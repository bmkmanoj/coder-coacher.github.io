for coming to the talk it's lovely to
see you all and some very familiar faces
and some new ones so that's absolutely
great I meant to tell you
you must rate the session in the app but
you've just heard that and all obviously
only rated if you're gonna rate it well
most of my talks are how-to talks for
architects they're sort of how to do
better security how to get your system
to production safely this one because
this is an architecture track as opposed
to more of a sort of dev track it's
slightly more philosophical and slightly
less how-to but hopefully it'll still be
interesting and it's about my
observations really about in the last
couple years as I've stepped back a
little bit from designing systems
everyday and looking at a lot more
systems being designed its observing
that actually some quite fundamental
things are changing in the way we need
to build systems but what's interesting
if you look at the historical context in
a sense we shouldn't be surprised by
that so I'm the CTO to come recalled in
Java we're a mid-sized technology
services company clearly the best with
the largest one you've never heard of I
spent about 10 years in product
development so I come from a product
engineering background really I built
helped to build a soy-based database I
helped to build the tuxedo transaction
processing monitor and I helped to build
some of the foundational digital rights
management systems that we used in the
early days of the internet which have
recently fallen deeply out of favor but
some products are destined to go that
way and then previous 10 years prior to
endeavor I've spent about 10 years
working capital markets I work for UBS
and PGI if you're familiar with those
firms and I've always been a software
engineer by profession by training by
practice whatever you call it and I've
done quite a lot of architecture work in
that time I've done all the other jobs
too at some point and about two years
ago nearly though it seems like three
months I joined in Java as their CTO a
new thing for endeavor and a new thing
for me so that's what's given me the
slightly different perspective now that
and although I do get involved in
projects I don't I'm no longer
personally responsible for the
architecture of a system every day just
a reminder or in fact this is an
announcement and early morning an ensign
went slightly wrong
we we're raffling a DJI phantom drone
now hopefully none of you will take part
and I can have it but I don't think
that's allowed under the rules we've a
roll up out there I have a colleague
flag kalmyk is at the back there what
you need to do is do our quiz a quiz don
dava comm and then drop your business
card off by the roll-up and at about
half past two we're just going to raffle
and the first one out wins the drone
really really straightforward okay so
it's a it's a very good deal so back to
the talk so I've observed in the last
few years that I think systems are
dissolving though what about earth do I
mean by that what I mean is that work we
are now creating systems out of less and
less tightly bound pieces I observed
this from a certain amount of history
and like Murat I have been in this
industry for some time and I have
actually worked on a mainframe not for
very long I was part of the disruptive
UNIX revolution I am old enough that
UNIX was disruptive there you go that's
all but we sort of started off building
systems that were sort of very tightly
packed with everything kind of bundled
up together and really procedure calls
being our inter component communication
mechanism and of course we had databases
and other stuff where there was some
networking but fundamentally software
developers thought about stuff as being
pretty firmly packed together so the
edge of the mainframe the mini computer
you know the standalone PC and and then
what happened was we started breaking
those systems apart because we hit all
kinds of practical problems in dealing
with very large monoliths and if nothing
else they were all very expensive and so
my analogy is it's like the lattice
starts moving apart but it's still
pretty firmly wired if you look at
first-generation distributed systems
client-server type systems you know what
the pieces are they're not going to go
varying too much at runtime in fact
varian's a big deal you've only got a
couple of types of pieces so you know
where all the connections are and we're
we're getting to narrow is actually an
architect or a designer or a team saying
that's my system and here's the hard
boundary is getting a bit harder because
actually we're composing systems out of
pieces that are selected at runtime so
obviously I'm alluding to things that
micro services but not exclusively micro
services we're just in general
the code that we're we're relying on
runtime is much looser bound together
and I think that's quite interesting and
I think it's causing and if not problems
it's certainly causing pulls for thought
in what good architectural practice
looks like and this has happened I
realized due to a bit of sort of
historical cycles happening because
we've been through five ages of software
systems we had the monolithic age that's
the one I'm talking about where
everything's sort of well understood it
runs on proprietary stuff even in early
UNIX systems it's all very well been
together it's all in one place and then
after that along came the sort of
distributed monoliths doing classic
client-server it was distributed but
crikey the bits were pretty big you had
a very big chunks of code talking to
other very big chunks of code you did
not have lots of little pieces and after
the distributed model this Along Came
internet-connected so we perhaps
unwisely at the time many of you I think
have come into the industry where the
internet was sort of a given I remember
the excitement let's politely call it
excitement sheer terror actually of
connecting systems to the internet early
on or we didn't really know what that
meant and that was the internet
connected systems meant we had to solve
a lot of problems quite quickly because
there were all sorts of actually quality
concerns as in system systemic qualities
we didn't know how to solve because we'd
never done this before there was no
Google to go and copy you know that's
what we do today right how do you solve
a problem at scale I don't know what a
Google do but there wasn't a Google in
fact that there was a Google but in fact
back then and there was for example an
eBay and what platform do DB run on
anyone OE based first platform IBM
WebSphere I kid you not
IBM WebSphere was connected to the
public Internet to run a large-scale
auction site that was iteration one
because that's that that sort of all we
knew admittedly that decision was
changed fairly quickly now the year I
think we're living in today is the
Internet is the system with apologies to
those of you old enough to have revered
Sun Microsystems well the network was
the computer I think today the Internet
is actually part of our systems and we
often connect
systems together using the Internet
sometimes implicitly and many many of
our systems use the internet to connect
to some portion of the system
it's no longer some kind of external
bastian firewall canopies that there's
the big wild Internet there actually
we're using it we're harnessing it as
part of our environment and I think what
works slowly moving into and in the next
decade maybe not slowly but I think in
the next decade we'll definitely be into
is the intelligent connected systems
where it'll no longer be good enough to
have a highly scalable high quality
distributed system available over all
over the world we'll need to have
systems that are in some way intelligent
I thought the opening keynote this
morning was really interesting about
what we mean by intelligent and we
talked about cognitive computing the
limits of that because I've been having
I've been going through similar thought
experiments the only snag is that I
don't have 35 years of artificial
intelligence experience it was very
useful to have somebody tell me the
answer that was very well time to clean
up for me but I think that's the next
phase so we've been through these phases
and actually what I have observed is
that software architecture practice has
evolved in conjunction with those phases
and that's not an accident of all
disciplines if you like software
architecture is pretty pragmatic it
develops because there's a challenge and
so we get better or we change the way we
do architecture to meet the challenge
and so architecture has changed as we've
gone through those periods so we look at
our history we started off in a
monolithic era fundamentally what the
monolithic era was about was how do you
structure computer programs now I'm of
an age were when I started off we were
already starting to talk about systems
but I think the people not much older
than me were still really from an era of
having thought ming-lee about how you
structure computer programs and this was
the area of languages like Fortran and
COBOL and assembler and if you were
impossibly looking into the distance he
used to talk about things that our goal
and Pascal so very very basic kind of
structuring facilities being available
and so the major concern of a designer
call them an architect a program or
whatever it just doesn't matter
but the major design problem was how do
we model eyes systems effective
and that led to that was the big
challenge I've got quite a bit of code
now more than a couple of hundred lines
I've got more than one or two people
working on it and I'm in an industrial
environment I'm no longer in the
University so it's gonna have to live
for quite a while and I'm gonna have to
change it quite regularly how do i mod
your lies large amounts of code which is
pretty well understood problem today in
it sometimes instructive when we look at
when we beat ourselves up about that the
software industry to look back at where
we've come from we have actually solved
a lot of problems in a relatively small
amount of time and so the things that
emerged where information hiding
composition concurrency and there were
some pioneers at this point who were not
really talking about architecture I
don't think but they were talking about
structurally structuring and solving the
problems of their age it's people like
Nygaard and down working on similar
which must have seemed like something
from outer space when they when they
introduced it to to a world that was
currently thinking that assemble it was
kind of a state-of-the-art Dykstra whore
working on computational fundamentals
and structuring Michael Jackson
obviously not the singer not the guy who
knows about beer but the other one he's
very hard to google have you noticed
that he's there it's a very unfortunate
named Michael Michael Jackson I want to
be famous because there's two already
quite famous ones out there and
obviously his work was quite fundamental
in how we approached the design process
and if you've got some some primitives
formalization how you actually used them
he was really important in that Donald
Knuth obviously looking at the
micro-level
and then one woman Pamela Zev I'm sure
there were others but one very prominent
woman who weren't extensive of Michael
Jackson actually and Pamela zelf who
worked in formal methods requirements
and and many other foundational things
as well at AT&amp;amp;T and the thing that I
took away from the 0 when I was thinking
about it and reading a bit about it was
architecture was a vendor concern and I
work for a vendor sort of at the end of
this year at the beginning of the next
and it really was you got your
architecture by buying a vendors
platform and the architecture turned up
with it if you were as Eddowes or in
fact it was then called mvs if you're an
IBM mainframe customer and you bought
some IBM products like kicks
db2 or whatever you got the architecture
given to you for free by IBM there was
only one way to structure a kicks IMS
dbvm system your look at me blankly
you've never heard those acronyms before
have you you're all far too young to be
in this room I was the same thing I work
for a clinical bull in a big French
manufacturer and we have three product
lines we had a big mainframe product
line called Chico sate any UNIX key
geeks recognize the term G cos ya where
does G costs intercept with UNIX
password field exactly used to be called
the G cos field because when they
developed Unix they had a Honeywell bull
mainframe in the labs which they had to
communicate with and they had to store
credentials for it in the password well
there you go
bit of UNIX Unix trivia for you about
how Honeywell bull and UNIX intersected
bull also produced the SMP version of
IBM's ni X UNIX just to bore you with
yet more facts for a pub quiz sometime
claim my pub always asked those kind of
questions and so when you when you
thought about architecture it was
implicit in fact when people talked
about architecture actually used the
word they normally meant the chip
architecture so architecture really
wasn't something people understood they
had it but they had it a byproduct of
buying a vendor platform and then very
very exciting this is sort of where I or
I enter the distributed monoliths
arrived and it was very very exciting
because we know rather than having one
kind of thing which was a computer with
software on it we've got three kinds of
things we've got clients and servers and
databases so this is the client this is
the classic client-server era and all
that a lot of the batch stuff starts
moving to be called online or real time
meaning interactive and the major
vendors in this period being people like
Sybase cybers was very disruptive
because they entered the market with the
vision that actually everything didn't
run on one computer that was good for
enterprise systems that was quite
visionary at the time um and you know
blank which is like Visual Basic and
powerbuilder and all those languages
enabling the graphical graphical user
interfaces and then this is when
software architecture kind of emerged if
you look at the time lines you
when the field of software architecture
when people started talking about it
when the first books and papers were
written there's a famous architecture
conference here called a wick sir
the first wick sir was held in this
period you sort of think well this is
really interesting
software architecture sort of it doesn't
quite yet explode but sort of starts
being talked about seriously in
mainstream industry about this time and
why well of course it's because people
now have some architectural concerns
they haven't got a lot of stuff to play
with but rather than being told by the
vendor look Sonny you write your code
you put it here you compile it and it'll
all run trust us the vendors are now
going well we've got some bits so if you
want to plug them together it'll all be
fine nothing can go wrong
Oh couldn't it go wrong of course as
soon as you put a bit of wire between
two things stuff can go wrong so this is
sort of what drove the idea of us
perhaps needing to think a bit more
about how we put a system together at
the macro level and the vendors what
were they about
well the vendors realized they were
starting to lose a bit of control
because if you bought the Sybase data
while ingress was better examples you
bought the ingress database some
customers had the audacity not to use
ingress is for GL but to want to use
visual basic or C++ instead for the
client and so they the vendors realized
that there was a bit of a problem here
they no longer control the end-to-end if
they weren't very careful some of their
customers are going to go elsewhere so
they started to try and control what we
call the architectural style the
architectural style is the kinds of
pieces in the architecture and the rules
for her to compose them and I definitely
worked on customer whitepapers and
customer training courses when I was at
so based on the client-server style and
we told clients how to do client-server
which actually give him the way some
clients do plan so I was just as well we
did tell them but the reason we did this
of course was not purely to make the
world a better place though actually
outside base there was an element of
that it was just as much though to keep
on controlling the architecture
narrative where do we fit in the
architecture story so that as your
challenge has changed you keep buying
our stuff because buying our stuff is
what we're worried about
and then about only two thousands we
move into the internet-connected era so
what really happened
I don't know how many of you how many of
you were working in the industry in 2001
for example oh good number so you'll
remember this what did we do well the
internet arrived and we said what we'll
do is we'll replace some of those clunky
user interfaces with web-based ones
won't we and gracious how hard was that
anyway we did that that was fine and
then we said well all we have to do now
is connect them to the Internet
don't see walking her wrong people will
just access access access us across the
internet and we'll all be very very rich
and for about 10 minutes some of us were
very rich unfortunately the stock
options didn't quite work out the way we
hoped mmm
and of course what happened was we took
our distributed monoliths and we just
attached them to the internet we didn't
really change them very much and so we
got a whole lot of system quality
non-functional demands suddenly placed
in our systems because of course the
whole world actually realized that they
were connected to the Internet and so
rather than just being online as in
we've got to be there from April 6 and
you know we've got to be quite quick
most of the time we realize we actually
had to be there all the time which was a
bit of a shock for most people who've
been building computer systems up to
that point if you haven't been working
in telephone switching then the idea of
never being able to take your system
down was a bit of a shock I can assure
you and most of the system software will
be using like databases had all been
built assuming there'd be periods in the
week or the day or the hour when you
could take them down for a bit and
nobody would mind there are a whole lot
of new challenges and of course some of
this ended rather badly does anyone
remember boo calm the hugely hyped
clothing store which was going to
revolutionize the way the internet
worked and they sort of would've if
they'd launched in about 2011
unfortunately they launched in 2001 and
after a massive amount of hype and more
more at that point investor money that
had ever been spent I think went out
with a fleam data business in about two
years they wrote the very esteemed book
called boohoo which was about how it
went wrong what's really hilarious is I
noticed that there is now an online
clothing company called boohoo comm
they're the same people I actually did a
bit of research it's the same folks who
have kind of gone back and go you see we
were right all along it works really
well all we needed was a completely
different generation of hardware
software and consumer apart from those
details we were absolutely on
top of it I don't know what you're all
complaining about you know part for the
investors of course but there were and
let's not go to pets calm he wanted to
sell pet food across the internet from a
high-value location in Silicon Valley
that didn't end well either so there was
at this point this is when I sort of
really sort of started doing I think
software architecture kinda
professionally if you like the explosion
of interest in it there were books
written methods started being discussed
lots more conferences real understanding
the business especially so I was working
in the valley at this time there was
there was a really strong focus in
nearly every engineering team about it's
all about the norm functional stupid
because if you get those right you can
fix the functions later if you get them
wrong you won't be in business to fix
the functions so suddenly that's when
the whole architecture discipline became
this fixation with non functions which
is you know I think absolutely correct
or not suggesting that's wrong people
started realizing that although these
were hard problems there were repeatable
solutions so styles and architectural
patterns that have been being written
down sometimes successfully sometimes
not and people started having to write
down relatively complicated architecture
so some simple pragmatic approaches such
as architectural viewpoints people
familiar with the 4+1
architectural view model Binet Krypton's
work yeah so that came out at about this
time and then people like Rebecca worse
Brock people like the sei guys people
like Matylda Krasinski and I and many
others were thinking about how do we
help people who don't want to spend all
day thinking about how you do
architecture actually do architecture so
that's when when this happened and the
reason for this was suddenly we've got a
load of problems that the techniques
that we today call architecture were
needed to solve and that that's why I
happened it wasn't random
and it wasn't pure academic exercise is
that the industry would be problem
architecture emerged to fill the void
and what were the vendors doing well the
vendors at this point one mainly trying
to fix the non-functional for you
because once again they realized that
architecture was key to them staying
part of the story and so they were
trying to sell you magic solutions
preferably hardware solutions that they
possibly could because
those are the best margin in many cases
for achieving at least one
non-functional Cisco built their
business pretty well during the Internet
boom on solving non-functional problems
which were fundamentally scalability and
security
those were the two propositions Cisco
came to you with and sold you a whole
lot of boxes that's fundamentally it was
about those architectural concerns
similarly some made a massive amount of
money out of selling a single line of
computers does anyone from that period
remember what the huge Sun vertically
scalable system was called the DM 10,000
thank you whoever said that was was
clearly there yeah for a short period
you could not buy those for love nor
money until the crash came and then you
couldn't give them away that I knew
engineers who bought that will put them
in their basements that son just could
not make enough D in ten thousands
because the DM 10,000 was the
scalability solution for the dot-com
boom it was a vertically scalable
computer that basically could bring UNIX
processing to the power of a mainframe
roughly it was that and of course it had
a reassuring the expensive price tag
which if you've just had a massive
investment of venture capital you'll be
needing to spend it on something so how
about a reassuring me expensive set of
computers that'll make everyone feel
much better it's a bit like the very
expensive office chairs I got I can't
remember their name but it was a huge
phase for them is companies that hadn't
turned over a dime yet we're supplying
all of their employees with the most
expensive office chairs money could buy
it was a great time to be an engineer I
can assure you so sadly that came to an
end and we kind of moved into the
current era yes actually the current
layer is pretty good too so we ended up
with the Internet as a system and the
key things for me that finding things
from an external perspective are is that
a public API and a mobile user interface
are the default ways into systems today
yes we've all got a web interface but
actually I was realizing the other day I
went to a bank and so I've kind of sort
out my my internal finances about once a
month when I went to my bank website and
I logged on because the mobile app
doesn't quite give me the same view of
transactions I realized that was the
first time for several months I'd
bothered to go to their main website and
actually they'd redesigned it I cannot
walk everything's changed that's nice
but actually
realize how irrelevant they is to me
because I nearly always use the moment
always on has become access from
everywhere it's not just about being
available 24/7 it's about being
compliant sensitive internationalized
and all these different markets which is
obviously quite difficult and what's
happened is that and we'll just goes why
in a minute
um oh no nevermind
animations well whatever and more
dynamic architectural styles are
emerging to allow us to deal with change
because there's a lot more competition
which we'll talk about a second and this
is for me I mean I became interested in
where micro services had come from
because in the sense it's not a new idea
but suddenly it's become the thing that
absolutely everyone has to do bit like
DevOps but for them I think are positive
it's just that well like when I talk to
clients about it they often say well
clearly we need we'll be needing a
DevOps project right about now and we're
going to rebuild the whole system in
micro services I go fantastic because I
guys love working on that stuff and
we're really quite good at it and I go
so just what were the business drivers I
mean look at me they're blank lingo yeah
anyway about the DevOps if we could just
kind of get that done that would be
super I go okay people do it I mean
we're really enthusiastic we think it's
a good thing but presumably somebody at
someone your organization when signing
the check is satisfied that it's there
for a good reason and actually I think
it is but I'm not sure people think
through that architectural driver and
the vendors of course god bless them
they're still with us a bit like death
and taxes there now
also want to be part of the narrative
they've realized that selling bits bits
of stuff be they bits of software or be
they're bits of tin isn't working all
that well anymore there's a number of
them realized they're about to be
disintermediated by the rising open
source which is part of it but also by
companies reducing tolerance for dealing
with what you might call technical
accidentals if you've got the essence
and the accidents people know they have
to deal with the essence but they don't
want to deal with the accidental stuff
so more so vendors have realized that
they're actually their values not
producing the components it's about
producing platforms from the components
that people can use really easily how
many of you hear user paz at work cloud
foundry or bluemix or one of those
oh not many at all how many of you use
one kena for fun when you're
experimenting with stuff Oh still not
many more actually I'm flabbergasted I
thought you'd all be going oh we're all
using passes for fun but nobody let me
use it at work and I really do think
that in my view the vendors are right in
thinking the value is in assembling
platforms not selling bits to allow
customers through very expensive
engineering as the banks call it to put
the bits together themselves so why did
we end up here we ended up here because
of some architectural drivers well I'm
an architect so I'd always think that
way but genuinely I think we did call
them business drivers there's constant
competition and what that has meant is
is that we need to keep on developing
the systems really quite quickly
quarterly releases don't work so well
anymore you can even see the big bang
stuff and to realize this if we've there
consumer-facing stuff I was talking to
somebody a huge international asset
manager yesterday not Blackrock one of
the other ones and I've mention that
because I have links to black roll just
to be clear it was not somebody from
there I'm not giving their secrets away
em and they're really absurd they're
having a new consumer-facing website for
investors built by a by a third party
not unlike my firm in fact though it's
not us he was talking to me about I'm
going to need an on-site team of really
good web developers who can work with
what the vendors are producing because
for various reasons I don't really
understand why but for various reasons
he was saying this particular vendor is
unhappy about shipping new stuff into
production for them or on a sort of day
to day basis they want to have more of a
kind of longer cadence weeks or months
I'm sure they've got good reasons maybe
they're contractual and he was saying
actually we realized that our
competition some fintechs some
traditional they're changing their
mobile apps and their website they're
offering on a week-to-week day-to-day
basis so that's where he that's his
solution he's going to take the platform
from the vendor who will keep on
developing in the background but he's
actually going to have sort of close to
business developers for putting in small
features all the time and he feels like
that's a competitive necessity the other
thing is you've got to be there all the
time if you're not there they'll go
somewhere else and traditionally how do
we get our user requirements when we
talk to users don't we we've got on-site
customers
we've got requirements engineering we've
got tight integration of IT and the
business what happens when your users
are all over the planet and they only
visit your website once a month they're
really hard to interact with aren't they
because if you what happens if you give
them a survey well some of them will
fill it in and how representative do you
think they are I think you'll find
they're your fan base because the rest
of them go survey for God's sake for
these chumps
life's too short and they've moved on so
you don't really know what anyone thinks
anymore and there's no one to ask and so
actually we need to move into completely
from paradigm or business analysts are
as much statistical analysts as they are
human analysts they look at actual
behavior as well as running focus groups
doing traditional interaction models and
so on and these are new unknown users
produce very unpredictable demand we
can't predict what happens in the real
world and then the real world in turn
tends to impact on our systems so we
have to have a much more dynamic
response to load I mean we're seeing
this finally some of our clients were
quite conservative one of them for
example runs a major golf championship
we do the website for that and they've
now they've been very concerned about
cloud because some of their golf
competitions are their real crown jewels
if their websites aren't there makes
massive difference with the cash flow
off it and but now they're they're kind
of getting it we actually cannot predict
how much traffic we're going to get for
a particular golf competition on a
particular hour we should have a much
more dynamic kind of platform and
they're pretty you know for good reasons
quite conservative people well part of
the internet and so generally speaking
that means we've got to be components of
the internet so we've got to be
consumable by other systems that's where
our API requirements come from and
unfortunately we're visible from
anywhere great thing about the Internet
is it links people together doesn't it
which is lovely then he snag is that
that means that there's a man in China
with too much time on his hands has
direct access to your public web
interface so we are constantly being
attacked Bruce Schneier who if you're a
security engineer he'll recognize that
name immediately a very famous former
cryptographer now sort of talking head
if I'm being slightly critical in the
security community talks about this that
he said when you're building systems
bear in mind there's an almost infinite
supply
informed intelligent brain power which
will be ranged against your system
that's quite a frightening thought if
you're a security engineer we rely on at
least partly rely on stupidity some
other time
and finally your access globally so
you've got to be compliant everywhere
with regulations you barely understand
talk to any large global company about
that and so that led me to think what
are the principles of this new age the
architectural principles I think the six
which just sort of leap out at you
you've got to be able to evolve
continually and actually that's that's
something you got to start thinking
about early unfortunately most of us
don't think about doing it all the time
we've got to respond to change
dynamically and what I really mean there
is things like load and scale and
security we've got to get into a period
of analyzing rather than asking so when
we want to know what people like what
people need we're probably going to have
to get that from data rather than from
individuals we're gonna need an API on
everything that's partly because we're
stuck on the internet and people would
like to communicate with us via api's
it's also because what does continual
evolution mean it means our software is
being used in different ways all the
time and I've seen this in large
enterprise environments in particular
systems are built to some degree that
mirror the organizational structure it's
a bit like Conway's law for enterprises
if you've got three divisions you'll
probably end up with three clusters of
systems however if you then split two of
those divisions and combine with another
company you might end up with four and
abit divisions so suddenly being able to
evolve means being able to use the
software in different ways and that
really means being able to come
attach the functional components to each
other differently to form different
business processes so that means you're
gonna have to put an API on it because
that's really the only way to do that
relatively quickly
you've also unfortunately to be secured
by design C as a security engineer my
colleague Vlad is actually our head of
security of secure development M makes
our hearts grow much fonder that we have
to be secured by design but just to give
them what we always do this I'm not
picking on you how many people here have
a system that has at least one public
facing interface be it mobile web
okay how many people in this room have
use a static and analyzer security
analyzer on their code Oh actually
that's really good
that's much better it normally is and
how many people have done for more
secure self development training a few
yeah so you know well we'll leave the
obvious lesson yeah and internationalize
instinctively we most people do not
internationalized instinctively it's
quite the opposite we think about our
local context because that's what human
beings and that that's what we do
actually being able to internationalize
in the broad sense thinking about a very
wide possible usage of a piece of
software and again in a corporate
environment where you've got a lot of
M&amp;amp;A going on which in fact we have an
endeavour for example we acquire
companies quite regularly
internationalization becomes really
important we recently and this is days
ago really we have acquired a company a
bit like us but about tenth of our size
just about the right size very pleased
pleased to have acquired them they're
based in holland and they have
operations in romania where we are and
they also have operations in bulgaria
which we have absolutely no knowledge
about so they're going to have to come
on to our enterprise platform so
suddenly we have to be able to deal with
bulgaria which is a lot more in fact we
probably won't support bulgaria in the
platform they'll use english its
international internationalization in a
broad sense of your systems can they be
used in different cultural and legal
environments so principles are all very
well they're very useful things to keep
in mind but what are the actual
implications of these well I think
there's there's about six of them I
think first I think we've got a design
in continuous delivery from the start I
don't mean that every sister has to
deliver to production continuously
that's not appropriate and completely
wrong for some systems what I really
mean is as architects if we're building
systems today in this environment we
have a responsibility a professional
responsibility to make sure that we have
removed the obstacles that tend to stop
continuous delivery working and for me
they're nearly always about automation
testing and deployment have we got the
ability to automate the ability to test
in a way that allows CD and have we got
the ability to deploy continuously if
somebody wanted to
or have we accidentally designed
something into our architecture it's
going to make that really rather awkward
we need to allow modular evolution by
this I do not mean that every sister has
to be micro-services I think modular
evolution is absolutely possible with
something that is currently rudely
referred to as a monolith as if that's a
bad thing it's not always a bad thing
down a monolith and there are certain
problems that go away with monoliths and
though I accept they come with some -
but the ideas like bounded context and
micro-services sort of in quotes not
necessarily microservices the way that
you know that an esteemed organization
like thought works would would be able
to help you you know absolutely define
what a proper micro-services but you're
looking for the capabilities of
something micro-service like which is
you can change a small part and deploy
it quickly without wrecking the world
can you build systems even if you're
even if they're relatively traditional
when you look when you glance on the
outside but can you build an
architecture that allows modular
evolution and I think today we have to
assume cloud deployment by trying again
I do not mean you must put your system
on Amazon what I mean is is that cloud
deployment I don't want to be successful
there are certain things about is likely
to be true there's the cattle not pets
principle we don't expect a load of
handcrafted servers and a lot of manual
interaction to build environments we
don't want one-off special cases we
don't want static config and into the
application they wanted all externalized
and of course the good start for this is
the 12 factor net advice which when you
glance over it I'm not going to go
through it all but it's all I think it's
all really good advice there's nothing
in that I go oh I'm not sure about that
really
I mean there's sort of nothing to argue
with in a sense it's just that when I
look over I go I think I agree with it
but actually there's a bit more isn't
there and I think a lot of its at quite
micro level so I don't know in fact I
was talking to Jeff at Jax earlier in
the week sorry go to for mentioning Jax
was mentioned about had a competitive
conference there are there are another
conferences to go to um at another
conference from one of the big banks so
he was saying yeah they've been looking
at this and their conclusion is sort of
missus or even
not sufficient is the way that they look
at 12 factor really useful advice but
don't stop there fourth or would be
putting measurement into the system an
observation I have of older system so I
would be guilty of this for many I've
designed is that if somebody said I'd
like to do a lot of analytics on the
activity going on in this system and
I've got you know half a million lines
of code already it would not be clear to
me how I would give them those analytics
because we didn't really think when we
were building those systems seven eight
years ago a bad measurement yes we've
got production measures and CPU and
transactions but we've got some measures
but what's going on in the system so
that we can run analytics on that so to
you know so we no longer have to go and
interview users and that's probably not
there so Kent would it be possible to do
that with your architecture or other
significant block to it I think we
should structure around public API I
must admit I've believed in this since
back in the 90s I think every API you
produce should you should think about it
as if it's public API and secondly every
component you create should have an API
it's just the easiest way to build
systems for the long term rather than
having lots of kind of special cases I
couldn't find a good reference to this
I've call it the amazon pattern because
it may be an apocryphal story but
apparently Jeff Bezos at some point sent
a memo around Amazon saying if you don't
put a public API that's potentially
accessible by the world on your
components I'm going to fire you
which seems like he'd be an awfully busy
guy if people didn't didn't actually do
it he'd have to run read a lot of people
but that's why I've got the Amazon
patent apparently I have worked at
Amazon but apparently Amazon uses right
through their infrastructure which is
everything you build you stick an API
that in principle could be exposed to an
Amazon customer and it's apparently one
of the ways they get agility in their
products because they don't meet they
don't expose everything to begin with
expose a small number of things but if
they find that there's a genuine good
customer demand for another bit well
they've got the API already and yeah I'm
sure they need to tidy it up think
through the security again make sure
that it works with the others
but they can expose it it was built to
be exposed and then finally please
design a build to be securable
I'm not saying that everyone has to do
secure
scanning on every piece of code all the
time you don't all have to do threat
modeling all the time but you know
development teams having a least a
nodding acquaintance with security
practice at least having a basic
understanding of threats and threat
modeling and risk analysis these are
base for me in this era these are when
the Internet is part of the system their
basic professional skills which should
be there along with TDD and clean code
and understanding of you know networking
currency or being able to use different
database models there's certain things
we all continuous integration this stuff
we all expect each other to be able to
do for me if you're going to connect to
the internet there needs to be at least
a basic understanding of how to build a
secure system so what does the future
look like well I think as I say it's
intelligent connected and the reason I'm
interested in this one I like to look
into the future why not
but M what I'm really interested in is
what is the future of the software
architect look like and I think the
things are going to happen is that data
and algorithms are going to become quite
important for achieving your
architectural qualities a number of the
architectural qualities we're talking
about require some sort of analytics
that suggests data and algorithms
suddenly become much more important my
observation being so far up yet the
previous eras is we've tended to push
data analytics under the rug and say
they're sort of details which the
architect shouldn't have an opinion on
that should be delegated into the
Empowered teams who are responsible for
the pieces of the system actually if
you're going to get meaningful analytics
across the system that's probably not
going to work so well so you're going to
have to take more ownership collectively
who I'm I'm not prejudging your
architectural model this could be a
shared ownership thing but when you come
to do architecture there's going to have
to be a bit more thought about where are
the data but what sort of date have we
got what sort of algorithms could we run
on it meaningfully what do we need to
run on it I think architecture is
becoming more and more runtime emergent
this isn't the emergence that sort of
Neal thought talks about with agility
that's emergence at design time this is
emergent at runtime this is the stuff
that adrian Cockcroft talks about a lot
to do with micro services which is you
do not know what your architecture is
you know what the principles behind it
are at any point in time if someone asks
you what
connected to what you have enough
instrumentation in place you could
answer the question but actually you
don't know until you actually go and
look the architecture
evolves over time at runtime and of
course these vendors aren't going to go
away and I think you can already see
this at IBM's massive marketing I've cut
them and intelligence on bluemix the
vendors are going to be selling us
intelligent behavior in the keynote
actually there was an allusion to that
wasn't there I mean you can use SAS
based services already for machine
learning I think that's going to get far
deeper and these powers platforms are
going to start becoming much more if you
have a lot more intelligence built into
them if you feed them the right data so
that means oh and so our access many
work becomes intelligent assistants so
what is it actually if how do you
actually affect this day to day I think
we're going to be doing a less detailed
structural design and I think we're
going to be doing more data in algorithm
design don't say we won't do structural
design but would be thinking more about
data and algorithms I think how define
structure is going to become much more
emergent so we're going to be putting
going to be putting principles and
patterns in place I think we're going to
be defining specific structures quite a
bit less and that means that we will
still be making decisions but we'll also
be putting a lot of principle policies
and algorithms in place rather than
point decisions rather than saying these
three things Connect in this way we're
going to be saying the general
interaction patterns that we are going
to use are the following go and use them
and then people will sort of auto wire
stuff maybe the software will
automatically but I think perfectly
possible today we tend to try and deal
we try and deal with a certain world I
think sometimes it's an illusion but
certainly something we like and we try
and reduce a lot of problems down to
very scientific certainty based trade
offs I think we're actually beginning
with probability if you don't know who
your users are you're connected to the
internet you're not quite sure what your
architecture is at runtime you're
basically in a probability game rather
than a point decision business today I
always encourage architects get deeply
involved in operations because there was
a great quote at Jack's
was remember who did it now somebody
said it according somebody else that
there was it's a software is complete
when it leaves production not what it
enters production and I mean great
belief in this architects need to be
deeply embedded in the operational cycle
however I think the whole operational
world is going to be moving from a game
very structured defined upfront stuff to
much more about policy and automation we
will have certain automated ways of
changing the production environment and
we'll have policies governing them so
that's what she'll architects need to
get their heads around need to step away
slightly from the dated from the
detailed process understand what's
possible through automated policy based
technology which I must admit I mean I'm
still learning about and I mean our
operational side of in dava are really
quite advanced thinking in this I'm
still getting getting to grips with this
myself very much and I think most
development architects I talk to you
aren't actually aware of what's possible
today and they're definitely not aware
of what's coming next so we need to get
better at that and although finance
isn't my favorite topic today we tend to
talk a lot about capex I need this much
money over this period of depreciate
like this it's all moving to OPEX
operational expense it's all consumers
you go if you one of our big concerns is
if I've got a credit card I can now buy
anything you sort of can because you buy
in tiny fractions so I think we're going
to have to be thinking about costing
models and justifications in our o eyes
which i think is quite important for
architects to understand much more an
OPEX model than a capex model which
probably implies making friends with
your Finance Group a lot more than you
do now because capex is pretty
straightforward
object that can actually be quite
complicated don't talk about that op X
and tax take a cup of coffee it may take
some time so my conclusions are that
actually it's it's worth looking at the
past if you want to predict the future
because monolithic computing led us to
start fixing structural problems
distributed computing led us to software
architecture internet-connected
computing led us to the explosion and
the maturity of architecture we've got
today so each era develops the solutions
to the problems it's facing and that's
why industrial practice often leads
academic practice and so
architecture so I think the Internet
International System era needs
continuous delivery module evolution
cloud enablement analysis public api's
and first-class security in your
architectural thinking and if you're
missing any one of those six bits I
think now's the time to be plugging that
building your knowledge and making sure
that the systems you're building comply
with those and in the next year we're
gonna have to be learning some new stuff
which is fun but it's something we're
gonna have to start planning for like
right now we're gonna what we're going
to have to go back and learn more about
data and algorithms we're gonna have to
think more about what architecture is in
a dynamic world principles policies and
patterns most a lot of us include myself
but most a lot of the time despite
talking a lot about principles we think
in in the single instance concrete I
think we've got to think much more about
policy and pattern and replication we've
got to think about operation a huge
varying scale which will be a lot more
policy based than process based and
there's quite a big gap there for us to
step across and there'll be these new
economics of systems effects based
economics we need to know all this stuff
to be ready for the next era quick
reminder if you'd like to win a phantom
it's outside thank you very much
I have two minutes but Simon needs to
set up so I can maybe if there are any
questions I could do two minutes great
and then Simon can set up while I'm
talking because there's no gap in
between us what has happened to security
non-functional and what has happened is
the same thing that has always happened
and senior managers assure us that
they're absolutely critical and then
refused to pay for people to go on
security training courses so that
happens repeatedly of course not as good
friends of mine tell me this but I think
I think what's happened is that over the
last Oh probably as long as I've been in
the business actually but it's only the
last five ten years
blood can correct me the things I'm
wrong but the security engineering
business has continued to be a bit balto
most so they've got their own language
their own priorities their own approach
to problems and anyone in this room is
security engineer no one Oh welcome
welcome yes we don't get many of you yes
go and talk to that man afterwards and
if I went to a security conference I
said how many of you here are actually
software developers not handed go up so
there's very little intersection and
that's what's happened is that there's a
lot of good knowledge and experience and
practice and theory out there it's often
not applied and that that that's where
it goes wrong one cos of prioritization
because for some reason people don't
seem to think it's going to happen to
them when it's happened to JP Morgan
targets only and hacking team anyone
remember the hacking team to turnover
when it can happen to hacking team it
can happen to you they're a team they're
a company that produces hacking
technology and they got turned inside
out by up by another hacking
organization so people don't think it's
gonna happen to them and the security
community to be fair to us and not
brilliant at coming in and speaking our
language to help us actually do the
right thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
