of my dearest friends Leslie Hawthorne
she's an ambassador for open source for
all of her life she worked for google
Summer of Code several years and is now
the director of developer relations at
elasticsearch she will tell you about
the human element in development please
warmly welcomed with me Leslie good
evening everyone thank you all for
coming and i'm just going to before i
get started to take this opportunity to
thank and acknowledge everyone for what
they've contributed to making this
second go to berlin conference what it
has been from our stalwart organizing
team to our volunteer crew my fellow
speakers and you as audience members
think to all of you for being here
so as diana was gracious enough to
mention i'm here today to talk about
something that has been the obsession of
my career in technology for the last 15
years the human element in development
how the interplay between us as human
beings as people either contributes to a
highly successful outcome as we work
together on our technical projects or
leads to great great disasters today we
will be exploring the latter category
great great disasters so it's my hope
that I can amuse you with some wonderful
tales of how the use and abuse of
particular tools were highly revealing
about some of the difficulties within a
particular company or organizations
culture so before I get into the meat of
this talk the standard disclaimers apply
these are my opinions and my opinions
only not those of my employer past
present and probably future the names in
this presentation have all been obscured
and some details have been changed
slightly to protect the innocent and the
guilty and my last disclaimer if you're
attending this talk hoping to hear about
what wiki is absolutely the best or
hearing me slam a particular
configuration management engine or
anything of that nature this is not
quite the top for you but we're still
going to have a good time so why is it
even significant to talk about the
interplay of tools and culture why is
this a topic that's useful for all of us
and for me my reckoning in this area has
really come from spending time in the
DevOps community and really
understanding the methodologies behind
that movement but there's been a
dedicated DevOps track here at go to
Berlin so I won't belabor the point but
for anyone in the audience he's not
familiar with the concept of DevOps the
idea is that software developers and
operations professionals are working to
achieve the same goal
shipping software effectively to
customers and yet if they're broken into
silos and are not effectively
collaborating with one another the
results are going to be that much more
poor the DevOps movement has focused a
lot on different types of tools
configuration management engines and
concepts like continuous delivery and
continuous integration and yet if you
talk to folks who are practitioners of
this methodology they will be the first
to tell you an oft-repeated mantra but
it's not about tools it's about culture
while tools may have made rapid
deployment much easier have taken out
several layers of process for approvals
etc it's not that the tools themselves
have facilitated this process it's a
culture of trust respect blameless
review and collaboration that is
actually what DevOps is all about so
today as we talk about tools we're going
to talk about five tools and how these
revealed certain things about a
particular corporate culture and I
wanted to be as inclusive as possible
with this presentation so I am willing
to wager one delicious cup of coffee to
each audience member that you have been
the end user of at least four out of
five of these tools and you've probably
been the administrator of at least three
of these tools and anyone if I have
failed with that wager please meet me
out in the foyer next to the tri fork
booth with the delicious coffee stand
and we'll make sure you get you a cup of
coffee all right so tool number one the
humble mailing list how many of you
enjoyed a happy mailman day seven days
ago with me great ok how many folks have
never used a mailman list ok I see a
couple of hands all right so fortunately
if you are not a deep practitioner in
the ways of mailman mailing list this
will not necessarily be something that
is lost upon you so as we all know the
actual use of mailing list is right
mailing list is pretty ripe for abuse in
terms of our interpersonal dialogue
but that's not actually what I'm
focusing on here today it's just the use
of a mailing list period and any user
experience designers in the audience see
a couple of nods yeah we're not going to
talk about the use and abuse of mailing
list to try to discuss design which i
think is the worst idea ever and my
sympathies to any of you who are
currently experiencing that right now
until we begin and I bring to you a tale
of two mailing lists so there was a very
large company and they were spinning up
a brand new team and the goal of this
team was to enact internal cultural
change as well as to be an externally
facing body that would help people to be
more included in the processes of the
products that the company was building
huge big deal support from all layers of
management and nooope all made people
hired and brought in to actually make
this project work this of course was the
fans of chocolate project because all
names have been changed to protect the
innocent and the guilty so new manager
comes in and as part of the first steps
and architecting this new team and
bringing all of his hires together he
creates two mailing lists one fans of
chocolate dash team won fans of
chocolate discuss the idea here being
that the discussion list was to bring
people throughout the organization in
and allow them to share ideas ask
questions get involved with some of
these initiatives provide feedback and
the fans of chocolate team list you
would be right in assuming that it was
probably just for the manager and his
direct reports except it wasn't the fans
of chocolate team mailing list was
expanded beyond this managers direct
reports to include several other members
of the company who this manager felt
could be potentially influential and
pushing the project forward or
individuals that he hoped would come and
join the fans of chocolate team as their
mission grew and expanded over time so a
bit unorthodox but not necessarily
terribly problematic
until the inevitable happened team
disharmony so this manager had some
difficulty with one of his employees
huge personality clash right just
happens to the best of us and after some
discussions between manager and his
employee and a request by the employee
for coaching and HR arbitration the
conclusion was reached that the employee
had a great deal to contribute to the
company and was brought in as a
specialist in chocolate so surely this
person belonged potentially working for
another manager but still able to
contribute to the chocolate project and
the same way that the rest of the
company did through the discussion list
through proposals people were empowered
to take up projects on their own under
the chocolate banner and it seemed that
with this change the problem had been
solved except it wasn't as part of
coming on board at this new company the
first task on your new hire checklist
was to go into the company's lists in
mailman of all of the mailing lists and
subscribe to whichever lists you felt
would be helpful to you in doing your
job projects you'd like to get involved
in areas where you could offer your
expertise and as it happened once this
employee had left the manager of the
chocolate team he went to remove the
employee and the employee objected
saying of course that they were an
expert in chocolate they felt that they
should remain on the team list and
clearly it was not just for entertain
communications because there were people
who are not the managers direct reports
on the list fair enough Human Resources
decided that this was fair that the
employees should go ahead and stay on
the list so in order to circumvent this
problem the manager created a brand new
mailing list FOC for friends of
chocolate dash core because this is
obviously descriptive of what this list
is about
and what you should use it for there's
also the huge problem of the fact that
fo c dash core appears alphabetically
completely disconnected from friends of
chocolate which is the project name that
the entire company is buzzing about and
this team mailing list has absolutely no
description in mailman telling you what
to use it for because the manager didn't
want to call attention to the fact that
he had created yet another mailing list
just for fear that this could cause some
contention within the organization so of
course many intelligent enthusiastic
excited newbies joined the organization
dutifully went to their new-hire
checklist and said oh i need to go into
mailman and check out some mailing lists
well that's pretty cool i'm going to do
that and reading through the description
subscribing to the lists and of course
reaching out to the friends of chocolate
team to ask if they could get involved
or offer their expertise and when notes
were sent to this list often the former
employee of the manager in question
would respond to them because he had
expertise in that area in an up very
particular area of chocolate making
which caused the manager in question to
spend an awful lot of cycles running
around behind the scenes saying no no no
no he is not quite the person that you
want working on this project he's
there's some issues there you might want
to steer clear just come on over to FOC
dash core just just send your mail there
we'll take care of you no problem oh
yeah no I haven't had time to update
mailman with the description but I will
later that was the party line for about
a year and a half I don't have time now
but I will update it later so when you
have two of these things which is not
like the other and it's very confusing
what you really have is something that
reveals a big gooey icky yucky mess and
the side of your team that everyone can
see and you'd really prefer that they
didn't and the thing that is most
striking to me about this story I think
we can all agree that there were
multiple ways in which this could have
gone much better
is when my friend was telling me about
what he had experienced and how it was
you know kind of weird that we just went
off and created this other mailing list
it get rid of one person I was like well
I'm not particularly surprised given
that that company is probably best known
for using technical solutions to solve
social problems right the real answer to
this is figure it out don't fork lists
this is just totally odd so even a
humble mailing list can betray deep
cultural traits ah my least favorite
tool of all how many of you enjoy filing
expense reports I see two Wow I see six
hands um excellent well we have a
therapy group and we will meet after
this presentation talk about so I have
to say that expense reporting tools are
probably the least favorite part of my
job now and as far back as I can recall
they're just all they're just all
painful right it turns out paying people
is really hard so and now a tale of how
expense reports can reveal deep sadness
within your corporate culture so a dear
friend of mine who worked at a
multinational company in the hardware
space I actually asked a couple friends
if they had suggestions for tools that
they wanted to talk about he immediately
said expense reports and I said ok tell
me more so it turns out that the CEO of
his corporation got some reports back
from the human resources department and
they revealed that the engineering team
was spending on average about two
percent of their time per month finally
expense reports and he thought this was
freaking ridiculous which it is actually
like perhaps you should be writing
software so they perform some analysis
and they figured out that it wasn't that
people were incurring so many expenses
that it was taking up a lot of their
time the issue is that the software that
they were using was so brittle and
painful and misery making that people
were losing reports they had to file
them over and over again it was just all
not good so they had an internal
discussion at the highest executive
levels about what they could do to
reclaim this lost productivity
and the answer was we need a new expense
report system and then they asked
themselves the standard business
question do we build or do we buy well
I'm sure everyone in the audience
already knows what the answer to this
question is because this is tales of woe
we decided to build one ourselves
because after all a multinational
company paying people in more than 40
currencies with subject to different
banking regulations different areas of
legal compliance etc etc is going to be
in a perfect position especially as a
hardware company to build an expense
reporting system right totally the worst
part of the story is apparently someone
attempted to object to this plan
suggesting it props lacked a little bit
of sanity and the response from the CEO
was that he had just gotten a 3d printer
and he'd been reading a lot about the
maker movement and he realized that the
real answer for innovation and progress
was to do it yourself all the time you
just have to do it yourself so we're
gonna do this ourselves it's gonna be
awesome yeah all right well we all know
where this is going but I'll still try
and entertain you so everything seemed
to be going quite well right the project
manager was brought in and put in place
several executive leaders were assigned
to check in on specific action items
several developers were pulled off of
other projects because they were known
to be really excellent developers so no
doubt they could be the miracle workers
who would make this expense report
system built and shipped to the entire
company in six months six months yep and
at every status check everything seemed
to be going really well the check in at
month five everything's going great
we've got all the right people in place
check it at month for everything's great
check it at month three yeah we might
slip a couple features but we're gonna
be okay check it at month two
yeah yeah no no no no everything's fine
everything's fine just to cut a couple
features have fallen off were okay check
in at month one the CEO wanted to see
the product that was being built see how
far along folks were just get a sense
for it a month before launch and what he
got was this a big sad mess of dreck
that not only seemed to be a very poor
re-implementation of the system that
they already had decided that they
wanted to get rid of but it wasn't even
his future complete as the specification
he had laid out at the beginning and in
order to solve this problem the of
course the answer is to go and pull
other professionals from your
organization in to save this scary
project because we've already invested
so much time and so much energy and we
just need to fix it and this is where my
friend comes into the story uh InfoSec
professional who gets pulled off to work
on the expense report system because he
is a miracle worker I'm very talented
and it is discovered that one of the
primary flaws of this system is that the
access control lists are not set up
properly so random employees can approve
each other's expense reports you know
time to go buy some champagne right so
my friend worked very very hard to make
sure that these problems were somewhat
solved and within another six months
they were able to roll out to the
organization a brittle broken system
that didn't replicate the functionality
of the last bad system and caused a
whole bunch of very sad very scary
nightmares and very sadly for the last
month before the new system was rolled
out no one was permitted to submit
expense reports because of course the
new system will be here any day which
yeah kind of sap's the morale of the
infosec guy you got on a plane to go fly
to hang out with your tiger team of
developers because he's flying in every
week and flying home every weekend to
met gonna fix this he just can't expense
his flights come on it we're almost
there we're almost there
well so the problem was solved ish with
very predictable results as soon as this
system shipped my friend said thank you
very very much for the opportunity to do
something that I have never done before
I appreciate your help and I'm leaving
to go find another job now I thank you
very much so after listening to all of
this absolute craziness because I still
trying to understand how this happened
he just looked at me he said no no no
this makes perfect sense and I was
trying to understand in what universe
any of this story makes perfect sons and
he just looked at me he said oh man we
had the worst case of not invented here
ever like ever and I'm going this is
taking not invented here to whole new
levels of crazy whole new levels of
crazy so let's talk a little bit about
why this project got so incredibly a
problematic so quickly ah because of the
use and abuse of meetings so believe it
or not these folks were in four meetings
per week and when I say these folks I
mean their project manager I mean all of
the developers on the project and they
were requested to brief various
executives throughout the organization
and folks in the upper echelon of
management on progress because of course
this was a project was very important to
the CEO so it's important that we can
have our finger on the pulse and we
always keep up to date on what's going
on and these were in four different
functional areas of the company and of
course it was very important that they
heard directly from the developers about
their progress so the developers were in
all of these meetings so you're already
wasting ten percent of your development
time per week sitting giving the same
exact information to different people so
that's already bad but sadly enough
since these folks were executive
management these meetings were
calendared for a regular time each day
in the morning
give the team time to work on their code
in the afternoon but unsurprisingly
executives schedules change a lot so you
may have your meeting calendar for 9am
but by the time you arrive in the office
you discover that it's been pushed back
to 1130 and then at about 1115 you find
out that it's actually been pushed back
to 3pm and of course you're not really
going to do anything after lunch and we
can all imagine exactly how this goes
but wait it gets better there's more so
about two weeks in to this project
apparently everyone figured out that it
was going to be a gigantic disaster why
it took them two weeks to find that out
not sure but that's okay sometimes you
have to learn so since it was figured
out that this was going to be an
unmitigated disaster the decision was
made that we just simply will not send
out meeting notes because if we send out
meeting notes people will realize that
this is on its way to miserable failure
the word will get back to the CEO that
this is going to get all screwed up he's
gonna get really mad at us so we just
won't send out meeting notes it'll be
fine no one will know it'll be great
we'll figure it out later and in the
meantime for these four meetings per
week there were no meeting agendas
because of course these were briefings
with important executive type humans and
you do whatever they would like you to
do while you are in the room so there
was absolutely no structure put around
these meetings and as we all know
meetings will expand to take whatever
time they're scheduled for so most of
these meetings consisted of about five
minutes of status update fifteen minutes
of shooting the breeze and another 45
minutes of the executive suggesting new
features for the system because they
heard the CEO would probably maybe
really like this thing great now of
course there was no limiting to this
feature creep or even recording of these
newly requested features because there
were no meeting notes no one actually
knew what anyone was asking for any more
but nobody really cared cuz it was all
just gonna be a disaster anyway so the
worst of the worst the success metric
of this project as it was reported out
to the rest of the organization was the
number of meetings they were holding
about getting the system made woot we
have had four videos a week we have had
four meetings a week and we have had
many many dialogues with so and so in
such and such and just disastrous very
sad so as we all understand the big
reveal was quite bad with its
predictable result so how could we
possibly have rescued these poor people
how could they possibly had not gone
down this this doomed road well clearly
he's come on board she's broke you know
seems reasonable it's a good tool and
now I will tell you about the use and
abuse of the humble conv on board so a
dear friend of mine and I apologize if
you ever watched this video dear unnamed
friend because he was very traumatized
are you telling me this story which he
did giving permission to share so he was
hired by a firm to do information
architecture and to redo their website
basically and improve the customer
journey help people better it be able to
find learning resources and of course
convert more visitors into buyers of the
product and this is this gentleman is
absolutely no slouch master's degree in
engineering from the massachusetts
institute of technology for some reason
decided that he was more interested in
kind of customer experience and
marketing type stuff for i guess we're
calling it growth hacking these days so
he accepted this role and one of the
first tasks he was given was to separate
out the product from the website because
apparently the website was built using
the underlying product and i'm not
talking about like a javascript
framework or anything like no these
things were completely coupled together
so that if you wanted to update the
website because there was a typo or you
needed to add a new case study or
something you had to do a push of the
entire code base in order to publish it
I don't even understand how this
actually works or isn't supposed to work
and when I asked unnamed friend about it
again he his eyes glazed over he looked
really traumatized I didn't want ask him
so I just didn't anyway so needless to
say this is another one of those
projects that is super important to the
CEO and he wants to see this website
split up completed ASAP okay wonderful
so my friend is busy singing his desk
hacking away doing all the things needs
to do and the CEO super energetic like
young enthusiastic do comes comes up and
says hey how's it going checks in four
or five times a day about what he's
working on asking him about a new
feature maybe we could do this maybe we
could do that maybe we could make it
cornflower blue I don't know so he
decides that the way to solve the
problem of being constantly distracted
and constantly interrupted just to get a
conv on board okay fair enough allows
everyone in the organization to see what
you're doing completely transparent you
get the sense of accomplishment as you
move tasks forward you can offload that
to-do list out of your brain should be
great right no no no no no no no no no
it's not great so um apparently some
folks were not well educated about the
use of this particular system so if they
noticed that there was a bug on the
website they would just come in insert
random post it notes onto his board
wherever they thought was a good idea
cuz you know that will totally help
right we just don't want to bother you
we're just gonna go file this bug right
here under done and that'll be great
maybe not the CEO would wander through
he would put up a post it note with new
feature requests I don't really know
where he put them we didn't get into
that probably in the done lane 2 and
then he would go and talk to my friend
about what he was doing and you know hey
I just put up a post it on your board
isn't that great this is really awesome
yeah yeah yeah nananana but you know
again my friend was not necessarily
comfortable with pushing back on this
but this project became more and more
stressful and more and more sanity
reducing over time and he talked about
how his the most important thing for him
was being able to move things over into
that done lane and how he had so many
post-its and done so everybody would
know that he was actually accomplishing
something that they would fall off the
wall and then he'd have to replace them
so that people knew he was getting
things done
it was just a disaster so I said so what
what kept you going through this why did
you keep this up he said well I felt
like I was developing a really good
relationship with our CEO and we were we
were actually getting some like personal
bonding time right and he's a genius
he's a really smart guy he's maybe not
the world's best manager but you know
super smart guy and I was getting all
this one-on-one time with him you know
and so that was pretty cool and I said
oh oh that's great I'm glad he was
giving you this one on one time and he's
like yeah and you know we weren't always
just talking about the website sometimes
we were talking about software
development or architecture food or you
know whatever I said oh that's that
sounds cool when did you have time to do
this he said oh you know what two or
three o'clock in the morning when the
CEO would come back to the office at
night because he was a night owl and I
was still there like ah that does not
sound that's not some fun I said no I
realized like I needed to be home not at
or three o'clock in the morning so I've
set up a webcam so I could always look
at my conv on board from home and
everybody in the company could look at
the conv on board on the webcam if they
wanted to know what we were doing and
that was really good so I did my one and
a half hour commute home earlier in the
day so that I could be up late and then
get back to the office on time so
needless to say this is problematic for
a wide variety of reasons but then I i
pointed out to him like how how does
this actually help your workflow he said
well I just had to memorize what I'd
fixed and what I'd done over the night
so then I would go in and i would i
would update my board the next day and
and feel like that sense of
accomplishment that was good and I'm
like so you had to memorize everything
you did all evening from like 10pm to
two o'clock in the morning and then go
physically update your board the next
day yeah that's what I did and it didn't
occur to you that you weren't actually
offloading any of those mental stress
cycles of getting her to-do list out of
your head with this process and and he
gave me that look that told me don't ask
any questions and don't ask him to go to
the supply cabinet because there's some
post-its in there and we just we just
left it there so here was what was
really going on with all those crazy
post-its and webcams
silliness what was really going on was
that my dear friend was just hoping
desperately that his hard work would be
acknowledged the people would realize
that he was executing furiously to
accomplish this monolithic horrific task
and that his work would be appreciated
that was really the goal that he was
going for this has nothing to do with
post-its or project management or
understanding what tasks needed to be
done next it was really about creating a
visible mark of achievement so that he
would get the acknowledgement that he
wanted from the CEO that he was doing a
good job instead of just constantly new
feature requests perhaps some harsh
criticism perhaps some inept discussions
of what needed to be done next so my
friend dutifully got the stunt very
proud of him in fact I know this story
because he was introduced to me as the
only human being who could have possibly
accomplished this particular task and
that's great he got it done that was
wonderful very good and then two weeks
later he decided that for his own
personal health and well-being it was
time to create his own light at the end
of the tunnel that wasn't a train and
get another gig and who can blame him
now the irony of course is that after my
friend had departed from this
organization the CEO wanders through the
hallway goes to go put up another post
it and discovers the conv on board is
gone and says what happened to my posted
sticky thing and my friends manager was
sitting there and he said well he's no
longer with us he's left and we need to
replace him and you know this and that
and they had a very polite conversation
about it and the CEO became very
frustrated in very upset he said I can't
believe this happened I can't believe
this happened why did this he's just
he's coming up for his annual review in
like two weeks I came over here I wanted
to catch you at your desk so I could let
you know that I wanted to personally
write a note for his performance review
to tell him how much I was pleased with
what he had done and thanking him for
all his hard work for the company and
giving him an extra bonus and I just
don't understand how this could have
happened why did this happen well I
think that this is because performance
reviews if done poorly and they often
are are probably the most abused tool in
our tool set uh as companies so where's
the feedback how often in our
organizations do we get only one type of
feedback at a time either you hear all
the time that you're doing a great job
great job great job or man you're
screwing up this is bad nope nope nope
nope no mistake mistake mistake but
without any balance to it so frequently
folks find themselves waiting 3 or 6 or
12 months for that annual review cycle
or quarterly review cycle where they can
sit down with their manager and have
that great talk about what's really
going on with their career and that
entire time you're waiting for failure
you're waiting to be told how you failed
if all you've gotten is good feedback
because the only time you get told what
mistakes you've made is during this
cycle and you never have the opportunity
to improve while you're actually in the
process of doing your work or your
hearing good things are your hearing bad
things bad things bad things bad things
bad things and you know that every
comment that's coming to you next is
just going to be something that's going
to make you sad so you're kind of
sitting there hunkered down holding out
for that moment when you're going to
meet up with your boss and then they're
finally gonna say you did a good job
awesome great here's a raise or a nice
vacation or possibly bottle wine
something to let you know that your
valued and even worse than this it's the
the publicly stated practice of many
incredibly large technology companies to
make sure that the bottom ten percent of
their employees receive performance
reviews that say they do not meet
expectations and that they are eligible
to be fired to be let go now I don't
think any of us here in the audience
today
want to work at a company where folks
are not getting things done that's very
fair and there are times that people are
just not a good match for the job that
they're in but if you're working at an
organization that values hiring very
very well and hiring very very talented
people to bake successful products for
them the chances that ten percent of
your workforce is just not doing
anything correctly is actually pretty
pretty low and that creates this very
toxic environment of competitiveness an
anti collaboration between your
teammates because they're all wondering
who's going to be the next person to be
let go why would you form those
relationship bonds with your peers if
the chances that they will be there
again is so arbitrary and so slight and
it also opens it up things up for for
abuse right like if you have ten
superstars on your team and one has to
go chances are the person on your team
who has to go is not gonna be your buddy
that should go for beers with every
Friday right even if perhaps your buddy
is not the best performer on the team so
in conclusion just to bring it all back
full circle I want to encourage all of
us as we're thinking about how we use
our tools and engaging in relationships
with our colleagues to remember that the
most important thing that we can do is
act with love to remember our empathy to
remember it's about our culture and not
our tools in our interactions and our
most effective collaboration and to
approach the giving of feedback to our
peers with a spirit of humility respect
and Trust to quote team geek which is a
great book I highly recommend it so uh

me at the speaker thing in the foyer
