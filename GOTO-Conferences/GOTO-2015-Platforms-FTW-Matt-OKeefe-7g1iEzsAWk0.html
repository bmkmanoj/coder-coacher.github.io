everybody and welcome my name is Matt
O'Keefe and I'm going to be talking
about platforms today so just a bit of
an introduction I started out my career
as a developer so I have a computer
science degree and I started in the late
90s my first job was at a boutique
consulting firm helping the dot-com
startups get launched that was a very
exciting time later in life I moved into
more of an architect role and this was
very enjoyable for me because I started
to work with many different product
development teams across an entire
company so I got to see a much broader
range of challenges and problems and
started to think about things more like
at the system level and not so much
heads down in a single code base and
more recently I became the CTO at hyatt
and my responsibilities today include
technical architecture across the entire
company and I also lead product
development teams for e-commerce which
is hiya calm as well as platform
development so for me personally mr.
Spock may rest in peace one of my idols
and he's also ironically someone that my
wife compares me to given my inability
to display emotion i've also been
compared to another well-known actor so
given that i'm going to use the slides
to liven things up all right so let's
get right into it what is a platform
there's a lot of answers right but
recently i was actually tasked with
explaining to Hyatts executive
management team what is this platform
that we're seeking to build and of
course there are people from all you
know all sorts of functions in the
hospitality industry very few are very
knowledgeable about technology so I had
to explain this in a way that they could
understand and what I chose to do is use
a metaphor
or and to compare it to a professional
kitchen so there is a phrase called
meson class which is French it
translates roughly to everything in its
place and what this is all about is in a
professional kitchen a lot of the
activity before the diners arrived is in
the kitchen with all the prep work all
of the preparing and slicing and dicing
and arrangement of ingredients and you
know portioning of the proteins packing
them carefully away everything within
arm's reach also the tools you know your
knives your stacks of clean white towels
all of these things are incredibly
important for a kitchen to operate at
full speed and full efficiency so I'd
like to compare a platform in the sense
that when you're a developer and you're
creating a new application you are
basically combining ingredients in this
case data often from many different
systems many different back-end systems
that have different origins in terms of
how the data is obtained how it's stored
and how you access it but the goal of a
platform is to make a front-end
developers life as easy as possible give
them a very fast and easy way to access
data from across the entire enterprise
so what's the motivation oh actually one
more point in slightly more technical
terms I like to think of a platform as a
proper service oriented architecture
combined with automation and the
motivation behind this primarily is
speed so this is a business imperative
this is how you win in the business
world is to outpace your competition in
terms of building new products launching
them iterating rapidly based on customer
feedback so you know we think very much
even though hi it is a large corporation
our development organization thanks very
much like a lean startup we want to
learn launch a product as soon as we can
iterate on it based on customer feed
back and make it the best it can be but
you have to also consider robustness so
you know when you go fast accidents
happen you need to be prepared for that
and in fact in racing they say that if
you don't feel at least a little bit out
of control you're not going fast enough
so a proper a properly designed platform
is going to make it safe for you to take
that kind of risk so when things blow up
it's not a catastrophic failure it's
something that's contained and you can
easily recover so one of my favorite
examples is Erlang OTP so this is a
platform that I learned about in in
terms of learning about the actor model
and a couple of the key themes are
process isolation so for example there's
no such thing as shared memory every
process has its own memory space and all
computing is performed through message
passing so if one process blows up it
doesn't take down the entire application
there's also the concept of Supervisors
so monitoring becomes extremely
important and in the case of Erlang OTP
if one process crashes you just start up
another and you continue running so you
also have to consider scalability so you
need to avoid catastrophic failure when
your demand for cat cat photos exceeds
capacity all right I'm glad at least one
person is laughing I should probably be
punished for that one but seriously
modern platforms often includes auto
scaling as a feature that you should and
you know it can easily take full
advantage of also there's the concept of
organizational scalability and Jeff
Bezos is famous for coming up with this
term to pizza teams and what he meant by
that was this originated at a management
off-site that he had and one of his
managers
we need more communication across the
company we need more communication
across teams and he basically said no
communication is turrible it slows you
down it introduces group think so I want
our rule of thumb is that any team can
only be large enough that you can feed
it with two pizzas so this is a an
interesting way to think about growth
without slowing down all right so some
modern examples of platforms AWS
speaking of Amazon this platform it is
less than 10 years old but look at the
number of services that are now
available you know they started out with
just infrastructure you remember you
could spin up a virtual machine and that
was really cool but the rest of it was
sort of up to you if you look at it
today there's a ton of services
everything from you know data stores to
application services for messaging
you've got things like cloud formation
for automated deployment and application
management auto scaling of is of course
in this picture but this is a huge
platform so if you were starting a new
company today you'd have to be a fool to
not take advantage of something like
this and they really are the leader in
the public cloud space in fact the rate
at which they're introducing new
products and services is accelerating
and they're achieving that based on you
know their best practices that they've
been doing for years with things like
DevOps and continuous deployment so
Heroku another well-known example built
on top of AWS but this was one of the
first platforms that made deployment
just painfully easy I mean you would
look at it and say wow is that all i
need to do with just a handful of CLI
commands based on your github repository
you can launch your application into the
public cloud probably my favorite
example though is netflix open source
they basically have developed their
platform again on top of AWS but in
addition they've open sourced a ton of
their services and their application
components that we can now reuse so if
you go to their github page they've got
their presentation is much like the
netflix home screen for watching movies
this goes down quite a ways we say 52
public repositories and you know i think
it was just a year ago I looked at their
page and the number was only 30
something I say only but how many
companies do you know that have such a
strong commitment to open source that
they put out that much that we can all
reuse you know much of it does have a
dependency on AWS but some of it doesn't
so I would look at them very carefully
also cloud foundry this is an open
source project as well it was it's
sponsored by and it's continuously
developed by pivotal labs which is a
spin-off of VMware and it's open source
so if for some reason you're not willing
or able to go into public cloud this
might actually be a good option for you
to pursue in your own private data
centers much like Heroku there's an
emphasis on ease of deployment it's got
the same sort of CLI and shared services
that you can access in a self-service
fashion through a pis and you can run it
in a bar in a variety of context so you
could even run it on vmware ESX without
having infrastructure as a service setup
that might be a good fast path for you
to get some of these same benefits but
we shouldn't forget this whole concept
of a platform is not new so you could
argue that the world wide web itself is
the most successful platform in the
history of you know the past what 20 25
years and iOS I mean that's a more
modern example but we're not talking
about cloud computing we're not talking
a platform in terms of a number of AP is
that you can you know self service
provision it's a collection of AP is the
world wide web is a collection of
standards and those are the underlying
themes that you should think about as
you build your own platform standards ap
is and ease of integration using those
so over the years I've read a couple of
very influential pieces that I wanted to
share with you that you know form my
point of view regarding platforms the
first is an ACM Q article that is a
conversation with burner Vogel's who's
the CTO at amazon and this was published
in 2006 this actually predates the
launcher the initial launch of AWS in
fact but even back then you can see
front and center learning from the
Amazon technology platform so there were
a few you know really important insights
that that really you know struck a chord
with me the first is that he says you
should think about Amazon as a
technology company you know everybody
thought about Amazon as a retailer that
had an online store but he's saying no
first and foremost we're a technology
company that's the key to our growth the
key to our success is growth and we're
going to grow faster you know adding
more products more categories more
channels all these things using
technology I think that's true today for
pretty much any business so if you read
the article that came out a couple of
years ago by Marc Andreessen it was
entitled how software is eating the
world and essentially he was talking
about how any company in any industry
will become a technology company or they
will perish essentially some competition
will come along that does understand how
to leverage technology and they will
outpace them in terms of how to deliver
business value
so that's one key theme another one
again is growth being core to the
business strategy investors love growth
that's one of their key indicators they
look at when they make investments and
technologies is fueling growth in Amazon
and other companies that follow that
model so verner described how originally
amazon.com was a monolithic application
it was basically very a very tightly
coupled you know top to bottom system
and they quickly started running into
scalability issues not surprising right
everybody talks about vertically scaling
versus horizontally scaling they're in a
situation where they're trying to
vertically scale and they couldn't do
that fast enough to keep up with the
growing traffic so they made a pretty
radical bet on service-oriented
architecture and this was before there
were a lot of success stories out there
regarding so uh you know and it's one of
those buzzwords that you hear about and
a lot of times people say oh and never
lived up to the hype but if you look at
them as a case study and you know some
of the other companies that followed you
can really see how it gave them a huge
advantage so they had a couple of
principles one being that you know for a
database the only way to access the
database or any other data store is to
go through one and only one service now
why is that important well earlier I
talked about process isolation and you
think about the ability to implement
change without needing a lot of
coordination so having one to two Pizza
team owning a service and presenting
that service through an interface but
then having the freedom to change the
database or to change the business logic
without coordinating with you know two
or more or many clients that are
connecting directly to the database that
turned out to be a huge advantage
and they took this to a bit of an
extreme so in this article he describes
how you know depending on who you are
and what the context is if you were to
visit amazon coms homepage that might
result in a hundred or more service
calls on the back end I'm sure they're
all you know fanning out in parallel but
you know each area of screen real estate
is essentially powered by an independent
service and then there's a front end
that pulls that all together into one
view so you know each team has a service
and they're responsible for that service
from end to end meaning they're
extremely close to the customer they're
getting that feedback directly and
they're doing the development themselves
but they're also handling operations
themselves which you know it's a pretty
dramatic it's an interesting concept if
you're used to a big company with
centralized operations and lots of
change control and lots of levels of
support at Amazon these teams run these
services from end to end they're doing
their own deployment or you know
responding to pages all of that but the
advantage it gives them is again the
team is able to stay close to the
customer and get that feedback directly
and if there are problems in operating
the service they feel that pain directly
so it's not a situation where you're
you're taking new code and throwing it
over the wall and then saying all right
not my problem this is really you know
one of the early examples of the DevOps
culture that they've applied very
successfully so another example that I
love actually came out i think in 2011
this was the Steve Yeager platform rant
so Steve is a guy who worked at amazon
oddly enough for about six and a half
years and then he took a new job at
Google and he worked there for you know
roughly the same amount of time and
apparently he got sort of frustrated
with a few things the state
things at Google especially concerning
platform development so what he did was
he wrote this long post describing
exactly how Google did everything better
than Amazon except two or three things
and the main thing that Amazon did
better than google was platform
development so he wrote this very
detailed post it was full of all sorts
of things that were only meant for an
internal audience and he posted it on
google+ and he made a mistake and posted
it publicly so you know you might think
that that's a potentially career
limiting move but you know the
executives at Google were actually okay
with that you know they they laughed
about it and they listened very closely
to what he had to say and then you know
we can benefit as well so part of that
post goes into some of the details about
how the platform concept was born at an
Amazon so essentially Jeff Bezos being
the genius that he is he figured out
that this was the way of the future and
he issued a mandate and I actually I
don't usually put this many words on the
slide but I think this is so awesome we
should go through this so number one was
all development teams will expose their
data and functionality through a service
interface okay teams must communicate
with each other through these interfaces
number three there is no other sort of
backdoor access to data there's there's
no other model you have to go through
this service interface so this is all
about service orientation right and he
said it doesn't matter what technology
you use protocol language etc I actually
disagree with this one a bit but you
know because I think there's a lot of
leverage in standards that perhaps you
know they they could do even could have
been doing even better but this next one
is really interesting all service
interfaces without exception must be
designed to be externalized well-meaning
they might be exposed to some other
development some other companies outside
of Amazon this one's interesting because
it puts you in a mindset as a developer
that you have you think about defensive
pneus and robustness you think about
security you think about all these
things up front you're not going to have
to react to a decision later that you're
going to expose an API to the outside
world oh my god what do I need to do to
to make this secure so you know we can
see how that played out with things like
their marketplace it's worked out very
well for them and then you know the next
point is anybody who doesn't do this
will be fired which was actually serious
you know so he's of course in a position
to make a mandate and enforce it in such
in such a strict manner the last point
was thank you have a nice day this was
actually a joke that Steve yagi through
in because Jeff didn't really care if
you had a nice day or not so next I
think I'll share some some personal
experiences you know all these sort of
principles and things I've read about
how of those applied to my job over the
years the first example was what I would
call a homogeneous platform that was
again another great example of
service-oriented architecture and this
was a scalable robust platform before
the days of cloud computing and you know
going back to my my theme about speed
this platform help this company grow
extremely fast the company basically
went from zero to IPO and about three
years and IP owed with the valuation of
about a billion dollars you know so
roughly four times the investment so it
was an incredible experience I joined
the company when it was still a start-up
a very well funded startup but you know
it was a very very fast-paced
environment
there were competitors that we were
chasing after and it was all about speed
how can we develop the product launch it
on time and then develop all the other
products that we needed to be on par
with the competition so I mentioned it
was a homogeneous platform and that's in
the sense that there was a language
standard and it was Java and there were
a lot of benefits to this approach in
the sense that there was a framework
there was a distributed system
distributed services framework there
were a set of shared libraries all this
stuff was completely reusable there were
standards that were enforced so all of
these services that were interconnected
on the network in many ways functions in
the same way so you could spin up a new
team I think two piece of teams again
you could spin up a new team or maybe
fork a team split into two and give them
a new challenge to build a new product a
new service and then given the
frameworks that were developed the
shared libraries it was a pretty simple
matter of configuration to actually
register that service on the network to
publish it and make it discoverable by
all the clients on the old network and
for a client to consume that service so
you know it started out as just a
website with a couple of services on the
back end so it was like two or three
components and then over the space of
three years it was dozens of services
and you know lots and lots of developers
dozens of services they could basically
be developed in parallel so again that's
the organizational scalability side of
things now it wasn't all you know it
wasn't all roses for this particular
system there were some lessons learned I
mentioned shared libraries and these
service interfaces in fact it was a
technology that was based on Java RMI so
you're talking about serializable
objects and of course there's version
concerns versioning was a huge challenge
and you know coordination of upgrades of
these shared libraries I see one person
in the audience nodding his head so you
know i think the lesson learned was you
need to think about loosely coupled
systems it's awesome to have you know a
large distributed system but it's not
awesome when i make a change down here
and i might not even be totally aware or
able to learn you know which of the my
dependencies are actually affected by
that so when you're in that sort of
situation you tend to think oh my gosh
there's changes all over the place we're
not sure what are the effects so you
start to think about the whole system as
a monolith which is the last thing you
want to do because that slows you down
again going back to you know
communication that sort of overhead it
slows everything down not to mention you
know you would have to test the whole
system as a single unit so things like
continuous deployment it's it's a real
challenge the next example I would bring
up from my experience was a
heterogeneous platform a totally
different corporate environment and this
was a company that had a very
entrepreneurial spirit and their their
approach to rapid growth was basically
to to do decentralized development spin
up a new development team send them off
to build a product and they would
operate it end to end but perhaps
without the same degree of you know
applying standards to make it a bit more
uniform and more predictable so so
really the only standard in this
environment in the beginning was the
infrastructure everything else was
highly decentralized but we did evolve
that to become a platform and we started
applying standards and you know I let a
team that developed a lot of or offered
a lot of core services you know a mix of
open source and commercial products
you know some of the examples are pretty
obvious like memcache d do you really
want each and every one of your
development teams to figure out you know
I mean it's quite simple right but how
do you figure out how to operate it at
scale or like RabbitMQ for messaging
it's a great example of something that's
fairly easy to sit to stand up in a
centralized manner and then have the
team's consume that as a service using
api's there's a bunch of other examples
here a zookeeper was an interesting one
a red hat storage service for object
store there's a mix of commercial
products as I mentioned and one of the
lessons learned for me was sort of a
reinforcement of my my love for open
source so one or more of these products
and i will say which one or ones we're a
bit of a headache in terms of support so
you know with commercial software you
pay you pay for the product and support
comes with it and that should be a very
good thing but if you run into an issue
and it gets fixed you run into an issue
again you know and you call up support
it's not like you're always going to get
the same guy who worked on your problem
before so he doesn't have necessarily
the context about your environment so
you go through this whole dance about ok
I'm going to upload my configuration
files and upload my log files and then
you know they go work on that they come
back with more questions sometimes it's
better to just have the source and you
know have a couple of talented engineers
who can dive in and figure it out
themselves one of the other things I
noticed was that you know we've got
about nine services that were on offer
and I had a team of three engineers that
we're supporting those so coverage could
be a challenge and I underestimated the
maintenance and support overhead
internally in terms of development teams
adopting one of these services and then
they come back with lots of questions or
issues
we actually wanted to add even more
services to the platform but we
underestimated the staffing required to
really support in a big enterprise okay
so a bit closer to the modern error for
me i joined height about a year and a
half ago and this was one of the first
things that they gave me it's a
architecture diagram from about twenty
ten and you know you can't read anything
on here but i hope you get the general
impression that it was a huge technology
footprint tons of complexity you know
you've got technology that's deployed on
hotel properties you've got stuff in the
data center you've got the backend for
the corporation itself tons of things
all connected almost arbitrarily it's a
very complex environment and you know
I'll give you one example one of these
bubbles over here is actually hiya calm
which by itself is like two and a half
million lines of code so a very
interesting challenge you know and
there's a few ways that people might
react to that I you know your head could
explode you could say oh my god what
have I gotten into but for me personally
I think this guy in the bottom you know
even though his mind is blown it's a
very you know enlightening sort of oh my
God look at all this potential look at
all this opportunity so that was my
reaction I knew what I was getting into
but my reaction was this is an awesome
opportunity if we simplify an abstract
all of this complexity we're going to be
in a great position so that's what we
set out to do starting with creating an
API facade so you know if you've got
many different type of systems and in
this example there's a mobile client
needs to consume data from some big
system maybe it's a reservation system
could be something else you've got
content you've got you know
perhaps third-party software packages
that only offer soap and maybe you want
your standard to be rest there's a
pattern that you can apply called API
facade to basically abstract all those
differences and have an intermediate
layer that makes all the backend
accessible in the same way so one of the
things we we did was one of the first
things we did was adopt Netflix zool
which is an API gateway and this is how
we implemented the API facade and it's
been a great experience so far again
it's open source and we've been able to
you know basically dive in and make it
you know form it to be exactly what we
need it to be but you know it's coming
from netflix is a very very high quality
product you know that they've hadn't had
in production for some time and we've
recently put it in production as well so
it's been great so far we've got a
number of features and we started out
pretty simple but for example the API
facade concept I think it's important to
present what I call a uniform API and
what that means is that we have a URL
design standard and going back to my my
goal of speed I want to make it as fast
and easy for front-end developer to
consume any service just by learning a
single type of API it's a single ingress
to all services so for example the
security team loves this idea you can
apply you know governance and all kinds
of controls at a single place it routes
to services based on a dynamically
configured URL path so essentially that
means we can have a single domain API
Hyatt com for example it's versioned and
then the rest of the path the next
couple of elements actually tell the
Gateway what kind of request is this
what back-end service do I need to route
it to and we've got a fairly simple
authentication
scheme for security so we could easily
externalise the service at this point
we're going to add other you know
two-legged OAuth type implementations in
the future but again keeping it simple
and in the beginning and of course we've
got things like rate limiting so it's
it's great again to to implement
something like process isolation where
in fact on the next slide you know
future enhancements circuit breakers
it's another pattern where if you have
this gateway and one of the backend
services starts to slow down you know
that might become an issue the cascades
upwards and takes down the Gateway
itself but you can implement a circuit
breaker to basically shunt that traffic
off to a placeholder while the rest of
the services are not impacted we're
going to be working on analytics across
the board is a huge theme getting more
intelligence about how you customers are
using the products and that applies to
developers who are consuming api's as
well so we're going to do analytics and
we are in the process of implementing a
real-time streaming analytics engine
that's based on a patchy storm so
there's some interesting work that we're
going to hook that hook the gateway into
aggregation and assembly of custom
object responses basically custom
payloads with intelligence about who is
the client and what data do they need
what data do they not need you know part
of the goal here is to reduce the
chattiness that's often a criticism of
restful web services you have too many
API calls that introduces latency
instead and this is another pattern that
Netflix's has written about what you can
do is make a single API call as a client
and then have an intermediate layer that
recognizes that client mix all the calls
on the back end within the data center
or within the private cloud and then
aggregates all that into a single
response so making very efficient use of
the network resources and I
with Amazon's lessons about being
prepared to externalise a service we're
thinking about multi-tenancy and
externalization that's going to be a
business decision that we haven't you
know started to engage on yet but I
could easily see you know our technology
platform becoming a multi-tenant system
that perhaps other smaller hotel chains
could leverage and whatever else again
the theme is the same as with the Lean
Startup we want to listen to our
customers very carefully and that's how
we're going to plan our roadmap so it's
very much an agile product development
process so this is a bit more detail on
what we've done so far on the upper
right you basically have you know a
hotel property and as I mentioned before
there's a technology that's used at the
hotel property especially at the front
desk an associate might use eight or
nine different applications you know for
something as common as check-in or
check-out but these are you know point
solutions often provided by vendors and
the associate has to switch back and
forth which is not very efficient it's
not a great user experience for them and
it takes away from the opportunity for
them to interact with the guests and
provide a better hospitality experience
so we are developing a new user
interface that we call colleague
advantage and that's what see I
represents in this in this diagram and
we have deployed that in AWS we're using
VPC which is a virtual private cloud so
we've got a VPN connection to the data
center it's secure and gives us all the
same benefits of using automation and we
also have the gateway to the netflix
dual api gateway we have that deployed
both in AWS as well as the data center
but in this case we have the gateway
with the ability through the VPC to talk
to a service that's in our data center
that talks to the backend for the
property management system you know to
do some of these tasks
like check in check out we've used
vagrant and ansible so far those were
fairly easy to to use to implement push
button deployment so it takes about five
minutes to stand up an entire new
environment versus you know the legacy
VMware environment which still takes you
know a while to put in a service request
for a new virtual machine and then
somebody's going to physically you know
run some scripts all right so the last
thing I want to talk about is what sort
of people do you need to hire to to run
this sort of environment right we've
talked a lot about automation we've
talked a bit about cloud and there's
very much a cultural aspect to it in
terms of service orientation so I'd like
to look for what I call DevOps unicorns
these are these mythical people who
understand DevOps not just in terms of
the tools and and that sort of thing but
also the culture behind it because for
me DevOps is most importantly about
having development teams work better
with operations teams to make that you
know a more a better relationship much
the same that agile helps the business
team interface with a product
development team so what do we mean by
DevOps should it be in a team name I
would say no and the reason being I
think if you do this you might give the
impression that DevOps is somebody
else's problem now oh there's a team
that's going to do DevOps so I don't
need to do it but again if you think
about the cultural nature you know the
collaborative approach that we want to
encourage we don't want to put that in a
team name and make it look like a
separate function should it be in a job
title perhaps I think that you know
today a lot of engineers are you know
they respond to this this buzzword it's
a bit of
honey pot you know if you put in a job
title it mixed feelings about it should
you put in a job description absolutely
you know this is one of the this
basically appears in all of the job
descriptions for my team so you know I
encourage you to please visit that URL
and check them out but really what is it
anyway how do you define dev ops and
sadly you know it's not like it's not
clear cut you know I'm part of a couple
of mailing lists DevOps tool chain is
one of the good ones you know this post
came out a couple of years ago somebody
shared this link and bongo here who I
think probably subscribes more into de
berault ops camp you know his first
response is like well you spelled it
wrong it's supposed to be capital d
capital oh and the funny thing about
this is that the person who wrote that
article is basically one of the founders
of the whole DevOps movement Patrick
Dubois so it's a bit ironic but for me
you know I want to simplify DevOps ha's
is like porn I know it when I see it so
I'm making a pun or making a joke here
you know there was the famous Supreme
Court case about obscenity and
pornography and they're one of the one
of the judges had that famous quote you
know I don't know what porn is but I
know what when I see it so all right so
is this a DevOps unicorn anybody okay
i'm going to say no this is actually a
cloud unicorn and there's that there's a
clue adrian cockcroft this was one of
his tweets he was at Netflix he recently
left but he was one of their architects
and he was pretty famous for saying I
don't want DevOps I actually want no ops
and what he meant by that was they
basically have outsourced operations to
amazon so they have developers that are
just consuming all of that
infrastructure doing deployments and all
of that
the automated way all right how about
this guy devops unicorn mmm I don't
think so so you know it's being ridden
by a superhero and again going back to
culture the hero syndrome is not
something that you want to encourage in
your organization you know those people
who basically are just thrilled when
there's a crisis and they're like the
only one who can save the day DevOps is
more about shearing you know and
building automation and repeatable
processes so you know I like this guy a
bit better so I'm going to I'm going to
use him as my image for what a DevOps
unicorn is but you know earlier I
mentioned that we want to think about
speed in the context of the entire
product development lifecycle so from
end to end it's not just DevOps you also
need a jold development processes you
need your developers to be close to the
business and and having that that
feedback in that rapid cycle of
iteration and even taking it a step
further we'd like to look for full stack
developers so by that i mean people who
can work both on the front end and the
back end and people are well versed in
best practices both agile and DevOps so
they're operating much more in a
continuous delivery model so that's
pretty much our ideal and with that I
can take some questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
