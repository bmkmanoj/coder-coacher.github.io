consultant
working for ThoughtWorks I come from the
beautiful city of Hamburg and two years
ago I gave a talk here and the title was
50,000 lines of code to brew a cup of
coffee
so that was my personal first IOT
project where we build a coffee machine
and the components around it and I
summed up some of the lessons learned
together from a colleague Martine on
this on this project now two years later
there were more projects there were
forklift is to be connected cars
charging poles and different things and
the goal of this talk is to summarize
the lessons learned from these projects
and hopefully to give you an idea how to
approach the Internet of Things so when
I first heard a couple of years ago
about the Internet of Things I was like
a little kid I was sitting on the train
dreaming about how my life will change
what devices will be connected what can
I do with them and it was very very
excited today I'm still excited but I
understood that if you take the Internet
of Things
it describes the state of the internet
it describes the state where most
information that's produced and consumed
is done without any deliberate human
interaction and as a developer I'm like
how can I create the negative things and
I understood I don't have to worry about
this because they will just appear once
we connect more devices and we just do
more project it's very similar to
remember those days when people talked
about web 2.0 everybody was really
excited about this and then people like
how we need a fab 2 dot or web site all
of a sudden people stopped talking about
it because it was there but if we now
ask ourselves how can we approach the
Internet of Things it's worth to dig one
one level down and the next level would
be the smarter mains smart mobility
smart agriculture
smart cities smart home so you have
different systems connected to each
other to be useful with both being
actors and senses of data but again here
I I myself I can't you know just build
smart mobility and probably no no
company itself can do there's some try
but probably they won't do this so again
we should go then one level deeper and
there you have something called the
multi-layered ecosystem so for example
you think about your home you might have
different devices connected to back-end
systems and interacting with each other
to make something useful you can think
about a smart factory you know there's
machinery there's logistics there are
production lines and all the systems are
actually not one system but they're just
connected system by itself again this is
very hard to implement so then comes the
idea of a smart ecosystem so you have a
connected device that is tied to some
back-end and it has useful services
around that so that is there's an extra
value for the user or for the for the
owner of the system and this is whether
what smart ecosystem comes from to make
it a bit more clear I'm going to start
also from bottom up so if you take a
device and yes you would still see
coffee machines in this talk the device
itself has a functionality in this case
it brews coffee without even being
connected and hopefully bros delicious
coffee if you then put it for a small
PCB some computing power into the device
you are able to to put in some logic
that might make the brewing of the
coffee more efficient or more delicious
or something like that then you might
call it a smart device so for example
the heating system I have in my basement
it's smart changes stuff as the
temperature is changing but it's not
connected and I wouldn't call it an IOT
heating system if you then put
connectivity into the device so then you
have something that has functionality
and it has some logic in it and then you
connect it to a back-end system or to
the internet just in general then you
can call it a connected device
but they're the additional user value is
very limited I mean most of the time you
see with with IOT devices you just have
an app and you see some values exactly
the same notes you could basically read
on there on the machine not very useful
but then you need to put extra value
into your back-end system and the
services around it and then you have the
smart ecosystem from from the bottom so
summing it up
smart ecosystem seems to be for most
companies the right way to approach the
IOT because if you if you start just
with a connected device you don't have
any additional user value and people
will actually be quite disappointed
because they spend all this money now an
expensive device that doesn't do much on
the other hand if you aim for the
multi-layered ecosystem right away it's
probably very hard to implement this as
a single step I hope this gives you some
idea what when I talk about smart
ecosystems what I mean by that
well I I didn't come up with this word
it's also used by found hope a lot and
they have a very different definition
because they say smart ecosystems are a
software system that are combining these
different types of systems so for
example a back-end system is more or
less an information system we must have
time building Java C sharp or whatever
and then there's a mobile component to
it either for the connectivity or it
could be a mobile app but mobile systems
feel a bit different than information
systems what's very different about
smart ecosystems is that most of the
time you also have an embedded system
this stuff that it's running inside the
machine where you have limited resources
where you have a different language and
you have to connect them by a mobile to
your information system so the idea is
that the smart ecosystem combines these
different types in one system I'm a
developer I wish I I could tell you now
the most important thing for building
smart ecosystem is the architecture and
the tools and the protocols the pass
shows at least from life my experience
it's not so the goal of this talk is to
highlight all these topics you see
around
they're on a very brief level because
all these things are important factors
for building a successful smart
ecosystem and honestly there's some
topics I am not really passionate about
organizational design I couldn't care
less but it's important start with the
first one business models I'm a
developer I'm speaking about business
models what I do know is there's
technology and there's business and
there's a interaction a relationship
between those two technology enables new
business and business drives then the
technology can how its evolving and how
innovation is done and the faster you
can turn this wheel in your company so
the fast you can make technology
actually be useful for the business and
the faster you can make the business
then drive again the technology the more
innovative you probably are it seems
that in the past people get a bit
overexcited about the idea of Internet
of Things because they broke this wheel
so you have on the left side this is a
connected egg tray on top of that you
have a connected water bottle and then
they stay connected hairbrush and I
maybe some people find it useful
I guess the success of these products
show that you have to step back a bit
what do people really want not just put
your same deal is the same product you
have just put smart in front of it and
give it some connectivity do you know
these watches where they measure your
pulse and your heart rate and these have
been around forever not forever so in
the 1990s these these watches were able
to measure your heartbeat and actually
if you would have the right cable and
the right operating system you will be
you were able to connect it to your
desktop and then download the data and
then you can I don't know you ever see a
CSV file and you can import into Excel
and make a graph
out of it that we sit later on these
things were then connected to it or to
web or mobile apps so you didn't have to
do the you know the the tedious
connecting and downloading and importing
and then analyze how your heart rate was
so that got a bit easier and now we are
in the next step so we can not only take
the heart rate when we exercise we can
also we might have a connected scale we
might have a diet plan we might have our
training schedule and we connect and
connect all those things so if you think
about the ecosystem that started with
this product this watch this watch moved
from being an instrument measuring an
integer value to an analysis tool for
your for your exercise and now if you're
a bit euphemistic and optimistic you
might be able to call it even a training
assistance and the thing is if you then
step back people actually don't want
this watch they want to run faster or
they want to lose weight or I don't know
and so they don't want the product they
want to achieve something and if you
then think about the different evolution
steps of this watch it started with but
being an instrument where the things
that this device that this product can
do for you to achieve your solution it's
very very limited but the more
information you put into the system and
the more you focus on what the clients
actually want or the users want to
achieve then you can push this what can
be automated to achieve this solution
forward so the human has less to do with
it
which is interesting I guess one good
example is on this one everybody knows
this one the Amazon - button sorry
you can see it's the aim of indifference
problem here is I'm standing in front of
my washing machine and I'm running out
of detergent solution as I get more
detergent the human interaction here is
I have to press the button and the
product itself is very stupid it's a
switch it's a switch that is connected
or Wi-Fi that's it right nothing special
it doesn't even have a core
functionality except for being clicked
but the service is behind it I set up my
address I set up my Amazon account and
things like that actually solve almost
the entire problem for me all the let's
left I have to wait a bit and have to
open the door that's it problem solved
so if you think about if you're in a
company that's solving that's
manufacturing and selling products I
guess it's time with you know the new
possibilities you get out of connected
devices to step back and to ask then
again ok do do people really want an
excavator or do they want just a hole in
the ground and maybe we can charge them
for holes in the ground rather than for
buying machines and I mean especially if
you look at the German manufacturers for
for industry vehicles they move from
selling products and vehicles to leasing
them maybe it's time then to move to the
next step let me give you an example all
these players are somewhat in the
mobility sector and do you know their
claims so at least until last year a
Volkswagen that's out of the car it's a
product sixth has the claim rent-a-car
and car to go I think they also changed
it but I really like that one hello
mobility so there you can see the trunk
strong trend from a product to let's say
a standard service to a very are talkin
individual solution
ah you can have this light oh that's so
that's my favorite topic organizational
structures when you think about building
a smart a customer system there are lots
of things that need to be done I wrote
down a few of them here maybe you can
think of even more so you start from the
hardware side firm eye needs to be built
the device needs connectivity you then
need a platform and infrastructure in
between to have services that then a
user has apps and for this obviously we
need to analyze the business and you
probably want to do some user research
if you then have a big company that is
able to do all this then at least you
can find you need different people for
this I myself can't do all this and in
real life these people are in different
teams in different departments and
different buildings and different
sections of the company maybe even
different companies and but you need all
of these people so what I've seen in the
past a lot is just put more hierarchy in
steering committee weekly meeting to two
hours every Monday scrum of scrums
and on the on the bottom then you have
one businessman organizing it all and
probably this person is really good at
organizing things but we know as you
know make technical people
if you then need to integrate this
actually on the bottom is where the
problem is I thought it was an integer
now it's a float I thought this probably
this unit and it's not and so what
people then tried a lot of different
companies tried a lot is to however it
scalding a company Innovation Lab or
startup within a company so they take
different people out of this and try to
build a cross-functional team that can
handle all this and to be honest I've
seen it's working quite well people are
coming together they are out of their
old environment and they are able to put
together a proof-of-concept or you know
some prototype within months what I've
also seen a lot is this doesn't scale
back then this group of people was able
to create something on a prototype level
on on you know proof-of-concept level
and then it's okay now we have to go to
production and then you're back in your
old structure again of all of yourself
and to be honest I don't have a silver
bullet for that but I want to I want to
add one more thing that is also a very
common pattern
I'm staff 50% on this project to explain
you our API so that was exactly the
sense I heard from a person on my team
and then I thought well what does 15%
mean that that will be there Monday from
9:00 to 2:00 or every day I this doesn't
work and this seems to be a lot an
excuse and big company structures that
oh yeah we want to do this but this is
not our core business so you just spend
20% here and there this doesn't work
people are not bought in people don't
have the context and you don't have the
interaction and the integration you need
them on the bottom level Oh another
topic I'm that's not my core skill
experience design for I don't know for
15 years I've been trying to build
software with the help of designers that
looks good on the screen like this maybe
bigger maybe smaller but we wanted to
have a really good user experience on a
two-dimensional computer screen
and in the past I don't know how many
years we fought very hard to make the
same experience as good to look good on
the screen that is on a mobile phone so
we came up with our nicely crafted
navigation structure and put it into a
burger menu and we came to the to the
idea that instead of putting things side
by side we just put them top to bottom
and honestly it works I'm happy with
most of the websites and software see on
my phone and I can use it and then you
have this you have five buttons and a
screen that is like that and oh it's not
a touchscreen and if it's a touchscreen
it's no it's resist if not capacitive so
it's really ugly and then you have user
flows across those devices
and so I guess we we have to move on you
know from those computer screens so
right now if you think about UI design
we have to think about those tiny
screens or maybe LEDs or maybe I don't
know whatever this machine has and also
about a mobile phone and also about our
computer screen we have to consider the
industrial design
how does it feel what's the form factor
how and the user flows is this thing
giving feedback to the user and the
hardest bit is the inter usability what
happens if I press the button here on
the phone how should the machine then
reacts so I guess if you then have your
experience designer sitting with you you
might want to get in an industry sign
off on some inspiration you might want
to have discussion about flows and I I
don't have an answer but I identified a
few topics that are really useful to
focus on first of all user experience
beyond the screen I think I already
alluded to this one latency with phones
we got a bit better but right now just
pushing and pushing a button and then
shall we spin up until the machine
finally received that what what it ever
is supposed to do and then sends back
that everything is okay spinners and
page loaders don't work anymore and I'm
flying everything that can be connected
can be offline so if you have a user
flow between different devices you
always have to consider literally every
case what happens if the mobile phone
has a big latency and a bad connection
and the machine has been offline for two
days in stored I don't know two hundred
events it wants to send back so you have
to consider this from a user perspective
you have to give feedback
I had a device that had an external
Wi-Fi connection and there was only one
LED on there and it could show green
yellow and red and if we lose Wi-Fi
connection would be red I know I don't
have I don't even have to try something
on my phone which it's not the best
you're at the experience but at least I
got feedback that I don't have to try
anything else
want to hide technology nobody cares if
it's a Wi-Fi connection or a SIM card or
whatever processor is behind it or if
it's booting up or getting updates and
synchronizing nobody cares about this I
have something in this case a coffee
machine in front of me I don't care just
give me coffee
so lots of areas where we have to work
on and nailing it down again if you
think about this device and it doesn't
matter what I decided it just took
something the first thing you want to
worry about from a user experience
perspective is the connectivity setup so
people are buying these really expensive
products they are all excited going home
unpacking and then they have to do this
I took this it took notes from the
YouTube video that it's explaining how
to get connectivity onto this device so
you have to register then you have a key
you have to do this key ID you have to
write it down somewhere then you attach
to the Wi-Fi module then it does a
firmware update you have to wait then
you have to select the Wi-Fi enter the
Wi-Fi password then you wait again then
it does the synchronization which then
takes time and then you have to accept
the privacy policy and then you are done
I guess this will take about half an
hour I guess and the thing is this is
the happy path oh I because you have to
type the your Wi-Fi password on this
screen I mistyped it sorry so when we
built the coffee machine this probably
took 30% of the time the initial process
how the user sets up the Wi-Fi and I
think it's worth if you if you have this
problem to look just at different
products how it's an Amazon echo setup
how is it - but and the GoPro because
there I'm not going into detail of this
they're just different let's say ways to
get connectivity that makes sense for
different devices if either GoPro camera
and then you just said about once it's
probably fine if I just attach a cable
because I'm going to work with my
computer anyway together with this for
other devices in the kitchen and might
not make sense at all again fantastical
machines
probably it's fine if somebody just
needs to come in and pluck something
it's good architecture so when I come to
a new project in the IOT area usually I
meet somebody that has architect in the
title and then we have the first meeting
and this person explains to me what
their technical vision is interestingly
they all look the same so we start with
a fresh whiteboard and then the person
says we are not building here an IOT
device or smart a great system we are
building the company's internal IOT
platform and then they draw this so on
the left hand side you have the
different devices in the middle you have
the IOT platform which usually has these
components for some reason people start
thinking again that rules engine are
good idea and then you have services on
top of the platform and then apps on top
of that and well we all know I mean have
you ever tried to build up front the
library the framework did that work and
I guess the same is with the both
platforms and and the anti-pattern the
smell you always see that they always
put the focus on the platform
and then of us oh we don't have any data
so then they put a bit of focused and
all let's get some device connected for
our multi-purpose platform and I I
rarely see then somebody building apps
on top of that maybe sometimes you know
just a showcase thing that just shows
the value from the device going through
the platform and then on the screen yes
I guess platform enviousness is how you
can call this I've seen this happening a
lot so how about what we do with web
applications as well I mean the first
thing we do is we put a locking screen
there that is just should you see I can
show something on a browser that goes
through my back-end that is connected to
the database it's working right and then
I can build on top of that and adding
functionality and I guess you should do
the same you don't know what
protocol is the right one for your use
case up front you don't know how it will
scale and where the bottlenecks will be
so just getting one thing end to end
it's not only good from a technology
perspective but also from an
organizational perspective to see if you
have set up a team that actually can put
things together also management will be
happy to see something on the air
because nobody cares about console
output I played around with you with the
echo a week ago and I wanted to fake
home device so I thought that my echo
would then speak directly to my fake
device it does not it just needs some
back-end URL and then basically it's
talking the Amazon echo is talking all
the time to the back end and the back
end would talk again to to my device and
none was like all this is boring but
then I stood right because the Amazon
echo needs internet connectivity to do
the speech recognition so in this case
it makes sense but this is actually how
most IRT systems works the devices speak
directly to the Internet and I mean this
works as long as the device itself has
the core functionality but I don't want
to have a smart home that basically
stops working when my ISP hangs up and I
guess the the term here that I don't
like it but it seems to be now
established is fog so you have the
devices on the ground you have the
backend in the cloud and then you have a
new layer which is called for computing
or some people call it edge computing
but the important thing is here that
there's a computing unit with services
with information that basically does the
orchestration the event buffering the
does the communication between them
devices maybe not as good and as rich as
the back-end would do but it keeps it
running and the most important thing is
that it's running in your local Anja
enterprise network for home automation I
guess it's a very tangible example but
think about an assembly line in a
factory you don't want to because
something is broken with a Wi-Fi you
don't want the assembly line just
working since you know you need you can
just do the orchestration on I called it
hub I don't know if there's a word in
between but hub is called for most
devices when you connect for most
systems when you connect multi devices
it uses if this one has connectivity and
you using something like ZigBee or so so
you don't have to worry about
connectivity then you just need to worry
about the hub another thing to consider
with the architecture is where do you
want to be at when you move from a smart
ecosystem to a multi layer ecosystem do
you want to be the platform do you want
to be the company the product in the
middle and since you can't do all the
things in your domain by yourself you
have others integrating this with with
you because all of a sudden things like
developer experience becomes very
important because they need to make it
easy for people to be connected to your
platform there's a very good HBR article
about this or do you want to be the
participant I have a device I have a
device may be a household device maybe
industrial advice but I won't be able to
build all this stuff around it I won't
be able to be the thing in the middle
and so I need to integrate to the
biggest platforms so in this case
probably for home automation will be
Amazon Google and Apple which seems to
be the biggest player and Amazon is
pushing hard or I just try everything to
do myself I do the vendor login I built
the devices about the platform I built
their app for Android and iOS and I
expect just all the users to have 50
different apps for 50 different devices
this is what I see a lot there's a
strong trend from companies to move from
from the vendor lock-in approach then to
realize ah maybe we can't do everything
ourselves so let's at least be the
platform in the middle and this might be
working somehow but then there is ah hah
I guess we should do an Alexa
integration
I mean if you make a deliberate decision
in the beginning where you at least want
to aim at then you might save some
energy and time and money on this my
first IOT project I spoke to the person
that wrote there was in charge of
writing the firmware for the device and
I was very excited I was like let's get
going let's define some HTTP endpoint
and some JSON structures and I look at
me blank it was like Jason that's just
fancy candy for the internet kitties so
he was saying like we should define a
binary protocol and then I over the next
month and with the next part I realized
that there is a divide between the
developers there is a divide between
information systems and mobile system
and probably two-thirds of you can
manage the right hand side quite well
and then there's another portion of
personal people that can manage the left
hand side as well but when it comes to
understanding each other ways of working
ways of testing continuous integration
then these worlds are quite different
and I think I come in more from the
right hand side I have to understand
that it might not be possible to have a
Jason pass on every single device it's
just too small all right so I have to be
open for this and on the other hand I
don't accept that something that was
working before doesn't work with the
next firmware update because I know how
to do automatic testing I can't see of a
reason why this shouldn't be the case
for embedded software as well spoke to a
lot of people things are moving there
but I guess we have to be aware of this
especially when when you then work with
a different company you should speak
early about how do we integrate how do
we work together how do we make sure
that stuff that work yesterday is still
working on the other day Oh best case
you have one team that you know can do
all of this brings me to this slide when
I started programming for money
in most companies there was a very
strong separation between front-end
developers and back-end developers and
we probably all know the reason why this
is not a good idea so 10 years later the
idea of a full stack developers is in a
lot of companies well-established and
there are many positive sites on this as
well the problem is when I really for
tech developer as a consulting going to
different companies I have to worry
about beckoned front-end mobile cloud
ops machine learning computer vision ARV
rmr PCP design embedded 3d printing and
blotching I can't use this really I this
doesn't fit in my head anymore
and I guess it's getting worse there are
more niche topics I can't be an expert
on I don't know 3d design and machine
learning at the same time well maybe
some people can I can't so the question
is where do we move on I guess we always
have to make sure that you have the
skills you need in your team but you
just have to accept that not every
single developer will be able to you
know take every single story I guess
right now we're still pushing for this
there will be the moment where they
split just be aware and let me know if
you have good ideas about this
testing testing changed a lot in the
last year's and we moved from manual
finding bugs to making testing let's say
a fully integrated tool to design our
software to test our software now if I
think about testing I think about those
two things the red-green refactoring
Monte and I think about the famous
pyramid with unit test integration it's
and functional tests all good for most
projects if you then come to a smart
ecosystem use case you have something
like this
so somebody does something on the
machine the machine talks to the back of
the back end of the phone I have an
interaction with the phone and the way
back and then the phone talks to the
Machine again and then the machine gives
effect to the user this is not made up
but it would be too long to explain this
use case because we had exactly this use
case on one of our projects this is not
fun to test at all well first first of
all you have those three different
components and well there are very
limited tools for especially for
embedded system to do tester and
development and automation development
not that it's not possible but it's very
limited and then you can do all the
things for the different devices and the
next thing is if you have a system that
has all these components and you want to
test a very specific scenario the
machine is almost out of out of memory
and then the user does this it's very
hard to set this up for an automated
test it just gets very complex most of
the time you have multiple teams with
this and then the most painful thing is
what if the test or the scenario needs
physical user interaction somebody
really has to press the button on this
machine yeah we were a bit stuck there i
I want to give you two things that
helped on the last projects not fully
eliminating the complexity of this but
that helped a lot to actually not
throwing out automatic testing
completely out of the window
the first one is fake components this
brass beep I hear things it's a coffee
machine and it does it good it's not
Brian coffee but it acts like a coffee
machine and the good news is if
right a small software maybe a note or
something on this that should behave
like the coffee machine I can give it
some extra end points I can give it just
now think you are in brewing mode just
now think you need cleaning it's very
easy to set this up in an automatic way
but obviously here well then we kind of
cheated a bit we can maybe test the
whole flow in the system but we are
working with a component that is not the
real machine and so this comes in the
second suggestion to do contract tests
so especially when somebody else is
building the physical device then you
fake the device do the testing for the
stuff you're writing and you write tests
first of all for your fake device and
you then run them again against the real
device so at least can say we expected
something different so we did that on
different projects especially for the
coffee machine project not there was no
single firmware update where all tests
read green but at least we now could
know immediately and we can point out
test 7 and test 9 at this 12 let's talk
about this
so with contract test you get somewhat a
living documentation and you are at
least able to automatically test the
updates you your team or somebody else
is doing so I guess we thought those two
components you might be able to handle
the complexity a bit and I guess the
other vices push for motivation even
though you can't do 100% of automation
then do the 90 percent then try to you
know pop up a window that says now
somebody needs to go through the Machine
and press this button or I've seen teams
building arms with Lego Mindstorm that
do things this is also fun security
thanks if we now think about the model
again from the phone of Institute if you
have an information system and a mobile
system the OWASP website identifies
those attacks or faces on these kind of
systems I guess you can go and more
detail onto that maybe some of them are
missing but these are basically
the things you need to worry about where
somebody can do something harmful to
your system when you now add an embedded
system to that you get more you get
these so your physical and interfaces
you have memory firmware and so on and
so on and so on and the problem most of
the time with physical devices is well
service it most of the time on Amazon
only very few people are able to go
there but the physical devices are at
people's home in warehouses maybe on the
street and people have time and the
screwdriver they can just read out
memory they can just read the signatures
and the keys and everything so we worry
a lot in the projects about security and
it seems that one good rule is whatever
comes from the device is insecure just
expect that it's fake because we
couldn't think of a situation or
scenario where it's impossible for
somebody to fake it but then you end up
with you know those many threats and
those many things that might go wrong
and it felt like it especially in the
initial phase you need to get a handle
of this you need to focus on something
so that's a good consult and then we
draw a nice diagram with two axes and
then you just sit together and you just
worry about okay if this goes wrong
what's the impact for our business and
how likely is it so for example if I
already have somebody in my Wi-Fi and
somebody can do something that's not
nice but it's okay the probability is
low because not everyone is on my Wi-Fi
and if it's not too bad and it probably
ends up more in the middle on the other
hand if somebody can take over my
servers and place a bad firmware that
affects all the devices this is very bad
and it might be quite hard but I guess
this way if you just think about the
different problems you might be able to
identify these things on the on the
upper right this is where you want to
fix these first or worry about the most
I have a scale at home and it's
connected to my Wi-Fi I I bought it long
long time ago it was the first one
had it any connectivity I don't know why
but I paid the money for it at some
point I changed my Wi-Fi password and
moved and then so this thing lost
connectivity I functionality was not too
great I didn't bother plugging the cable
back in and you're setting the Wi-Fi
again so it's unconnected right now but
at some point it might be again
connected so this thing has seen no
updates in ten years and there are bugs
in the software and since it's not
connected for this scale for this
specific scenario might not be as bad
but I guess what I learned for myself
and what I've seen in the real life also
no one cares about updates as long as it
works if if the thing works just nicely
nobody will push the button nobody will
go to preferences settings from update
bah-bah-bah so regarding security leave
the door open for yourself implement
automatic and secure over the updates
now if you just need one feature you
need that one because everything else
you can hopefully fix then afterwards
and maybe Isis I don't don't forget
about the basics we learn so many things
the hard way and it seems that some of
those things just get thrown out of the
window as soon as we move to the IT
world so don't forget the basics so you
need to sign your farm update with
signatures you need to send the
signatures and verify the signatures you
need key rotation you need secure
connections HTTP is not an option
anymore and no hard coded secrets who
thought that this will be acceptable
against I don't know privacy I have the
feeling that in Germany the people are
not more technically skilled than in
other countries but it seems that people
worry more about privacy we are not -
we're not too keen on credit cards we
like cash and it seems that every time
you know especially in that IT well
something comes up people and Jeremy
worry about this and I do understand
because we have those products
this is a Barbie doll that can record
the voices of the of kids playing
obviously the Amazon echo I tried really
hard to see when it's actually sending
stuff to the intent and when it does not
but still I can understand that people
are doubtful about this the Samsung TV
that that God got in the news as well
because it was collecting and recording
stuff it wasn't supposed to do and you
might not know this on the lower right
side this is an ODB Donnell it's
something you put in the diagnosis part
of your car and that was not working on
that one but it looked very similar we
were building this and the first used
case we did if you put this in your car
and the car runs into a wall the call
center gets notified and will try to
call you and if you don't if you if you
don't take the call then it will take
the latest GPS location and send an
ambulance to it good right second use
case it will collect the driving
behavior and if you're willing to take
the telemetry insurance tariff for the
car then it will match actually the
speeding is the speed you are going
together with the speed that is allowed
on that road and then you might get a
good deal or a bad deal for an insurance
and after like 10 years from now I won't
be able to get an insurance without this
right there's one formula for privacy
and it's very simple it there's only two
components so if you want to secure the
privacy of your clients you just have to
worry about two things ready
transparency make it transparent what
data your things are collecting make it
transparent what these are useful this
is from our website don't worry about
what's actually standing there but say
it in real words people can read and
understand not just in this long fine
print right because then people will
know what this is doing and if you do
I'm assuming we don't have any blackhat
people here I'm assuming if you want to
just you know make a good product why
not tell people about it
why not tell I'm actually I'm actually
record
the coffee's you brute and you get bonus
points for it oh by the way we use this
for marketing research what coffee is
the most favorite one that's okay if
people know about it
second thing control if people know what
you are doing with the data what you are
collecting and if you give them the
option to disagree
this is privacy I don't want the bonus
points for my machine ok we're doing
marketing right people disagree that's
fine if you do those two you don't have
to worry about any data privacy lawyer
at all I guess we win but this principle
for the coffee machine we went to a data
privacy Laura I explained her everything
she was like yeah sounds good
so it was not all for this specific use
case we have a double opt-in on the
second page of the privacy policy that
this is stupid right I don't understand
this I don't want this I mean one more
thing um baton spasm kite for the
non-germans because in the room spasm
kite means to be not wasteful to be
careful
and not in spasm kite is awfully to be
not wasteful and very careful with data
because I mean take as much data as you
need for making a good business and for
making a good user experience but not
more if the marketing person comes to
you let's collect all the data and store
it in the big data like somebody will
come at some point and analyze it just
say no if you can't tell me what it's
useful I want is we all have the
privilege to do this I'm already done so
we recovered all those topics very
briefly to be fair but I hope I gave you
a good insert like what are important
factors for building a successful smart
ecosystem and how to approach IOT I wish
more of them would have been technical
but this is how it is thank you
thank you Michael
I have a couple of questions here um one
of them when you do a fake device on the
Raspberry Pi does it actually run the
real device operating system
no is that being fake - not a good
question it's fake it's it's literally
just in the interaction between the fake
device and and the rest of the system
needs to be the real one yes you are
missing out a lot of things you're
missing out special problems you might
have to with the operating system but
then I guess you just have to write more
contract tests and yes it doesn't solve
the problem completely it just gives you
puts you in a position where you are
able to at least do some end-to-end
testing as I pointed out it's no silver
bullet it's just a good approach to
tackle some of the things good question
okay here's another one you talked about
we want to make the company's IOT
platform the platform yes all cloud or
service providers provide the platform
aja Amazon IBM these platforms work I
look at a lot of them and I haven't
looked at all of them all the time so I
don't really know how they evolve but
most of them let's say the marketing
department was a bit faster than a
technical department and I've seen so on
honestly Amazon IOT works I could get
something running within 30 minutes
there's a company from Berlin here
R'lyeh also within 30 minutes I was able
to get something running if I looked at
eclipse home I looked at it for 30
minutes and had no clue what they are
saying so I guess I think it's worth
checking you don't have to rebuild
everything I said I would always go for
the smaller approach I would rather look
at the MQTT frameworks and maybe at the
queueing systems that are there and and
plumbed together whatever something
small I need rather than go for the full
platform because if you do some
something small in the beginning in my
paper just to jump on
but for more you're sure that you don't
need it I have answered the question
that's a good answer
here's one I need to read because
there's so many words in it um is there
an open standard other open standards
for communication and interaction
between layers or across domains that
will facilitate the broader cross domain
smart ecosystem no good question
from device to cloud or from deform
device to back-end if you don't have
something in between I guess most common
are AMQP mqtt and HTTP that's the
protocol to this data regarding than on
a deeper level on the domain level the
formats for specific domains I think a
lot of consortiums are trying hard I
have not seen something in real life
that really is a standard and I guess
from from from back into service to an
app most of the time speak HTTP within
the devices lots of systems hub systems
have done something that exactly others
speak directly at GDP school I have a
very specific specific question the last
one do you prefer Nokia's for IOT so the
last part of our song was actually an
IOT blockchain project and it's not just
going to gather buzzwords the blockchain
world seems to be note world right now
so I like that for faking components are
like nodejs because it's just fast to
build this it's it's not a complex
software and if you get something
running fast I actually like note for
this back-end systems that are growing
that get complex and you want to build
them with multiple people I still think
Java is a good idea cool
thank you Michael you had some very
interesting points here
