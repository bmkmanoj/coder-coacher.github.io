apologize my name is Chad Fowler I work
on something called wunderlist any
Wunderlist users by chance very cool so
I'm working right now on wonderless 3
which will be released I think last
March yes that's a joke it's not done
yet but it's almost done i have it on my
phone i'll show it to if you want to see
it it's really good we're building a
whole new infrastructure we're doing
kind of a big rewrite when i went to
work at Wunderlist some of my friends
asked me why are you going to work on a
to-do list isn't that just like the
hello world of applications at this
point and it is if you google for build
a to-do list application or any sort of
variation of that phrase you're going to
find so many different examples of how
to do it it is kind of the thing that
everybody understands the best right
very easy you start out and you think
well this is just like there's a list
and there are tasks in it and that's it
you can check them off you can put them
in an order probably simple right yes
it's very simple if you stop there the
reason that building up to to-do list is
hard and the reason that it's worth
listening to me talk about it I hope are
three major things sink meaning you have
to actually synchronize changes between
probably a server and definitely some
device or multiple devices scale we have
millions of users that are active daily
and monthly so when you just have a to
do list it's one thing on your computer
when you have to have one that
synchronizes and works for millions of
active users then it's a completely
different matter and then finally a
requirement that we have that we're
putting into wonderless three is that
changes appear in real time across all
devices 4shared lists so in the case of
wunderlist we have the need to
synchronize at high scale real time with
multiple clients and multiple users
potentially each with multiple clients
those users also share with each other
so we have little universes of data that
we have to deal with what we have
effectively built as I say in the type
love this talk is a high-volume
multimaster cross-platform distributed
database system that runs on mobile
devices web browsers and client desktop
operating systems natively that sounds
kind of buzz worthy obviously and it's
meant to but it also represents the
reality of the system it really is a
multi master replicating database system
that has to work on an iPhone Android
iPad web browser etc etc etc it's a
really hard problem even though the end
result is just a to-do list as people
like to say so sync first let's just
talk about what wonderless is so you can
see this is this is a screenshot of
wonderless 3 on my computer it's lists
its tasks lists have positions tasks
have positions tasks have attributes you
can complete them you can assign them to
people you can star them you can write
notes about them they can have sub tasks
etc you can even comment and do files so
we have a bunch of different entities in
the system every time we add now a new
feature we create new entities that also
need to synchronize so you can think of
this as a tree and I'll show you that
tree in a future slide here you can
think of it as a tree of data where you
have a user who has list that has tasks
that has stuff in the tasks right so if
you were going to build a sync system
for one user who only has one device I
mean it could be many users but each
user would just log in and have their
own little universe kind of like the way
Apple's iCloud stuff works it's pretty
easy to implement they have to do at a
massive scale but you could just imagine
doing like the simplest most idiotic
thing that could possibly work that's
what wunderlist one was in fact you have
an application you have a rest api and
you have a database that's it you put
stuff into the REST API you get all the
stuff back out when it changes so
there's no need to really even worry
about synchronization it's very easy
that's why building a to-do list is such
a simple thing I create all my tax I
push them to the server whenever I log
back in I get all the tasks and lists
from the server and I'm set kind of
works until you start sharing so even
when you're sharing with one user having
multiple devices it turns into a pain
for one probably the data gets a little
harder to deal with second you may end
up having changes that conflict between
the two devices so that's when it starts
getting a little bit more difficult so
the first thing like you have too much
data how do you deal with just getting
the parts that have changed well the
naive typical approach that you would go
for first is probably some kind of time
stamp right now you would not use a
client time stamp because we're all too
smart for that you would never trust the
time stamp on the client because you
know your phone or your computer can
have a different time than a server
obviously things are not in sync the
problem is servers are also not in sync
so you just can't use a time stamp at
all times are not trustworthy in any way
so now you have Milt millions of users
with multiple devices all pushing stuff
at high volume well you have to do stuff
like replicate data to separate
databases this is where the time stamp
thing becomes a serious issue even if
you have one server you're using as the
time stamp server there's just no way to
solve this you can't do it so some of
the possible solutions of solving the
sink are there are all sorts of
well-known things even back from like
the 80s and the 70s Leslie Lamport wrote
a whole bunch of great papers on this
google has two you can you can look at
the implementation of react I spent my
time in the 90s doing a lot of stuff
with ldap and ldap has a really good
replication solution so we looked at all
these different ideas we looked up
operational transformation from the
google wave project but we wanted to
keep things simple and we are developers
and the main thing we were dealing with
is how we keep data in sync and how we
know which version is the latest and how
we know that our local changes won't
overwrite things on the server and as
we're we can't working every day there's
a system that we use that helps us
understand that already does this for us
right get so what we have built is
something based on the idea of get and I
actually have the plan at some point in
the future to build an actual
get based back into Wunderlist because
it is the same thing so you have in get
the important thing you have to know is
that you have revisions and the
revisions are in a tree so every change
branches off of another change and if
you try to push a change to another
repository which usually is a server but
doesn't have to be because it's multi
master and peer-to-peer if you don't
have the local change it's rejected and
you have to pull what's there and then
merge locally so that's the approach
that we took and it actually works
really really well now we did it and we
we did it in a way that required us to
create those version numbers and a like
across multiple different servers so
we're using atomic updates in sequel and
I'll show you how that works in a moment
the second problem is scale wunderlist
to polling we had millions of hungry
clients just polling via rest this kind
of sounds like a good idea but obviously
it doesn't work it's very expensive we
kept going down etc so we looked at our
existing infrastructure and we had four
problems we had a monolithic application
a monolithic database most of us have
had that in the past it's an
anti-pattern we all grow into it for
some reason we implemented caching
because things were slow guess what
everything got slower but also buggy we
did our own auto sharding solution
because we were smart but auto sharding
is a really bad idea just like automated
failover and multi-master replication
usually is and basically everything we
tried to do that was smart was wrong and
and actually made a slower and less
available so our mantra now is keep
things simple and not just simple but
stupid we like to use the word stupid or
they were dumb to describe the things we
do and we celebrate that just make your
client dumb make your server dumb make
every piece of code dumb that you can
and then take that dumb thing that every
single human being on the team could
understand and optimize it when it's
slow only when it's slow solve only
simple problems because we're building
just a to-do list come on it's got to be
simple right so if you find yourself
solving a difficult
them make it a simple problem defer the
hard part till the next step it's just
like TDD I don't know if you've
experienced this yourselves but when you
do TDD right every single step is easy
and you just keep pushing the complexity
away finally you get to the end there's
nothing left so that's the way we've
solved this performance issue with
Wunderlist small is simple so another
mantra is everything must be small tiny
applications tiny services microservices
tiny data where possible the micro
services wrap the data and then tiny
traffic where we can get it so one step
to doing this tiny traffic thing the
light went off what does it mean three
minutes okay it's not flashing a minha
is to keep all of our changes small so
we did two things one is we implemented
a push model for all of our data and the
other is we actually visualized our data
as a tree and it's kind of like the way
Russian doll caching works if you've
heard of that but if you think of the
data as a tree you have a root you have
a user a user has lists the lists have
tasks the tasks have sub tasks etc if a
subtask changes it can notify its parent
task which can notify its parent list
which can notify its user etc so
whenever you need to see do I have
anything new all you have to do is say
has anything changed in the universe and
for that we hit this thing called root
which is a tiny tiny because tiny is
good Pascrell application which
outperforms anything else that we have
and most of the time the answer is no
because people are mostly reading and
not writing the next step in the final
step to making our our scale small is
real time push and so this is what our
architecture looks like i won't go into
too much detail but now all of the
clients connect to these lightweight
WebSocket servers and then they just sit
there so most of the time they don't
have to do anything they only do
something when they're pushed a message
and we have now comprised our
architecture over a bunch of tiny little
services everything is asynchronous in
the background pushing stuff to clients
when they need them and as you can see
they're written
languages we no longer have a monolith
we've broken our databases up into a
bunch of tiny ones instead of doing
crazy art of auto sharding we just do it
vertically final slide we chose the play
from framework for that front end thing
it's written in Scala and the reason is
if you look at the web socket framework
for play everything is is non blocking
an asynchronous by default and this is
literally all you have to type to set up
a highly available after based web
socket solution in play it's really nice
I think I am out of time I will gladly
talk and answer questions on a break and
thank you very much for listening
