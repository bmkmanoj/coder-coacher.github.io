Berlin I was at the go-to conference in
Copenhagen back in 2015 and I think
that's where I met some of the
organizers for the Berlin conference so
I definitely wanted to come back and
visit your beautiful city I have one day
here as I hope I can see all the sights
in terms of my background my background
is all aerospace engineering I have my
BS my MSM a PhD in aerospace engineering
which is also code for rocket science so
my PhD is actually in the development
and propulsion systems for deep space
exploration and sort of propulsion
systems to slow you down in the opposite
direction that I'll talk about a little
bit today but several years ago I had
the great opportunity to work on the
Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover
mission by a show of hands and if you
have familiar with it a good some of you
are so we we did land in August of 2012
and I was able to work on the mission
from roughly 2006 to 2012 my background
has been exclusively in the development
of spacecraft technologies for
propulsion purposes and for entry
descent and landing a different
planetary atmospheres purposes I'm also
a research professor at the University
of Southern California where I teach
spacecraft design to undergraduate
students and very recently only a few
weeks ago I actually took on a new role
as senior vice president at Hyperloop
one which is a new mode of
transportation which is actually like
transportation on the ground so you'll
probably see me speaking about that a
lot more in the coming years and in my
new role but the purpose of my talk
today is to talk to you about the basis
for Mars exploration and where we're
going as a society where we're going as
a planet and hopefully will become
Martians ourselves in the coming years
so first what I would like to show you
is a video that we created in advance of
the curiosity landing called seven
minutes of Terror
it did go viral on YouTube and I think
you'll see why and the reason why it's
called seven minutes of Terror is it
takes seven minutes to get from the top
of the atmosphere of Mars down to the
surface and our job is to land safely on
the surface of the planet
when people look at it it looks crazy
that's a very natural thing sometimes
when we look at it it looks crazy it is
the result of reasoned engineering
thought but it still looks crazy the top
of the atmosphere down to the surface
it takes a seven minutes it takes 14
minutes or so for the signal from the
spacecraft to make it to earth that's
how far Mars is away from us so when we
first get word that we've touched the
top of the atmosphere
the vehicle has been a lie
you're dead on the surface for at least
seven
entry descent landing also known as EDL
is referred to as a seven minutes of
Terror because we've got literally seven
minutes to get from the top the
atmosphere to the surface of Mars going
from 13,000 miles an hour to zero in
perfect sequence perfect choreography
perfect timing and the computer has to
do it all by itself with no help from
the ground if any one thing doesn't work
just right it's game over we slam into
the atmosphere and develop so much
aromatic drag power heat shield it heats
up and it glows like the surface of the
south
1600 degrees during entry the vehicles
not already slowing down violently
through the atmosphere but also we are
guiding like an airplane to be able to
land in a very narrow constrained space
this is one of the biggest challenges
that we're facing and one that we have
never attempted on Mars Mars is actually
really hard to slow down because it has
just enough atmosphere that you have to
deal with it otherwise it will destroy
your spacecraft on the other hand it
doesn't have enough atmosphere to finish
the job we're still going about a
thousand miles an hour so at that point
we use a parachute
the parachute is the largest and
strongest supersonic parachute that
we've ever built to date it has to be
able to withstand 65,000 pounds of force
even though the parachute itself only
weighs about 100 pounds when opens up
that fast it's a neck snapping 9 G's at
that point we have to get that heat
shield off it's like a big lens cap
blocking our view of the ground to the
radar the radar has to take just the
right altitude and velocity measurements
at just the right time or the rest of
the landing sequence won't work this big
huge parachute that we've got will only
slow us down to about 200 miles now
it's not slowing up the land so we have
no choice but we gotta cut it off and
then come down and walk this one could
turn those rocket motors off you don't
do something weird you're gonna smack
right back into the pair of feet
so the first thing we do is make this
really radical divert can either fly off
to the side diverting away from the
parachute killing our horizontal
velocity and our vertical velocity
getting you over moving straight up and
down so if you look at the surface with
his radar and see where the boil and
then head straight down to the bottom of
the crater right beside six kilometer
high note
we can't get those rocket engines to
post again because if you were to
descend compulsively for their engines
all the way to the ground we would
essentially create this massive dust
cloud that dust clouds have been go and
land on the rover if the damage
mechanisms a tappa damage instrument so
today we solve that problem is by using
the sky created twenty meters above the
surface we have to lower the rover below
us that's heaven that's 21 people
and then gently deposited on its be
palmistry
as the rover touches down and is now on
the ground the descent state it's in a
collision course with a robot we must
cut the bridle immediately and fight in
the same stage away to a safe distance
on the road
so as I think you all know that was
successfully accomplished in August 5th
of 2012 and of course I worked on it so
I'm a bit biased it was a very
impressive engineering feat and a very
impressive engineering challenge in
pretty much all disciplines of
engineering and in the fields of
autonomy as that entire sequence
actually happens autonomously without a
human being in the loop but just to take
a step back from the description of that
mission specifically I wanted to talk
about why are we so interested in
exploring Mars and one of the best ways
that we can describe that is by thinking
of the larger context of our solar
system and so in our solar system there
are three planets which are known as the
terrestrial planets and those are Venus
which is one planet in from Earth earth
and Mars and the reason why the planets
are grouped this way is that we believe
that at the beginning of the formation
of our solar system Earth Venus and Mars
were very similar to each other but now
you can see with Venus on the Left Venus
has a surface temperature of 400 the 70
degrees centigrade which is the
temperature setting for your oven if you
want to make it clean itself it has an
atmospheric pressure 100 times what it
is on the surface of Earth and an
atmosphere which is entirely co2 and up
in the clouds is made of sulfuric acid
in comparison Mars the planet on the
right is a world which has a very very
thin atmosphere it has about one percent
of the surface density as compared to
earth also made primarily of co2 and no
appreciable water on the surface so how
is it that these two planets evolved so
differently from Earth and what is it
about Earth which were no it's not going
to go the same way and I think one of
the greatest challenges that we have as
a society right now is to prevent
climate change and do something to slow
it down and hopefully reverse it because
Venus is an example of a planet which
has experienced a runaway greenhouse gas
effect and all the oceans on the surface
of Venus boiled and are now in the upper
atmosphere which creates at incredibly
high temperature and high pressure and
Mars on the other end had a different
fate where we can now no longer live on
the surface of Mars without bringing our
own life-support equipment with us so
one of the reasons why we explore space
is actually to understand our own planet
and how its evolved the second reason
why we explore space is for the more fun
exciting reason of could we one day live
on the surface of another world
and this table on the right gives you a
comparison of some of the properties
between Mars and Earth
so because Mars is smaller than Earth
the gravitational acceleration is about
one-third which means that you would
weigh one-third on Mars as you do on
earth so that's not good for our human
bodies but compared to being in the
microgravity environment on Space
Station for example it's actually a lot
better to have that gravitational vector
it allows us to grow tall it allows us
to grow strong it allows us to actually
grow plants for food to eat so I know a
lot about space station my last project
into them for about five years
similarly on Mars the temperature is
quite low so it is very very cold at
minus 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the
worst case winter time during the
evening in the polar regions but during
the summer time on Mars in the
equatorial regions during the middle of
the day it can actually approach a
temperature which is reasonable so from
a bringing your resources with you
perspective Mars is not that difficult
of a place for us to be able to survive
you can think of it as the Antarctic the
real problem of course with Mars is that
the environment is not something that we
can breathe it's made of purely co2 and
the surface density is only 1% what it
hear us on earth which means that we
would have to bring our own oxygen
supply so that we can make air so that's
the biggest challenge
and then also radiation the radiation
environment on Mars is obviously much
more harsh than the radiation
environment on earth by a show of hands
who here has seen the movie the Martian
okay so you're big fans of science
fiction then like me so we'll talk a
little bit more about that at the end of
the talk in terms of where we're headed
but one of the reasons why I am so
interested in Mars exploration and
exploration of our solar system in
general is to understand from a
planetary science perspective how the
planets evolved and so on Mars you can
see in the upper left here is a mountain
called olympus mons it's three times the
height of Mount Everest and it was an
active volcano but now it's stopped so
think of the volcanic activity that
created something so large in an
environment so far away the image on the
bottom here Valles Marineris is
basically Mars's version of the Grand
Canyon but it's about six times as deep
as the Grand Canyon and we all know what
created the vent Grand Canyon here on
earth which was water flowing on the
surface so we do believe
that there were appreciable water flows
on the surface of Mars but now they're
gone as well as most of the atmosphere
so what happened one of the theories of
what happened is that Mars does have a
residual magnetic field which means at
some point in its past it had a much
stronger magnetic field it had a molten
core and it was rotating creating this
effect called a dynamo which we have
here on earth and that magnetic field
around Earth actually protects us from
in space radiation it actually protects
our atmosphere from being stripped away
by the radiation that comes from deep
space so what we believed was that many
many years ago probably four billion
years ago there was some kind of impact
between the asteroid obody and Mars
which then shattered the core disrupted
the magnetic field and then resulted in
the atmosphere being ripped away and the
water therefore being boiled off of the
surface because of the low pressure
environment so we don't know if this is
what's happened but this is our
hypothesis and we send spacecraft to the
surface of Mars and we send spacecraft
to orbit Mars to make scientific
measurements to test these hypotheses so
we understand the evolution of the
planets so by a show of hands who thinks
that Mars has moons it does it has two
moons it has a moon called Phobos and a
moon called damos and you can see
they're quite small only 20 kilometers
diameter for the 112 kilometers in
diameter for the right and so because
they're so small they actually can
maintain their weird potato shape
looking body structure because they
don't compress over their own
gravitational influence and they don't
experience differentiation like a planet
does but what we believe is that these
are captured asteroid --all objects--
that got captured and Mars's gravity
well but the reason why these are so
interesting to us now is that we could
conceivably use these as natural
satellites if we were to set up a human
colony on Mars both to mine minerals
from the surface to mine water from
these bodies as well as to set up
literally a communications
infrastructure on these satellites so
that we can easily communicate between
the surface of Mars and back to earth by
having satellite relays on these bodies
in addition to mining depots on these
bodies so for the future human
expeditions to Mars or setting up a
future human colony there we need to use
the resources which are already
available to us because that solves the
energy problem of having sit
things over a really long distance so by
a show of hands who thinks we found
water on Mars so you guys have been
doing your homework so we actually have
and so what this picture is on the upper
right is taken by a spacecraft called
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter which
has been in orbit around Mars for over
10 years taking incredibly
high-resolution images of the surface
which gives us all the beautiful data
that I show today from a top-down view
and also gives us interesting
reconnaissance information so we can
figure out where do we want to land on
the surface of Mars when we send
missions to land on the surface the
picture on the bottom here is actually a
view underneath the Phoenix lander which
was taken I think in 2006 timeframe and
the little white patch that you see
we've actually confirmed is salt water
ice that exists in the polar regions on
Mars so this is so important because if
we know that there's really there's
water available to us pretty close to
the surface if we do send people to Mars
in the future they could access that
water and use it for washing their
clothes for take for bathing as well as
for growing plants in pressurized
environments so we know that hidden
beneath the surface on Mars is evidence
of its poorer or past habitability over
time so by a show of hands who thinks
that there's flowing water on Mars so
this is a less known finding but there
actually is it's in the form of mud so
sort of a wet mud and so what you can
see on this picture in the lower left is
streaks coming down the cliff faces on
Mars and we believe that these are
actually wet mud water flows and the
reason why this happens is because the
planet is tilted on its axis which means
that if there was frozen water in the
subsurface as as mars goes around the
Sun it melts or it sort of like heats up
and as a result the frozen water can
seep out at the side depending upon the
season and the weather it's in the
northern the southern hemisphere of the
planets and so once again it means that
there is water in the subsurface and
where there's water there can sometimes
be life and so one of our future
missions we would actually like to land
in one of these places where we know
there are these active water flows to be
able to sample them and see what's
actually in it and why this is important
is that this data was actually
determined
a student back in I think it was
September of 2015 who took a look at
this image data was coming from the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter and did an
analysis to actually determine that this
was water coming out using another
instrument called a spectroscopy
instrument to confirm that so part of
the data which is collected by all these
missions whether they're NASA missions
ISA missions JAXA missions is that that
data is available open source for people
to analyze whether they're students or
even private citizen scientists so
that's kind of exciting we're inherently
all the science data which is collected
you can view it as open source but from
a science perspective so how many times
have we landed on Mars we've landed a
total of seven times successfully on
Mars they were all done by the u.s.
space program NASA the first one was the
Viking landers in the late 1970s that
was a long time ago you can imagine the
state of computer technology back then
as well as the knowledge of the
planetary atmosphere back then 20 years
later or so we landed the Pathfinder
Sojourner Rover which was a very small
Rover we developed a whole new set of
technologies there was about a gap of 20
years between the first and the second
landing we had two more successful
landings in the early 2000s with Spirit
and Opportunity rover using a different
set of technologies enabling us to bring
more mass to the surface and then we did
it again in Phoenix in 2004 with a
single platform and then we did it again
in August of 2012 for the Curiosity
rover and the next two missions that we
have coming up are the insight mission
in 2018 just around the corner
which is actually going to measure
whether or not there are still active
seismic activity on the planet looking
for Mars quakes to get a better
understanding of whether or not we still
have a geologically active planet and
then Mars 2020 which is basically doing
the Mars Science Laboratory mission
again but this time collecting a sample
to cache it for a future mission which
will pick it up and send the sample back
to earth and we can talk about more more
in the Q&amp;amp;A section but over the course
of these different missions we've
developed new technologies which have
enabled us to land more accurately and
land more equipment on the surface of
the planet which allows us to do more
science and it also gives us the
building blocks or the stepping stones
to facilitate sending people to the
planet in the decades ahead and these
images that you see here are images
taken by these landed platforms on the
surface of the planet and so I always
find them very beautiful but also kind
of eerie but they look very similar to
Earth which means that our plants really
aren't that dissimilar to each other
so the reason why this is important
though is that we learn from the past
and then we build from that on the
future and so one of the analogies I
would give you here for the software
conference is the agile design
methodology so we're not able to use
agile design methodology for a given
mission and and because it's totally new
and you can't afford to have a mistake
it has to work the first time but we can
use it in sort of a historical sense
where we build from the prior missions
use the things that we demonstrated and
then implement it on the next mission
I'll talk about that a little bit later
how we use the Curiosity missions
technology demonstrations to build on
the future mission which is the Mars
2020 mission coming up but what you can
see here is the evolution in the
capability of the roving technology that
we have sent to the surface of the
planet on the lower left we have
something which is sort of like a small
toy truck sized version which used solar
power on the left hand side is the
Explorer 8 Mars exploration Rovers
Spirit and Opportunity which are about
the size of a lawn mower also using
solar panels and then you can see how
much larger the Curiosity rover is with
its large wheelbase and about a mass on
the order of the mass of a small car
like a Mini Cooper type of car and the
reason why we grow the Rovers is because
if you were going to go out into the
desert or into the mountains you
probably would want to be in something
like a four-wheel drive right if you're
off-road so the larger your wheelbase
the more difficult terrain you can cross
over and then more equipment you can
carry on your back so we can do more
science as we develop and build larger
Rovers and so this particular
achievement was won from an entry
descent and landing spective as we have
to land something which is much larger
on the surface of the planet and I'll
talk about that in more detail as well
but the purpose of the Mars Science
Laboratory mission is to determine
whether or not Mars once supported life
in the past and could it still support
life today it turns out it's very
difficult to make scientific
measurements to find active life because
you have to understand what makes it
tick you have to basically feed it and
make it grow and that requires a really
long period of time and a set of
technologies from a science instrument
perspective that haven't been
yet developed but what we can do is
assess past or present habitability and
we look at that by looking at the rocks
the geology the geochemistry and the
role of water and the formation of these
substances and also we take a look at
what the surface radiation environment
is so the biggest challenge to sending
people to the surface of Mars is dealing
with the radiation environment because
our bodies are not designed to withstand
high radiation well it cancer will die
that kind of thing so we have to develop
technologies to shield ourselves from
the radiation environment well we can
only do that if we know what the
radiation environment is and then we can
develop the shielding necessary to
mitigate the value that that is so that
we can protect ourselves as people and
also organisms in general organic life
which is hydrocarbon based organisms
also cannot withstand significant
amounts of radiation with the exception
of tardigrades if you've ever heard of
this before which are little things that
live in the water so the next question
though becomes from a science
perspective is that where do we want to
go on the surface of Mars so the picture
that you see on the upper left here is
sort of a Mercator projection map on the
surface of Mars and the science
community asked us the engineering team
can you land us in a place called Gale
Crater that you can see on the lower
right here and the reason why they
wanted us to land them there is because
they believed from surface top-down
images for the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter that this was the site of an
ancient water body either a river or a
lake bed billions of years ago
so we're best to look for the evidence
of past life than in the sedimentary
rock layers of an ancient water body and
so that was our challenge the
engineering team to be able to have a
system which could land something around
a thousand kilograms to the surface in a
place called Gale Crater and I'll tell
you a little more about Gale Crater but
just for reference the Mars exploration
rover landed in Meridiani and curiosity
landed in Gale Crater so they're very
far apart from each other so sadly the
Rovers will never be able to drive to
meet each other like Mark Watney did but
that will require but better driving
technologies in future but just a better
view of Gale Crater Gale Crater has in
its center a mountain called Mount sharp
which is six kilometers high so I went
and checked last night this is about 50%
taller the
pizzo Bernina which I guess is the
largest mountain range in the eastern
Alps so you can get an idea of how big
this region is by comparing it to you
know local features in the eastern alps
six kilometers high the mountain in the
middle and then there's a valley and
then there's crater walls on the side so
from a landing accuracy perspective we
have to be able to land in an ellipse
which was roughly 20 kilometers long by
12 kilometers or 7 kilometers in
diameter so when you look at this from a
bull's-eye perspective that defines your
accuracy and also understand the
distance between Earth and Mars is 400
million kilometers which means you have
to go from over a distance of 400
million kilometers you have to land with
an accuracy of 20 kilometers that's
pretty difficult if you think about it
and in terms of understanding how our
technologies have evolved over time in
the 1970s we kind of had more of a
slingshot approach sending the Viking
Rovers there they had a landing lips of
you know almost two hundred miles in
diameter which I guess is what three
hundred kilometers in diameter and so
over time we've improved our landing
accuracy using basically turning these
things into airplanes so they can fly
themselves to a more precise location
just something with a landing ellipse
diameter of about twelve by four miles
so that's about twenty like seven
kilometers and so that was the challenge
for the entry descent landing team for
curiosity was to shrink down the landing
lips creating a more precise system to
get the scientists exactly where they
wanted to go because if we didn't do
that we would either smack into Gale
Crater and crash or smack into the sides
of the crater wall and crash and that
would have been mission over no science
information collected but just for
reference the distance that we're
talking about here is from four hundred
million kilometers away we would have to
land in a distance which is between the
Berlin International Airport and I guess
on the southeastern section of Berlin so
even though that might seem like a large
distance here if you think about the
distance over which you have to do that
dart throw it's incredibly challenging
you know it's basically less than a
needle in a haystack so I want to talk a
little bit about how the landing system
actually operates because I think people
usually find this interesting
so what we use is the principle of
aerodynamic drag which is when something
is coming at a really fast speed you
slow down when it hit the atmosphere
should we start from around 20,000
kilometres an hour we go down to around
1,000 kilometres an hour and we deploy a
very large parachute which is probably
about one and a half times the size of
this room that slows us down also due to
aerodynamic drag to around we know 300
km/h at that point we've reached
terminal velocity we can't go any slower
so we have to take out the rest of our
energy using retro rockets which is
basically firing rocket engines towards
the ground to slow yourself down it's
momentum transfer we do this until we
get to around 20 meters above the
surface which is probably you know two
times the height of this room and then
the rover starts to get lowered on the
tether tether when it's fully extended
is seven meters in length and the reason
why we do this is because now the rover
is the actual landing platform it allows
us to put all of the mass that we want
into our scientific platform versus
having airbags like we had used in Prior
missions and so that device that you see
there which is called the sky crane is
basically a mini spacecraft or a mini
airplane flying the thing towards the
ground but slowing it down at the same
time and then the rover has safely
landed on the surface of the planet so
by using the concepts of aerodynamic
drag by using the concept of aerodynamic
lift basically by rotating the
orientation of that weird-looking Bowl
shape we can actually fly it down very
precisely to a location that we want on
the surface of the planet which gives us
that 20 kilometer landing ellipse and we
had never done that before because we
had never made the entry vehicle Bowl
shape and airplane before we had never
done that and that's the reason why we
were able to land this more successfully
on the surface of this planet so this is
a view of the thing that we call the
Aero shell the Aero shell contains the
rover and it has the strange shape that
it has because it actually is intended
to generate aerodynamic drag and for
those of you who don't know what that is
if you're going down the motorway you
put your arm out the window you feel the
force on your arm that's aerodynamic
drag so we're using the atmosphere to
actually take out our energy so it's
really smart right it's a green way of
slowing yourself down versus doing it
all Retro propulsively but at the same
time as you're going in it really fast
speeds you start
at 20,000 km/h when you rub your hands
together an ad you know how to get warm
with friction think about that but you
get up to 5,000 degrees centigrade so in
the very front of that vehicle we have
something called a heat shield that heat
shield basically burns up as it burns up
it takes all the energy way with it and
it protects the rover inside of the rest
of the vehicle from getting hot so on
the surface of that heat shield you have
a maximum temperature of five thousand
degrees centigrade on the interior of
the heat shield where the rover is you
have a temperature of room temperature
that's the differential which is enabled
by using the heat shield technology and
then the other thing to realize that
even though it doesn't look like an
airplane it actually has an angle of
attack it has a slight lift-to-drag
ratio and that allows it to generate a
lift vector which if you modulate that
lift vector you can actually fly it more
precisely so that's why I give it an
allergy of a bird and so that is how we
landed the thing precisely but all of
this was done autonomously with software
in the loop with a guidance navigation
and control system because of the time
delay between Earth and Mars is so long
that you can't have a human being with a
joystick flying this down to the surface
it has to be done on board using its own
guidance navigation and control system
which is where officee software comes
into the picture so this is another way
of viewing the entry descent and landing
architecture you start off with 100% of
your energy 20,000 km/h you sell
yourself down to around 1500 km/h at
that point you've gone through peak
decelerations which is around 10 g's
you've gone through this peak heating
environment you then deploy a parachute
that parachute slows you down to around
300 km/h you then drop the parachute cuz
it's no longer doing anything for you
you take off the rest of your energy on
retrorockets you're coming in at 20,000
kilometres per hour and you're landing
at around 2 km/h so that is the whole
challenge of the entry descent landing
system and all of this happens in less
than seven minutes and so my role on the
mission was the development at the
supersonic parachute system because I
have a background in aerodynamics and
computational fluid dynamics and so I
won't go through that in great detail
just because that's more of an
engineering presentation but that was my
role in the mission it was a lot of fun
to work on but this is where I wanted to
bring in the waterfall versus agile
analogy overall the full Mars Science
Laboratory mission
does follow the waterfall design
approach but the individual elements
whether it be the heat shield the
parachute the engines or the sky crane
that actually does follow more the agile
methodology where you do a prototype you
test it you then make it better you test
it again and then you finally fabricate
your final one which goes and lands on
Mars on landing day now the reason why
Mars is a more difficult engineering
problem is that there is no way that you
can actually do this end-to-end sequence
here on earth because the properties are
so different the gravity is different
the atmospheric properties are different
in terms of composition in terms of
density so the very first time we test
all these technologies together is
actually when we land it on Mars and so
that's the tremendous engineering
challenge of what we do here is that we
have to use this out Angella methodology
to qualify the individual elements and
then piece them together using a Monte
Carlo simulation to make sure we have
the margins and the design that we need
and then we go off and test it for our
very first time on landing day and of
course we have tremendous engineering
knowledge that went in advance of that
which gives us a very high probability
of success which I'll show you at the
very end of the talk but I'll show you
one video of parachute testing because I
think this is fun so this is where our
first test was not successful but our
subsequent testing was we've redesigned
the system so that it survived and so we
do our testing out in the desert at
around 3:00 about a thousand meters in
altitude and so this parachute is
enormous right it's about one and a half
times the size of this room so it gives
you a picture of how big that is if not
larger and so we use this to
structurally qualify the design we do
computational fluid dynamic simulations
to determine what kind of load it with C
on Mars and then we design a test here
on earth which will demonstrate that
load in a full-scale environment and if
it doesn't work we make it stronger but
obviously our first one wasn't
successful but then we redesigned it to
make it wrong with the six second time
and so I like to show this picture
because this is important to be for all
of the women in the audience and all the
men in the audience who have daughters
and sisters and things like that is that
engineering typically has been a
male-dominated field things are getting
better you know we're probably on the
order of you know 25 to 30 percent
females now when it comes to aerospace
mechanical engineering I think computer
science also has a relatively low male
to female ratio
but it's really important to have
diversity in the workplace and the
reason for that is because diversity of
people leads to diversity of thought
leads to amazing solutions and our team
from the overall and true descent
landing team was very diverse you could
see that in the video we had people from
Asia we had people from South America
and then we had me who's a mixture of
Indian and European but if you don't
have diversity you get this right the
matrix right you have a bunch of clones
who all do the same thing and this was a
very mean clone this particular
intention so that's not a good solution
right you want to have diversity as my
point so the future what is the future
of Mars exploration advanced power
system so we demonstrated for the first
time a radio isotope power source on the
Curiosity rover and so it's something
called a radioisotope thermoelectric
generator which takes the decay of
plutonium 238 converts that heat energy
into electricity and you have a battery
that lasts for decades upon decades and
so this type of system gives you a
constant power source it's not sensitive
to you know whether it's day or night
it's not sensitive to the deposition of
dust on the solar panels
it'll keep you going for a really long
time so these kinds of systems are the
ones that we want to develop for future
human landed things that they have power
which is always there for the
emergencies in the nighttime scenario
and this gives you a nice idea as well
of how large the rover was happening a
my colleague standing there next to it
so what are some of the essentials for
going to Mars you want to have a whole
range of instruments you can make
measurements one of those things is a
weather station I'll show you some data
from the weather station in a little bit
and a lot of cameras and then a lot of
scientific instruments which allow you
to determine the chemical composition of
the rocks the soil the atmosphere as
well as the mineralogical composition of
the rocks and the soil because that will
tell you how the planet involves and so
our Rover was equipped with a suite of
really powerful scientific measurements
which it makes immediately and then it
uploads the data back to earth twice a
day and then we have scientists
analyzing it on the other side and so I
do like to show this one is that clearly
your science intrument of choice would
be a laser with if you're a Star Trek
fan photon torpedoes and although it
doesn't look this extreme it does have a
laser and that laser basically if I'm
the rover here and I'm firing my laser
into that desk it would burn a hole
the side of the desk what would burn a
hole in your t-shirt for example and the
reason for that is because you want to
create that amount of heat energy
because it vaporizes the block and when
you vaporize the rock it generates a
spectroscopic signature which allows you
to determine what it's made out of so
there's a reason why we carry laser it's
not just for shooting people that's not
a good reason so how long does it take
get to Mars so in November of 2011 we
packaged the aeroshell with a rover
inside it with a cruise stage into a
launch vehicle and it takes roughly
seven to nine months which ironically is
the gestation period between a sloth and
a human baby so from that perspective
it's not that bad for schoolchildren
they think that's the most incredible
long time ever but for us for like a
that's not so bad we could probably do
it right seven to nine months and a tuna
can next to other people that we may or
may not like I don't know it better be
your friends but one thing that I'd like
to talk about is that we were able to
use this mission to generate a
technology which we'll use in the future
Mars 2020 mission and we carried a
camera onboard the rover looking down so
what you see here is the Curiosity rover
looking down seeing the heat shield
dropping towards the surface looking
into Gale Crater
you can see how the camera image is
moving back and forth this is because
the rover is hanging onto the parachute
basically and so what you're seeing is
the rocking motion that you would see
the asila tarry motion on the parachute
but we can also see as a darkened region
here which evidence of past volcanic
activity or volcanic locks on the
surface you also see several pock marks
on the surface these are basically
little mini craters with inner crater
because the atmosphere on Mars is so
thin things can get through right from
meteorites where as they burn up here in
the atmosphere is more likely now what
you'll start to see next as the shaking
motion will stop it'll start to sweep
off to the side because now the
parachute has been cut away and it's now
on its descent rockets going towards the
surface of the planets it hasn't quite
happened yet but you'll kind of see the
divert move maneuver which I think
starts about now and so as we're
approaching the surface we're getting
video data this video data allows us to
actually to determine what our altitude
is it allows us to determine our
position relative to noon surface
features so having video images in the
loop allows something called terrain
relative navigation so that you can more
accurately get to the surface now we're
getting closer and closer the rocket
engines are fine
into the soilless you're starting to see
the dust get kicking up you can see the
rover's wheel has just come down and so
now it's basically on the sky crane
approaching towards the surface and you
can't see much now because it's
basically blocking out all the light
this was an image or a set of images
that was captured by a camera real-time
during the landing event on Mars and so
if we had used that data during the
descent we could have used it to
determine our altitude and we could have
used it to determine our position
relative to known surface features which
would have allowed us to land even more
accurately but because we don't want to
do something the very first time right
with a two billion dollar mission in
case it didn't work we demoed this
technology on this mission and now we
will baseline it for the next mission so
that's kind of the analogy I would use
for agile where it goes mission to
mission that we do that so this is what
terrain relative navigation looks like
so you're coming down the surface you're
taking these images you're processing
them and you're comparing them to known
features in the onboard computer and
then use that to actually change your
position so you modulate your thrust
vectors you can get a better precision
to where you want to go relative to your
desired landing site so that is going to
be the baseline for the next mission
which launches in 2020 but the other
thing which I think is cool is that
everybody loves images right and so the
first image that the rover was had to
send back to earth after it successfully
land on the surface was if its landing
site so you can see here this is
immediately after landing you can see
Mount sharp in the distance you can see
the shadow of the rover in front and it
looks like a transformer to be that's
kind of fun for people who like those
movies and then the other thing to
realize is that you look at the picture
on the right which is a color image of
the landing site it looks so similar to
the desert so if any of you have been
out to the desert in Nevada you'll know
how similar that actually looks to the
region just outside of Las Vegas so even
though it's another planet it's so
similar to our home planet that it's
kind of scary because it really means
that we're all interconnected and we've
got to do more to protect our own home
world otherwise if you go the way of
Mars which is no atmosphere and we can't
survive so here's a good comparison of
simulation versus reality what you see
on the image on the lower right here is
a red ellipse the white box is where we
targeted to land assuming all the
properties were nominal if the
properties were off nominal so for
example the winds were higher than
average for example the at
fear was thinner the atmosphere was
thicker the drag being produced with a
parachute was slightly higher than lower
than we thought it would be
we made a prediction using a Monte Carlo
simulation that our 99.9% probability
would fall within this landing ellipse
and we actually did land very close to
the center cuz we actually did land in
that white box so which means we did a
good job with our engineering
calculations and you can see a better
idea here of where the landing site is
which is the Green Dot relative to where
we wanted to drive to which is the base
of Mount sharp so we have to do that
driving on the scene which we've done
over the course of the past five years
so this is another really fun image we
had an ability to position the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter to put it in
orbit in such a position that it could
take a picture of the rover under the
parachute as it was descending towards
the surface and so we finally got this
picture uploaded to us around midnight
on the landing night and we all saw it
we're all really happy because we were
having a great party for having been
successful till ended but this was fun
for me right because I could see that
the parachute was fully inflated there
was no damage to it so obviously we did
a good job in designing the parachutes
so what's in the future autonomous
systems so we all know that that's
coming now with cars right cars or
hopefully will ship to our autonomous
driving Network so that we can be more
efficient reduce traffic congestion but
we've already demonstrated this for the
Curiosity rover it has cameras on board
so they can take images so they can make
the determination of what is the says's
safest way for me to drive from here to
there the rover is not going to drive
into this thing right it's gonna take a
measurement of ahead of time and say oh
I'm gonna go this way so it actually
navigates autonomously we give the
direction go and make a measurement over
there where that post is you figure out
the safest way to drive there so this is
how we are able to make something happen
so far away from us with a time delay
yet safely intelligent systems so I
would argue that the rover is
intelligent because it takes selfies
just like the stalks take selfies and so
this is actually a selfie of itself
where it has a bunch of cameras it has
an arm and so we piece together those
images so we can create this 360-degree
view but I think this is like the best
selfie ever relative to ones that we
probably take so life on Mars that this
is so apropos since I saw those pictures
before curiosity killed the cat
so hopefully you get that I am a cat
person don't worry if any of you follow
me on Twitter you'll see my cat all over
but there are no cats on Mars hopefully
one day there will be so what are we
doing we are taking scientific
measurements and so remember I told you
before there was a laser see the picture
the animated gif this is a scientific
animated gif on the upper right you see
the hole that's being generated that's
because the laser is firing into the
rock and generating making a hole it
generates a vapor that vapor is then
immediately turned into a spectroscopic
signature which tells us what the
elemental composition is of that rock so
that's how quickly we can make these
scientific so it's just like in Star
Trek where they analyze something at
Rygaard oh it's made of this listen this
we can actually do that with the
instrument on board so that is also
reality relative to the Star Trek
universe so understand in the
environment we have a weather station we
make measurements of the wind we make
measurements of the pressure the
temperature and we make measurements of
the radiation environment on the surface
and so as you can see here the
temperature goes up and down because
during the daytime obviously the
temperature goes up at nighttime their
pressure the temperature goes down we
know what's really cool you see that
same diurnal variation in the radiation
measurement what that means is the
atmospheric density on Mars when it's
higher versus lower attenuates the
surface radiation so now we know exactly
what the surface radiation on Mars is
and we probably can use sort of a high
pressure system as a means of
attenuating radiation as a radiation
shield that's one example of things that
we can do enabled by the measurements
that curiosity is made another really
important scientific finding is the
evidence of organic compounds we have
confirmed in multiple occasions now that
there is indeed methane being produced
on the surface of Mars methane has a
really short residence time which means
if you find it in the atmosphere it's
because it was recently produced like
wooden the last thing a couple of
thousand years or something like that
which is actually pretty recently you
can't say whether it was produced
yesterday or a thousand years ago but
that still or recent finding and may
thing can only have two sources high
biological source which is cool right
enteric fermentation the breakdown of
food in your gut by bacteria or a
geological source but in either of those
scenarios the fact that it's being
actively produced means that the planet
either still has some kind of seismic
activity or the planet has bacteria
right it's one of those two things which
is pretty exciting we don't know but
that's the measurement which is going to
be further facilitated by the ISA
trace gas orbiter mission that recently
got tomorrow's I think about a year ago
so what is in the future getting larger
pelo
to the surface and so even though this
is an artist conception these things are
actively being worked on so I actually
had the opportunity to work on the Orion
spacecraft for several years when I was
over at NASA JPL and so this is the next
spacecraft which is going to send and
house at people on their journey into
deeper space whether that's going to the
moon going to Mars or going to an
asteroid beyond so these are things
which are actively being developed its
space agencies around the world and so I
don't like to think of myself as a large
payload but I'm certainly larger than
the average scientific instrument and of
course this can hold about six people in
there so what is in the future
environmental control systems so on Mars
you have to be in a pressurized
environment you have to protect yourself
from radiation you have to have an air
supply and so these are systems which
are being demoed in Arctic research
stations by various different groups in
academia and the government at different
places on earth to understand how can
people live in a small space confined
space for long periods of time so what
is in the future surface mobility
another fun picture I got to take is
that we are developing these systems as
well this one in particular is being
developed at NASA Johnson Space Center
and so you would have to have a
pressurized cap that goes over it but
we're developing sort of an electric car
based ways of getting around on
difficult terrain and these things are
tested out in the desert all the time so
the real way that we're going to be able
to survive on Mars and set up a colony
is by using in situ resource utilization
and this means being green this means
using the planetary resources to keep
yourself going so you can do that with
power by using solar power for example
or wind power Mars actually does have a
lot of wind not as bad as they showed on
the Martian however a radiation
protection you can bury your habitat
under the ground you can use the soil to
protect you from the radiation
environment water you can access and
melt the subsurface aquifers they talked
about before methane if methane is being
produced you can actually use that to
provide rocket fuel or some kind of fuel
for internal combustion engines on the
surface and extremophiles which is
growing plants in a very difficult
environment so for radiation protection
this is a usual graphic where you can
see the red bar on the right is 500 days
on Mars and this is orders of magnitude
is the scale on the Left going up rather
versus what you get on earth so we know
that we cannot survive for 500 days on
Mars without doing something with Ray
environment and this graphic on the left
shows you a computer simulation of
what's going on with the planet Mars
relative to the radiation coming from
the Sun so it's pretty extreme and it
comes from the Sun and it also comes
from deep space you gets you in two ways
so we have to do something to mitigate
that so we need a shield like they have
an allergic Enterprise Star Trek fans
here yes no a few okay and this is
actually real right you can create a
shield which uses a magnetic field to
protect high-energy particles from
coming in our own earth uses a shield
it's called our magnetic field so could
we do something like this for a
spacecraft absolutely is the technology
in existence yet no we need to work on
it could we do it for a habitat on the
surface of the planet probably as well
but it's actually worse in space and it
is on the surface of the planet growing
food we can use fiber optics to generate
light going into an underground cavern
where we grow plants for eating because
on Mars we're all going to be
vegetarians sorry guys that's just the
way it has to be and I'm vegetarian so I
don't mind and then growing food so
another great example we've demonstrated
this on the International Space Station
which is growing a lettuce leaf not in
soil but being spritzed with nutrients
in a microgravity environment so we're
already making great steps in the
research area to develop a lot of these
technologies to facilitate them for
future long-duration deep-space missions
with human beings and artificial
intelligence that's the key so we have
Robonaut which you can see off to the
left here and Robonaut why couldn't
Robonaut do a lot of the assembly for us
but I can't Robonaut do a lot of the
work that protects our weak feeble human
bodies from being exposed to the harsh
environment of Mars absolutely
Robonaut was demonstrated on the
International Space Station and this is
a new robot which is being developed at
NASA Johnson Space Center it's actually
kind of cool because you could like push
on it and shouldn't kick it or something
like but you can pull it's our
impression to push this back on you and
stuff like that so there's a lot being
done in the robotics front right now and
this really would enable people to do
minimum exposure do minimum EVs on the
surface and get most of the work done by
artificial intelligence and robotics
platforms
so the of course final question I like
to leave everybody with is would you
want to live on Mars it's certainly not
going to be easy
you know earth is a very beautiful
planet and then
you work on missions into deep space and
more you realise we should really do a
lot more at home to protect it because
all the other worlds out there are not
like ours right they do not have water
on the surface they do not have an an
air atmosphere and plants and tropical
jungles we do what we can to protect our
planet here at home and so I would like
to kind of drive that home as a message
but I do believe that our future is Mars
so these missions they are a wonderful
opportunity to provide a base of jobs
for scientists and engineers and are the
hotbed of new technologies which are
developed which can be used in the
private sector as we all know you know
all of the telecommunications industry
came about because of the space program
or they can be used to simply further
the exploration of our solar system and
beyond and so right now all of the
spacious ease space agencies around the
world are interested in going to Mars
the only way we're going to make human
missions to Mars possible is if we
collaborate and work together we can't
do it siloed one country the other
country we have to come together pull
our resources figure out who's good at
what spread the funding around so we can
actually make it happen and then the
other point is all the data is
open-source it's accessible to anybody
who wants to download it anybody who
wants to analyze it because I think Mars
is the future for all human beings not
just one particular country and for me
doing outreach presentations to kids is
one of the most important things I can
do the reason why I became an engineer
is because I was a huge fan of space
program a huge fan of science fiction so
now that I am an adult engineer I need
to go and talk about that so I recently
worked with a lady over at ISA to create
a book which is called a galaxy of her
own and it features the story is I think
around 50 or so women in the space
program and it actually gets released
today ironically in the UK and get it on
Amazon things like that and so if you
are if you have classrooms or any of
your spouse's or teachers or something
like that I think it's a really nice
book to teach young people about what
you know underrepresented groups like
women in aerospace can actually
accomplish and you can certainly ask me
questions you want on Twitter or on my
Facebook page but I think I probably
have a few minutes now to answer
questions so thank you
thank you very much Anita that was
intense
I hope you learned a lot oh yeah oh yes
and I have a lot of questions in here
that you asked in our app I will start
with the first question that came in and
then let's see how far we come so what
what do you think about X space and
commercial developments in space
exploration do you see it as a
competition or will it help NASA oh I
think it's the best thing ever so I
think the problem with space exploration
now is that if it's limited to
government agencies the funding is quite
small so the fact that we can actually
come up with ways to commercialize space
is going to facilitate the generation of
new technologies and I think all the
future sort of people going into space
is not gonna be part of NASA or you say
anymore it's there's gonna be like
people who do it from Boeing people who
do it from SpaceX from Blue Origin to so
many different companies so I think
that's kind of the wave of the future I
think the government side will probably
be reduced and focused more on research
and then all of the facilitation of
these explorations for commercial
purposes will be done in the private
sector thank you
and oh my god they are more coming in
there where was I there was a and that's
a team work in metric or imperial units
both so the interesting thing is that on
the aerospace aeronautical side of
things they almost always use the
imperial units it just historically all
of our interface documents are in metric
and everything on the government side of
the house is in metric but because we
have many different partners and some of
them want to work in in imperial units
that's fine but we do our interface
documents in metric it's their work
being done to improve the speed of
communication between Earth and Mars so
unfortunately that is a speed of
limitation is based off of the speed of
light so that is purely driven by a
three times 10 to the 8 meters per
second so it's based off of the distance
that's how fast photons can travel
that's how fast electromagnetic waves
can travel so everything in our universe
is governed by the speed of light so
unless someone can somehow warp
space-time that will never change and so
for example the new horizon mission
which was out at Pluto I guess probably
a couple of months ago it made
the Pluto I took like over an hour for
the data to get back because it's so far
away so there's nothing you can do about
it unless there's some way to have my
quantum entangled comp come
communications to places but no one
knows how to do that yet either okay
when will the first person go to Mars
and do you plan to go to Mars yourself
well so I think that it'll probably
happen in the next 10 to 20 years is my
guess and I think I would yeah I think
it would be kind of cool I wouldn't want
to do a one-way trip or anything like
that because earth is very nice actually
and so I think the one thing you realize
is as you get older and get to go to
more cool tropical places or like
actually it's pretty nice here versus a
place which has no water cuz I like the
beaches and things like that but I would
for sure if it was if it was not a
one-way trip and I could actually come
back home again then I would do it yeah
good what programming language was used
for the software I think most of it was
C and so none of it is it Oh a lot of it
is brought about by old code which we
reintroduce in later missions so we do
have a lot of reuse of our code but then
a lot of the stuff which is developed
for scientific instruments is brand-new
but the basic operating system we've
sort of repurposed for mission to
Mission how do you get the soil samples
ecetera back so we have several ways of
getting soil samples we have a drill we
have a brush and we have a scoop and all
of that is at the end of an arm and so
because we have the ability to reach out
and either do brushing drilling or
scooping and we bring it back and we put
it inside the rover and so there's a
different it falls into a platform which
is kind of like we call it the shake and
bake oven and so it shakes it around so
it fill it filters out basically you
know bigger particles from smaller
particles and it goes into an oven it
gets heated up generates a vapor once
again and tells us what the
mineralogical composition of the rocks
is and one more was there collaboration
between ASA and NASA for curiosity and
will there be a collaboration for
ExoMars and Nessa on NASA's own mission
in 2020 so there certainly was so what
are most of our collaborations have
traditionally been on the science side
so we have several different science
instruments and I think at least two of
them were contributed by the European
Space Agency I don't remember which one
forgive me because I was more on the
engineering side than on the science
for this mission I actually worked on a
mission I worked on GG trace gas orbiter
years and years ago I think back in 2012
where we were actually were partnering
and sadly that whole thing fell apart
because I guess one country pulled out
funding and the other country pulled out
funding in the US and departed entirely
so on the most recent mission the 2016
trace gas orbiter that was a yeast
mission but it had a communications
payload which was from the US and I
think it had one science instrument but
unfortunately our bigger role got this
destroyed because the governments didn't
want to fund it and it really is the
case that we need to do this so a great
example of ISA and NASA collaboration is
with the Cassini spacecraft so Cassini I
think you heard about that recently rice
it had been going around the Saturn
system for you know over a decade and
there was a entry system component of
that which was the Huygens probe which
actually went into the surface landed on
the surface of Titan and that was the
European contribution to that mission so
we've only had success when we work
together but for whatever reason we
don't do it enough and I hope we do it
more going forward there are still more
questions rolling in my way we ran out
of time okay be around to I'll be around
