Chicago and have the pleasure to be
talking to my tias me mamela who's here
now from toronto talking about angularjs
and in particular his contribution to
this great new framework which is in the
ng animation the animation classes and
you know I had the fortune it was
fortunate enough to see his talk today
and all those horrible transitions and
event catching and so on and it swept
really quite nice to see how elegant
leave abstracted those away and put them
in there so how long you been working
with the angularjs bout with the
framework her with like professional
equipment it's the framework I've been
working with it for almost two years but
then working developing it has been
almost a year now and just a general
question about angular seems to be the
framework to use and certainly it's very
nice to be able to work in a more
declarative style as opposed to so much
JavaScript any words of advice with
people who have existing JavaScript code
you know sort of you know why great you
know do your new do your new stuff with
angular you know certainly debated in my
own organization you know they've looked
at and said this looks really great but
we have all this stuff that's running
yeah it's the switch might be a little
bit tough because it also depends on our
websites are built nowadays websites
there's less work on the server or more
work in the browser and angular
facilitates that so it might not be a
very turbulent to switch over to angular
what existing code but if you're
building a new website or a big
application to start off with them
that's a good idea well certainly and
then in our case we're doing much more
apps than website so it looks like that
so it's a that's really its strong suit
for a lot of
client-side heavy lifting right so
anything that volves a lot of updates to
the UI a lot of data flying road for
building and so negatives great for them
now CSS is always increasing in power it
seems but I'm not a CSS expert but it
seems that it's sometimes not quite as
easy to share style sheets and reuse
some that CSS information that you'd
like seems like you're the approach and
angular if you may give it some leverage
in terms of doing that so the approach
with regular with the animations is to
keep the animation code the CSS
animation code in CSS will not have a
heavy amount of crossover between
JavaScript and CSS and that's how it
should be should be isolating as much as
you can keeping each technology specific
to what it can do but you know CSS and
there's still new features coming around
and it's still improving so it's
difficult to keep those two separate you
owe me in the end if you want to do
chaves recording you'll have to
obviously JavaScript now angular being
at least publicly identified in some
cases with Google because of misko and
so on is it is it you know should
someone be concerned about using angular
and an on Chrome browser no no not at
all okay I just wanted to put that out
there because I think some people
sometimes assume that just because the
framework comes from a given source or
the key contributors are that you know
it isn't that's really I've seen people
using it across the board all right no
there isn't any sort of bias against the
particular browser occur over anything
javascript in general web technologies
are very consistent among browsers
obviously depending on what you're
trying to build and you've probably run
into sort of inconsistencies but angular
by itself is fair to all processed and
and is that true for the animation
support as well yeah the browsers that
don't support animation being I 899 the
CSS ones and you gotta luck with those
but for all the other ones they support
it but you can always use JavaScript
animations onion so the work you are
showing what release of angular were you
showing hillis trading today that was
1.3 but would work to say that will
point to and where do you see one of the
big things that you see coming next in
terms of your work and angular it's a
good question kind of jumping between
places with angular like doing some work
on egg of their darts I recently I did
some work with form displaying error
message mechanisms and so on so yeah
stuff with the forms stuff with you I
lots of things well I want to thank you
for this brief interview it was very
very interesting and those of you that
haven't looked at angular how it yeah
you can do your animation as well so it
really provides a nice abstraction for
building rich client-side applications
thanks a lot Matias thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
