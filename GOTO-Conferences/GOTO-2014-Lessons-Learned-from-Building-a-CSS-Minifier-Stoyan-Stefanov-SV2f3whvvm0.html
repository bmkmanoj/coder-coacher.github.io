hello hi nice to see you all let's talk
about shrinking CSS this is the about me
slide this is the reason why you should
listen to what I have to say mucus in
that proves that I know what I'm talking
about and this is not me just take that
out of the way but um otherwise I am a
software engineer in facebook before
that idea who I worked on a lot of
performance research and tools like why
slow and also big fan of JavaScript but
this is not to talk about any Facebook
technology this is just a pet project of
mine that hopefully maybe one day we'll
be used at Facebook once we once i
finish it mmm so let's get started so on
the agenda today i'll start with a
little bit of rant about CSS I don't
really know much ESS and that's why I
decided to write a thesis minification
too so I was hoping that once I learn
more about the syntax I'll be able to be
a better CSS developer it didn't quite
happen so parsing CSS and so part of the
talk is about minification but it mostly
about writing CSS tools and CSS
transformation tools parsing and so on
because I would like to encourage people
to consider writing their own CSS tools
that they do some sort of code
transformation work with ASD and so on
part of the reason is because well see
there's this list of transpires from
from es6 two years five which i think
they really help move the language
forward so you don't have to wait
for all the browser's to implement all
the features you can start using your
features as soon as they are more or
less settled or just proposed and then
give feedback to the committee's and so
on so was thinking why live all the fun
to the JavaScript community and I know
do the same in CSS and I'm not talking
about you know Polly feels like if
you're missing a method somewhere on the
prototype you implemented yourself
talking more about transporting you know
syntax that is not otherwise valid in in
all the rice for example and let me just
take a break and I promise to do screen
recording of the thing all right so
writing writing CSS to seize is one of
the messages that I want to to emphasize
so let's start with a rant why why
bother with CSS in CSS minification it's
mostly about performance about what
performance because you have an HTML
page with some images script styles fond
maybe and images are inherently
asynchronous JavaScript can be made a
sequence you can load JavaScript files
it synchronously so they don't block the
display of the page but without CSS
there is nothing ready to display and
the way the browsers work is they wait
for all the CSS to arrive before they
they start rendering something so in
this sense CSS is the critical part of
loading a page and you only have a
limited time to make an impression on
the user's how response is your
application feels like and you have
about 200 milliseconds before before the
app starts to feel slow so if you can
render something Heather anything within
200 milliseconds that's great
and just wanted to share this slide from
Patrick from the Guardian that I found
really amusing is you know that's the
the worst user experience right you you
stare at a blank page just because it's
waiting for some CSS file to load the
comment here is this is the story of my
life staring at a blank page well see
that it's coming off the wire so how do
people deal with Oh with that blocking
nature of CSS so you the goal is to to
load the CSS as soon as possible so that
you can display anything and one
strategy to do that is to split the CSS
into CSS that is part of the critical
top part of the page that you can
display and he says that is used later
on maybe in different pages and load the
critical part as soon as possible which
also means even in line it at the top of
the HTML document that may look
counterproductive because what happens
you lose all the caching and so on but
you are saving on one HTTP request one
more DNS lookup maybe if this uses foul
is is loaded from a CDN and turns out to
be faster and that's what a lot of
companies that really worried about
performance do if you look at the Google
search results you see all the CSS in
line there that's what we do in facebook
social plugins like the like button she
says is in line and also Bing and they
do something even more complicated is
the the load the CSS in line at the top
of the page the first time then they
write a cookie and say okay this CSS has
been loaded and they load the same thing
is an external file so the next time you
visit they read the cookie and say okay
this CSS is already here so i'm not
going to inline it and some other folks
like
ardian website will take that CSS and
store it in local storage and read it
from there so a lot of crazy stuff
people doing just because there's too
much of payload in CSS and you need to
get it out of the way soon as possible
so one of the problems with the CSS is
that it's too easy almost too easy right
so you have you have a selector and say
okay this I want to find something on
that page and then I can set one or more
properties their values in that that
looks that looks so easy that probably
shouldn't be even paid money to do that
for living right that's too simple but
CSS is also hard it gets really
complicated really quickly when you when
you start trying to position something
or do column layouts and all that stuff
because she says wasn't designed as a
layout engine right so is you just use a
bunch of hacks or you use the library to
do that but again when you use the
library and then you probably don't need
everything from this library so your
scissors payload gets even bigger so
positioning block formatting context you
know things like specificity cascade CSS
inheritance how does that work so this
is actually a nice list if you interview
people just ask them to explain one of
those concepts to you when they say in
the resume that they know CSS and it
gets fun so this is what because
crockford has to say about CSS is that
Jesus is long fragile lists of self
contradictory rules and if you ask him
it should be thrown away and replaced
with something more reasonable and
you've revolves in picture like this
right with you would you look at your
inspector and you see most of the times
crossed out and and not needed and not
used but you still have to send all that
payload to into the user right
what can you do to avoid things like
that and because Jesus is hard the you
know when you deal with specificity you
stopped writing longer selectors to
override something then you or somebody
else couple of months later looks at
this and say okay what the hell is this
thing doing and can I refactor it but I
don't know why would be what was there
and the refactoring is almost impossible
and just when you when you start a new
project your CSS is nice and lean but
you know couple of months down the road
a couple of people it just grows and
grows and the refactoring is almost
impossible and the place what people do
most of the time is just start over and
we will write everything from scratch so
what is the solution to this CSS problem
that we have on the web he used to
really learn CSS and not just experiment
in the in the in the tools until you
make something with long enough selector
or something that achieves what you're
trying to do and there's lately has been
sort of a newer thinking on how to
organize she says how to write uses in
terms of architecture and I have a few
pointers at the end but we meanwhile
what we learn CSS in and how to properly
architect uses for larger web
applications what we must absolutely do
is GC pen in minute I so unification and
how do we go about it so looking around
at what what Mia's uses mini files are
available out there you can see that
they're either based on regular
expressions or of some sort of parsing
that I called partial parsing and
explain what I mean so when you when you
take a bunch of CSS and you look at the
ad AST that you you get back
then you see something like this right i
have a CSS block here and i have an
array of selectors and then i have an
array of declarations and that's oh
pretty nice and you can do a bunch of
stuff with this quite a bit actually but
when you look at these key value pairs
then you notice that this is actually
not really part right so you have to do
a little bit of parsing when you only
have keys and values in this case it's
it's pretty trivial but I'm all about
some some more complicated properties I
like shorthand properties right which
can have some some optional parts and
what can have some stuff flipped around
any kids again the partial parser that
you use is not really good enough for
this or how about something like a
background declaration where these days
it can be really complicated with
gradients and and stuff so that's not
really all that easy to work with so how
how I went to to that unifier that I'm
working on right now I was at some point
supporting the CSS mini fire from from
yahoo the white wine so the first thing
that I did was because it was written in
Java on to rewrite it in JavaScript so
that it's easier for me at least to fix
bugs and so on so it's it's based on on
regular expressions it doesn't have a
real parser so you need to see things
like that we're okay I have this minam
but looking regular expression to try to
strip some spaces and minify in this way
and it worked most of the times works
fine but then it's not okay to strip
spaces around plus sign in calc and so
on so it's it's not really robust plus
you're missing other more organizational
features right that deal with with whole
blocks
and this is what in the bug tracker
people started asking for features like
this so next I thought I will write my
own parser because I looked around that
there was nothing in JavaScript so this
was years ago say okay we have to have a
partner in JavaScript then eventually I
lost steam but I have some sun block
post explaining where I was right and I
even decided to pull a crock for it that
was Crockford in his diagrams for JSON
and in JavaScript and so on and i said
i'll write middies this nice little
railroad their diagrams that will help
me understand how to polish this is this
anyway so I forgot all about it and then
came back few years later and there was
already some existing parsers with an in
JavaScript and there was this one called
man that was just released few weeks ago
when I when I started looking by bretts
timmerman and there were these other
ones like the one written by nicholas ii
because that's used in CSS lint or the
one by TJ that is worse they used in the
rework tool and here's a bunch of Jesus
tools which is great and but Brett
mentioned that he is inspired of those
and i said okay i'll use this one but um
when it came to minifying hold hands and
so on i thought that you know it's a
partial parts and you cannot get not far
away with it and then I looked around
again and found this prosthesis parser
code Gonzalez which gives me much more
much more detailed abstract syntax tree
right and a lot of those tools that I
mentioned are you know have little demos
on this website CSS patterns I snatch
this expired domain and just put up a
bunch of things that I was working on so
if you see and then you can play around
with with manish and see what kind of
treat gives you if you decide to do your
own parcel right
eh oh let's see all right so this is
sort of a pretty print and this is the
abstract syntax tree it's really nice to
work with right you have a bunch of
rules in in a style sheet in there you
have selectors declarations but again
the values are only partially there and
if you take the same thing in in
Gonzalez's parser and then you see that
in the Declaration you have a property
which is an has an identifier and then
the value of this property you know he
wants to start with a space and then a
dimension which is much better defiant
it has a number and unit value that's a
more space it also preserves spaces and
comment in you can do interesting stuff
with it ah so this is just a screenshot
in case the demo didn't work and that's
how this CSS shrink to was born so it's
all it's all written in JavaScript you
can install it on the command line with
NPM or there's also a see web UI thanks
to the magic of browser if I right then
you can have you can just test and see
how other works in your savings here and
before and after Jeezy ping you also see
some pretty representation of what
structural changes were done here so in
this case I have fun I have a say 22
mediacorp is that happen to be the same
and adjacent and they also happen to
have the same the same rules here if you
H to convert the colors to to the
shortest representation so these can
safely be merged and you see what the
kind of structural changes were done so
what what does the to do and so the
first thing I'm unifier she do is of
course deal with with comments and in
white space right and this is the the
easiest transformation and it's pretty
safe all right you take into account
where were the space matters and this
some I separated this part of the
project into another library I called
pretty ugly that you can have a
purification in uglification of the code
and so if you if you decide to roll your
own or you think some of the
modifications that see a shrink is doing
are not safe you can just pick and
choose only the ones that matter to you
and the one that you consider safe so
then colors so essentially brute-forcing
taking taking any color representation
converting it to unto all the possible
representations and taking the shorter
all right so if you have if the keyboard
happens to be the shortest one or there
is a tourism the hexadecimal
representation that is shorter than they
then the six characters and because i'm
using a library cold color i think from
from the no npm any does all that stuff
for me so i didn't have to do that
myself I'd said rather reuse something
that people have done in and tested and
it also supports all the other colors in
CSS and even some that are not supported
in CSS like it yourself or mix for
example I know a lot of designers prefer
to define colors this way so why not
give them the option so as a side effect
of this minification my two supports a
bunch
other ways to represent color so these
are the sort of an transformation that I
would like to encourage you even if you
don't sign up for a whole tool or for
some reason you don't want to use less
or SAS or any of those you don't want to
sign up for the whole deal that they
offer but you just want to pick and
choose smaller features and that that's
a good idea zeros and numbers right in
most of the times if you have a zero
zero value you can you can remove the
the unit of measure except if it's if
it's an angle where it is required also
if you have zero percentage values
that's also you can remove them 20
except when you're talking about
keyframes where the percentage sign is
required and also things like stripping
leading zeros and simple modifications
like this so quotes are trying to remove
the quotes where they're not required
for example in a in a URL that doesn't
have spaces and the first thing I've try
to make all of them consistent right so
hoping that this will help with with
Amina fication because a side effect of
the gzip right so if I have see
let's see font family something like
this turns out this is the space the the
quotes here are not required most of the
people use them because you know maybe
the space matters but it doesn't it's
just a comma separated list of stuff so
this is a result and I I stripped the
spaces where they're not required or in
imports and stuff like this when the
euro is not required I'll remove that
and if everything fails just make it
consistent all right and I think a
settled on on double quotes I guess so
let's see if you have fun char said and
so the the single quotes get change to
thee unto the double quotes in the cases
where they required keyframes if I see
the word from it's ever so slightly
shorter to use 0% so i'll change that
everywhere if you see one hundred
percent you can say two instead of one
hundred percent because it's a little
bit shorter so if you see something
stupid that I'm describing please let me
know or if you see something that I'm
missing also please let me know part of
the the presentation is just seek
feedback for the for the minification
part of it for those pseudos there is
there is a shorter syntax that is
supported i'm back in IE so except if if
it's two column selector so um I'll just
cover those two single one and there's a
little I coracoid you would you need
space here in some cases so IE filters
right
I don't know if you're still using those
but on and that's also a way to support
things like opacity in in order is that
so from time to time people still need
to resort to those filters which here is
too long to fit on the page but if they
have they have two syntaxes and this one
is short this one is longer that goes
yada yada yada opacity and there is this
one called IE for syntax which is much
shorter and if you read the msdn page
about the eye for syntax it wants you
enough to use them because of
performance reasons so I talked to some
people from Microsoft what is the
problem have they quantified it and so
on so they told me that that doesn't
really matter in the grand scheme of
things it really doesn't matter and
certainly not anymore since I don't know
I 60 so there's no reason why not to use
this shorter syntax when dealing with
font weight if I see the world bold I
change the numeric value some with with
the word normal also trying to make
everything consistently lower case again
with the hope that that the G zipping
will will produce smaller file sizes
when when the strings are the same so
also any any sort of those that you know
some people sometimes people write in in
upper case will be normalized everything
to normal case and so this will kind of
changes in values that you can do but
what about more structural changes when
you deal with with selectors in and
blocks so the first thing is to remove
any any empty any empty rule sets right
because that that doesn't affect the
program at all so if you have an empty
media query or
empty proves head and just remove it
double cup declarations when in the same
block you have the same key in the same
value doesn't matter if they're adjacent
or not after you after you come for the
colors then you notice that they bought
this in color and then they can be
merged and you just leave the last one
I'm not I'm not removing yet duplicate
duplicate keys duplicate properties that
have different values because a lot of
times people use that for backwards
compatibility let's say you want to
define a color with rgba but a
background color but then you also
define it first is as white so that the
IE versions that don't support or any
browser doesn't support rgba will fall
back to the old one so still thinking of
what's the best way to to deal with
cases where it's going to be a white
list or any other way to be able to to
remove duplicate declarations that that
don't matter so duplicates electors if
you have the same selector twice for
some reason right you can remove one of
them when you have a JSON selectors
right when you have the same selector
and two blocks right after each other
then you can merge those into one but
they have to be adjacent because
otherwise the way CSS works is it
matters whether it is depending on
what's in the middle adjacent blocks if
you happen to after all the
transformation you discover that the
content of the blocks is the same but
they have different selectors then then
you can change this to be to be a single
block
something like this no where it becomes
a single a single block a Jason medium
again the same thing they're right next
to each other and they happen to have
the exact same content after all the
transformations and there's also a bunch
of other random nonsense that we put in
in our series has like for example 22
generic phones right have you seen
anything that goes like foamed family
let's say I have some Helvetica
something in the NSA and my fallback
generic font is Sunseri serif or serif
or or something like that
or mono space right so this thing
doesn't doesn't make sense anymore once
you the browser finds it a photo generic
want the rest doesn't really matter so
it can safely be stripped from from the
minified code invalid property serv
values hi this is coming up where I need
to do a proper link and proper
validation of the of the CSS so that if
there is anything with wrong syntax or
or value that doesn't make sense for
this property and anything that the
browser will ignore shouldn't be sent to
the user to begin with and things like
if you have an inline element and you
set the width or height it doesn't do
anything right so why is it there but
this becomes a little bit unsafe there's
probably going to be an advanced mid
efficacious mode because what if you
change that inline element of your block
element with JavaScript then suddenly
this thing start to matter so it's kind
of a general rule of thumb it's not a
good idea to manipulate CSS with
JavaScript because it will break
potential optimizations like this same
thing with with borders just just a few
examples it's always best to change the
class names rather than write CSS with
JavaScript so short hands of course any
any decent mini fire should use the the
minimum possible syntax to achieve the
same result and when you see something
that's called shorthand of course the
mini fire should handle this mine is not
yet so that's why I don't consider it
finished but things like the trouble
properties just a mini monic to remember
say border top right bottom left right
if you happen to have all of these in
the same block they can be substituted
with with the shorthand
and phone support their backgrounds
another possible optimizations is to
convert the unit right if you if you
have an animation that last for a
thousand milliseconds it shorter to say
it's just one second and I was also
working on the converting angles
depending on on what's the shortest
result and beta it's currently commented
out because it's not all the browser
support all the all the angles
definitions and it's some crazier things
like if you have a pixel value that
happened to be shorter in some other
unit an inch for example but they're
equivalent why not use that yeah also
removing duplicate key frames no matter
where they are they don't have to get
Jason if you have key frames with the
same names the last one wins renaming
yep so when you minify JavaScript you
can you can take all the local variables
and then change let's save our first
name to VAR a right to use the use
shorter names in CSS that's that's not
really all that possible because you
cannot you cannot change font family to
anything else right it has to be this
thing but at least for some things like
like names in keyframes you can rename
them of course it's potentially unsafe
if you use javascript to manipulate
those key frames and also the variables
are are coming up and now supported in
in in your Firefox this is something
that see if this community has wanted
for a while right instead of repeating
same value over and over again and use
variables so if there are variables they
can be finally renamed to shorter
representations
just like in JavaScript but we're not
there yet because not all the browsers
support them but that doesn't mean you
cannot use viruses as variables today
and just have a lightweight transform
that will that will take the AST and
convert all the variable names to expand
them too all right in my computer
crashed I think it's probably because
I'm recording it so once old tools the
when you when you create a CSS or any
sort of code transformation tools right
that the most important thing is not to
break people's code and how do you know
that this thing works and which is has
any any little changes you make ends up
screwing the display so you have to test
in different browsers and like I said
divide and conquer I decided to split
the project into several few smaller
ones for which node package manager is
the greatest thing to organize different
loosely coupled separated projects in
use them even benefit from other people
like i said i'm using color library from
someone else so ended up trading a bunch
of packages Gonzalez AST so the gonzales
parser had a part in paris and then
string defy the code but it doesn't
support a SD to HD transform so that was
the first thing that I had to do I'll
talk about CSS diff would you assert the
results before and after and she says
test batteries just a bunch of CSS and
HTML from popular libraries or CSS Zen
garden that you just a bunch of stuff
that you can use to test your transforms
talk about this in a second no way
did you die again alright so the CSS
diff thing is you take an HTML and CSS
and you do your transform of the CSS and
then load the HTML with the with the
before and the after state take a
screenshot compare pixel by pixel and if
there's something wrong you fail the
test if there is even one pixel missing
and for this I'm using phantom GS for
Firefox price ojs was it for IE there
was also one in for firefox but there's
a newer project code dalek jes which i
didn't end up using yet because it said
it's not really complete but it looks
really promising because it can load the
page in the real browser as opposed to
phantom GS another thing that I want to
mention harm up with all the time by the
way five minutes left all right one
other thing that I wanted to encourage
people to explore is something I call BS
CSS or browser specific browser specific
CSS which means do some sort of
server-side sniffing and then send only
this uses that is supported by the
browser send it to the real browser that
means to power the prefixes or I hacks
and so on yeah I what's happening here
but all right I'm just going to give up
on this thing close it not to distract
people
alright browser specific CSS in my
testing with say bootstrap if you if you
compile the the CSS form for a for an
older version of ie you end up removing
forty-eight percent or half of the
bootstraps page load which is great so I
have a have a library that it does very
very basic browser specific generation
of CSS you can generate for IE 6 to 11
and for an item split in two versions
for the all the other browsers so you
can say I can generate the file for for
chrome and one for firefox so because we
would see says minification you can only
get so far with let's say stripping
leading zeros and stuff like this but if
you can constrict whole blocks and whole
property's data that's a big win so
there's no reason to send to chrome dash
mods properties so something I'd like to
encourage you to explore and what else
was there that's about it I think there
was I guess in kind of a closing I just
wanted to encourage people to experiment
with with CSS transforms and see what
what kind of good ideas you can come up
with of course try my try my tool but
not in production yet because I don't
consider it finish I haven't done any
benchmarking how does it perform
compared to others but with the with the
transforms that I have in mind seems
like it should pretty soon be the best
of breed that's out there and I had a
few pointers to learn CSS at the end so
if you find anything from Nicholas
gallaher any initial presentations from
him or look up
object-oriented CSS and smacks smacks SS
and there's there's on really good one
that I liked called CSS for grown ups or
CSS for grumpy old men ages it's really
awesome would that I thank you very much
for your patience sorry for the computer
trouble and if you if you have any any
questions or anything you want to chat
