or the organization has some kind of
existential threat if they're feeling
threatened so they see competitors that
are going faster they're worried they
may be you start having a few bad
quarters we've got to go fix something
you see this governments have a bit of a
different problem the existential
threats sort of a curve maybe like the
Second World War was an existential
threat in the UK right so there was a
huge amount of innovation that happened
in government there because I well we
could get bombed out of existence or we
can figure this out right but most
governments have got very sort of you
know they're stable you're working
government it's you know it's a
relatively slow moving thing we're very
constrained so it's get it's difficult
to do there to figure out what is what
is the real driver for things maybe
there's you know will shut you down your
department take your money away as
through the existential threat but
there's this so I think that you need
that feeling that there is there is at
the top level in a company there's going
to be need that the change and some of
it comes from overall things are
speeding up as I think you know as
competition speeds up more and more
people players in a market will speed up
and people that don't speed up other
people that get left behind to go to
business hopefully so Ellie goldratt has
a had a description of someone there's a
great interview with a guy who at the
goal and invented theory of constraints
and he's this is great interview with
him and they're saying so like all this
stuff makes perfect sense why isn't
everyone doing and how long does it take
people to get it and he said my
experience between five and 15 years
made and they're like why and he says
well you need three things to line up
because you need exactly what saying
existential threat equals it downward
pressure you need some kind of immovable
deadline you need to have tried
everything else and be desperate and the
third thing you need is information he
said I'm good for the third one but so
what I do is wait around for the first
day now I stay friends and then
sometimes I get all worried craziest
thing I saw glad you asked right
and and so and so you can accelerate
that yourself by choosing to cause those
two there's something something I was
talking about is like and you know we
set ourselves up to say we will move
this fast oh crap now we need to solve
for that right there's some information
out that we can go and start to do that
but that's a choice yes maybe mean time
between hair on fire moments yes
roundabout a generation all right but
maybe it's of Nicole boots what's what
are you seeing I mean the traction you
produce this this dev ops report now two
or three years worth of data you've got
some trends in there you seeing people
adopting more of these ideas and getting
traction from from the double are so you
know it it's interesting because it the
DevOps movement really started with
startups or with web op shops and you
know there's this thing I said for a few
years which is you know healthy respect
through fear is still respect and so he
saw companies saying oh that's really
interesting what they're doing over
there that right on and then there's
this thing we're all sudden it's like oh
 you know survival is not necessary
and we're going to crash and we're going
to crash hard and we're going down we're
going down we're going down and all of a
sudden it was everyone calling everyone
else saying okay so I hear you're doing
this DevOps thing help me out how do I
do it because I have to do it now and I
have to do it for real and they're
realizing so I don't know if anyone here
SERPs like I don't surf but there's this
thing where it's called the duck dive
and like the wave is coming and if you
kind of hang out near the surface and
the wave is coming you're toast so you
have to do it all the way like you have
to go under like you have to go under
and you have to do it all the way and if
you like hang out near the surface
you're just going to tumble and so we
have these companies like a couple of
them are kind of trying to hang out
depending on the industry or depending
where you are in your company and if
you're in this if you have this downward
pressure that Dan was talking about and
you're in tumultuous situation or you've
got too much pressure you're you're
going to fail like survival isn't
mandatory that's totally fine you can
fail that nice knowing you or if you
decide to really commit and go through
the whole thing then we're seeing
industries that have traditionally been
not fast moving or traditionally
brick-and-mortar retail industries
finance industries even some government
industries so you know the US government
right now is going through this massive
transformation shift where all of a
sudden they're like oh we're toast so
they're starting to do even DevOps
transformations there where but they
they realize that if you try to do it
the half way that they tried to do one
or two years it was just massive they
were just bleeding money in massive ways
so they're having to do like the full
dive but that's what it was it was
healthy respect through fear still
respect and then it was all of a sudden
you either go all the way or you don't
and there's still a few holdouts that
are kind of like waiting and saying
that's sweet and we're going to stand
back and watch but i think it's it's
kind of going to be this wave of either
going to survive or you're not and a lot
of people are starting to see that it's
kind of this impending i wasn't going to
say it but yeah i'm handing him big
change for the better o or something
we're not a tiny honey badger hey give
me some help each other anybody want
that slide I think for the rugged
concept it's much lower adoption than
you would see for DevOps really scary
its eggs a newer idea really so this is
more about it's coming well I think it's
a logical inevitability that if you're
going to survive this you're going to
end up coming pull on in the devops and
then if you want to accelerate devops
and get it at scale especially in highly
regulated environments you're going to
have to do some of this stuff so we just
want to be ready for with the patterns
and with the the lessons learned and the
mistakes out of the way so as people do
it rugged spin around 4i think seven
years we it's really shocking and
surprising when I in
in the wild because we don't have a very
formal command and control anything
there's a manifesto but a large airline
need has been using it for six years
some of the big banks are using it for
procurement leverage over their
suppliers with DevOps I think if you
look at one of the most mind-blowing
existing proofs of the year last year
was genes dev ops Enterprise summit
right because this was fortune 100
highly regulated hundred-year-old
organizations doing it for real not just
talking about it so I think that's where
you saw I wasn't just unicorns it was
also horses and I also think that
demographic is the ones who are making
us pulse smart scalable security
practices into play because they they
have sarbanes-oxley they had PCI they
have all these things were the
antithesis of rugged and they're saying
how can we do compliance at speed and
the reason I have hope is people like I
think the cool one of the coolest
presentations was mark that's mark
Schwartz mark Schwartz from the US
Department of Homeland Security
immigration services I can't think of
anything more horribly backwards into
funked an IT in the federal government
us and yet he's a living breathing human
chaos monkey chattering their notions of
IT because he's just so successful in
every project he's given they keep
giving him more and more and more
projects and because of the consequences
of his mission he's pulling in more and
more and more rugged principles that
this starting point was a year-long
mandated waterfall progress process
which was written almost you know
basically a huge document it says the
all development must finish before any
testing starts was like it's that that
of course i think it was really 50 to
make sure to make one like a one-line
change of to a website was you had to
use this process and the smallest
possible change had to go through this
process and he ended up some things so
what our process said and every one
thing we have to follow this process
that that was the mindset so he broke it
to be you know they're they're doing
things in days or weeks or whatever that
would previously have taken them from
years and yeah i said it really did fix
it but it is it is it is a really great
presentation if you haven't seen that
talk it's inspiring it's also quite
humorous
because it comes on saying you're
expecting me okay it was waving this
massive pile of paper at people when I
met him I think you're both inspiring in
if you soon as you get fired I'll try to
find you a job but he hasn't been back
he's gonna crack but I want to pick a
retailing something you said I think in
alcoholics Anonymous they say you know
you have to hit rock bottom I have a
friend you know another way to put it is
you have to be sick and tired of being
sick and tired so I think the physics
teacher said no one changes until the
pain of maintaining inertia exceeds the
pain of making chain and I think the
reason that rugged has hope and DevOps
and rugged at us together have hope is
the really serious high-profile breach
victims they've kind of found out
through necessity just how inadequate
and what an abject failure security best
practices are and that's why I was
really happy that Shannon's going to
speak because she's lived some of those
abject failures and has made the
necessary adaptations to survive and
thrive so I I have hope that even though
we're early on it's kind of what you
have to do to survive and people will be
very delighted as they start playing so
an example of that I was working at a
proprietary trading firm few years ago
who are pretty good at what they do and
take security quite seriously and all
that kind of stuff and they decided
always get an audit of their
applications infrastructure that they
consider themselves very much got a hard
shell soft Center kind of organization
so they got to later asked the two
different people to come in and take a
look around one was a literally a couple
of guys in suits with a checklist and
I've processed whatever from a a large
well-known consulting firm and they came
in and sat down and they spent some days
walking around the place interviewing
looking at things poking stuff and they
came back games a pretty pretty clean
bill of health and this other guy came
in I'm not making any of this up so the
guy came in sort of shaggy hair t-shirt
jeans came up to the reception desk and
he said hi I'm and she said oh yeah the
elevators are over there because she
thought he was the elevator engineer who
come to fix the broken look they said oh
no I'm actually come to meet your CTO
and blah so they sat down and while he's
sitting in reception
waiting for the CTO to come out of a
meeting he's hacked the Wi-Fi got onto
the servers he's walking all over
production and he's got this list of
stuff and he goes him we should probably
talk looks like we are not worthy you
know people is there are people who can
do that stuff and it is unnaturally
terrifying when you meet them it's
really good to have an inside the tent
is all I'm saying some of them are
sitting here watching you so we've got
we got some questions I'll take one of
the easy ones first which is how do we
get the slides the presentation so we're
recording everything I mean collecting
the slides I've got all and we're going
to be collecting all the presentation
slides and we'll put them all up over
the coming days or whatever how long it
takes to do that but but everything will
be available let's see question for for
josh's in profit org or rented
organizations this all looks fantastic
that how do you influence not public
sector organizations what how are you
seeing the take up there and how what's
driving that I'm trying to divine the
purpose of the question I think the
patterns are useful especially when you
have no resources i mean i think i was
one guy said where our IT departments
too small we can't do devops and I said
whoa an IT department of one is
inherently DevOps in one person so um
the way I look at it is you know that
the phrase necessity is the mother of
invention I think this was always the
superior way to do it regardless of your
staff or your budget and in smaller
organizations you know I'm in two
nonprofits as well as my day job we have
no idea budget so we have to be clean we
have to be Spartan we have to think
smart I don't think the patterns are
incredibly different there's nothing
that's there's nothing in the rugged
philosophy that says go buy a bunch of
stuff I think it's more about smarter
design choices smarter implementations
smarter instrumentation so if the
question is how does somebody without a
budget do this i think the patterns are
almost identical but we can talk we can
talk more or maybe if it's what's the
motivation and the private sector it
could be prophets and the public sector
could be reputation I mean either way
you don't want a security breach we help
it we help
groups that help dissidents and if they
fail people die or in prison so I think
elections I mean mark Schwartz keeps
getting reappointed right so another if
I did comment early don't let me they
are in maven there are some artifacts
which have known security flaws so the
question is I can't you just block those
two this shouldn't you be you know
actually shutting alien seven yeah so
during the interview process I asked why
don't we just get rid of all the
vulnerable ones it's a very
straightforward question and the really
simple answer is you can get these
projects directly from origin typically
when people try to do it they get
counterfeit versions so it's a public
benefit to have all the versions of
every project in one place in a
validated form second if I delete it
people will go get it from our cash
proxy or from the project directly third
people would stop using the service
entirely so there are tools that I
provide and others provide that do sit
in between Navin and do give you supply
chain intelligence heads ups and all
sorts of parts throughout the
development cycle including IDEs but
until people are starting to look at the
available information that are being
shown to them it is just a batch script
grabbing something we break builds if we
start it's not going okay we've got some
questions on the edge are also with you
so the future sounds promising but has
anyone done it yet so we can measure it
huh sorry I'm looking around the wrong
things i think i've been working with
over the last few years one guy in
particular works in the securities
operations part of a large bank just to
give an idea of the scale of his
operation so securities is anything that
gets traded as interesting so stock
shares futures options all that stuff
that you hear about on trading exchanges
they're all securities operations is all
of the unsexy stuff that happens after
the trainings finished so matching
everything up netting paying tax doing
all that stuff making sure the numbers
add up to zero they never add up to zero
right because you have millions of state
wat not millions 30 tens of
those pipe systems or doing similar
things his world is quite interesting he
he's responsible for the flow trading of
a trillion dollars of stuff a day okay I
mean figure out how many microseconds
you need to be down before that starts
costing it's not very long yeah it's a
very very low tolerance of stuff he
pronounced a couple years ago and I was
working with him I said we're going to
have our lead time to deployment okay
we're going to have our lead time for
anything and we're going to double
throughput and we're going to do that
without releasing quality in any way and
a whole bunch of people look to him and
went you're bonkers right where this
Bank we've got this much flour and he
said right and that's why we need to do
this and so he said we're going to
hardly time to 224 everything he knew
when he said that that's not going to
happen right there are some places where
you can destroy the lead time you can go
down to like a tenth of the Lee time
there are some places where because of
the amount of external touch points and
formal handoffs and law that you won't
make much of a dent what he was doing
was shifting everyone's thinking 90
degrees right everyone's thinking about
activity and busyness and features and
story points and all that other nonsense
he's saying that's all detail we want to
get there faster and the way we get
there faster is being better get in
there and it caused a cultural shift and
it's still double it is still on
unrolling so there are companies at
scale who are taking this this shift in
thinking and what the thing that's both
frustrating and exciting for me is
there's no what's the word there's it's
very hard to measure the trajectory
because everything leading up to a shift
into lean operations is about measuring
activity and effort because that's the
stuff you can see right so i have my
testing team and i can measure the
amount of testing I've got my support
guys like a measure tickets because we
love measuring tickets right meantime to
whatever is interesting yet all of those
things and I measure all these local
activity metrics I'm not looking at the
park I'm not looking at the big picture
when you shift to like a lean mindset
you start caring much more about
essentially all i care about is lead
time to thank you what's the shortest
time between now and someone saying
thanks that's what i wanted right
everything else is detail
because we weren't measuring that before
it's kind of your site you're starting
over you can derive a lot of those
numbers anyway from existing systems but
by definition it's going to be a bit of
a guess but I would star in the trading
indicators amazing a trailing indicator
is you become more profitable you get
things to market faster all of that good
stuff but it is a trailing indicator and
someone was saying is I was talking to
someone yesterday and I've saying about
it basically moving the Titanic but with
a very tiny little brother and and
that's kind of what it feels like for a
bunch of time when it starts moving that
you know it's moving so that's moved in
a cult so there's a question here about
the evidence of causation so that he
could talk a bit about the methodology
behind these surveys you've been pretty
short so quickly statistician to me will
clarify we didn't do anything on
causation we did do some prediction
though so prediction and causation or
two different things so there was some
prediction there was also quite a bit of
correlation correlation so difference
between correlation and prediction
correlations is just when two things
move together prediction is when one
thing can predict another causation is
when one thing actually creates or make
something else happen so we didn't
actually we never did causation because
that has a much higher statistical
threshold that we have to cross so we
did do prediction in some things the
things that we did prediction on is
which which factors in the environment
make IT performance move and which
things in the environment make
organizational performance move and so
or not make it move predict that it will
move so the things that help predict
that movement NIT performance were
discussed and those things were
generally some tooling decisions some
cultural things and some some practice
and process things and so there was
another question that you know how how
do i define devops that's kind of a an
amorphous term but that's those are some
of the things that go into my definition
for DevOps because those are the three
components that that tend to go in there
and so the methodology
behind what we did is we used a
cross-sectional survey so it's one point
in time in order to capture prediction
you have to have one of three conditions
it has to be either longitudinal this
isn't longitudinal because it was one
point in time or it has to be I'm losing
the other one theory based and this one
was theory based so we did it based on
models of business technology and lean
lean management so we did those and then
we used very carefully crafted and
worded psychometric models and then when
possible we also used some objective
measures so that's where we pulled in
the objective measures of companies
exists yeah it's covered a company
success and stock market tickers and
then we did all of the we did extra to
statistical tests to make sure we didn't
have common method variants common
method bias so for example to make sure
that people didn't go through the survey
and like answer one on every possible
thing or three on every possible thing
so um and also it's like for example
sometimes just by taking a survey you
end up being biased because I only
captured or I captured most of the data
through a survey so we did early versus
late responders all the measures were
statistically valid reliable
discriminant validity convergent
validity and then we used different
statistical tests to check for
prediction so some partially squares
some covariance based mostly correlation
based measures because those maximize
for prediction versus data fit to the
model I'd be happy to talk stats if
anybody's interested yeah so this is
like most most surveys are back Stone
Age compared to the kind of analysis was
actually thought that went into this
this was actually a research report and
not just a marketing report and we're
hearing word that several analyst firms
are pointing other companies to this
report
which is very very rare um gene is
desperate for the United swap data with
your method because this report was done
with Gene Kim and Jess on both has her
as well with puppet labs so we haven't
shared and we're reluctant to share is
the actual global consumption stats for
open source hygiene and one of the ones
we've looked at a glance and I use the
correlation where you use because that's
all it is is correlation gene said I
wonder if surface area which is how many
versions of a project are using an
active deployment correlates with the
stock price of publicly traded companies
and I've had a glance it does so if we
can start to make arguments that could
show up in the wall street journal about
here are the tangible correlations
between market performance and supply
chain hygiene it'll be very easy to get
executive air cover to do so yeah so one
thing I didn't mention so when we did
the report in 2014 and I threw in
organizational performance in the survey
Gina gezz were like yeah that's a great
idea and I was like oh like this is
never shown up this hasn't shown up for
40 years this is a massive like I really
hope this pans out and the only reason I
thought it might pan out is because so
much of DevOps looks very very similar
to lean lean principles lean menu but in
the manufacturing process I mean agile
y'all are sweet but like it's never
panicked like it's never it's never
panned out it's never shown up it's
shown up in two or three studies but
it's only shown up an ROI and only after
a three to five year lag and then it
only hangs out for one to two years and
then it disappears so the fact that this
is showing up in the bottom line
consistently including like when I throw
in all the control variables is a really
really really big deal and when I
mentioned it to my friends in academia
it's like I have a PhD I do all this
stuff I do research i do peer review
they told me I was completely full of
 and I showed them my data under NDA
and they ran it and they lost their
minds so like everyone is super super
excited now so this
is this is a big deal this is really
really exciting all big stats words
aside okay well I went through the
question so this is teaching you people
if you want to ask a question stick them
in the app because that's where i was
reading from these questions from we're
running a little bit late for lunch so
if somebody has an absolute burning
question but we're going to be so
remember this conference I didn't
overview and then we went over some the
areas this morning now we get to drill
in for the next day and a half just
getting into more and more detail so
there were plenty of opportunities to
ask more questions so lunch is
downstairs I believe this lunch is
actually sponsored by battery ventures
who I work for so much we get anything
that's what we ended up sponge 11 babe
back at one-thirty to get through more
rugged
