this year uh can you tell us a little
bit about what you're up to this is yeah
so I actually recently rejoined your bun
excellent um it's really great stuff
going on there right now and really fun
job actually you know I'll be doing some
of the security stuff like I used to but
we focusing on just getting all the good
stuff the groupons building internally
and helping it get out as open source
excellent so it's open source part of
the the security strategy with the
groupon or is is you know I think I'm
not sure it's part of the security
strategy in general but it's definitely
part of the company vision you know
groupon has been seen as a you know a
non-technical company for a while but
there's some really great stuff there
and really the part of the pushes to to
show everybody that you're about really
is dead male company and reducing with a
great stuff what are some examples of
the projects you guys are bringing into
the open source yeah so um you know what
we're doing right now is working on a
couple of things that we have built
internally some AP testing stuff there's
a blog post recently that kind of
explained how we move to nodejs for our
front and we call the interaction tier
and the interaction two components we're
looking to open source a lot of it isn't
all of it this summer so this little
work to do and it'll be it'll happen in
stages but that's part of it we've done
a few things about github right now some
testing tools you know just a bunch of
different things we just recently
released some Jenkins plugins one called
dot C I that's about docker with Jenkins
and kind of systematic CI stuff it's
actually kind of interesting sorry so
what sorts of companies would you
recommend to jump in and take a look at
the open source projects you know I
think anybody anybody could pick a juice
I definitely think the target will be
companies building bigger things you
know there are the things that we're
building our global scale there's a lot
of lot of moving parts and some of a
thing could be overkill for a one server
you know fresh start up so this is more
kind of the next step in looking to
support a bigger every structure
distributed that kind
so switching topics a bit from groupon
you know putting your security hat on
what do you think in kind of today's
today's Internet what do you think
people should be thinking about when
they think security when engineers
building a solution where should they be
thinking about security at what faces
and yeah that's sort of the toughest I
mean for me it's a design process thing
right it starts when you start it's very
hard to talk out later it's usually not
complete enough when you check it out
later but for me it's also about
discoverability preventive security is
something we've been doing for years you
focus our efforts on must prevent an
attack and you just can't and you know
we've seen this over and over again you
can't prevent the tax now there's the
stack of things you have to get right
and then there's the one thing the
attacker has to be ready and it's
asymmetric it doesn't work right and we
should focus our efforts on a good
security practices but also we shift
back to discovery of you know breaches
we need to look at the threat community
that's attacking us and what they want
so we want to know who they are why
they're exactly what they want what they
want to do with what they take all
that's what important to understand and
if we don't understand that we can't
deliberately build security right
deliberate controls deliberate
architectural design around security
based on the threat community that's
most harmful to you i think is where we
need to be going blanket security
blanket security it's only as good as
the generic security you can provide but
if you know as a group and here's what
they're after and why you could kind of
turn the knob up a little bit and start
to focus on the kinds of things they're
doing to you so threat intelligence
sorry in terms of discoverability what
do you think that you know well how do
you think that our existing tools and
frameworks could be improved you look
forward five years or ten years you know
what sorts of facilities would you would
you like to see to make to make that for
their first that's a good question and I
think that there are there are handful
things that the security of our
frameworks and libraries will improve
but it only improves as people discover
problems right
frameworks are written by teens are
dealt developers who are looking to make
something more useful you know that
they're they're trying to be more
productive it's not a here's my new
secure framework right but you never you
there's anybody advertise oh here's the
new most secure web framework out there
it's like here's the most productive
framework or the most productive
language and that's good and that's what
we need to have but we need to ads or
adding people to those framework teams
that are focused on just the security of
that framework and to be honest some
frameworks are doing some really great
things along with the development of the
next versions of the frameworks in the
Rabanne rails core team actually that's
a really good job of identifying things
that have happened that they've seen Oh
responding to problems but you know
things they see his problems there every
time as a new version out there picking
off a couple of them and making sure
that they're addressed in the next
version so i actually think they're a
good example of a team Mets aware but
this stuff exists and they're they're
not you know hunter person focus but
they're also doing things that matter so
I was actually pretty impressed by the
river ouse core team and what they've
been doing with these last couple
versions of rails a lot of security
features actually great what do you what
do you guys do a groupon to integrate
the concerns of the user experience team
and the security team you know for me
for me and also for groupon it's about
reducing friction right it needs to be
easy there is nothing in the way between
you and the thing you want to do and so
it historically certain security has
been in the way of that right increased
friction to make sure you keep the bad
people out for me it's the wrong mental
model or at the bunch of model everybody
has is the fortress I keep everybody out
except for the people who should be in
and that's it doesn't that's not the
internet that internet doesn't work that
way right it's whoa the casino write
your comment will check your ID and you
go play right and if you do something
wrong will address that but you should
just be able to come in and do what you
want to do right there should be no
friction between you and the purchase
you want to make things you want to
search for you know the interaction you
want to have there should be nothing
more than who we are who are you again
are used ok good you're go ahead and go
on right and that's it and then that's
the model we're actually using so we
should flip my mental model and just
address this is what this is this is how
we should behave but it becomes more
about intelligence of behavior then and
for me that's that's very valuable
because it lets us not just study mental
security threats but there's business
intelligence and how people wants in her
ass right there are more controls you
get rid of the the the more signal you
have for for real interactions you know
people will have to work around this and
work around that but go away because
they don't like how something stop them
from doing this thing my favorite
example is captures right it's doesn't
14 we're still putting captures on every
page because we don't know whether
somebody's good at-bat right that's the
point is oh baby i could find a robot
you can find a robot a lot easier than a
captcha right how robots have
characteristics and behavior you can
identify it says that they're a robot so
don't punish your users because you
don't know but everything you a robot in
a human right that's that's bad right so
for me it's about studying behavior and
reducing the friction because I think
you can actually get a lot more accurate
with behavioral analysis and you can
with you know stodgy you know static
security controls so I mean it sounds
really like a really great approach to
take what does that mean in terms of
like what what tools and frameworks
exist 244 for people to go and do that
sort of a real analysis yesterday is
that is that out there and ready or Z so
it's not ready and it's not really out
there actually my talk is about you know
how do you build these kinds of systems
what are you looking for you know
there's bits and pieces that you can
string together to make this thing but
this thing doesn't exist yet and I mean
it actually starts with the simple ideas
that we should be doing anyways so you
know things like a great logs and I put
them all in one place and put a query
engine and talk with them so that you
can ask questions about what's going on
right can I actually what a normal day
look like could you tell me what a
normal day was because you get you
identify an abnormal day and why is it
abnormal right these these questions
about just the flow of data through our
systems
you know things like splunk and log
stash and sumo logic and you know the
different engines that people are
building you know having some of that
got at the core making graphs you know
just understand its visibility in your
environment so I mean visibility and
analysis of logs it's like you know like
that core foundation you have to have
without that nothing to really work you
don't have the information you need and
after that he's not asking the questions
there's a cup that correlation things
that are seemingly unrelated could also
sit could trigger something interesting
but you have to be looking you have to
be aware right my favorite question is
if bob leaves a train station at 5pm 155
miles an hour wyd an alligator shipping
address right they could there there
might be a related thing right yeah but
you know you don't understand unless you
look it is difficult because you draw a
parallel sometimes there's the idea of
anybody can find the correlation they
want if they look hard enough right so
you got to be careful of looking too
hard and enforcing patterns so it really
becomes a good rigor and identifying
potential potential matches find the
people who are good at that kind of
thing let them do their thing don't
force it with that I'm gonna find this
if it kills me kind of thing is you'll
find it it might not be right though
sounds like a great place for she
learning techniques gets loans
absolutely yes so I've been
experimenting with a little bit my open
source project rap sheet has
experimented with that quite a bit and I
think that's one of the other one of the
keys I have gotten it right I'm probably
not the right person to do that either
but I do think there's something pretty
important there great well thanks a lot
