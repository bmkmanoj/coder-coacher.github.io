it's a pretty late already so I try to
keep things fairly high level in this
talk where's Dee okay if I can start at
all nice okay so um I work for a company
or I'm okay i'm the co-founder of a
company called esco we develop
blockchain technology and we have based
out of London and Berlin and I want to
give you like a brief overview like
what's what's been going on in the space
so far where things are heading what
happened in the last few weeks to the
etherion project and so on and so forth
maybe just for me to get a feeling like
who of you feels comfortable explaining
what bitcoin does okay who have you I
mean do all of you know but quality of
you knows Bitcoin like okay pretty much
everybody who have your own spit coin
okay fair amount who of you has some
ether okay who of you has heard of
etherium before ok cool so um that's
nice um great so um how so basically
this whole whole thing started about
like in 2008 with Satoshi Nakamoto
publishing a white paper called a
peer-to-peer electronic cash system and
that we now know all is Bitcoin so it
kind of people also call it from the
internet money where you can directly
send cash back and forth in a
peer-to-peer manner so initially it
didn't have much uptake but then kind of
over time people realized that there's
potentially something bigger behind it
and so further onwards people I by the
way like if I say something that you
don't know haven't heard of any terms
like I might use some some some terms
that I quite like typical for the
blockchain ecosystem just interrupt me
or like any other questions in between
I'm happy to answer in any case like
people
there was something something bigger
behind this technology that could could
be quite useful for for the way how we
interact and transact on the internet
and so people quite quickly started then
abstracting the whole notion of a
blockchain so there were projects like
master coin and and colored coin they
tried to use this peer-to-peer network
in kind of different ways for domain
registration and other things kind of
either building directly on the Bitcoin
block chain or slightly altering the
protocol in order to make it useful for
other systems so but then all the time
people realize that potentially things
could be done in a slightly different
way and this was when the theorem
project got started so ethereal
basically was the idea of instead of
just slightly altering the scripting
language that you have in Bitcoin you
put a virtual machine on top of the
block chain and so what you get is
basically what we now call a global the
central computer kind of a a server
infrastructure that can be used by
everybody as a single environment for
deploying programs that that can be used
by everyone in an open fashion and in a
secure way so it's kind of one could
also think of like api's even like done
a big step further so because you have
the single shared environment where
programs can freely interact with each
other talk to each other and you can be
sure the program as you deployed it will
be executed in the way you deployed it
and you know what you get when you call
other functions and other programs but
it's not just interesting from a
technological perspective it's actually
way more interesting I think from a
social and human perspective in that by
not having this central architecture
with a server in the middle you all of a
sudden can deploy services that don't
require this middleman keeping track of
things so because so far the internet
was basically good to distribute to
distribute information but
as soon as you wanted to transact
something of value you need to resort to
a third party be it like a big bang or
be it uber or any other system that
keeps track of who owns what who
transacts with who and that we have to
go through in order to to implement a
service so I don't want to go too much
into detail about like financial
applications because it's actually more
interesting I think to talk about
different applications outside of the
financial realm and and also much more
educational because it makes you think
of how you could use this system in
other settings be beyond finance so one
of the projects that people are
currently working on is is a system
called fire coin it's a decentralized
cloud storage basically where you can
host and share data and through this
virtual machine you can implement the
whole incentive Asian mechanism for
people to host that data and also for
people to trust lessly check whether or
not the the data that you assume is
actually held by by another p in the in
the in the network is actually still
there so another system which I just
came across this is actually quite
interesting in probably how we're going
to see systems like bitcoin and blocks
on being used in the very near future
it's called get money and what it allows
you is to contribute micro task
basically in a github like project and
then as soon as you commit the your work
to to github you automatically get paid
in Bitcoin so it also shows this project
also shows like what kind of
infrastructure will be needed in order
to make such decentralized systems work
one thing that here comes in and the way
how github X here is as a so-called
Oracle that feeds outside information
into the blockchain so in the previous
example with the fire coin we also had a
similar data source so people have to do
a cryptographic prove that they own a
certain bit of a file which then goes
into the block chain and in this case
it's like data that can be
directly fed from from guitar for
example another interesting project that
that I've been also involved with is is
a system called provenance here in this
case and the the actual asset that's
being transferred other people are
interested in our certificates that
prove authenticity of a physical good so
think of your fair trade FSC a
certificate that shows a certain way of
manufacturing for a product right now
all these systems are very much
paper-based I mean not only are they not
digital but they are also even even
paper-based and it's really hard to to
verify that the product you actually buy
is organic whatsoever with such a system
on a managed through a blockchain that
overcomes all these trust barriers that
you find us in a supply chain in a shop
when you scan a tag you could actually
see that the certificate is authentic in
the sense that it hadn't been double
spent because this is what the block
train originally solved as a problem so
not being able to double spend a digital
asset in on the Internet so right here
you also have again like a data source
that comes into the block train from the
outside namely through scanning this tag
this information is being fed into it to
verify that this that this tag is
actually authentic a third system a
third really interesting startup is
uncalled grip singularity they deal with
decentralization of energy market so you
could think of your peer-to-peer trading
system that some people might have read
about but even more broadly also on a
higher level where utilities actually
consolidate who bought energy on which
day from whom could be run on to such a
system and especially in in countries
where there's less infrastructure for
managing such data exchanges in a trust
trustful manner this could be a really
good approach to speed up very delivery
liberal energy markets and thus help
economies to develop just as a side
remark and what's quite in
justing about all these blockchain
applications is in recent years what
we've seen is how our monetization
basically and moved further and further
up the stack so eventually was like
these aggregators Airbnb uber monetizing
all the data that's that's been put into
the platform by other people but what
blockchain could allow through the
through the issuance of tokens that are
directly tied to certain protocols they
could help maintain that could lead to a
monetization further down the stack on a
shared platform that goes across all so
different and industries and thus quite
dramatically change the way how
businesses work actually 11 yeah one
interesting example that goes into that
direction was some project called the
Dow has anybody heard of the Dow over
the summer okay a few people so a dallas
night now is a shorthand for
decentralized autonomous organization
what happened in this case was basically
people used this shared common global
computer to deploy a program that models
an investment fund people could be
centrally by and without your
Kickstarter behind but just by a token
that represents their ownership in the
order their stake in the in the Dow then
the dow was supposed to so it also came
with voting mechanism so that I was
supposed to invest in the future raised
about 160,000 160 million u.s. dollars
over the summer quite a quite a bit but
then unfortunately this happened so what
this program had had a little bug and it
allowed it also like it allows an
attacker to withdraw the money from the
towel contract so basically I think it
was like about two two and a half months
ago was a Friday morning when we
realized and this is our public park can
publicly be observed on the internet
when we realized that the doll was
getting drained because of because of
the bug
and the what then started was was a big
debate around in how far what is called
also smart contract this program on the
blockchain that basically mimic mimics
the digital agreement between parties
and how far this code actually should be
law and whether the attacker by what he
did just explored nine didn't actually
exploit the program but just behaved
according to the rules that that were
laid out in the in the program basically
some people argued the dow is like the
code in the dow is law and so there was
a bug in there or some people just
perceived it as a bug why the attacker
argued or people around the attacker
potentially argued that actually is fine
because yeah this is how the code works
and it was advertised in any case what
we then saw was a was what's called a
hard fork of the protocol which was
quite contentious because of these
arguments around is is a smart contract
on a blockchain now the the actual
agreement or how does that work with
with the law in the real world so there
was this hard fork which was pretty
controversial that many people also
argued and that this is a quite a big
setback for the for the blockchain
development I would argue it actually
made the system harder so in some ways
we are really still in the early days I
mean many people there's a lot of buzz
around block chains and many people i
think overestimate a bit where we are at
the moment with these systems it's
really early days likey theorem is just
two years old or like the actual
operationally theorem is one year old
and you'd expect that that there could
be bugs that there could be issues which
need to be fixed i think it's actually
quite quite remarkable that through this
hard for what was a potential what was
what could be made was to fix this bug
and basically give the money that people
had invested into the dial back to the
these investors which i mean think of
all the cyber security issues that are
ongoing in bangs like once the money is
gone
I've rarely heard of any cybertek where
people were like money could be restored
like where the where the status work or
could be restored and like people got
their money back actually in recent
weeks we had who does anybody know which
country this is with Venezuela so in
like recently we had a little bit of a
similar issue to Venezuela and that what
that certain operations were under
underpriced in terms of what they
actually cost so as I said there is this
there's this virtual machine on the on
the block chain which where you can
execute of course and certain upwards
were wrongly priced according to the
actual cost they cause which was a Miss
like it's what was basically just a
mistake in the in the protocol in we
were quite lucky that most of the
implementations were very robust in that
sense so we ourselves did a new
implementation of the protocol em in our
company f qor in rust which was quite a
useful thing so they could deal with
that over price everything with this
underpricing of that cost nonetheless
does anybody know what this is this is
the lending computer of the Apollo 11
and the reason why I'm talking or why i
put this proto here is that in the
development of the etherium system we
followed certain approaches that
actually proved quite useful in that in
contrast to the Bitcoin system the first
was a formal specification and then
independently multiple implementations
were developed so you find this user
usually in aerospace for example where
you have at least three different
implementations that first need to show
that they in under all tests come to the
same result before systems are allowed
to go go operational and we did the same
thing so they are which is quite a big
effort but which proved to basically
save the network and that there are
different implementations completely
independently
built just based on the formal
specification and nothing else and that
come to consensus in all cases in any
case there will be another hard fork so
the protocol must be fixed similar to
the to the dow and i hope the media
won't won't go crazy again because in
this case it's just a it's just a fix to
the to the net to the protocol to an
issue that that was in the protocol
itself so yeah i hope this will again
lead to making the system much stronger
so maybe just a brief outlook in terms
of where we are now and what's on the
horizon for all these systems so the
biggest one of the biggest issues that's
being discussed at the moment in for
blockchains is the scalability so it
can't like the number of transactions
that you can do per second for the
system same same problems exist for for
the etherium block chain and it's one of
the issues we are working on as a
company to make to make the system
actually you more much more useful in
the world and otherwise we are also
working on an infrastructure that makes
it possible to integrate the blockchain
into existing systems like a plug-in for
for browser and will hopefully lead to
much more secure infrastructure overall
when we interact on the web by
introducing secure signing mechanisms
having a really high security around
wallets and have people being having
much more agency over their data and how
they how they transact on the internet
for this if you know anyone we are
hiring a and that's the only advertise
not really want to wake we're hiring a
designer who's who would be excited to
work with us on this under stuff yeah i
mean i hope i could give you like a
little bit of an overview like how how
we as a company see things going i mean
i guess i could go into more details how
the system works but i'm not sure really
how useful this is I'd rather be
interested in discussing with you maybe
you have like ideas how you would use
this stuff or maybe you have some
experience of building
proof of concept in your own company
yeah so I like to hear from you I think
I was way too quick I guess yeah yeah so
and there was not so I just repeat the
question it was about how how it worked
what kind of methods we use for the
formal specification so it's not really
like a particular method that we use but
it's it's mainly formalizing the
protocol as mathematically as possible
so you can actually check and verify
just with paper based basically the the
working of the of the protocol it was in
fact developed in parallel with the
first implementation so it's not that it
was purely paper-based and then there
was the first implementation that was
hand in hand but different
implementations were in were developed
in parallel according to this
specification so that was I think the
important point that not nobody ever
looked into the other code base so it
was not like as for Bitcoin we're now
you have reimplement ations of the
VidCon protocol would actually be
implementing bugs that were present in
the in the first implementation yeah any
further questions anything yeah
right so it was about whether or not the
heart fog will be feasible in the long
term and under certain circumstances I
mean it's so the Heart Walk basically
how this how this worked for the for the
Dow was people try to get a sense of
whether there's enough support in the
network before the hard fork in order to
make sure that there won't be any
technical issues once the protocol gets
change and the the clients updated the
bigger the system grows or the bigger
the network grows the more difficult it
will be to come to consensus I mean it
will depend on like which kind of things
you want to change with a heart fork for
the next hard I'm pretty confident
we'll be really easy because it's just a
technical issue that at the moment
exposes the system to a dosing attack so
there's no sense and kind of sticking to
the old protocol because it makes the
system basically useless in the long run
there are ideas of actually implementing
kind of the voting mechanism for
upgrades into the protocol itself so
this could all be abstracted and
automated in the governance but yeah I
think that's that's a really important
thing to consider like overall how these
distributed systems that have so many
different stakeholders can be governed
as a whole because we are seeing this
now in Bitcoin at the moment there are
many discussions going on what kind of
fixes people 1 minus prefer this because
they can get more revenue by a certain
alteration of the protocol other
stakeholders have other ideas and so I
guess some automation that gives
stakeholders an opportunity for
systematically engaging is a really good
idea so that's something on the on the
on the horizon for a theorem potentially
now yeah
again
and so um basically what happened was
this I so what the question was whether
or not we have information on whether
people got the money back and whether
this money can be used in the future
that was the yeah okay so first of all
the the way how the heart folk worked
was basically the smart contract that
modeled or this program that model this
Dow was replaced by a different contract
where according to how much you bought
in or according to how many tokens you
held you could claim like the ether back
that you invested in the first place I
think as far as I know that that
programmers or that contract is now more
or less drained so most people just
reclaimed it by doing a transaction and
and get the money back in terms of the
confidence I think it has it has changed
things quite a bit so currently there's
like a little parity which came out just
a couple of days ago it's called the ICO
dot in for the ICO that something so
people just making fun a bit about all
this height that's been going on I mean
there are like loads of projects that
try to raise money through these crowd
sales and some of them have surprisingly
little material online in the first
place when they try to raise money I
think people are still quite excited
about this opportunity for the
blockchain being this out-of-the-box
organizational tool for getting people
to collaborate together I think that
that still holds that people are really
excited about it but people are a bit
more skeptical about marketing around
these these projects that do try to
raise crowd funding but I think that's
the same problem for other for kind of
classical classical cultures as well
where people could just not deliver what
way I want to deliver I mean that said
there is some skepticism around around
in how far we need better methods to
check bugs and codes
so which actually now them caught the
attention by people working on former
methods former proofing so I guess we're
going to see a lot of PhDs coming out
and on that topic so which is pretty
cool to see because before they were
basically limited to aerospace and
nuclear power plants for checking what
they do academically and yeah I guess
we're going to see this a lot we we have
ideas on around like that there is a way
when people try to engage and with such
a smart contract a way for checking that
for example then you could be sure that
the number of tokens that's represented
is actually an invariant or whatever and
similar things so I guess in the future
we we are going to see like an entire
ecosystem kind of maybe foundations the
electronic frontier frontier foundation
has people like checking such contracts
and and then you can be sure they are
certified so you have kind of a
plug-and-play big library of contracts
that people actually trust and where
they can like reuse certain elements and
stuff think that that's what we are
going to see in the long run kind of
these micro service contracts that that
you can mishmash together and build a
new system and which will make it much
easier for people also to build their
own thing without going through this
whole mechanism again
is it here and I didn't
oh no no I mean there's like this this
is like and so the question was like
whether or not when you want to use such
a system you need to build a virtual
machine yourself or put it yourself on
top like I mean the the way the idea
behind the theorem was like to build
this general purpose blockchain that
people can really easily use in their
system so there's a JavaScript API as
well for people so that actually also
just normal web developers can easily
build like Addie central application
that has instead of a centralized
database just this block chain computer
also in the back end or the server less
infrastructure in the back end so it
wouldn't like in the long run once we
have all the tools or tooling around it
it wouldn't require you to like do
really highly sophisticated development
before you can use that system it's it's
very much like a common infrastructure
for everybody to easily use that at
least division yeah it if it is combed
and easy for people to used is it not
end easy for the hacker to to hockey
well I mean yes yes I know like why why
do you think just because it's for
everybody to use it should be easy for
the hacker because a lot of the problems
to be talking quite often happens when
when something is that really accessible
and easy to use and this is where people
figure out a way to hack it in then you
get this way it's a lot of hugging
happens like for example so many cases
I'm with even if you talk about things
dies outside the bitcoins at the moment
maybe things like block changed and all
that is secure because a lot of people
still doesn't know about it whereas if
you then make it accessible and what
I've known for people to know about it
so now later they will beep
not those who work on coming in Hackett
because they know the way I run it then
they were because because in ordinary
system there have been so many cases of
you know or people having known the
system the hacker in and they you know
you got like known company even my own
service proprietor light talk talk last
year was hacking and then and then
there's so many you can think of you
know and you can look at all kind of
things and then a couple years ago they
were like Go Daddy's and you know
clients was hacking people think that
it's because God daddy's is so cheap and
it's easy to whatever but then the the
the companies who were huginn they
actually have their own server from
godaddy well you see what i mean i think
i think one important thing here is that
this is an open infrastructure for
everybody to use i mean i think in many
cases if you try to be cheap then you
often have to compromise but then you
run and protect your own systems right i
mean well this is like a native protocol
that can be also improved by everyone
also the i mean most of the all the
clients are open source software so
everybody can look into the source code
and check things can can improve things
i mean just because i don't really get
like just because it's open and I mean
there's of course like a design
challenge when it comes to user
interfaces and like people maybe
accidentally providing their private
keys to someone which which they didn't
want to but like for the cost system I
see a big strength strength in in this
being like a single infrastructure I
mean if we if we did get like funding
right for for open for for ssh for
example I mean for other crypto
libraries as well I mean we could
probably really easily improve improve
such such libraries as well which are
which are used by a lot of people I
don't really see why being open and
easily usable should directly lead to
the two difficulties unless you you mean
a particular service that's that's cheap
and therefore compromises on security
because remember that life example I
forgot I there's the name there's a
company for example who
at chilis actually when it come to
github they actually provide something
similar to keep house but they declined
that come today actually is you stand
because they want to be kept separate
from github so the people don't abuse
the system the company stuff and I've
known so so the because they did these
are the company they actually runs a
whole lot of other stuff and something
similar to keep tabs is what they
provide for the clients are separate
services and they say to us that a dated
decline actually come to buy this rather
than what you can get a good start
because it they're kept separate which
means that they are more secure and
everything like that so that's why did
okay it's hard to comment on that
particular case yeah
I mean so there are different estimates
on like how much it costs so costs come
basically into the system from the
minors who maintain the system I think
it's it's less useful to look at the
current cost because they're still like
loads of technical development going on
so people working on getting from proof
of work to proof of stake which will
probably dramatically decrease the cost
I mean at the moment when we talk about
transaction like it's a it's like micro
send cents and like that's kind of the
the rough ballpark but I expect this to
come down quite a bit over the next next
year's as the system's mature and become
more efficient in terms of the
processing power yeah so directly
services that are run mostly at the
moment exchanges that's that's something
which is operational there's a another
platform een I spoke about these spots
startups right i mean they are
developing proof of concept or early
products that that run on top of
etherium there are a couple of projects
one is there to bigger prediction market
projects who want to go live pretty soon
i think which is an interesting concept
as well there's a there's an overview i
can provide you with a link it's i mean
most of them are still in in an early
stage so there's they're not that many
apart from the exchanges who run a
business on a day-to-day basis already
on the theorem grab train yeah yeah
mm-hmm that's that for both systems yeah
yeah so a theorem classic just for the
others a theorem classic is the system
that like that's the non fork system so
which still which still has the buggy
down so to speak in the on the
blockchain so it's a different way how
history could have been continued and so
it's the same problem it's just the same
issue I'm not sure I mean there's
currently like mining power anyhow as
far as I heard leaving from Ethier and
classic I don't know what's going to
happen I think they're like that they
are relatively mature and immature in
terms of their governance so I don't
even know who drives that that hard for
Peter do you know maybe anything about
et Cie hard now yeah I mean it
wouldn't be too difficult to transfer
what what's been developed for the
etherium system to the theorem classic
system but that we are I'm not aware of
anybody who's implementing it yeah
it's to block chains now yeah which were
this which were just the same like until
this first hard happened and then
so what we actually saw back then or
what the what the theoretical thinking
was if there was ever a contentious
heart fork what would happen is like
maybe for a couple of days they're like
2 Chainz there's some uncertainty around
which one is the winning one which one
is the one that that's not going ahead
but what effectively happened in this
case was that there were enough miners
who stayed on this theorem classics on
the unforeseen and so currently we have
two to e theorems like one is supported
by like a really big network of miners
and then a smaller one and was also
interesting in terms of seeing how like
what's called the market cap it is that
capitalization got spread I mean of
course uncertainty always causes crisis
to pressure to crash which happened for
for a theorem as well but then yeah so
at the moment if the classic is like
traded at one dollar i think if either
itself is traded at eleven or twelve
dollars so but yeah there was like a big
bit of hype then after a few days around
he theorem classic which led to a price
spike of three dollars and now it's down
to one again so I expect we going to see
it probably slowly dying like similar to
other I coins that we've seen for
Bitcoin but yeah I don't know I mean
yeah
okay we have a couple of questions
coming in on the app so you mentioned
that the bach chain can verify ownership
of an asset taking an ssl certificate
for example how does the system first to
declare ownership of the certificate and
how does one verify the origin so I mean
initially you see I mean so if you have
something that's existing in the real
world or out of outside of the block
turn you always need some process for
getting it into the blockchain so as I
said like similar for I mean let's not
talk about this ssl specific question
maybe but about other assets that you
want to kind of shadow on the blockchain
so you need some mechanism to get like
this ID of something in the first place
on the on the chain that that's probably
like some company who takes care of that
that is comes kind of trusted and has
some processes for for doing this in a
way but then the verification can be
done by everybody independently so maybe
you need a QR code that you scanned in
terms of these physical assets and then
you you can you can verify the identity
of that product yeah and the last person
we have at the moment that is what timer
eyes and do in this just before it
become commonplace payment hmm that's an
interesting person I mean six months ago
I would have said probably like in half
a year I don't know but now I mean many
what we what we are need is a lot of
tooling around these systems to make it
much more easy for people to use and
then similarly the corresponding
infrastructure for users that what we
are basically also working on in the
company I think once we have that and
like it becomes fairly easy to develop
applications on top it can be it can be
quite quickly I mean we've seen adoption
of other applications that you have a
mobile fairly quickly so that's I think
the the more relevant point lot more
coming in do you see theorem
applications replacing bitcoins in the
future it depends on I think I think
there's there some some use cases for
bitcoin bitcoin Excel especially with
with the Lightning network coming on so
like a network or like an
an add-on to the Bitcoin block chain
that allows micro payments in a very
efficient manner I think we're going to
see like loads of different chains that
that then interact with each other and
for particular purposes in there there's
kind of a master chain that that then
makes it possible for all these chains
to talk to each other which is at the
moment not possible now people start to
use the app so is there a way to host
web pages on the theorem network to make
them more resilient to attacks than all
censorship well there are ways I mean
like you can as I said like there's
tooling and for web developers to
basically use JavaScript to to develop
an application that leverages the if
you're in luck showing what you still
need I mean the theorem doctrine is
fairly limited in terms of storage so
you'd only want to put the logic on the
chain that actually needs to be agreed
on by everybody like just the bare very
essential logic and then anything else
you'll any like additional information
photos or whatever for which you might
need to check kind of some authentic
authenticity through like putting the
hash of a photo on the blockchain but
not the photo itself because there's no
no reason why you put a photo in the
first place on the block chain itself so
you toast that may be either on a
centralized server or like on something
like the fire coin system that i
mentioned earlier which is like a
further development of things like
BitTorrent to host stuff in a
decentralized way but then yeah and what
applications do you think will speed up
if you're iam adoption I think like
applications like this this this
provenance application for example where
it's very unnoticed that there is
actually a blockchain behind I mean who
cares like which database it in the end
is behind this stuff so as long as it it
gives you an additional value or an
additional service that you don't have
at the moment which in this case is
having a single source of truth for for
where stuff comes from in a in a supply
chain I mean I'm also waiting still for
somebody to implement actually a
decentralized Eber there was like some
buzz going on around a start-up who
wanted to do this so decentralized eva
basically consisting
of a marketplace for rides and that that
you can then for which you can do the
processing of the of the business logic
on the on the blockchain and then for
example also insurance could be handled
through the blockchain like micro
insurance just for the particular ride
that's something i'd like to see i mean
it basically i mean the thing is we
don't know what these systems are going
to do so the best thing that we or the
best thing we can do i think is to just
take it experiment and play with it and
see where we where we get and all your
thoughts on athyrium and microsoft azure
well i mean i think it's it's it's a
good thing that there is so Microsoft
and Microsoft Azure and and and the
blockchain i think that refers to
certain certain blocked and
implementations that are now available
on azure for people to be able to play
with in in the corporate sphere I think
that's a good thing so it makes makes it
accessible at them because it's really
difficult as far as I know too often get
get like and and unkind of verified
software running in a corporate
environment so that's a good thing at
the same time I what I fee at the moment
is there's lots of discussions going on
about private chains and what they can
bring to enterprise so I think there is
some value of private chain so a
blockchain that's just limited to
certain certain users but then the big
the big innovation around block chain is
this open network that can be used
globally on the web and that's free for
everybody to access open to access okay
thank you very much water i think we are
slowly running out of time so thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
