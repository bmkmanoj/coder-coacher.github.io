for Microsoft but i work an open source
which makes it a lot more fun I actually
work for the azure team and do stuff and
cloud and I work on asp.net and
everything that I focus on is around
angle brackets and curly braces and I
was thinking about this I wanted to
share a couple of thoughts that I had
around the cloud and the browser and to
see what you guys thought this is a
famous quote that we can't prove that
Heath this guy said that there is at
most a market for five computers this is
a guy from IBM I couldn't find a picture
of the guy so I found a picture of a
really old guy from a book so I'm just
going to say that that's the picture of
the guy and in his mind computers were
this large filling up a room kind of a
thing and that there would be a market
for you know maybe five of these and it
turns out that that was absolutely true
except it's the cloud there's the amazon
cloud and the google cloud and the
Rackspace cloud is about five computers
out there they just happen to be made up
of thousands and thousands of other
little computers so when I think about
the cloud we think about this virtual
machine there's all the different
components of an operating system that
one has and if you think about operating
system theory and you remember back to
college all the different components of
an operating system things like
threading and storage and security and
eventing surprisingly these are the
things that we associate with languages
more than operating systems but a while
back when I was writing see these were
characteristics of an operating system
but now they can be thought of as
characteristics of of languages which i
think is a really interesting idea we
take these virtual machines and we throw
them into a data center and then we call
it a cloud I don't know cloud is fun to
say although data center is what it is
but the nice thing with these virtual
machines is that you can move them back
and forth not just from your day
a center to the cloud but to someone
else's data center and when that company
gets big enough and they decide that
their data center is officially a cloud
then we're moving from cloud to cloud
but the point is that we have
portability we're not locked down we are
literally moving machines around as fast
as we can copy those machines which is a
really comforting feeling and being able
to scale up means to add more of these
machines and it wasn't too long ago when
I would build a new machine in our farm
and I would run down to the local
computer store and I would buy another
physical machine it would take an entire
day to install the operating system and
to go and set up an all new machine it
was a pretty extraordinary time and then
fast forward today and you can run linux
in Azure which is insane right because
because we're evil it doesn't matter
that it's the azure cloud must be
anyone's cloud you know you can do this
on Amazon and other cloud providers but
the fact that we can do this is amazing
it's mind-blowing we couldn't do this a
little while back and now we can and
when I hear about people not moving to
the cloud how can you not want to go to
the cloud when you can do this put that
in a for loop and yet that's file new
company that's truly truly amazing stuff
being able to create websites and scale
them up with a simple slider bar is such
a joy to say I want to and no I want
three and the best part about the cloud
is it it doesn't care about your
language choice you can do this stuff in
any language that you want you can run
node you grunt Java PHP the best part is
that it's open this is so important a
good cloud is an open cloud you need to
be able to see what's going on inside
you need to not feel like it's
abstracting away something that's not to
be abstracted away a good cloud
abstracts away complexity but is still
open
we're doing all of our stuff in as open
source so actually right now all of the
windows azure stuff is open source if
you haven't heard it's just important to
point out that it's a kinder gentler
Death Star over at Microsoft right now
everything's up on on github so now I've
gone and made a new website from scratch
created it provisioned it and now it's
running in the cloud that's what a cloud
should do we need to expect that from
the cloud it used the open source tools
that I want it will use any language
that I want it uses get if I want choice
choice choice everybody that's what it's
about you may have heard also that
asp.net MVC razor Web API it's all open
source now and this is another important
point that's great about the web right
now is that this isn't source opened
this is open source it's really easy to
zip up source and put it online and then
put a really unfortunate license on it
that says look but don't touch I think
it's great that Martin Fowler is taking
pictures of me right now action pose get
an action pose Martin know it's going to
be pictures of me looking like a pundit
it's all open source now even if you
want to use on your Python that's cool
too i don't care but maybe maybe you're
not maybe you're into python baby or not
it's all good we support whatever you
want in the cloud now this is something
i wanted to show you that we've been
thinking about this is so early that it
doesn't even have a name yet we're just
putting quotes in it and i wanted to
show you to get your ideas about what
else one could do with the cloud because
we saw that we can make virtual machines
in the cloud that's great I can make
websites where I'm even abstracting away
the virtual machine underneath and I can
dial that up and dial that out and I
don't even know where that website is
running or what virtual machines but
oftentimes we find ourselves doing work
with batch systems and these batch
systems typically end up doing something
in a console app and then you want to
take something like this where I'm going
to modify some text file and I want that
to scale up maybe I'm going to take a
couple of images
and I'm going to resize them or I'm
going to take some pdfs and I want to
OCR them the New York Times recently did
this on the Amazon Cloud where they took
a hundred years of scanned New York
Times issues and then turn them into
pdfs all using the cloud these things to
start out in little console apps so
here's an example of a silly little
console app that reads in some text and
then on the output it writes a line of
content and then a little bit of
information that it in fact wrote
happened in the cloud so we've
abstracted away this kind of batch
process ideas so that locally it's as
simple as running a console app and in
the cloud it's as simple as just copying
the executable up there it's scanned
that function is found and now I can
invoke those functions and if I want to
run them on one text file or five
terabytes of text files the cloud will
scale up for me so though those virtual
machines live on the server but there's
another virtual machine that we're
forgetting about and when we design
systems we design them in such a way
that we keep wanting to scale up the
server I keep seeing people ship huge
amounts of data back and forth between
browser and server as if the browser was
stupid as if the browser was incapable
of doing any actual work I think that it
can do a little bit more work than we
give it credit for I've been thinking
about this so remember our view of what
an operating system is operating systems
handle memory management operating
systems have often a graphics subsystem
of some kind they have networking and
eventing and things like that well once
upon a time you would have a machine
that looked like this that was kind of
powerful for the time but really not
very powerful and it always needed a
friend in a back room somewhere to do
the real work and in a system like that
if you wanted to go and Google something
you would visit a terminal like this and
you would go and google it with your
terminal but the screen was actually
rendered as I a ski or answer your vt100
and sent across the wire and then
displayed here so you felt powerful but
you were really seeing a view into
someone else's power so then someone
created the webpage not a web page with
the web page this is the one web page
this was the first one and it's living
inside of this terminal this dumb
terminal that we call a browser it's
living in user mode and it's a view on
some text format instead of vt100 its
HTML then this happened and this is
super interesting because here someone
is deciding that the operating system
needs a little help so we're going to
make another operating system and we're
going to run it inside of this user mode
browser and that seemed like a really
cool idea and then these guys said yeah
we totally going to do that too and then
these guys are like hey remember us we
control YouTube and we have all these
other virtual machines out there with
all these operating systems that are
running inside of our browser so now
we've got an operating system inside of
a plug-in virtual machine inside of a
browser but that operating system is
legit it's a legitimate operating system
it's got memory management it's got its
own kind of threading it's got events
forget windows forget Mac forget Linux
you can go and write to this operating
system and that'll be that'll be a great
idea I won't it that'll be an awesome
idea and then we'll go and we'll have
the terminal thing be in there which is
bizarre I was recently at Toyota and I
had the oil changed on my car and the
guy said he needed to login to the
backend system that managed the
appointments for Toyota so he launched
windows logged into windows launched
Firefox went to a page launched Java
which then loaded a jar file which
contained a vt100 emulator which then
talked to a back-end mainframe and he
says and it's so much better than it
used to be
somebody thought that was a really great
idea and no one noticed while it was
happening do you guys know how to boil a
frog you know Holly boiler frog you turn
the heat up slow and the frog doesn't
know that he's being boiled by the time
the heat gets too hot well frogs dead
but imagine if you hadn't been on the
web for all this time imagine if you
didn't grow up through this process
maybe some of you some of the younger
people haven't then you're being thrown
into a hot water a hot pot as a frog and
you're gonna be like I'm not going to be
boiled today and you're going to jump
right out of that hot pot so you're
going to come up with a different
solution and I think that that's what's
happening the funny thing about the java
stuff was that you'd have this HTML that
represented some document because
remember that tim berners-lee original
view was this hyperlinked series of
documents and then you'd have an island
of activity like a little window on
another world that was this virtual
machine and you would know that it was
Java because there was always physics
demos in the entire internet consisted
of web pages and teapots and you knew
that a teapot was coming because you
navigate to the next page and then oh no
Java is coming and then it would load
and that was really awesome and then
you'd have a physics demo in your
browser and JavaScript was a toy right
javascript was this silly toy that
people would use to bring up alert boxes
or if you were really fancy do text
validation and that was an amazing use
of JavaScript and someone would say wow
i wish that i could do javascript like
that and they would make things that
people couldn't believe pac-man entirely
in javascript that's amazing oh my god i
can't believe they just make pac-man
javascript and they're like well i guess
javascript isn't only a toy but that
wasn't enough for some people
some people had to really break the
rules and they would implement entire
other operating systems in JavaScript
oops because what's good what good is it
to have that many layers if you can't
play gala go write this in my mind was
when that bit switched in my brain and I
realized that you could really do some
damage with JavaScript they had a
virtual machine now mind you a
twenty-five-year-old virtual machine
with 64 K of RAM but still a complete
virtual machine implemented on top of
something that we did not think was a
virtual machine Java scripts a toy how
do they get from alert and text box
validation to this and then this
happened and my mind was blown this is a
complete implementation of a x86 virtual
machine including pentium processor
flaws because that intel quality is job
zero point nine nine nine nine and it's
done entirely in javascript in there and
how do you know if it's JavaScript we
all know the trick you try to select it
oh my god I could select the text it
must be real because someone would show
you something and then you'd go you
right click and it would say flash and
you go come on that's cheating you're
using a real virtual machine javascripts
just a toy virtual machine well what if
I could take this toy virtual machine
and then compile something in c so now
I'm inside a browser running JavaScript
running Linux faking an x86 in user mode
and now i'm going to compile a see
application and then say hello world
that's disturbing but that wouldn't be
the most disturbing thing that i could
show you today this would be far more
disturbing
shall we let's let's fire up linux
inside of a browser inside of an iphone
simulator on windows so if you haven't
realized that javascript is the biggest
thing since God talked to Moses too much
it's a big deal then you have no soul
and I say that with all due respect so
JavaScript is no longer a toy javascript
is itself a complete operating system I
mean drink that in for a second we're
all fighting about macs and pcs and
Linux and we've got this JS operating
system for by of from the people that
has snuck in from the side asking
nothing of us just to love it and it has
all these things you've got web workers
for threading you've got events you've
got a half dozen different networking
options you've got passable garbage
collection you've got 3d and 2d this is
amazing and it's on the pocket
supercomputer that happens to ship and
my phone
this can actually be changed and you can
just say Excel and that will also be
true that is as true as it ever will be
in every day it becomes more true you've
got a complete operating system that
ships with your tiny mobile phone and it
lives inside the browser that's what we
should really be concerned that the
mobile people who want us writing native
apps are maybe not going to let that
move forward as much as it needs to now
the Zuckerberg said this he said that
html5 was a mistake for him it was a bet
I respectfully disagree I like this
quote instead the Avalanche has begun it
is too late for the pebbles to vote what
wise person said that anyone know any
guesses Babylon 5 it was actually costs
from Babylon 5 but thanks Lee done thank
you no prize for you though but a good
effort good effort thank you for going
out on a limb there I thought it was the
other guy too but no I was Kosh some of
our greatest wisdom one of our finest
philosophers whether or not Zuckerberg
thinks that it was a mistake doesn't
matter it's happening and he doesn't get
to vote and that's really powerful so
it's up to us the users the developers
and it's up to the vendors to make it
more enjoyable because it is going to
happen it has happened so get on board
why you still can html5 and css3 are
becoming really interesting now HTML
though that was really hard back in the
day do we all remember the first time we
learned HTML what was the hardest thing
that you could do in HTML was the most
the pinnacle of technical achievement in
HTML were tables because if you could
make a table and master the row span
well you could you could have a job like
that you know tables i dunno tables
rowspan and call span
please I I can nest tables up to the
actual theoretical maximum of nested
tables I actually know I was there when
I hit that maximum in in Mozilla that
there was a maximum number of nested
tables and I'm proud of that in this
time HTML is getting bigger and bigger
and bigger and the mark-up was getting
more and more and more complex and then
suddenly it disappeared suddenly the
markup didn't matter you could make
amazing things with a single element so
then maybe it's not all about html5 okay
what that would would have been is a
single element div class iPhone and 100
lines of CSS pure CSS no pngs no fancy
graphics hacks and the guy draws a
complete and perfectly pixel perfect
accurate iphone with CSS no JavaScript
one element the element doesn't even
really need to be there the element
could be implied I suppose but he needed
something to hang it on the fact that
people are doing stuff like that is
really significant and should give us
pause when we think about what's really
doing the work if HTML isn't involved
anymore if HTML is only the structure
then CSS is the look and the color and
the style but if you were going to take
that iphone and make it do something and
give it life it would have come down to
javascript because that's doing
everything else now there's lots of
implications around this for
accessibility there's lots of
amplification implications around Google
ability and what it means to have an
application that is primarily in
JavaScript but ultimately knowing
javascript is what you're going to have
to do to get a job yeah he did not nail
it in case anyone is confused at all so
we've got virtual machines we've got
complete implementations of other
operating systems we've got the ability
to create full applications and bring
them down with JavaScript it's
literally the assembly language of the
web who said that me I said that and
everyone else said that also because
it's totally true and anyone who doesn't
think that it's true is just wrong I
wrote a blog post about this where I
declared that that was the truth and
then immediately a bunch of people
declared that that was nonsense that was
insane well maybe it's not the assembly
language of the web maybe it's the lisp
of the web or maybe they just making up
all sorts of other stupid analogies to
go against my analogy so I called some
people that know JavaScript like the guy
who invented it and he said that's
that's actually Brendan Fraser the actor
there on the left but but that's Brendan
Eich but he's prettier so Brendan Fraser
Brendan Fraser said that he said also
that javascript is the x86 of the web
which is pretty much close to saying
it's the simulators the web but he can't
claim that it's original this is what's
great about thoughts like this is that
they are all original thoughts because
we all had them at one time or another
it's just whoever tweets it first it's
to claim it's their their idea but when
he said that and then when Douglas
Crockford agreed it's like okay this is
pretty clear that's happening so what do
you do when you have this this assembly
language that you can start targeting
well you start building languages on top
of it because what better thing to do
than to write a layer of abstraction on
it so coffeescript is this kind of
lovely layer that targets JavaScript and
our very own Anders will present on
wednesday about typescript which is
another layer on top of javascript to
make it friendlier to make it the
language that we wish it could be
because remember that JavaScript
happened in a fairly organic way and I
don't think anyone necessarily likes all
aspects of it so there's a little bit of
tidying up that's happening it's unclear
whether that will happen with languages
like typescript and coffee script or
whether that will be fixed in the next
version of JavaScript or not but the
point is it's on everyone's machine and
it is a free virtual machine we need to
start used little izing but i would
encourage people to not
layers hi too much complexity you've got
this JavaScript operating system in this
virtual machine and people are
continuing to build layers on top of
layers there's another fun quote no one
writes JavaScript anymore they write
jquery I don't like meeting programmers
that tell me that they're awesome
JavaScript programmers and then you
realize that without jquery they would
not be able to program now that's
different than being unable to program
without google which is something that i
can admit to i am completely incapable
of programming without google but you
need to be able to write JavaScript at
the root this was the case 20 or 30
years ago when I first learned see
before I learned see I had to take an
assembler class because the see guys are
like C is going to let your really
powerful thing son and I need you to
understand what those powerful things
are really doing under the hood so let's
learn x86 first now people don't do that
now they say Java and C sharp son are
going to allow you to do some really
powerful things so you're going to need
to learn C first and they're slow and
pretty soon it's going to be like foo
foo script from Anders Hiles Berg jr.
it's going to allow you to do really
powerful things but we're going to look
at C sharp first before we learn that
who said that well I also said that
because everyone says that you really
want to build these amazing things you
get this image in your mind about all
the cool stuff that you're going to snap
together with these components and if
you snap them together without thinking
about your components they're going to
end up looking different from what you
expect and you're not sure who you're
going to be able to blame
and then you're going to feel sad so I
would encourage people to try one
javascript library one JavaScript by
vanilla j/s this is a little bit of a
tease but it needs to make us remember
what we're standing on top of whose
shoulders are we standing on top of and
when we go and create our new startup
and before we make our startup we say
all right all right we're going to make
the world's greatest to-do list it's
going to be awesome but before we write
to do list we need to write a new domme
traversal library it's going to be way
better than everything before it we need
to ask ourselves are we really rewriting
you know Malik is our Malik going to be
better than the one that's built in so I
think we need to expect more of our web
tools and I think there's still a lot of
innovation to be had there to remember
that we've got these virtual machines
and when you're designing a system don't
forget that you have that virtual
machine available on the client and you
can make that do some really interesting
stuff on the cloud you've got this great
scale this elasticity you've got your
choice of languages but on the browser
you've got accelerated graphics even a
crappy android phone has a dual
processor and the slightly less crappy
ones have four get them working you've
got this integrated vm that's running
let mcleod you can have unlimited
virtual machines and you can use
whatever language makes you happy in the
browser you can either write JavaScript
or target JavaScript and if you remember
that the users virtual machine is part
of the cloud as well what could you do
to put that to work so I would encourage
you to be thinking about this it's it's
happening really fast and I recognize
that the Internet is moving forward
quicker than we can get our brains
around but you're not obsolete you have
the computer science concepts you think
about this kind of stuff I hope I've
given you a slightly different way to to
think about things so that you will feel
that you are powerful and might design
your systems in a slightly different way
remember that there's a new operating
system that's shipping every single day
and you just have to press f5 to reboot
it
so get to work thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
