I'm going to talk today to you about how
a little bit about the history of how
the image and the CEO types of the
software developer came about and yes
you are in the future of IT track but as
you all might know that sometimes it
helps to look at history to then think
about the future and so in the second
part I'm going to talk a bit about how
this this image is still a big factor in
holding us back from becoming a more
diverse workforce which is some
something that sometimes seems a lot
more futuristic to me than self-driving
cars and things like that because our
progress they are so slow so I am a
programmer have been programming for
about 15 16 years now I've been doing it
for about 11 years professionally and
fortunately I still get to code almost
every day because I'm fortunate enough
to work for a company who believes in
coding architects and tech leads and I'm
assuming that a large part of the
audience also would say that they are
programmers or they work with
programmers and I personally try to
complete the sentence or this definition
what is a programmer quite a lot in my
day-to-day life for example when I when
I'm involved in recruiting and I to hire
new programmers for the company I work
for or when people ask me what I do for
a living but also in terms of my
identity because I really love my job so
it's a big part of my life so I've been
thinking about this a lot over the past
15 16 years what does it mean to be a
programmer but if we went outside on the
street right now maybe on Alexander
Platz and asked people what a programmer
is maybe these images were pop into
their heads more the inventors and
entrepreneurs and tech although at least
one of these guys is not even a
programmer as far as I know another
image that might pop into people's heads
is this one of kind of the hacker
wizards the geniuses who can access a
terminal by cracking polymorphic
algorithms apparently I've never done
that but so this I don't think that this
is representative of the vast majority
of so
fry developers and I would go out on a
limb and assume that most of you here in
this room would not would not identify
with this so I turn to history and I
learned a lot about the history of our
profession and how it first came about
from this book the computer boys take
over it's written by a computing
historian his name is Nathan Ensminger
and he talks about lot of stuff in the
book like for example how the discipline
of computer science first came about how
they named it how computers and software
first started disrupting businesses how
the first explosion of languages
happened but what I want to summarize
for you a little bit is about how he
describes our profession our the origins
of our profession so a reasonable place
to start is then with the first
programmers right but we already hit a
little bit of a wall there because i
entered first computer into google com
and asked a computer into google germany
and you actually get different results
so on google com the first result that
comes up is the e niak and on the german
google the first result is cannot suz's
Teti so what you do first programmers
those that program the tech guy or the
or the e niak but i'm showing you this
because this is actually reminder that
most of the source is most of the
information i will present to you in
this talk is actually from us American
sources a few UK sources actually I
still think that's very valid because
the US tech industry has a huge impact
still on the global industry and
especially the culture there's just a
reminder when you interpret what I tell
you that this is very much from the US
perspective because I'm going to start
with the first programmers of the in yak
and they are sometimes called the ENIAC
girls I prefer to call them the Enoch
women and they've been in the media more
and more over the past few years I feel
so if you might have heard about them
and the more I learned about them the
more fascinated I became with them and I
want to show you a short excerpt of an
interview with a woman called Jean
Bartik she was one of the six women who
are
generally called the iliac women and
what they did is they they wrote a
program for the ENIAC that could
calculate weapons trajectories and that
was something that they would usually do
with pen and paper and I actually don't
know what other help they had but just
sitting in a room a group of women
calculating these over hours and they
wanted to write a program to have the
computer do that and i'm going to show
you this video and it's from the
computer history museum's website so
let's see if the sound works
Snyder and I from the beginning were a
pair and I think I don't know many of
you who worked ugly but I believe that
the best program is the best design and
all this stuff is done by pairs because
you can criticize each other and you
know find each other's errors and use
the best ideas and it really works very
well later on I have thought about why I
word when bidding I become so successful
and we were successful and I think it's
because we were finishers because most
people like to do the fun part of a
design or a program but they hate doing
that nasty little details that usually
take more than me middleton side and so
you have to take care of everything and
think of everything so that it works
well I was good at it but many was even
better than I am she was fantastic the
smartest thing we did was to have
Marland and Ruth calculate a trajectory
exactly the same way the Antioch did it
you know and time by had time well this
is the document that made people respect
us because of those 18,000 vacuum tubes
we could find the one that wasn't
working in a very few minutes with that
and we were never people never
recognized in your act as though we knew
what we were doing I mean we were in a
lot of pictures but they never ask us
anything well we did all having for the
meeting was it was absurd so I really
recommend that you also watch the full
version of this I think was like a 45
minute long interview but she's actually
a very nice storyteller very
entertaining and has some interesting
anecdotes from from her time working on
the in yak and also after that some
stories around John von Neumann you
might have heard of the
roman architecture and so it's quite
entertaining but from this excerpt
actually there were two things that
really struck me the first one you might
have noticed right at the beginning of
the clip she basically talks about pair
programming and these women didn't have
any role models to look to how to do
this job and they decided the best way
to do it would be to work together and
use each other's ideas and criticize
each other and it took us decades it
took us 60 years or so until this became
a general practice in our industry and
became and got a name with a pair
programming which probably came about
mostly with Kent backs book on extreme
programming and the second thing is that
when she talks about this this document
that those other two women wrote that
were done at time buy ad time what the
in dec was supposed to do that's another
one of those things that we take for
granted today we constantly compare what
we expect with the actual results to
test and to debug and we don't even
think about that anymore but again these
these women didn't have anybody to look
at like how what is the best way to do
this to debug this and they already came
up with that let's have what we actually
expect to come out of this and then
compare it to what the computer does
when something goes wrong so I found
that amazing so here they are I think
these are actually Jean Bartik and Betty
Snyder holberton that she talked about a
program that's Jean there I think and as
you might have known and as you can see
here it was a much more mechanical
almost switchboard like process at the
time and it was considered much more
handicraft in science and not very
intellectual and the women who did this
at the time the term programmer wasn't
even around yet and they were called
computers or operators and another thing
that ensminger mentions is that the term
coder was also around and it was very
much associated with this
non-intellectual handicraft work and
also associated with the female gender &amp;amp;
ensminger says in his book that for
years after that later male programmers
try to distance themselves from this
term because it was associated with
those things so at this time there were
very high hopes for computers very
exciting time so they
finally had electronic touring complete
computers and were figuring out how to
make them better and faster but nobody
was actually paying much attention to
software yet they thought that would
just be something on the side you know
some Engineer would come up with the
flowchart and then somebody would put it
into the computer like Stephanie Shirley
says she's this amazing woman who
founded one of the first UK software
companies in 1962 and she says software
was given away free at the time with
hardware and nobody would buy software
and certainly not from a woman is what
she has but it soon became clear that
the challenge of software development
actually had been really underestimated
so they started to realize that
programming is hard and a lot harder
than they thought it would be so here's
a short quote from Maurice Wilkes a
british computer scientist
so he realized it was basically
impossible for him not to make arrows so
he would probably spend the rest of his
life finding those arrows and his own
programs and also in the press at the
time in the 50s and 60s there were a lot
of stories going around like that of the
Mariner one probe that they tried to
send to Venus and it steered of course
and they had to destroy it and there
were all these urban legends going
around why that happens and one of them
was that there was a dot instead of a
comma in a Fortran statement and that's
why it went of course so it's very much
debated if that was actually the reason
there are some other theories out there
but it just shows that the stories out
there that made people believe that
programmers had to be really really good
to do that job because it was so easy to
to make arrows and then they might be
really expensive so the view of the
programming in the 50s and 60s was that
of kind of magic or black art also of
course at the time every computer was
different so every programmer had to
figure out again with a new computer how
to use it so that made it even more
mysterious how to do this job also they
believed that programmers are born not
made because they couldn't figure out it
was this totally new profession they
couldn't figure out what other skills
that you need because there was no
computer science discipline at the
University so they just had to hire
people and train them in this but who do
you hire for this so they decided oh you
have to be born for this because it's so
magical so we can't it's hard to really
make you a programmer and this is quite
a famous quote by a by IBM when a
programmer is good he's very very good
but when he's bad he's horrid you might
still hear that today right so um people
believe that you could only use the
really best programmers because it was
so error-prone then they also couldn't
really figure out what the skills were
that you need it so they believed you
have to be born to be a programmer and
then you have to be identified somehow
and at the same time the demand was
rising rapidly so they needed more and
more programmers and this was around the
time that the term software crisis was
first coined in the 60s which describes
the situation where we need a lot of
good people to do this job but there's
just never enough supply and you might
argue that the software crisis has been
going on ever since then because we're
still in that situation today
so how did they try to hire these
magical beings at the time here's one
example this is an edge that was posted
by IBM in the New York Times in May 1968
and it's titleist are you the man to
command electronic Giants and then it
goes on and they're looking for
candidates who enjoy musical composition
and arrangement people who like chess
bridge or anagrams or simply possess a
lively imagination and they received
exactly 7 replies and consider that an
excellent return on investment so
another thing apart from these these
kind of quirky ads that they that they
came up with was aptitude tests so a
number of tests that filtered for trays
that people at the time thought were
essential to good programming like
logical thinking and abstract reasoning
and in 1962 about eighty percent of
businesses who needed to recruit
programmers used some form of aptitude
tests half of them use the IBM patch the
programmer aptitude test and in 1967
alone 700,000 people took this IBM Pat
and that has had three parts the first
part was that he had to complete a
number sequence you know series of
numbers what's the next one the second
part was kind of geometric comparison so
which shape fits into this group of
shape and the third one was kind of word
problems like in high school mathematics
so very mass heavy actually and if you
ask yourself now the scores of these
700,000 people if they actually
correspond it to their performance as
programmers later we don't know because
most companies didn't even check and
those who did they didn't really find a
correlation but some thought that
aptitude tests were not enough so they
also turn to personality profiles this
is the from the title page of paper from
1966 it was written by two psychologists
and the title is a vocational interests
kale for computer programmers I
she had to look up this word vocational
when I first read it so it's kind of in
German Buffon yeah so when you go to a
job center as a young adult and say okay
this these are kind of the things that I
like what do you think would be a good
job for me that I would be happy and for
the rest of my life and so this was the
personality profile they came up with
for programmers and it was close to
engineering and chemistry not even that
close to physics and mathematics there
was a slight correlation with musicians
actually but otherwise it was pretty
similar to white-collar work and a few
things that these two gentlemen mr.
Kenan and mr. Perry decided about
programmers was that they're crazy about
puzzles they tend to like research
applications and risk-taking they
dislike routine and regimentation I
don't know if any of you recognize
yourselves in this but then they came up
with one characteristic that was quite
unusual and it's actually in no other or
in as far as i know i know how that
profile and that's that they don't like
people so they said programmers prefer
to work with things rather than people
they don't like to interact and they
accompanied this whole thing with these
like kind of ridiculous cartoons I don't
really know why if they weren't taking
themselves seriously or so in the in the
top left corner there is the guy who
likes puzzles and then there's the risk
taker in the upper right corner the guy
who likes research applications and in
the bottom right corner he is the grumpy
guy doesn't like people and it's a
smoker apparently I don't know if all
smokers don't like people I'm sure
that's not true so we're laughing about
this and as i said i was a bit confused
that they had these cartoons because it
seemed like it wasn't really serious but
i want to tell you a bit about the
context in which this paper was written
the authors were paid by a company
called SDC and SDC at the time was hired
by IBM to work on a huge military
projects project the sage project the
semi automated ground environment air
defense system like so many early
software and computer projects it was a
military project
it was one of the the largest software
projects at the time an SDC in 1956
employed 700 programmers to give you a
context of that that was about
three-fifths of the available
programmers in the u.s. at the time and
then five years later they had hired
seven thousand more programmers so they
say of themselves that they trained the
industry at the time and a long time
after that you could in a lot of IT
departments in the US you could still
find at least one or two alumni from
from this company so surprised seven
hundred thousand individuals just in one
year took the same test to determine if
they would be hired as programmers and
the company who says of themselves that
they trained the industry subscribe to a
personality profile that included the
tray that programmers don't like people
and ants manga actually concludes in the
book that these hiring practices
resulted in a primary selection
mechanism for anti-social mathematically
inclined males if you remember the pad
for example was very math focused and
therefore those types of people were
over-represented in the programmer
population which in turn again
reinforced the popular perception about
what the job was and then maybe put some
people off and attracted other people so
it kind of self perpetuated itself and I
have to say he makes a he makes a pretty
good point so I want to fast forward now
from the 60s about 30 to 40 years and
give you some quotes to read again
so these words are from the late 90s and
you can see this theme of you know this
belief of you have to be born to be a
programmer is still actually quite
present and these and other quotes
really resonated with me and they are
from a book called unlocking the
clubhouse by Jane Margolis and Ellen
Fischer and what they did is they they
put together a group of computer science
students at carnegie mellon university
in the US and conducted interview
interviews with them over the course of
about four or five years 1995 to 1999
and it was about a 50-50 gender ratio
and they asked some questions like why
did you choose to go into computer
science what motivates you how do you
feel at this moment in time or for those
of them who dropped out over their time
they asked them why did you drop out why
did you stop doing this and there are
lots of quotes here in here that can
give us an idea of what the image in our
heads of programmers is today even
programmers themselves and here are two
more
these quotes are not just from women by
the way also from from men but sometimes
this effect has a bit more because we
already stand out a little bit like a
sore thumb because we look different and
so what these people were experiencing
was that they actually started off with
computer science we're really excited
about it and then they saw these other
people around them with this eat sleep
code repeat attitude and they thought oh
okay so they're really passionate about
this so I'm not that passionate I guess
I think I'm more balanced and I enjoy
this but it's not my life so they were
starting to think out maybe I don't
belong here after all because I don't
seem to be as passionate about this as
other people and they dropped out and
there's really interesting exchange
between two to computer science high
school teachers described in the book
about what we expect passion to look
like and i would like to quote that for
you it happens to be a male teacher and
a female teacher and the male teacher
starts off with an email saying that he
comes across a lot of boys in his
classes who really love computers and
several parents have told him that their
sons would be on the computer
programming all night if they could and
he says i've yet to run into a girl like
that they look at me funny when I talk
about programming is fun and then the
female teacher responds and she doesn't
respond with reasons why girls are just
different than boys or things like that
but she says that she calls out what she
thinks is his miss assumption and one
that she also sees in her students it's
that we're looking in the wrong places
or not enough places for signs of why
you might be interested in computers she
talks about herself and says that when
she started she really loved she really
loved programming when she learned it at
school but that didn't mean that she
stayed up all night doing it but she
still loved it and girls may show their
love for computers and computer science
very differently but we're only looking
in one place so for using a single model
to identify potential programmers we
will miss many potential students
so do we also have a scale in our heads
and don't even realize it and what does
it do when we're to us when we're
interviewing candidates or when we're
describing to other people what our job
is like or when we're thinking about
what we have to do to get the next job
and we have 50 github projects up and
running and stuff like that but also
what might it due to some people's
identity there's a blog post on medium
by a woman named erica joy Baker called
the other side of diversity and I think
it's about two years old it was really
eye-opening to me when I read this it
describes what effect the lack of
diversity had on her over as an
african-american woman working in the
tech industry for about 10 years
sticking out like a sore thumb all the
time kind of low stress level
continuously and a few quotes from this
text are I continue to lose myself for
the sake of being included amongst my
co-workers and I feel like I've lost my
entire cultural identity in an effort to
be part of the IT culture and the the
caption they're actually says at work
wearing the uniform and she's talking
about unisex t-shirt jeans and sneakers
so and she only realized this after 10
years of working in the industry that
she had been adapting to what was around
her to fit in and had actually lost her
own identity through this so this is a
really good reminder why diversity
always has to come with inclusion and
inclusivity words that have been have
been popping up a lot more over the past
one or two years so fortunately it has
never been this bad for me but reading
her story also made me think about what
what my journey has been an IT and
reflect on that and I realized that I've
often tried to just emphasize those
parts of me that fit the image in my and
my head and also what i thought was
around me better and just stayed more
quiet about the ones that don't for
example the many times that i've said at
a dinner table with all my male
colleagues talking about their first
computers and i actually started
programming when i was too
too I think so I thought my first
computer already had windows on it and
you know i paid tetris and so I could
never join into those conversations but
on the other end I'm just a bit louder
and more live when I can talk about how
I love science fiction and fantasy
because that seems to fit right in the
mold so before I finish I want to ask
you for a few things the first one is
don't think the status quo is just
natural ol boys just like computers more
so that's why this is what it is and
it's going to continue like that for
example something that I've always
wondered about is why such a majority of
programmers seem to like science fiction
and fantasy so where does that
inclination come from what is that
correlation i actually had discussions
about this over over drinks and after
reading these things I realized oh my
god there's no natural link at all it's
just us hiring ourselves over and over
again and then people self-selecting
themselves into our group because they
are similar to that or not deciding to
join us because they're different from
what they see on the surface so don't
let a few guys in the 60s still
determine who we hire and how people
perceive us the second thing is stop
acting so surprised I don't know if who
of you has ever set or has it set to
them a sentence is like oh you don't
look like a programmer it's a small
thing but when you're somebody who
already feels like like you stick out
like you have to prove yourself because
your assumed competence level is
different from people around you because
you look different or I have different
interests and you hear this over and
over then this can actually have a
significant cumulative effect that you
start believing or maybe I do not belong
here and this is a phenomenon called
micro aggressions and there's some
really good articles out there that you
recommend that i recommend you read one
of them is this one i'll give you a way
to get to all these sources at the end
so and part of this is also just to
avoid incredulity like what really you
don't you don't know this or you don't
know the difference between Star Trek
and Star Wars just be happy you know
that they don't because then you
can explain it to them that's awesome
right so another little story maybe I
had a conversation with a journalist
once and he was doing a documentary
about programmers and it was at an event
and he asked me so what do you do at
ThoughtWorks did you organize this event
and i said no i'm a software developer
and he said oh wow cool so does that
mean you're also write code or that's
like how you're doing a documentary
about programmers you should know what
they do and lastly I've said it a few
times over the course of this challenge
your image of the real programmer for
example let go of the notion that only
people who spend every free minute
programming can be good at this because
let's face it no amount of time spent
doing this in our free time can actually
get us up to speed on everything we have
to deal with today with things like you
have to do ops on top of dev
microservices poly everything on your
craft write better tests get better at
interacting with people like we one
single person cannot do that so it's all
about it it is magic indeed just very
different from the one that they thought
it was in the in the 60s so real
programmers for me are those who know
that they cannot do this all by
themselves and create an environment
where everybody embraces cooperation and
doesn't make each other feel stupid and
work together instead of pushing for
rock stars and the genius programmers
and an environment like this might even
be more attractive to new pools of
people that that we haven't even been
tapping into in recruiting so that a
truly diverse workforce without contempt
culture is the future of ite to me but
again it sometimes seems less realistic
than machines taking decisions for us so
I summed all of this and a little bit
more up in an article that my colleague
Martin Fowler was nice enough to put on
its website that's the link up there and
you can find all the resources that i
mentioned in the talk below that article
as well and also link to the video and
we have two copies of the unlocking the
clubhouse book
at our booth at the thought works booth
and it's part of the sweepstakes that is
being done at go to and that was all and
please give me some feedback and write
the session and if anybody has questions
this is a pretty small room so if if you
feel like you want to go out for an
early lunch feel free to do so but if
you want to if you have some comments or
questions maybe come up front and we can
have a little discussion still have
fifteen minutes before lunch to
officially start so I would love to have
some conversations about this thanks
okay so thank you very much for the for
the talk I think diversity is a really
important question an important issue
and I was wondering where the IT can
even help with for example giving advice
for meeting better solutions in fitness
Diagnostics imagine arm imagine the
toolkit imagine software that somehow
rates are an applicant to job position
not armed by brigid eyes somehow but
based on a little bit algorithms and
machine learning and whatever so that
the decision will be a little bit more
accurate is it easy to think is it a way
to solve this or two to move towards
this diversity it's a super hard right I
don't think we can ever do this
objectively and also may be doing this
totally objectively at this point in
time with the with a demographic makeup
that we have might actually not even
solve the problem because we we have to
go through a transition time now where
we actually maybe a favor becoming more
diverse over some other things but there
is something around standardization I
think so not algorithms maybe about
standardization for example we're
currently at all works you are thinking
about moving not accepting resumes
anymore but having a standard set of
questions that we ask people that they
can answer so it becomes a bit more
comparable and it also gets rid of some
of the the biases that we get that we
don't even want just by looking at the
resume I can Germany we sort of pictures
on them right so we still got in Germany
a lot of resumes with pictures then you
look at maybe if you're a stickler for
form then you see something that they
formatted in the resume that you don't
like and it's a little thing but all
those things are your first impression
so there's something around
standardization I think maybe that can
get that can get rid of some of those
biases but yeah I'm very skeptical of
algorithms and machines deciding that
for us yeah
it's super hard I think you
hi so my question was something similar
but I would like to so not algorithms
for sure because because I think this is
a very subjective this is this is not
something that you can just standardized
you know how our programming this this
is a profession you don't I there are
very few profession that you can
standardize basically and this does not
seem to me at least to be one of them so
subjectively what would you look for in
a good like what do you think make
something somebody a good programmer or
even you know you know as a student I'm
a student so any sort of advice for
budding programmers that you might have
it's also hard questions haha I do
interviews with with people that we want
to hire so I asked myself at all the
time and I never had like have like a
good like only in hindsight I can I can
sometimes saving things and it in terms
of hard skills I think it depends on
what area of software development you
need somebody for so I think that for if
you're a full stack developer to do a
business application I don't necessarily
expect you to know ten algorithms by
heart but for me it's a lot more
important you know things like curiosity
not being dogmatic but being open to
other ways of doing things how you work
with other people I mean it's all very
high level but it's it's more about
attitude for me because it's also you
were mentioning a standard in terms of
hard skills it's it changes every year
right so I was actually talking to a to
a friend recently who has been on
maternity leave and is now starting
wants to come back into the job and
she's freaking out a little bit about
all the things she needs to know and I
told her actually it's a it's a great
time actually now because things are
changing all the time anyway so all the
people that you're going to join on a
team they're not going to know these
necessarily as well because especially
like when you're in front end
development with JavaScript changing so
if you know the things like if you can
put things into buckets quickly like
this is a build tool this is something
that I automate server installation with
you know and then those are the things
that are important I just want to add
something I think it might be simpler
and strong algorithms or machine
learning as a problem there was this
experiment where contributions to open
source software where they just hits
agenda of Sir contributor and then all
of a sudden the contributions from women
they were immediately more often
accepted than before I think could apply
is the same for let's say for applicants
and if you look at resumes if you remove
the gender already then you might
already have this is an ease around that
yeah yeah just one strata nice talk but
I seem to remember as a story is that
when they remove to gender there was
more stereotype pics in the end because
basically you're reading direct
remaining parts and are looking for what
you expect and I wanted to add one thing
it seems you have to learn one way or
another many things to get a good
software developer and it really depends
on the culture of the company how you
can teach your program as the new stuff
as you said if you leave for one year
you might not know anything when I went
to your current project and they are
people around that really notes that try
to learn everything for themselves and
they would set the pace and everyone
else has to get up to speed and have to
learn the thing how they do it doesn't
matter if they learn it from a colleague
or learn about themselves during
night sessions or weekends it doesn't
matter so it's a google skank height
right that we always think how am I
freaking out about it and I don't know
if you've heard about this term impostor
syndrome where people think Oh
somebody's going to find out that I
actually don't know what they think i
know and i think a big factor and i
think that a lot of people in ite have
imposter syndrome and I think it's
generally said that people in very high
performing jobs often office and I think
one of the main reasons is that we
usually just see the tip of the iceberg
of what what people do so we see the
things that they do good we see the
things that they they can talk about but
we don't see all the work they had to
put in to get there we don't see all the
things that they do not know so and we
compare ourselves to that so we have to
focus more on the things on our tip of
the iceberg like the things that we do
know the things and the work we put into
that and where we were successful and
then share that with others as well and
be all be more vulnerable about that and
and in the end we are really suspect to
the survival by us because we only hire
people we think they might do what we
expect them but the ones we turn back we
never evaluate if they would have fitted
yeah so nobody is perfect in any sense
and electing who can do the work who
cannot and I mean all the stories about
bias is how you know maybe if you take
it away it might become worse or it's
it's super complicated right but I
really hope that there's a lot of noise
about stuff at the moment as well like
people going back and forth and things
like code of conduct all the discussion
about it and I really hope that it's all
that noise is a sign of the growing
pains that we're actually in a
transition and things are happening and
changing but I hope that's true I also
wanted to add about the tip of the
iceberg and you also mentioned magic
tasks of programmers I guess the
comparison to magicians is quite well it
because medicines also have much
practice they do much practice at home
or in the hidden and now we see some
magic trick and we are also quest but
it's only practice it's not yet nothing
special it's all illusion right yes it's
an illusion and I guess everyone can
practice you no matter if from or men so
um it only depends on time and now it
can become worse when you have too much
passion yeah that's the point where you
as a magician needs you to think about
yeah how much life do we want to invest
sex-positive
so I have another question to ask as
Linda said in the morning we do have
some stereotypes and we do like to open
boxes in order to fit the people into I
was wondering whether um we will somehow
have an attitude towards more
personalized treatment of human
resources are more personalized even
these Fitness Diagnostics so all these
more personalized services and the more
personalized view on diversity because
diversity is not just the gender
question it's not just the question of
age it's not only question of illnesses
it arises at n at every point more or
less do you think our personalization
might be a solution what do you mean by
personalization well you just imagine
personalized medical treatment arm based
on your well scientifically proved
genomic profile on think of personalized
I'm psychotherapy or think of
personalized human resource training
that choice that makes the effort to
give you an empowerment which is suited
right for you well I hope that's already
happening at least like where where I
work it's definitely happening like
people are seen as individuals and I
work for a software consultancy so in a
consultancy you always have this this
function where you where you have to
staff people on two projects right so
and it's super complicated because you
have so many dimensions you have like
the skills for that particular project
where that project is and where people
live what type of roles you need all
that stuff and there's always one factor
in there as well what the personal
preferences of the person are what
they're a living situation is all that
stuff and it's you know those people
always try to put to make it to optimize
it for everybody as much as they can
it's never possible in this particular
example but that for me it's just just
one example that I hope that I hope that
you work for companies that that look at
you as an individual and try to
try to push you as an individual not as
one of a hundred developers the last
question my question is do you know if
any if there's any different countries
or other culture where things are better
like in a way that not not as awful as
things I've actually done that question
a lot after I published the interview
and I only know of one country where the
number of women in tech leadership
positions like technical leads and teams
is is higher than that of men and that
is the Philippines I don't know of and I
don't know why but that is what I know I
on my previous job I worked with a
delivery center there once and i also
have heard it confirmed in in other
sources so if you know any other
countries where it's different and yeah
maybe let me know but so i'm in this
panel where we try to get more women
into IT at my university and one of the
things we found is that I think it's
Malaysia where are the more women in the
IT industry in general lot more women
because it's looked down upon because
real men do labour outside I interesting
so so in the countries where top down
upon it's really that we have a lot of
women and that's also what it used to be
like in I'm from Denmark in the old days
because it was just a typing job and
that's on but then when it became a
prestigious job men came in from CODIS
to promise interesting okay thank you
very much
and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
