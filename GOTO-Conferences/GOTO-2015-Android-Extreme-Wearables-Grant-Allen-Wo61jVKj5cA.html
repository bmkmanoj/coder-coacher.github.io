work for Google I'm a technology program
manager I also advise a bunch of
startups in London where I'm based but
also Berlin New York and a few other
locations and more than happy to talk to
startups in Amsterdam it's a great city
I love coming here I advise VCS on how I
can spend their money so if you have any
spare money you'd like me to spend for
you I'm more than happy to invest in
some good wearable startup companies for
you and I tend to make a lot of trouble
and say some outrageous things including
some very bad jokes you don't have to
laugh at any of my jokes but what got me
into talking about Android and to
talking about wearables was a really bad
habit of saying yes whenever somebody
asked me to write a book and so I've
written these 30 co-written in the case
of some of these in fact there another
three as well that don't really have
anything to do with with Android or
wearables but this is what got me into
trouble with wearables and that's kind
of one of the reasons why I'm here today
all right but that's really tedious if
I'm just talking about me so let's get
that out the way I promise to never
mention myself again what I really want
to focus on today is extreme wearables
and some of the things you could do with
wearables if you decided to completely
reinvent revolutionize up and change
what people think of when they think of
wearables when they think of mobile
devices I'm going to throw some
statistics in every now and again just
to give you an idea of how big we're
talking about when we talk about
wearable markets when we talk about the
opportunity out there if you remember
you're all going to be building your own
wearable device by the end of today that
I said by the end of today right you're
ready for that you okay good so let's
talk about how big things are going to
be and how big things are right now so
you you can appreciate the scale we
currently have a roundabout I think this
might have ticked over to 7.3 billion
people and about 2.9 to 3 billion of
those 7.3 billion on the planet who have
some form of connection to
a communications network whether it's
the internet whether it's something more
straightforward or primitive that's
roughly thirty nine forty percent of the
population are online today in some form
in five and a half years by the time we
get to 2020 the population will have
grown to eight billion but more
importantly the number of people
connected will be the same they will
converge pretty much everyone on the
planet with a few outliers will have
some form of connectivity now it's not
going to be a good old notebook computer
here or the big desktop machine which is
rapidly dying out it's probably not even
going to be a smart phone that gets most
of these other people online it's going
to be a device that they've bought for
fashion purposes for information
purposes because it's a really cheap
information device or it may even be
where wearables and the Internet of
Things kind of blur someone may have
bought a very cheap home appliance
around the world some of the key
appliances people look for are things
like something to purify your water
because getting clean drinking water is
a huge struggle in a lot of parts of the
world well if you had a smart drinking
water filter that could tell you how
pure of the water was after it was
filtered that might be your online
device if it's sharing data back to a
network or gathering local information
about problems with the water supply in
the area that day you may have got
online through the den of a water
purifier instead of a computer or a
phone but the big opportunity here is
there are five point two ish billion
people who are going to have their first
experience of a connected world and it
could be through the wearable device
that you make so you're going to be
making them by the end of today and you
need to make 5.2 billion of them you've
got a few years to do that right but
you're ready for that kind of output how
many of you run production factories
anywhere okay a couple good okay so oh
yeah we're just about squeeze these on
that growth curve in the human
population is like this the online
connectivity goes like this the wearable
adoption is growing even faster and this
is how we can make this this connection
between everyone being online
in 2020 and most of that coming through
some kind of wearable device or
non-traditional phone or computer device
that gets them online so just by the end
of this year the now number by the way
was from December last year so it's not
quite now anymore by the end of 2015 we
will have gone from about 100 million
wearable devices actually sold not just
shipped to distributors or sitting in a
warehouse but actually sold by the end
of this year it will be 1 billion
devices and I was in Shanghai three
weeks ago talking at a conference over
there and they gave me a booklet that
was about this thick and on every page
with 10 different wearable devices I had
no idea they're literally you can go to
Taiwan Shanghai Hong Kong and buy 5,000
different kinds of wearable device
immediately three and a half thousand of
those are watches so how long is your
arm how many watches can you wear it
once but you get the idea the variety is
exploding the take-up is exploding it's
it's a big opportunity lots and lots of
room to play room to experiment in the
wearables world and do extreme things so
let's let's get down to what can you do
about it how many Android developers are
in the room right now good good right
you folks have got some work to do today
to teach everyone else some Android
development the next a little bit of
what of what I want to talk about is
about where Google has gone with Android
recently and a few highlights of things
that are very very pertinent to how you
might design apps for both mobile and
wearables now with some of the new
features and also some interesting
changes that we've made to help with
some of the biggest single problems that
people encounter with wearables so this
is quick I promise for the non
developers in the room there's very
little code in fact I think there's like
three words that come from code so your
chance to become a coder will have to
happen to one of the other sessions okay
so attempting to destroy the mic here
this is this is a game I call spot the
wearable where is the wearable it's on
his arm right it is so this is the ad
that we launched there's the wearable
right there
this is a wonderful beautiful country
kitchen this seen this kitchen is about
the size of my apartment so I'm kind of
joe this is what Californians do when
they invent marketing right everyone
lives in the giant four-bedroom house
and you'll have you know enough space
for the the table that only holds the
fruit so this was the the ideal
marketing notion of what would happen
you'd buy a wearable device it would fit
beautifully into your daily life into
your giant beautiful kitchen and your
quiet afternoon preparation or morning
preparation maybe he's making coffee
there or something like that this didn't
really turn out to be the reality a year
two years after wearables hit the market
people who bought Jawbone's fitbit's
Android watches people are discovering
it now with the iWatch and so forth this
scene turns into something that looks
more like this right people buy all
kinds of wearables we've got running
gear like vests and shirts and so forth
this is a baby monitor thing to like
literally monitor the heart rate
breathing the audio that people buy the
little baby monitors for this can do
that as well babies make some terrible
noises I'm just saying I'm going to put
that out there and let you imagine what
some of those noises might be you'll
have 15 different watches a couple of
fit bands there were socks here
somewhere they might have scrolled off
the side of the screen there's a pattern
that we see that people buy a device and
if they like it they'll buy a
complementary device will try a
different one or upgrade but one of the
biggest problems that people who design
wearables have is that you adopt a
wearable you use it and you get the
thing that nags you to say grant you're
like this athletic figure doesn't look
after itself you better get up and do
some exercise and after a while you get
sick of that and you just leave it in
the drawer and you never come back to it
and then you draw a fills up with all
these so it's been an issue people are
happy to try things especially with the
prices plummeting and i'll show you how
low the prices can go but what makes
people come back to use them we use this
phrase to describe
what it will take for a wearable device
to really catch on and and it's called
would you go back for it would you turn
around for it so imagine you're leaving
home in the morning you're going to work
or you're going to your your cafe where
you meet with your your friends to do
your startup stuff for your cycling
through the streets of Amsterdam and you
think I've left my smart socks at home
or I've left my smart watch at home
whatever would you turn around and go
back for it how many of you would turn
around and go back for your phone if you
left it at home right that's the kind of
response we want for a wearable device
that people love right you think ah I
have forgotten my crazy eyeglasses I
need to turn around and get those so and
not the drawer full of abandoned unloved
devices so what can we do well we can
first of all we can make apps really
appeal to the people who are using the
devices because ultimately it's the
utility and the enjoyment and the wow
factor they get from this device rather
than just the notion of I have a my
other watch I'll tell you the story
about what happen to my SmartWatch but
you know I've got this thing I can
really live without it we want them
turning around we want them going back
to get that device okay so how can we
make an experience that gets them back
there here are a few Android specific
points but some of these design ideas
really translate to other devices as
well so I'm speaking to everyone not
just the eight people who put their
hands up as Android developers we came
up with this design approach design
language way of laying out devices for
every kind of device be at a large
machine be at a phone via to watch be it
something on Google glass be it one of
our new devices that are coming out and
we call this material design and it's
basically a set of things like fonts
guides to how things should be spaced
how information dense the screen should
be or sparse as the case may be and
these are just some examples of some of
the the richer kinds of data display on
a bigger screen and some of this does
translate to a small screen and then
I'll talk about no screen in just a
moment so for I told you three bits of
code I think these are the two of the
three bits of code a view for those of
you on an Android developer is just a
fancy name for one of the user interface
widgets you see on the screen so
this lovely bit of graphics and text and
a link and so forth would be a card view
a way of displaying card like
information the material design
extensions and implementations of these
bits of code are really designed to do
the hard work for you moving from one
device to another so you don't have to
repeatedly think okay how do I lay out
that information now for a watch face
that's only 40 millimeters in diameter
the material design classes and a lot of
the material design framework that's
built into the Android tools will help
you do that for you so you can spend
more time thinking about what makes a
person come back to the house and pick
up the watch rather than is the button
in the right place on the watch a couple
of other things that will appeal to
anyone who's used the devices bringing
out that notion of depth literally the
3d effect where it makes sense so there
are properties and capabilities now to
take any of the well not any of the view
objects but a wide range of objects as
you see on these screens and give them
some kind of visual debt not just the
traditional shadowing that you've
probably seen for like 10 years 20 years
on everything from old fashioned windows
all the way through to you know the
latest and greatest Linux but true
notions of depth including what happens
when items move over and behind and in
front of each other to give you a little
bit of visual Wow basically some some
animations I'll show you some animations
in a minute hopefully they will work
crazy things like circular reveals so
rather than just one thing sliding over
the other you can do like crazy rotating
motions animations and so forth custom
transitions although this is like a
slide deck you never want to see those
weird horrible custom transmission
transitions in a slide deck but maybe
you do on on a phone or something like
that you're showing someone their heart
rate you want to a nice little like
beating heart transition to come onto
the screen or one of those great medical
ECG beeping dashed lines that you see in
all the medical dramas these tools
inside the material
framework would let you design them and
they're really that they do extend
beyond devices with screens to devices
without screens it's the same sort of
what what can I do what can I show
people what feedback can I give them
through the sensors in the device if
there's no screen the framework is there
to help you okay with the very latest
release of Android that we announced two
weeks ago I Oh Android M which still
doesn't have a flavor of of
confectionery as a code name as far as I
know but it will start with M you can
guarantee that we added a few more fancy
transitions fancy animations and so
forth let me see if these actually work
and probably not so what these would
have shown if they worked is a bunch of
of these panels expanding in size
bouncing like literally appearing to
bounce and so forth the animations these
were again scrolling and bouncing
animations if you really keen on seeing
these you can just jump on the Android
developer website you can see examples
of these in action but again some new
animations something that is visually
obvious and doesn't require the
animation is what happens with buttons
and with things that you want someone to
interact with on a wearable device if
you think about how big a watch face is
or how big a fitness band is or even
what kind of device interface you could
have on a shoe or a piece of clothing or
something like that every pixel counts
and having to like make space for
traditional buttons and so forth is a
real pain it really limits you in terms
of the flare you have with a layout and
also just the functionality you can cram
into the space so we came up with this
notion of floating action buttons and
the in this case the floating action
button is the the floating circular
checkmark here that's like the yes
acknowledged button and in this example
we've got it sort of hovering split
along that blue boundary there but we
could actually place this over the top
of any other view element on the screen
which means if
in a really constrained you a space if
we're talking about you know literally
the 40 pixels by 40 pixel kind of space
you don't have to worry about what could
you crammed in there you could actually
use the floating action button effect to
effectively put interstitials on top of
what the user is looking at to take
action and so forth we're having to like
really crammed things in there so it's a
nice feature and you're not limited to
just the circular classic sort of tikkun
cross and so forth you can actually
design your own shapes triangles
hexagons squiggly lines whatever you
like and the way you do that that's a
nice intro here to this second nut one
again the last bit of code I promise so
those of you allergic to code the code
is about to disappear those sorts of
designs creating those custom shapes to
suit a small wearable interface we have
a class called view outline provider and
it literally lets you explain using
vector graphics what you would like the
shape to look like you define a
mathematically material design framework
takes care of a bunch of the scaling and
so forth across different screen sizes
so you don't have to come up with 58
different circle sizes for the 58
different sized Android wear devices
that you're going to find out there for
a device with no screen or a device with
the screen for that matter I have
another question for you I like
questioning my audience interrogating
them put your hand up and keep it in the
air if your phone battery lasts one day
all right keep it in the air all right
two days mine's kind of almost two days
three days four days a week right we got
close how long does your phone battery
usually last about four days okay that's
that's pretty good i would i would put
that phone in a box and treasure it
because i don't remove the last time i
had a phone that lasted that long
battery life with wearables battery life
is one of the biggest concerns that
people have you buy a watch am I going
to be able to tell the time this evening
one I'm out having a beer it's nice when
I don't have to tell the time when I'm
having a beer but that's usually a sign
I've drunk too much beer I shouldn't
have to worry about whether my watch is
also accurate so one of the things we
have done to really help address battery
life with the Android M preview
you and the Android M released when it
comes out is this notion of doze and
it's it's really clever and I want you
to think more about how we're doing this
rather than just the actual battery
saving so a wearable device comes packed
with sensors sometimes only a few
sometimes dozens accelerometers
barometers magnetman is there magneto
meters or magnetometers depending on how
you like to pronounce that word
basically things to tell you everything
from air pressure to compass direction
all those sorts of things we've taken
the sensors on a device it could be a
device with no screen like a fitness
band or something like that could be a
phone could be a watch could be a pair
of google glass whatever and we've
worked out that it's far more likely
that you're using the device when motion
is detected and when motion is detected
you're potentially like scrolling
tapping jogging whatever the case may be
you want full functionality if there's
no motion detected we can infer that you
are either a passively consuming some
content but that's fine we can see if
you're playing back video or listening
to audio or whatever the case may be or
it's more likely you know what you're
not actually looking at the device right
now and not not relying on an
instantaneous response and so we've
invented this dough's framework that
uses the sensors detects whether motion
and activity is happening and if nothing
is detected we will tell all of the
background services that are like
polling for updates and syncing your
Facebook stuff and sending your latest
you know snapchat picture and so forth
well basically say you know what back
off a little don't worry about syncing
for 30 seconds now don't worry about
syncing for 5 minutes now don't worry
about syncing for 15 minutes it's this
notion of exponential back-off so that
the things that hog your battery power
become far far less resource-intensive
they really really benefit those devices
that are struggling to make it a day is
probably the best way to describe it the
good news is this is this is built in
you can just benefit up benefit from it
straight away for instance if you're
writing wearable apps that use google
play and so forth to Google Play
services or automatically hooked up to
this but you can also explicitly start
using doze and say yep I know that I
might be using some kind of endpoint in
the cloud somewhere to grab data or sync
data or whatever I can make my classes
dose aware and just makes it there
backing off as well and not consuming
the vital battery life we aren't we are
all blessed with four days so let's see
if we can at least get beyond the day
the last of course you can never present
on a Mac without an update message
appearing ok let's go back to here okay
the last thing I want to recommend
reinforce suggest is of our developers
out there you probably have your
favorite developer tool some of you like
hacking away at the good old text
command line plain text editors some of
you like an IDE historically Android was
built with and supported Eclipse very
popular also has its rough edges in
places and a couple of years ago we
launched Android studio and the one
thing I would recommend to you if you're
looking to get started or go further
with wearable development and you
haven't looked at Android studio is go
grab it because it does one really cool
thing for you straight away which is let
you write once and target whole bunch of
platforms without having to write four
different sets of code or five different
sets of code the newest releasing adds
another one here the Android auto
deployment so if you want your app to
deploy to in car systems that are coming
again all of the package management and
so forth is a built with sort of
awareness of this sort of stuff so with
much less overhead you could target a
traditional laptop a phone some wearable
devices TV car and save yourself a whole
heap of coding effort ok so that's the
that's the sales pitch for Android and
the three pieces of programming I
promised you would see now I want to get
to the extreme part with this is a
foundation and even Android aside like I
said it's a big world there's a lot out
there
android and other ways if you want to
learn more about our wearable stuff
there are some links I'm pretty certain
you guys know how the internet works so
I don't need to read those I tell you
how to follow them let's talk about what
you could do and what people are doing
with wearables and with the data that
they can get from wearables so is this
number again eight billion people they
all have some kind of device we don't
need to know who they are we don't need
any personal information I think about
this at a very high aggregated level
what kinds of things could you learn
what kind of useful things could you do
that you may never have conceived of
before just by dint of a whole bunch of
people having a wearable device sending
you some anonymized fairly basic data
another question let me just take a
glass of water for a moment okay how
many of you take your your holidays your
vacation in august warm weather
beautiful yeah out on the canals and
lakes okay how many of you remember your
your August holiday from last year okay
quite a few okay how many of you
remember where you were at three oh
three in the morning on the
twenty-fourth of August well okay we
have do we have two people who remember
where they were okay so where were you
at home sleeping I was also sleeping for
a moment and and I think we had one more
person off the back who's do you
remember where you were at home sleeping
was a i was i was sleeping as well but i
wasn't at home oh and exactly this
there's this if i gave you a random date
from any time last year and said where
were you at three in the morning most of
you think well I was probably asleep
unless it was a really good night having
a good party or something like that why
do I remember exactly where I was at
three minutes past three on the
twenty-fourth of August last year it has
to do with this so this building is the
post office building in Napa in Napa
Valley in California in the US
I was there on holiday my wife and i
were there with some friends we were
touring the the vineyards drinking some
wine it's a nice nice part of the world
drinking wine and at three oh three in
the morning I woke up because there was
an earthquake measured about 6.5 on the
Richter scale this is the post office
building the next morning this is my my
picture Oh actually no this is another
one I got was a better angle but
basically all of the glasses blown out
what you can't see here because it
didn't actually fit into the picture is
more of these big brick columns stand on
the end of the building at each end and
basically they had stepped away from the
rest of the building or like bricks were
just falling off the building was in
danger of collapse a whole bunch of
buildings in the town were damaged by
the earthquake so I always awake at 303
a wine bottle had rolled off the shelf
Nick's it was empty of course I'd had a
good night but I had gone to sleep I
wasn't already awake at 303 but I also
know that thousands and thousands and
thousands of other people were also
awake at three oh three in the morning
on the twenty-fourth of August how do I
know this it's not just guessing it's
not just thinking well if I woke up in
an earthquake a bunch of other people
probably woke up I know for a fact that
they woke up I know that about eighty
percent of the people in the town woke
up and the reason I know this is I can
infer it from a bunch of data from
people who were wearing fitness bands to
bed they went to sleep with their bands
on my wife has one of these things she
she used to use it to remind her to go
out for a jog now what she uses it for
is an alarm clock she loves the gentle
buzzing feature that wakes her up in the
morning it was not a gentle wake up that
morning it was it was bang it was a
really loud shock things fell over
buildings damaged and so forth and in
aggregate these were the these were the
people who particularly this is from the
jawbone company so these people were
wearing jawbone up and they had agreed
to share their data just the you know am
I awake am i asleep fitness sort of
stuff so this tracks the percentage of
people that were awake you're on the y
axis and this is the time as the evening
draws on now I mentioned it to Napa
right wine country people like having a
good time so
even as we get down to like 1am 2am 3am
there's still ten to fifteen percent of
the population week I think these are
the people who really like their wine
right they're really out there enjoying
things and then bang napa-sonoma is the
next Valley over Vallejo is this the
count of the south Berkeley's a little
further south we've gone from about
seventeen percent of the people awake to
nearly eighty percent of the people
awake and we know that because they're
jawbone recorded the fact they work up
there awake and it's pretty much obvious
when they woke up all across the Bay
Area San Francisco santa cruz San Jose
those sorts of places the further away
from Napa we get this is San Francisco
and Oakland Oakland is just south of
Berkeley san Francisco's on the west
side of the bay I can't even remember
where Central Russa is but on its around
there somewhere Sacramento and San Jose
are a much further away we're talking
about 50 to 80 kilometers away and then
Santa Cruz way down on the coast fewer
and fewer people wake up at those
further distances from where the
earthquake occurred now I don't know
about you but when my wife bought a
fitness band I did not think that she
was going to be participating in some
kind of math that mass earthquake
detection in the middle of the night but
this is the kind of thing you could do
with a wearable device and some very
simple that I don't need to know who
these people are I don't need to know
any identifying information about them I
could make a crowdsourced seismograph
with just them sharing wearables data
about where they asleep or where they
awake now I've looked at how much it
costs to buy a seismograph a really
cheap one is about fifty thousand euro a
very very good one top-of-the-line
expensive seismograph is about two and a
half million and typically it's like
universities or research stations
volcano monitoring stations and so forth
that have these but with a bunch of
people who've already bought some kind
of wearable device and an idea like hey
I could basically make some kind of
crowd-sourced earthquake detector bingo
I don't have to buy a seismograph I get
people out there becoming living human
walking seismographs for me
okay so that's one possible application
that really nobody would have thought of
up front with a wearable device or with
a bunch of wearable devices what else
could we do we could predict some things
wouldn't it be lovely to predict the
weather in Amsterdam I used to work here
15 years ago and yet some it was one of
my I live in London now right so the
weather is still totally unpredictable
anyway but so this is this is me if you
know exactly this morning just checking
what the rain would be like right here
and I'm thinking well you know my google
search said there'd be showers well what
time of day and when and what would it
look like and I thought well I a bit as
if I could zoom in I might know a little
bit more because I hear that you know
occasionally you'll be walking down the
street in Amsterdam bang your rained on
but the person next to you is not in two
streets over so you could try zooming in
but then I noticed a really strange
effect I've never seen clouds that rain
sort of imperfect straight lines like
this before I don't know about you but I
tend to think the rain is a little more
chaotic and unpredictable than that but
there is one thing you can predict when
it rains all right and some people have
just done the motion running away this
happens a lot when it rains right people
do this they put up an umbrella it's
crazy I know but it works it kind of
keeps the rain off we just checked my
battery life no that's cool we're fine
this is something we know people are
going to do or go running as as the
gentleman back there suggested so if I
if I could somehow detect the fact that
a whole bunch of people have just done
this or a whole bunch of people have
just sprinted to locations that I might
know happen to have like Gables or
shelters or something like that maybe I
could learn something about the rain and
maybe it wouldn't have to look weird
like this and have these weird
triangular clouds happening now there
are devices like this as well as
traditional website traditional wearable
devices right there only been out a few
years this is the the device from
thalmic labs its base
a bunch of muscle sensors around your
arm they're not super precise but they
are quite good at differentiating
between the various muscles that rotate
the elbow that move the wrist that move
the shoulder joint and so forth someone
wearing a device like this or even a
more modern device one of the newer
watches that's come out one of the newer
sports tracking devices there is an
Australian company called catapult from
where I am from they make some very very
high-grade wearable devices for sporting
people who and they can literally track
everything from the degree of flex when
you impact your your knee flexing one
way or the other it's called pronating
or super nating depending on which way
the knees going it could easily detect
what you're doing with your arm and the
fact you might have tilted your hand
this way and be holding something
because your fingers are gripped like
this and with that in place you could
turn this with a bunch of people wearing
all kinds of different devices but if
you could at least get the data that
says that put their hands up like this
except for the ten of them that are
running for the shelter over there you
can make a much much more accurate
crowd-sourced brain detector you could
literally say it's raining here on
damrak right now but on princess
it's not raining at all and not end up
with that weird blob of green that says
somewhere in Amsterdam it's raining but
I'm sorry I can't tell you exactly where
okay another thing you could do which is
at a personal level but also has wider
applications is see what you can do
about changing changing lives liberating
people from the constraints that they
encounter in their day-to-day lives so
this is a gentleman called Simon require
if Simon Wheatcroft here we go I know we
craft um I'm going to tell you three
interesting three or four interesting
facts about him first of all he runs
ultra marathons I probably couldn't even
run back to Central Station if I had to
but this guy runs easily 100 kilometer
marathons 250 kilometres runs runs
through the desert runs urban
and remote marathons he's an Android fan
and I'll tell you why in a moment but
the most interesting thing about him is
that he has been blind since he was 17
and I'm not blind but I do have several
good friends who told me that it's you
know it you can imagine it by closing
your eyes but it still doesn't convey
the full depth of how it affects your
life every single day Simon started
using Android because he wanted to leave
his house walk along the street outside
his house just walk up and down get
outside get some fresh air and he had
had the phone on him mainly for music at
the time and he knew the street because
before he went blind he had a good
mental picture of what the street looked
like so he knew he could just walk
safely up and down the street one day he
was feeling particularly either outraged
or adventurous or frustrated or maybe a
combination of all of those and instead
of turning around at the end of the
street and coming back to his house he
just decided to turn left and see where
where things went and see how he fared
whether he would like fall over the the
curb or run into an issue and then he
remembered this part that he had a phone
that was playing some music was an
Android device and he remembered okay
it's got maps and maps has turn by turn
navigation and spoken were turn-by-turn
navigation so he turned that on and said
yep i'm doing a navigation by walking
give me turn-by-turn navigation and ah
that's a good question I thought he used
Google now to activate it but
potentially yeah I'd have to ask him how
he did it whether he primed it in
advance or whatever but he's got a video
on youtube so going it might actually be
in his description of what he did that
day then he SAT back and forth and this
was before he started running ultra
marathons then he SAT back and thought
okay I've got turn-by-turn navigation is
how far can I go sure he had some
stumbles and so forth but this device
freed him from just being able to walk
on the street outside his house to being
able to roam across the city then he
fill it well this is great I'll go for a
run and this is actually him this is the
picture from the video of him running
he's never been in this
ocean before actually I think they
probably stage this right so they
probably did a few takes he may well
have been in this location but this was
new to him that day is my understanding
and he suddenly realized if I've got an
android phone and I'm running with it I
don't know if any of you are runners but
running with something in your hand is a
bit cumbersome most people sort of use
an armband or something like that you
feel it wouldn't well why don't I find
an Android wear device that can do the
turn-by-turn navigation or help with the
turn-by-turn navigation so my hands are
free so I can run with a much more
natural running gait and he explored a
bunch of things including things that
weren't Android devices and he's come
across these shoes this is a let gel
running shoe from a company in India and
it's a it's a fairly you know fairly
sexy design if you ask me I don't have
them myself I just have good old tailors
but this kind of shoes really helpful
for him it's just using bluetooth it's a
very simple wearable device but it
vibrates with variable intensity so you
can basically calibrate it if you're a
runner right you're getting a lot of
shock and vibration anyway so little
tiny vibrations are not good if you're
trying to get some kind of signal but
the other thing they do is they vibrate
a number of times and to a certain
length of time to tell you to turn left
or to turn right and how far to turn
left and how far to turn right so
literally as you run you can feel the
vibrations in your feet giving you the
turn-by-turn navigation which if you're
blind and running an ultramarathon is
really helpful I think it'd be helpful
for me just walking down the street if
we can help him if we can help Simon who
else could we help are those shoes are
100 US dollars about ninety four ish
euro not not expensive and in the I
think six months since I spoke to Simon
and found out about those shoes there
are probably a dozen different kinds of
shoes out there that can do similar
things give haptic feedback for turn by
turn direction and other information
like your feet buzz because you just got
a text message or you know someone just
pinged you on snapchat or something like
that I don't know if that's useful but
it's out there a hundred bucks 94 euro
ok this is a researcher at Imperial
College London
name is Aldo Faisal and he was working
on helping wheelchair users who are
totally paralyzed they literally they
can breathe and they have I movement and
that's about all they've got and he was
trying to build them a system so they
could navigate their own wheelchair just
with eye movement and he he was using
some fantastically complex optics this
is kind of a little rig that he's got
set up holding the optical device the
idea is it's tracking your eye it's
trying to see where your eyes going
because that's all you can do if you're
a total paraplegic or quadriplegic I
can't remember which way around that is
you know you can move your eye if we can
detect that you've looked over there and
you might want to turn that way we could
then instruct the wheelchair to turn
that way and this is the research he was
doing he was using optics that cost
twenty twenty-five thousand euro for
each set of optics if you're looking for
a cheap wheelchair 25,000 is not cheap
especially when all the other equipment
goes into the chair and then he had an
idea he also has children and his
children are I think they're using a
Microsoft Xbox and of course that meant
they had the Kinect controller sitting
on top of the TV and he literally he
walked up to it and looked at it and
went had some really good optics in that
connect controller and he stole his
child's connect controller from from the
TV now I believe he did buy another one
he bought a replacement but he took the
Kinect controller to work he took it to
pieces he took the optics out perfect he
can track movements that are as fast as
10 milliseconds he can differentiate
between you looking at something because
you're interested in it and looking at
something because you want the
wheelchair to go that way and you no
longer has to use 25 thousand euro
optics he's using a secondhand connect
which is about 60 euro so think about
all game controllers you have lying
around at home that you could turn into
wearable devices do you have children
anyone or any of your children going to
scream if you take their think about
buying a second one then rather than
taking the existing one but you get the
idea you don't have to have the huge
factories the the massive investment you
can literally cannibalize the components
you find lying around to build your own
wearables and if you if you don't think
a wheelchair is a wearable device
talk to someone who sits in a wheelchair
every day and they will change your mind
on that I guarantee it so another group
this is from MIT this is from a few
years ago to 2014 they were doing very
similar things but their goal wasn't to
help the they're paralyzed
co-researchers remove their wheelchair
they wanted to have some fun so again
they cannibalize some optics I don't
know where there's came from but it was
a very cheap set of optics instead of
these sort of tens of thousands of euro
they built a pickup system that you
could wear basically like a headset that
you wear and enabled people who are
totally paralyzed to play Super Mario
Brothers just by tracking eye movement
and their optics cost $25 23 euros right
so if you're thinking well I can't go
out to make a the next version of google
glass like the markets wide open with
we're still taking the second version
internally and working on it you've got
you've got an opportunity right now if
you've got 23 euro in your pocket you'll
probably go and buy some optics and see
what you could build okay that's that's
getting cheaper you see this price is
dropping further and further and further
I really want to encourage you that this
is something you could do for the price
of a cup of coffee you could experiment
with wearables today for a really really
really low amount i'll show you hello in
a moment okay one statistic i want to
take away with you i mentioned blind
ultra marathon runners i mentioned
people who rely on wheelchair for
mobility if you're thinking what kind of
market is that right can I cannot could
I make a business helping and improving
the quality of life for people who have
these challenges one in seven according
to the world health organization one in
seven people around the planet live with
some form of disability so that's well
over a billion potential awesome
hackable wearable devices you could
invent and have a huge market out there
okay
this is something you can do today this
isn't you can do right now some of you
may have already done it what could you
do for four-year oh I think my coffee
was actually cheaper than that this
morning after dancing remarkably I don't
want to say cheaper because that's not
really a nice way of describing it the
prices here are very reasonable compared
to the last time I worked and lived here
I yeah I commend you all on excellent
coffee for under for euro but instead of
buying tomorrow's coffee you could
instead build one of these who's who
seen google cardboard before right okay
most okay so I'll keep this short and
sweet and then we can have questions if
you want four dollars is pretty much the
price of you can go to the link to find
cardboard including we have a new
version 2 that takes phones up to six
and a half inches in diameter the
existing version the diagonal couldn't
be more than about five and a quarter
inch most of the price comes from just
buying these these lenses and the two
magnets that go into it the cardboard
you've probably got cardboard laying
around at home if not you can you can go
to a stationery store or a craft store
and buy a bit of cardboard we have the
schematics available on that URL you can
download them literally print them out
take a knife and cut out your your
cardboard design by the lenses by the
magnets will tell you the specs for
those and build your own and not just
build things that look like this but
think about what you could do next I've
seen a video where people have taken the
original design of the cardboard that
sis of your face and then added
cardboard headphone sets and a few other
bits and pieces and just keep
experimenting with it for for euro I
think that's a bargain when it comes to
could I make the next great wearable
device prototyping with some cardboard
the cardboard SDK is now available you
can go crazy you can create apps you all
could be the next great wearable
inventor right now today so you should
get on that because I'll come back
tomorrow and I expect to see some great
devices again all right but in all
seriousness we should plan for whether
it's Android M or another platform the
market is going to be huge
think big don't just think about what
one device could do think about what
thousands of devices could do in
aggregate and build some fun stuff make
a lot of mess with a lot of cardboard
and for those of you with children it's
you know it's perfectly okay to be
having more fun with playing with
cardboard than than their children have
so okay all right that's it thank you
very much and let me know if you have
any questions
