presentation first of all it's not
microservices I'm gonna talk about
microservices it's also being run for my
iPhone oh so I I just keep hoping that
will work fine so far looks like it's
pretty good I think the iPhone by the
way is turning into like the hub device
of my enterprise you know your Apple
watch hooks to it and it does works with
your host system somewhat so I'm gonna
talk about the secret assumption of
agile so a lot of nice things that come
from scrum relative to management
processes and how you organize teams and
stuff like that and I came I'm gonna
developer myself so I kind of came in
from the engineering side and I'm a big
subscriber to Kent back in extreme
programming and all those sorts of
things so I'm gonna focus more on that
today and sort of and what I consider to
be almost a thing that Kent bag did not
tell us when he said I'm doing XP
because he assumed we knew what he was
talking about so stressful it's kind of
called a secret assumption of agile
agile is a very productive sort of
process so this is a real project worked
on a nationwide there was a it was an
offshore vendor actually one of the best
team in level five companies in the
world they basically said it's going to
take his 12 months will charge $28 an
hour and it's going to take us you know
cost you about two million dollars and
they were okay with that except for the
twenty twelve months was too long for
the client and the game you get the
opportunity then to sort of do something
interesting because the client is
desperate and desperate clients will let
you do crazy things so we suggest we do
an agile project will deliver it across
eight months we'll do a very faster will
deliver you intermediate releases so you
can get some value now you'd have to
wait four months to get your first value
but our labor rate was going to be over
three times higher because we're using
so a lot of us labor as well as a little
bit offshore of our own and we wind up
bidding for that project 1.1 million
half the price of the offshore vendor if
you see our three times the labor rate
half the price and we have to deliver
the same functionality you were six
times better than the best team
five company in the world using agile
processes I usually and I do this
presentation before I leave off that
number at the bottom I kind of asked the
audience how much do you think you
should bid for this I get numbers like
six million because you got to do it
it's three times more expensive you're
gonna lose money
very few people guess a million dollars
or so it is more productive to work this
way so what is going on what is the
magic that let us sort of deliver and
this goes back to 2003 2004 it's a
relatively early agile project in my
career and it was basically a
fundamental thing is we wrote code it
makes it easy to change the code and
that was kind of the the thing that we
did we also you know basically used some
very lean management processes I was
trained in just-in-time manufacturing in
business school in the mid 80s so I have
applied a lot of things from
just-in-time to software development in
my process today you would call that
Kanban but you know it's basically the
same stuff I was doing at that point and
we were not afraid to sort of process in
power you know if you get any more
more machines you wanna run more tests
automated you need better develop
machines we would just spend that money
and don't think twice about it so this
is the fundamental principle and this
was one of the guys one of the first
early participants by the way in oops
low back in the early days got an IBM
rig dinelli and he said this to me very
early my learning of object programming
about objects are only good for programs
that change and it sounds like it's
trying to trigger but you think about
every interesting program is going to
change and therefore you really want to
think about those terms so one of the
things that the whole concept of stories
stories assume that you can change
things easily that's why we do stories
we write a story and and we make trying
to make them independent and we play
them in order the customers to play the
man the assumption is every story can be
changed at a reasonable cost to the base
system so to some degree the first story
is a virgin system and every time every
story after that is changing your system
so usually follows paradigm changing is
become something you should be very very
good at you should not slow down
further into the system so typically
when you write code you know you have a
some sort of public method you have some
sort of thing how many lines of code
isn't your typical method and I asked
this question again around the world and
you get answers like you know 25 lines
or 40 lines it should fit on one page
you know Schwartz the answers like that
oh it's sort of my school of thinking
the way we tend to work this way and in
fact the nationwide project are each
method was to point three lines of code
they were tiny average class size was 25
lines of code
it fit on a page the entire class this
is probably not the way you're used to
writing code and by the way this was in
Java I had a colleague was doing some
small talk stuff his average of 1.1 when
I worked with Ruby I'm rarely over 1.5
in terms of my size of things it's a
different style of writing code it's
actually quite easy to change so with
this moment this nationwide project they
had this sort of thing the original
application was written in Java we used
an Oracle back-end database and a web
front-end the new application though
it's come to be written in Java Oracle
database where Beck is friend
same technology stack the legacy system
had 72 classes this is a system doing
pension plans pension plans you know in
the u.s. there's about three or four
with legal types of pension plans
there's there's agents that sell these
things for our fried times different
agents and of course you know every
state has slightly different rules so
they defined 72 classes they're having
trouble changing this application when
we finished we had written 1,400 classes
it was extraordinarily easy to change
fact has an order of magnitude higher
quality than anything they have in the
enterprise they recently again this is
almost ten years old now they recently
rewrote the system except for this part
they begin to rewrite the system so it's
a different way of writing programs so
where does this come from - basically we
have a way of working in the
organization we try to work
these things and the process basically
says you started with some task of
something you're trying to accomplish we
do design people say you don't do design
when you're doing agile you do design
you guys have to think about how this
stuff's got to work I'm a strong
believer in tests first you write
through tests to make that sort of stuff
work then you write some code if you
need to then you know write another test
and you keep writing more tests skin so
you can't think of anything else the
system should do at that point you want
to integrate that code with the rest of
the code you have make sure it still
works
run oldest those tests and then you can
go back to know the task but if you
really are running everything at this
point you can basically if you want to
ship because basically systems working
everything seems to be working and the
concept of shipping is no longer a
choice we programmers are making the
business can make that decision because
we're kind of always ready to ship
and whatever boundary we're working in
here now that's a very powerful thing
and by the way my experience has been
the business is not ready to answer that
question I have to apologize yeah
because to some degree the way the
business works with programmers today is
my fault well he's my generation maybe a
few of us some generation um because we
basically did in the dark ages of 1970s
we could write code with a customer
because a large application was a
thousand lines of code or two thousand
that's one box of cards it's not a big
deal I saw somebody to a customer we got
bigger and bigger we sorted telling the
customer go away because it takes a
little longer for us to do this and they
went away and they wrote some
requirements for us and we got more and
more sophisticated over time about how
far we're keeping away from us we had
layers and layers between us all project
offices business analysts all sorts of
stuff we're keeping this arm's length
now this agile stuff comes along we're
trying to work in smaller units and
we're saying come talk to us and they
say why should we talk to programmers
it's like well because we want to do
things fast for you and it's like but we
like this being away from you says no no
I was right it's my fault sorry we
pushed you away
come join us again they're not ready but
we are ready to ship and again they're
not ready to answer that question would
you like to software today and they're
like what would I do with it
would you ship it alright so let's talk
about a case study of this so I'm
actually working in India all
a big application actually at one point
is the largest Sun certified job
application in the world this is not
something you want to be but as a
thousand main lines of code we have 50
programmers across two continents
working on this stuff we had four
thousand automated tests which wasn't it
enough for that so I system so the
question is for programmers sitting in
this sort of world how long does it take
you to pick up a task something you need
to be changed in the system figure out
how to change a million lines of code
don't order to accommodate this new
functionality not have any conflicts
with the other fifty programmers there
should also change in system the same
time make sure you can run all four
thousand tests successfully and then
come back again for another task I mean
how long does it take you to do that I
hear all sorts of numbers like you know
it maybe takes a week and people say
just a week seriously it's a million
lines of code it's gonna take you a
month so it turns out it took us on
average around two to four hours two to
four hours well it turns out in two to
four hours you don't worry about the
other 49 programmers it's a million
lines of code we're not gonna hit each
other it's too big a space and the 4000
test lets you sort of change things very
safely because you know you didn't break
the other stuff and so you're little you
gotta be a little wild and crazy you can
make some changes and if it seems to
work you core inch and push it out the
door and there's a little thing that
happens here because if you're working
in four hours and you're working in two
hours and you're checking in then I
gotta go integrate your code with mind
so guess what I want to go in 1 hours
and 50 minutes instead so I'm trying to
go a little faster than you are of
course then you want to go a little
faster a little faster it stabilizes so
this is Java when it by the way I'm
working with something like Ruby or
small talk to cycles 30 minutes already
mess between pushes we get some very
aggressive with this stuff so we're
working at a different pace and speed
than you're used to seeing and doing
this sort of stuff and changing our
systems so typically then you know the
time from the time I write a test till I
get it working needs to be 15 minutes if
it's longer than 15 minutes you doing
something wrong the test is too hard and
where are you having difficulty and go
into that part of the system to write a
test for that part but that's where your
feedback process 15
from the time I write something till I
get it working how long do you spend on
design about 15 minutes you're not
trying to find the perfect design you're
not spending all the time on a
whiteboard again the architecture to
sign off all right you just have an idea
here's the way to solve the problem and
Kent Beck said this very eloquently in
his first book he says a relationship
between design and code he says design
code is when design hits a harsh reality
of dawn it says if you it's a good
design the code would be pretty if the
code is ugly
your design is flawed CoBank try another
design so basically we have another
feedback cycle it says if I start
writing the code and it gets really ugly
let's try a different design and so it's
not that we have the right design to
fart with but will we have a design
we'll try it out we'll try something
else we're always trying things out by
the way this process this way of working
comes from the small talk world which is
where Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham
they're it had the original ideas that
came out of XP some of the early agile
engineering stuff comes from working in
this style and this is a style that I
basically have taken now moved into Java
moving into every other language every
other environment I work in the same
style regardless of the language and its
terms I'd be very productive
so here's one of the old charts that
says here's all the XP practices and
they're sort of the the sort of secret
assumptions built into one and sort of
the net in the middle they're called
simple design because even though they
said simple design simple design isn't
that easy simple design kind of has four
parts to it first of all the code should
work it's a really good criteria to have
all the most important one second one
you should communicate the code should
scream out what it is doing if it's not
doing that you're writing the bad code
fix it if you feel a need to write a
comment in code there's something wrong
with your code make it clearer fix the
code even a blank line is trying to tell
you something you something about these
code to this code here and the blank
line has the meaning about is a group
separate it out compose a method pattern
separate it out listen to the code
you'll tell you how to fix it
self-sow working he's just not good
enough he's got to communicate we want
to kill the duplicate code lots and lots
of patterns and designs subscribers kill
the duplicate code and finally we want
to kill all the extra code there's
anything left over there still lying
around we don't need yet kill it if I
see a block of code somewhere has been
commented out I just erase it I'm not
gonna look at it cuz guarantee if I look
at it out try free if it's necessary not
on me try turning back clone oh my god
what a waste and if I wasted my time so
will you next time you see that block of
code I just erase it
that's simple design we talk about
simple design our process we didn't
father we think about these steps
they're written down somewhere they're
written down in the books but we
probably don't follow that I taught of
course at university for a sort of a
self-imposed sabbatical and I graded my
students on this curve half what quarter
the grade for their programs based on
every one of this so they tried
something and it works it's like thank
you third 25% you failed
well but it worked thank you very much
25% they had some extra coding there
this looks really cool yes it's really
cool - 25 %
don't need it and some very very low
grades until they got kind of got the
message but they wrote code differently
than our other colleagues that we're
missing this this is the secret
assumption of agile we're writing code
is very easy to change there's a certain
style associated with it that kid Beck
Arnie knew Chris he was a small talker
we're cutting and mourning those all
these sort of you know original agile
guys angel engineering guys they knew
all this stuff this is the way they work
but they forgot to tell us and by the
way I had to figure out the hard way
myself so you do this work for
applications uh here's a book of recipes
it's probably one of the I don't read
very many technical books by the way
this happens to be one I read which
makes it kind of very special in my mind
it's a full recipes these are recipes on
how to make your code better it's a nice
chapter in this book called code smells
which is kids back to osteolysis chapter
he basically said this is what makes
your code smell if your code looks like
this it's got a smell and then there's a
references to all the recipes that the
rest of the book of how to fix this
you should learn these recipes makes you
faster but it cleans a lot of that stuff
up how does this fit sort of am i
tasking cycle well just because your
code is past all this test you've only
got 25% you still got to earn the other
75% and one of these Martin books does a
nice job of is it tells you how to do
that and you can inject that right there
in that process before you claim your
finish fix it I have horrible problems
with people who say we're creating
technical debt which mean my way of
saying is we're being lazy we're not
doing our cleaning up our code before
you check it in and we're leaving it for
somebody else to do which tastes a lot
harder for them to do and then we get
slower and slower and slower usually
it's because sometimes it's because
we're ignorant we didn't know how to fix
it better because we don't remember ed
the book sometimes we're just being lazy
sometimes you're getting pressure
wherever the reason is you gotta resist
that temptation clean it up as you go
there's another sort of companion book
that's really quite powerful that came
out a few years after Martin's book part
of his series it talks about refactoring
to patterns how to use design patterns
so it turns out if you go back to this
model again design patterns kind of fit
here design patterns something you
introduced into the code when the design
says I need it I'm looking at the design
looks like a state may make some sense
because I have two different ways I want
to work so I'm gonna put a state pattern
in here inject the state pattern into
the old code when there's only one state
get it working again
then add the second state so this sort
of changes for that are actually done at
this point in the process so if you
refactor two patterns you refactor
before you start your new functionality
again something that the books talk
about a little bit but it's sort of a
lost knowledge in terms of how to work
fast so this is another another project
I worked on this was a large project out
of one of the manufacturers in Detroit
and you know you sort of use the cycle
concept a car cyclomatic complexity or
also known as mckay complexity but
basically is how many pass through your
code and it turns out big numbers of
course evil and it's certainly not
uncommon to see really big classes or
really big methods having numbers like a
hundred
associate with him there was a senior
architect of this client and again one
of the barge manufacturers it's one of
the consulting firms he says I've never
seen anything less than a 5 in any
application I've ever worked yet and so
we brought some these techniques in
place we implemented a system the
original estimate from developed the
system by the vendor was 1518 months we
delivered in nine weeks what was I so I
could make complexity 1.8 they had a
nine week to develop a cycle nine week
testing cycle the nine we tested cycle
II found one bug to Taro's a fix
they were like would you guys do yeah we
wrote different style we spent that
whole nine weeks writing the next
version uh nails to say that was sort of
a radical change in the whole
organization one sort understand what's
going on so is a different style of
programming how do you get there what do
you really do sort of had how to write
in the style and I gotta say this for me
this was a easily a five year journey of
great pain in order to get there and I
had some great tutors and mentors in
this process but how do you get from
that spot to that spot ideally you want
to get some training and what they're
talking about how do you write code in
this different style that's easy to
change style that we have here and then
you get some experience you actually got
to get your hands dirty it's nice to
learn it but if you don't get your hands
dirty immediately you're gonna lose the
what you've learned
it is possible although it's sort of
rocky that's why it's sort of the dirt
road versus the highway you can't
actually learn on the job if the team is
working this way you drop into the team
and you practice program repairing you
can pick up these techniques but it's
very strange of years to writing these
big long methods and these guys are
writing classes the same size and it's
saying no no you can't put a blank line
in your method you're like what do you
mean you can put okay things you put a
blank line in my method you know but you
shouldn't do that for some reason and
the reasons not very clear to them but
you can't pick it up in fact on the
nationwide project we did not have
formal training we skipped that we just
want to start writing the code and we
had quite a bit of the team that's
struggled early I went through a lot of
pain learning that they after that
they're in a retrospective they
basically said we wanted the training
next time we should always have the
training because we've gotten started so
much faster than that
we'll see a case of that in a few
minutes so here's actually I like
continuous flow diagrams if you're not
used to reading these things I'm
basically just count how many stories
are in each state every day so how many
stories are finished that's the green
dotted zone and how many finished
stories haven't been worked on yet
that's a big white zone and then in the
middle is a little bit ribbons think of
stuff that's being worked on and the
little blue ribbon in the middle is
actually development time so we're
developers are working on only a couple
stories at a time so you see there's a
slope here of a certain line that goes
flat and then it starts up again well
basically I had a team it's a very
bright set of programmers but they
didn't understand these techniques so in
that first part of the project we
finished 23 stories in 15 days that was
a certain pace
I took them offline for one week so okay
excuse me we had to stop here you guys
don't know how to write code in this
easy to change style it's gonna cost us
of the wrong run so we held the class
for one week then we started back up
again with the same people we recover
the cost of the class within 8 11 days
11 day payback period on the class and
we kept that aggressive slope from their
own by the way it goes up again that's
because we had another pair we can
actually measure the productivity
increase of adding some people more
people so by the way this is one of my
favorite management techniques for
managing projects is let's just chart it
out and see what it looks like and this
is what I showed the sponsors and
everybody else this is how fast we're
working what doesn't work faster it was
more people but again we took people
offline payback period for this sort of
training to teach them how to write code
differently and these were experienced
programmers being well paid oh you know
11 days so the class is typically called
boot camp it was named boot camp by the
first students because it wasn't that
painful for them wasn't my name for it
and they've cut to some degree is
teaching you to think like a programmer
or like an object programmer in
particular it's tall with Socratic
method which means it's quite painful
for the students because they're
learning on the on the job this is what
with the lead designer of the same firm
that in Detroit that was talked about he
was in the class he added to the class
insisted he joined the class that's what
he told that the corporate CTO after
taking the class he says well I thought
I knew about programming but this is
different
this is not what I've learned this is
not my my COBOL Fortran world that I
grew up in this is something different
so what are we covering in this in this
sort of bootcamp
basically yeah put this class together
so I could teach programmers to work
like I like to deliver software you know
I get my joy writing code
I still enjoy writing code um but I got
to get everybody on the same page was
writing the code Innis in this very very
fast style so we we started this class
in 1995 at this point I've probably
trained over a thousand people across
three countries in this stuff this by
the way what is the core curriculum
behind thought works University in India
so all thought works graduates would say
hire go through this training now nice
the language is almost invariant doesn't
matter what language you I'm teaching
you think like a programmer work
differently in this environment it is
Socratic if you're not afraid of
Socratic it's where I keep asking you
questions and sometimes you get the
right answer but if I if you do I always
have another question it turns out this
is a method by which you struggle as a
student turns out struggling is a very
good teaching technique retention rates
are of 70% I stood here and told you
what the answers were in actually repeat
it and exercise retention is 30% so it
turns out struggling is a very good
learning technique although again quite
painful it's mostly done with labs and
programming we're actually write
exercises we look at code we talk about
the code we talk about why it's ugly we
try it again we try it again we try the
next exercise very much a very high high
development environment
I kind of believe of this model I
believe there are tears of skills and
programmers you can believe in a four
level or five levels you have to renames
for these this is my favorite you know
master Jeremy an apprentice my in my
experience you know apprentice being a
typical programmer that you start on the
street if you get them up to speed with
some of these techniques are twice as
fast there are twice as fast as they
would be normally it's a huge thing when
I talk about continuously associated my
development plans my biggest contingency
is make my programmers smarter we drew
by pairing using these techniques you
know I can get your new tool get your
process you know something like that
make you 20% 30% kicks nothing doubles
your productivity as much as investing
in the people master programmers magical
creatures if you think you're anyone is
a 2x guy a master could be around 10x
their absolute beast
just get out of their way they just just
drive through code sometimes you get a
lot of discussion with various clients
about how much do you want to pay these
guys and they're saying well why would I
pay a programmer you know more than
$100,000 or even or 150,000
maybe he's a 10x guy would you hire 10
of the 15k guys or one of these guys one
of these guys I just had a discussion
with a startup I had in in California
and was able to hire quite a few master
programmers and there's a little
reluctance on a part of my co-founders
about we want to pay them this much yes
you do once they saw a couple these guys
working it's like they start writing the
checks there weren't no doubt about it
so yeah and some degree I staff projects
based upon skills of my programmers you
know certainly going through this
training process I can figure out very
quickly where which one of these guys
you are and I will use these sort of
multipliers in how much effort I need
from you in order to make it work so how
long does it take to sort of make some
of these transitions in my experience
you can probably go from an apprentice
to a journeyman in somewhere in two to
six months if you don't make that
transition in six months it's not going
to happen you're probably in the wrong
career you're liking the conceptual
skills it's something else going wrong
but you're not gonna make it the
journeyman to master you know that's
something it takes at least a couple of
years or in a lot of case it'll never
happen
you're so missing that level of
conceptual skills that you can be able
to do that sort of stuff there are a lot
of master potential programmers set so
for some various reasons got pulled into
management or they call architects now
they're not allowed to touch code these
are sort of guys you want to drag back
into the program because they're
extremely valuable
developers so I can't really affect the
master stuff because it's a little bit
magical in itself but I can't pretty
much predict and it makes work to remove
it from an apprentice to a journeyman I
can't go after that double productivity
with teams I work with in a reasonable
timeframe these are the sort of things
we cover in part one of the course is 40
to 60 40 to 50 hours it is is brutally
intense you know these are just basic
object principles we're also learning
how to pair or learning how to rotate
doing I don't how to do test first we're
learning things about how to work as a
team and to our site to a make this sure
that bad guy is the problem it's not my
colleague I'm trying to compete against
getting a better title we're trying to
kill the problem here they used to
attacking the problems we in part 2 part
2 click in part 2 we cover a lot of the
patterns because patterns are very very
powerful tools to clean up your code
another 40 or 50 hours yeah click again
so some of the things we cover that
would sort of give you an idea of how
strange this style of programming is
that that these small talkers guys
brought to us so we have concept of
suspicious statements David said if
you're using them it's a little
suspicious
ie probably wrong uh case tables are
almost always wrong in your model using
a case statement it's definitely wrong
once every 18 months or so I write a
case statement I feel really bad about
it because basically usually some
translating some user interface element
or database element says one two three
and four
which would really mean red green and
blue they could call it red green or
blue but they got to call it number so
you got to translate that case nameís
worked really well for that
but in my core model they're not there
at all else is almost always wrong
how many lc-ms do you write I'll tell
you back in the day I used to write a
goal I go to statements they probably
represented fifteen or twenty percent of
my code was go to and then somebody said
you can't use them anymore and I'm like
okay I just can't be a programmer I
guess somehow we got our way without it
turns out L statements in the same
classification it feels like you got to
have it how else could you write code
turns out most the time you don't need
it
I wrote I wrote an exercise for a for a
job interview one time basically a
blackjack game blackjack so a lot of
rules there's double downs is there's
all these rules about stuff know else
statements I probably put that in my
note to the to the people I was sitting
at code to says I write it probably
style you haven't seen before by the way
the no else name was in the entire
application they're like can you
seriously write it that way here it is
look at it did come back and say up we
think we're interested but I'd already
found another job at that point if it's
suspicious if you have an if statement
on your first line of your code it's
method is probably wrong you know how
many of those do you see by the way this
is the stuff that kills you it became
complexity if you have lots of embedded
ifs your cake complexities gonna go way
up because it's buggy code so yeah like
I know my guard clauses the beginning to
make sure you don't do something stupid
to the rest of the code is protecting
the code but actually protect it you
don't need the F statements so it turns
out a lot of design patterns probably at
least a third of the patterns in the
Gang of Four book kill if statements
that is their sole purpose in the life
it's the kill if statements and you
don't know how to use them correctly you
have to use a lot of estimates instead
so we kill those guys off with that
again very strange way of writing code
methods getters violate encapsulation do
you have getters in your code using
rails everything is a getter you are
dead your rails application will die
when it gets any sort of complexity
because of that completing violence
encapsulation of course that really
despised changing things senator is also
equal evil it's not more evil so you
should be using those either now let me
tell you that's hard for people to do in
fact one of our best IDs have a little
button you know click juries getters and
setters for all my variables I want to
go find that guy shoot him
whoever put that button on your screen
he has ruined more programs and more
programmers with that one button methods
that have more than two levels of
indention nested ifs that's to do loops
yeah got that it's wrong fix it
so again we we teach how to do these
things and still write very productive
code suspicious classes any class that
is an ER or is evil managed your classes
calculators how many of those are we
right I almost guarantee the other God
classes out there you should not be
using them by the way what do they do
where's the manager class - like ogre
managers he takes your work in your work
he takes credit for it
he reaches who grabs your data your data
your data does the calculations for you
thank you I'm the manager you sure data
encapsulated you do the work
push that code back to these guys so the
ers and Oh ours we kill them off it's a
little hard to figure out how to write a
piece of code without an ER or again
need for the class um I hate naming
interfaces Navy interface with a special
convention it's evil that's you know
that's a c-sharp think Oh a single
interface in a single class it's why
have two things for me one thing works
fine don't worry about that this is one
of one of my colleagues actually
proposed I have trouble argue with it
but you have more than two is this
variable something's wrong if you have
three is this variables two of them are
more related than the other that's a
hint there's something you should be
able to tease away that takes those two
with it I don't tend to follow that rule
at least three or four or five before I
start doing these things but but you
know two more than two evil yeah
probably not a bad idea look at that
either so a lot of very strange coding
conventions we're trying to kill off the
results of this training is frankly
about 20% of students drop out there's
really two classes those guys those guys
that don't have the conceptual skills to
understand what you're talking about
like oh yeah I just kind of write a main
just write a big long method with lots
of ifs and do's and it works again it
working I'm happy and I'm feeling good
about myself and it's like yeah you
don't belong here dude the other group
that tends to drop out is sort of the
tech lead team leads who we're saying
okay your job is now write code you have
great conceptual skills that's why
you're a team lead or an architect and
they sit down beside some new University
graduate who's just running rings around
them in the class and they just can't
stand it how he's embarrassing me I
can't have this and so he drops out of
the class his career is nose-diving he's
heading the wrong direction
turns out about 20% of students come out
of the class because they were ready for
this and they're twice as fast they were
the week before everything said them you
said made sense of them it's like oh my
god I understand how to write code
better now and they're twice as fast as
they walk out of the court code it turns
out a predictor of success in the class
tends to be things that are tied up with
basically conceptual skills if you're an
architect you got there because you had
great conceptual skills and then because
you have that it works really well or a
designer also exposure to multiple
programming languages particularly
different classes of languages we I
never hire anybody who's considered a
adjective programmer if you're hcv says
i'm an adjective programmer Java
programmer rails programmer I don't one
touch you
I don't looking for programmers we solve
problems we do it we don't care about
what language we solve it in so you know
both of the languages helps quite a bit
after the training if you don't try
anything use it within a month it will
start to atrophy you already forget why
do I want to get rid of that blank line
it works why can't I use multiple AF
statements DPF statements what's wrong
with an else statement I can write code
like this for a long time still works so
you don't sort of drop it to a team as
making sure you're using this stuff
you've wasted your training but training
budget so don't do that either um and
you got it when you we come out of this
training you got to be able to drop down
with somebody who knows about how to
work at this style you need to be
pairing with those guys to refine those
skills and it gets a stick so you got to
make sure you have enough guys waiting
for them and journeyman master Murs to
pick up these new guys coming out of
class so going back to my nationwide
project you know is it was your same
technology different way of working so
basically at this point we we did three
releases with the client and then we
walked out the door and before you left
because the client is going to keep
writing code the question was what do we
need to do in try to transition the team
to pick up all the stuff
just worked on so what was our
transition plan and we worked this out
with a client they said we don't need
any documentation thank you very much we
don't need any training we don't need
any time for the training we're ready to
take over right now because we have been
rotating pairs we've been working
together we've been solving problems
we've been working in the style of
programming made all the code so easy to
understand entire classes were 25 lines
of code
there weren't any herbs and orders a guy
classes floating around everything was
pretty easy to understand let's say we
don't need any training the management
didn't believe them but they'd actually
released three more releases after we
left without that training so trying to
be no problem have none of these things
how strange is that it's a different way
of writing code so I played some of
these games that male online if you're
not familiar with male online it's it's
a it's a tabloid newspaper it's been in
business since 1890 in 1892 were buying
news from celebrities or whatever in
royalty
so he's 125 year old company it's run by
Lord Rothermere Lord rosboroughs the
fourth Lord Rosebery of his title so
we're talking about old English company
and it was brought in to sort of bring
some of these ideas to fruition so what
we did basically was we put everybody
through the training
this included q a's and scrum masters
and in the architects the hell-like it
didn't matter where your front-end
developer or our back-end developer or
an iOS developer everybody would go we
went through the same training because
we're trying to build the skill set
regardless of you that role so I ran the
first class in October 1st of that year
we put about 9 to 12 students through
there I include the project managers
keyway we run for clients that we
weren't through the program that that
everybody had the opportunity to go
through it think there's only three
people said we won't go through it and
so what we wound up doing then after
this we started implementing the ideal
building teams around these things so we
started development on the 15th of
October two exams the class was over we
use Ruby to do our development these
they'd never seen Ruby before the first
of October
and we successfully delivered new pages
of the newspaper in Ruby language using
these techniques within a first month
afterwards so so far at six months and
six months level when it's point when I
left this thing we actually had five
different tables everyone was solving
problems we're using new languages we're
using closure we're using Ruby we're
running very very lean teams working in
a style and we successfully delivered a
rewrite of the newspaper rewriter the
whole front of the newspaper something
to CTOs had tried and failed and got
fired for beforehand partly because we
empowered the people gave them the
problem and walked away and gave them
these techniques to work with so the
secret assumption of agile which i think
is the next last slide secret assumption
of agile is writing code that's easy to
change it's probably not the way your
code looks today there's tiny little
classes the very functional classes kill
the getters and setters get rid of the
herbs and the ORS that stuff makes your
code extremely easy to change the last
release of the nationwide project
I took the team size down to six
programmers 6 how many testers does it
take to support six programmers but
typical ratios three to one it would
take you know two testers to support
these six programmers who wasn't enough
needed six testers six wasn't enough it
took 17 testers to keep up with six
programmers seventeen testers four of
those programmers were now master
programmers because we've been pairing
investing in training them which means
effort wise there were 40 people in that
for warm bodies two other guys were
journeyman so as 44 logical bodies
divide that by three seventeen
programmers 70 testers this is very very
powerful stuff so that sort of wraps it
up
secret sumption of agile engineering
practices to go with a lot of the
management practice you've been hearing
today it's a different way of writing
programs very powerful way of doing it I
think I have time for questions oh there
wasn't watching the clock too much yes
we have about
five or 10 minutes for questions anybody
not writing urgent or you do getters and
setters yes we have a microphone here
please
thank you yeah you want to queue up to
the microphone I'd be fine just one of
the questions from your slides when you
said that no there is an alternate
alternative without using if and case
and all those things can you give us an
example of how much reduction in code
size have we seen by just using design
patterns or without using the
traditional way of coding I can't
understand thing he said the echo is
really bad oh I'm sorry
well why don't you come to tell me the
question without the Delta microphone
yes yes so the question is what's right
production code sighs I don't I sure my
number a lot well let's see the the in
the nationwide project the the offshore
vendor is estimating going to write five
hundred thousand lines of code implement
the application we opened the
application in 60,000 plus sixty five
thousands of test code so pretty much a
reduction of universe would take
probably 80% 85% reduction code size a
lot of that has to do with design
patterns and because for example uh you
know state state strategy patterns kill
if statements like crazy so I write a
state Paris home write a state of
strategy pattern and we have to make a
case statement and a big thing like that
I can do that with three or four lines
of code so scenes rise your parents are
very powerful we use composite patterns
and et cetera but yeah we were we do out
writing probably only 20 20 20 percent
or less than what the indie inventor was
gonna write and accomplish the same
thing yes
I'm trying to have open source projects
they're written in this style
um I don't do much open-source myself
but I have a few things on my my github
account I always say the best thing I've
ever seen for doing this is small talk
so the small talk source code itself
which was which published looks this way
through me tiny that style of working I
would say right now I'll say if you look
at some of the more popular and powerful
nodejs libraries they're written in
style this style as well very very tiny
methods very very avoiding the getters
and setters as much as possible yes so
the question is is comparing this to
functional programming versus
object-oriented this is pure
object-oriented going in fact I would
say is unpopular as object-oriented
because we're not writing this style
we're right we're trying to write your
more traditional style programming
comparing this to the functional
languages sube things like closure and
things like that
there's sorting a lot of elements of
that built into these languages it
Smalltalk certainly had a lot of
functional programming concepts they
borrowed a life from list when they
built that language I use a lot of those
constructs you know applying Maps
playing map operations across entire
Ray's very quickly a lot of stuff is
being used here but that being said the
functional programming style is also
very terse but you don't have things
like encapsulation you know where it's
about that that being said I'm not a
functional programmer I've used a lot of
function programming concepts but I'm
not a pure functional programmer
oh I haven't gone through that
transition yet myself I don't know I
know that when I started learning how to
write objects this way it hurt my head I
mean I went through five years of pain
every time I try something my shirt to
learn my object colleagues he shakes his
head like this you're like why did you
rock you just taped a junior says like
this so you go back and rework it but it
was big methods using getters and
setters I mean I was doing all the stuff
I was trained to do and it turns out
it's wrong
but I was five-years of pain so
basically what this class I teach is
it's basically taking my five years of
pain may get one week of extreme pain
for the students well I just Suzy's
class especially when I'm engaged with a
client I'm gonna write some code form if
I look at their team and talk to their
team and they don't know this stuff we
learned this stuff first the criterias
do that like we did the Daily Mail they
said I was pushing code out the door but
I took everybody put it through this
training so we knew how to work together
and get this stuff done that way that's
why I develop it I like writing code but
I like don't like writing code in ugly
ways I can't I can't stand that so
that's what I've got you know hey too
much anal retentiveness or whatever it
has to be but I like writing code of
this style I can't stand not to any
other questions yes Sandi Metz just
published a book in Ruby about how to
write code of this style I would say
between Martin files refactoring book
which is very good about this stuff it's
especially the Ruby version if you're
getting Ruby or the original verses in
Java it's one of the Bible's about how
to write in this style
oh it's Andy met Sandi Metz published a
book about writing Ruby style it's very
very good about that as well
oh there's a book called I think
learning to program from the pragmatic
programmer guys it's an introductory
programming book but it uses the same
style of thinking about how to build
things it's also Ruby oriented yeah Ruby
this stuff is quite easy to do it's a
little it's not hard to do in Java
either obviously I did this in Java but
you know basically when I write in Ruby
my line might my program is about half
the size they are in same Sakura code in
Java using these same techniques and the
lines are much much shorter so I'm much
more productive in a dynamic language on
this stuff yes
we have tons of kovitch around naming
conventions they used to be a little
book came out of the rogue wave guys
called it was a style guide it was
before I think was written for Java but
it's not about naming conventions you
know if you have a collection you name
it with a plural word those names you
name if I'm a functionary if a method
returns it returns of value you name the
method for the value it returns and
these are things we teach in the class
because that's as part of the
communicate we wanted to scream out what
it does I know if I if somebody has a
plural plural name for something that's
an object and it's not a really a
collection I can't read the code I read
the code it gets I get confused because
the conventions are just making it so
much clearer to you so we teach that as
well and a little bit that's what
pairing is very powerful for when I'm
writing code I'm gonna get try to get it
working my partners they're saying you
know there's a better name for that
there's a very powerful part of it
alright let me wrap it up to that point
thank you for coming again variously
programming style a lot of fun to work
this way and extremely productive thank
you
