my name is Veronica Larry I work a
System Architect for a group within
Philips called connected digital
platforms and propositions so yeah we're
in the Netherlands I hope I don't have
to explain too much what Phillips's or
what Philips does right we're a 125 year
old company been doing products and
things like light bulbs and TVs and
radios for a long time but the past few
years Philips has been going through a
major transformation right so we are
focusing more and more on healthcare
really becoming a health technology kind
of company and in that context the group
that I work for connected digital
propositions and platforms is has been
working on building a platform that
enables the that enables Philips to
actually become a high-tech company
really manage all the data that we have
and deliver a good amount of value to
the users so what I'm going to talk
about in the next few slides is some of
the trends that we have seen which is
led us to think in this direction also
why did we actually start making a
platform what are the major concerns or
learnings that we've seen while starting
to build this platform yeah as we said
earlier if there's questions anywhere
please just ask to start with there's a
few trends that probably most of you are
aware of but like to reiterate that
driving this transition so connected
digital products right and we're talking
in the IOT tracks so so obviously
everything is now connected yeah so
connectivity is this is kind of a given
if you buy a device that cannot really
connect I'd it via bluetooth or Wi-Fi to
another mobile or something and to the
Internet that's simply not possible
everything that you look at has to be
connected and the second real thing that
made this happen because I also remember
it was six or seven years ago if you
actually made an Internet connected TV
or a device
that the big discussion was always how
do you control that device right
was it the remote control do you build a
specific tablet that does that the
control point was a big discussion the
coming of mobile solved that problem
right so everybody has a mobile device
the mobile devices are always connected
so basically you have a control point
for IOT devices by default yeah so there
is a control point and then the third
big trend is the coming of cloud with
scalable data storage processing and
analytics we cannot underestimate this
simply because what it means to build a
big infrastructure has changed
significantly with the coming of the
cloud earlier you would have to be a
huge company to set up a datacenter or
hire a mainframe or whatever and now
with things like Amazon Web Services
anybody can start ripping out an
instance of the cloud and start doing
things yeah now with these things
happening the nature of a product has
fundamentally changed so especially for
a company like Philips in the past when
we made a TV or a DVD player or
something else you made a product you
really tested it a box pro and put it in
the box put it on the shelf and sold it
and then it was done right and people
would buy it and use it and the purpose
for it which it was built it was fully
tested before you put in the market it
was done but what you see now is that a
digital product is by default just a
small piece in a in a big puzzle yeah so
if you build a product you need to build
an application around it you bring it to
build some services around it and
because you do all of this it's
difficult to bundle the cost of all
these services into a product so you
need to make sure that you're constantly
leveraging the data that you have and
making something out of it and again if
you make a mobile application the
ecosystem around you is always changing
right so if you yeah there's a new
version of iOS it's a new version of
Android that is not controlled by us but
the users expect your app to continue
working you have to constantly make
updates that has to keep happening and
all of this means a very very fun
mental change in the way a lot of
product companies do business so it's no
longer about making a product putting it
in the box and shipping it out it's all
about building the building the
proposition around it in which the
product is just one piece yeah and
that's that's what we call a proposition
here within Philips so basically it's
hardware software and services all
interconnected by data and digital
content that deliver meaningful
solutions so this is this is something
that's happened in the product landscape
agenda and then if you look at
healthcare the same trends that drove
the change in the product are also
leading to what we call the
democratization of healthcare
traditionally healthcare when within
Philips when we said healthcare it was
these big machines you had scanners
x-ray machines things that went into the
hospitals only experts could look at
them and so on and that was healthcare
consumers had nothing to do with
healthcare but what you see now is
everybody has a variable right there
people want to discuss people have
sensors people want to know what is
going on with them and healthcare is no
longer limited to hospitals people have
a lot of data they want to use that data
in the hospitals outside and I want to
constantly know how well they're doing
are they doing well and what's going on
and this means that yeah healthcare is
no longer limited just to the big iron
devices and to hospitals so these two
terms together enable what we like to
call the health continue yeah so
basically you have again if you go back
to if you look at what we do we span an
entire spectrum from when you're born
all the way till you get more or less
right so basically we call it from the
womb to the tomb so we have products
that do pregnancy and as soon as you're
born you have devices well maybe cameras
and so on and then you
we're variables which which help you
track your fitness and prevention and
then if you go into a hospital you have
all these x-rays and MRI machines and so
on and then you have treatment devices
and finally if you're an if you're old
and if you need home care
you also have devices that can do fall
detection look at your wellness and so
on and so forth and if you look at the
amount of data that this provides and
the opportunities that this gives it's
amazing right you basically don't have
to wait for somebody to fall sick or you
don't have to only treat people on
conditions you can actually follow them
through their life with the consent
whatever but really understand and
deliver value for the person so it it
can help the consumer understand who he
is
and deliver the value all the way
through but we do this there are a few
basic things that need to be in place
right so like I mentioned although we
there are products in all the spaces
typically they're all built in their own
silos so the event guys are out there
building their baby bottles the x-ray
guys are building their x-rays and
somebody is building a health watch and
if I import the data from my health
watch on to my aunt or phone or
something and then I go into the
hospital for an x-ray they don't even
know that I'm the same person right
unless you solve the problem of having
one identity for the user across all of
these segments then you don't have a
health continue that's one and the
second big challenge is data again if
unless all of this data across the
spectrum lands in one data store
somewhere where you can actually compare
correlate analyze to all of these things
then you have nothing right because
everything is again silent so that's the
so that's that's that's a bit of context
from where we are coming so we have
these trends we have this ambition to go
into the health continuum how do we
solve this problem and the way we
thought of doing that is to actually
build a platform which can support solve
some of these things and support the
entire health continue so I will talk
about how we approach that going for
so before diving into the building
blocks and what the platform is right I
want to quickly show ya we said that a
device is just a small part of the
solution I just want to show what a
typical solution looks like these days
right so again event as a part of
Philips that does mother and child care
so you
they make baby bottles and temperatures
and so on well if you look at the
biggest project that we are working on
with an event it's a software project
which is basically a kind of application
that allows parents to to keep track of
how the children are doing so they can
either do that manually by just entering
how well you're sleeping and so on but
also with a bunch of IOT devices that
character it yeah we have we have a baby
camera that connects to it which can
detect whether your baby is sleeping or
awake in and out of bed there is
thermometer that connects to it which
again transfers all of this data via
bluetooth to the app and so on but the
interesting bit here is beyond the
connectivity what we try to do is once
you get this data in the application the
application has to store all of these
observations process that data do
something interesting with it and give
back some personalized recommendations
to the user and personalized is kind of
the key part right so if I just send the
same article to everyone not if I just
show the same advice to everyone it
doesn't make sense so what you need to
do is really look at the data make sense
of it for that specific person also that
specific baby and give something back
and this this is this is kind of a
proposition that we're looking at and
you can do this at almost every level
right so I was talking about the baby
care stuff but if you start looking at
things like toothbrushes you could do
the same you could have sensors in there
which which gathers a lot of data you
could actually provide guidance to the
user on which parts of the mode that
they're not brushing well on is it
working is it not working how long do
you brush all of these kind of things
and an interesting bit here is although
this looks like a simple application
this is actually medical yeah so when I
say medical
it basically means that this is
classified as a medical device because
it's getting tape data from the data
from something like a thermometer which
is a class to medical device and then
you're processing that and giving back
advice so this entire system is
classified as medical and his hands
filed with the FDA and so on as a
medical device ya know if you go a level
deeper into what it takes to build an
application like this first of all like
I mentioned this is this is medical rate
so there's an entire group of within
research or scientists or whoever else
you're actually looking at all the data
out there and coming up with meaningful
correlations yeah so like like I said
you have a lot of IOT devices so for
example we have an air purifier right
which is a so these days the quality of
the air is a big deal in China a lot of
people have air purifiers and then we
have you have a baby camera which can
measure how the baby is sleeping so what
could be interesting is to see is there
actually a clinically proven connection
between the air quality in your room and
how well your baby is sleeping so we
have people who actually do research on
that look up the literature clinical
trials if needed etcetera etcetera and
come up with the kind of rule saying if
the air core if the co2 concentration in
the room goes beyond a certain value
then the baby sleep and the baby does
not sleep ER yeah and once you come up
with something like that you actually
have to write down content in a way that
makes sense to a specific user who's
listening to it how do you want to
explain it you have to define a rule
that that triggers this thing so
basically what happens is you're getting
in a lot of data from the air purifier
and at a certain time if you see that
the the value of the co2 concentration
is going too high then you want to
trigger a rule to give them feedback and
then you have to have the application
which actually gives this feedback to
the user right so this the
this whole system is what you need to
build up a digital proposition now
before going a bit further so that's
that was background to say what is the
kind of propositions we are looking to
address in the problems that we're
solving a couple of special thing is
things that make it more challenging in
the medical arena and that's about this
medical device classification right so
if you build a medical device like the
like you grow it's no longer just an
application simply because the moment
you say something is medical it is
heavily regulated and you need to have
all kinds of documentation and
classification etcetera and finally so
the first thing that happens there is
you have this process called yeah you
need to do a risk analysis of every any
proposition that you build to say which
medical class does it belong to and that
always starts with something called the
intended use yeah so you have to declare
saying this is a device so if you build
it thermometer say this is a device that
is intended to diagnose the temperature
of a baby within a tolerance of a
certain value and diagnose if he has a
fever if you say that and then you have
to actually start saying okay there are
these are the components that this
thermometer contains and this
requirement or the claim that you have
maps to these various components in this
way because of which we then end up with
the classification Class A B or C Class
A is no injury if the device goes bad no
injury or as possible so typically what
you see is a number of these
applications that we have fallen the
Class A simply because if you say I'm
importing data from a thermometer and
some of the thermometer shows the data
in the mobile application goes wrong it
doesn't show the right temperature is
that cause for serious injury or non
serious injury right and that's the kind
of discussion that you need to have with
the experts and they usually they say
no if you just show if the display is
wrong it's usually not cause for serious
injury because the parents are still
looking at the baby and they know that
he isn't doing well etcetera etcetera
and any parent who purely looks at a
mobile and doesn't see that this baby is
not doing too well isn't doing great
parenting
so that's usually falls in the Class A
but then you have other devices like
Class B where you really use them for
diagnosis and if they misdiagnosed
something then this possible for non
serious injury and then you have Class C
which is where you can really have
people dying if something goes wrong
right and a typical example is an x-ray
machine if the amount of exposure is not
right and if you deliver too much x-ray
then you can cause serious injury this
is the and this is becomes extremely
interesting when we go further into the
platforms that we are building because
if we start building if you're building
various building blocks that you want to
pick and choose and compose into a
proposition then what classification do
you paint that with right because
different propositions will have
different categories and when your
component goes into that you need to
make sure that it fits the specific
category so that's a pretty interesting
challenge and the next one is personal
data I don't know if you some of you
were here for loop in stock before but
personal data is extremely important and
if you look at the classification of
personal data we have anything that can
identify a person it's personal data so
including IP addresses by the way so
that's always interesting so if you're
collecting data if you're actually
logging the IP address from where a
request is coming from you're still
collecting data so for regulatory
reasons you have to say you have to
declare that you're collecting personal
data and actually abide by all the laws
and regulations and then the moment you
have something like ethnicity race
sexual preference or anything to do with
health that sensitive personal data and
sensitive personal data always has to
follow
really stringent regulations and these
are things like sensitive personal data
in a number of cases cannot leave a
country where you are where the data was
collected so if there's a consumer and
France for whom you're collecting a
certain amount of data
there are regulations that say that that
data has to reside within the country so
if you actually have a cloud deployment
in the US then you're not allowed to
send data for European consumer for that
and then you have things like China
which has its own set of regulations
Russia etcetera etcetera
and those bring in extremely interesting
implications and on top of that the it's
not just about the it's not just about
how and where you stir it's also about
whether the user has consented to the
type of data that we're collecting and
does it really understand what we're
using it for does he give informed
consent to it yeah so a couple of slides
here I'll go through that quickly but
basically the whole idea is that
whenever you are collecting any kind of
personal data you need to make sure that
the user really understands what data is
giving up and why and gives explicit
consent and we also have to ensure that
you actually record the consent from the
user very well so that if you have for
regulatory reasons this has to be
clearly recorded and kept somewhere so
that's a slightly long context basically
say all the challenges and the contexts
that led us to creating a platform so
yeah and then that we start we thought
that it's an interesting idea to
actually build a platform simply because
these are issues that are faced by
different parts of the company different
propositions again and again and you
could solve it once and solve it well by
building a platform the important things
there is you have one at 1.4 user
identity and authorization consistent
brand expression so we also don't want
every application that Philips builds
looking very different we have one
things combining data I think we
mentioned that simply be quicker because
everyone does not need to
do the same thing over and over again
and it just gives a scale right so it
could be that each individual business
with the amount of data isn't huge but
then if you're able to put it all
together gives us very good scale the
security and compliance is complex and
if we can do it once and do it well then
it helps us so talking about so going by
the kind of propositions that we have we
have a number of different types of
building blocks so you have the the UX
part of it where you want to have a
consistent look and feel you can have
building blocks in there you can have
connected devices itself the devices
have a bit and the backend cloud
services we'll talk a little bit about
each of these so for the front-end
building blocks to a large extent we're
building iOS and Android apps and also
web applications so what we do in this
space is we have a concept of micro
applications so basically what we do is
create composable micro applications
which actually can say hey they have an
entry point you say you launch this do a
bunch of activities and then you exit
and these are built completely from top
to bottom
Isis is almost a standalone thing which
has its own context which is completely
tested there it just works yeah so what
that means you can actually if you have
four different applications or solutions
that did it they can all just pick it up
put it in their application and go and
it works and they don't have to actually
test the basic functionality again and
do it over and over again and the
interesting bit here is that when we
talk about a microp it's not just the UX
bit so if you take a typical example
user registration right so if you look
at if you download any application that
Philips has bet there is there as there
are screens in there where a user can
register and login or there are screens
in there where a user can actually
connect hook up to his IOT device
connected to the Internet and get the
initial setup going now instead of doing
that again and again what we do is build
it as a micro application so basically
you build your application where you say
hey now I want to go into registration
so you transfer control to this micro
app go through all the steps in there
and he does his thing
finishes the registration and then hands
control back to the yeah which means
that you can just reuse the whole thing
again and again so the the interesting
bit about this is to say if you build an
iOS and Android application how have ya
we also have this discussion on what do
we really need to do on top of what is
an Android already delivered to to make
micro applications or to build
applications so there's a number of
things we need to have something like a
uniform logging format right so if you
have a number of different applications
who are all logging some data and if you
want to make sense of it centrally we
need to define good logging formats
simply handling of configuration options
by definition these microbes are usable
in a number of different applications
which means that they have a lot of
possible configurations and how do we
define all of these configurations and
manage them in one place it's an
interesting challenge determining user
local so I was explaining to you before
that a user who is in France for example
can never be routed to a data center or
the cloud instance in the US yeah that
means that we really have to have pretty
reliable ways of determining where the
users locales so that could be things
like yeah do we combine is geoip with
this language with this with the country
that he has selected and a number of
other parameter so these are all things
that we have to do in the mobile
yes so that's yeah that's that's an
interesting question right so normally
the way we do that is you ask the user
so we you know that the user actually
registered with a specific country and
now you detect say with Geo IP or by
other means that the user is now in a
new location so what you do then is you
actually pop up something to the user
saying hey we detect that you're in a
new place do you actually want to update
your settings and move the data and if
he says yes if it's kind of permanently
mode over then you would have to
actually move the data to a different
data center and record the fact that the
user asked for it you couldn't do it on
your own yeah but if the user says no
you don't do anything but at least you
record the fact that you explicitly
asked this user and the user chose to
stay with this one and the other key
challenge is security as always so when
you look at the healthcare world
typically we were people were used to
making completely closed systems right
so you you don't you usually don't have
an open control of any of the things in
your healthcare system but now if you
have a mobile application that are
running on Android and iOS the basically
means that they're completely open which
causes a lot of challenges so there are
some basic things in here that we can do
to ensure that these things remain
secure so basically on Android and iOS
use key store and the keychain as much
as possible you secure databases so in
the iOS iOS has the concept of
protection classes where basically you
can say that make sure that the entire
database is encrypted and so on
these are things that you have to do to
build medical applications and in case
of Android we use something like SQL
cipher which can actually encrypt the
SQL database and provide an overlay on
top of it so that this whole works
then if you got that that's about the
front end building blocks then if you
start looking at the back end there we
simply use micro services I'm not going
to talk a lot about microservices I
think there's an entire track on
microservices here going on in this era
to be honest Phillips is not the expert
here we're basically just trying to
leverage yeah the best in class here and
simply make yourself or micro-services
and but the main point I want to mention
here is yeah we don't try to create
custom clouds or data centers we use
some s on web services we use Cloud
Foundry we just use all the standard
things in here and what we need to do
additionally on top is to ensure things
like the data stays in the right country
we use the right instances of Amazon Web
Services and so on and so there it is
one of the biggest challenges that we
face while doing these back-end services
is the fact that we want to update micro
services very very very often right so
the whole idea of micro services is
every couple of weeks you probably want
to make a new deployment and update it
and so on but as I was explaining in the
medical classification slides every time
you do an update to a medical device you
actually have to completely complete a
new set of documentation and file it
with the specific regulatory authority
which itself is a lot of work right
which severely limits the speed at which
we can update things so one thing we can
do there is to be smart about how we
draw the boundaries of the medical
device right so you can you can from
your intended use and exactly what the
application is doing derive which parts
of the system are actually medical and
which are not so if you can actually
separate out the for example the rules
that are doing diagnosis from the actual
service that hosts it you could say that
the service itself is updatable without
needing big documentation changes but
the rules themselves they are part of
the medical device so this is something
that they have to very carefully analyze
and define and then the
important--but is the data model and how
we store the data we have this big
ambition of having data that is fully
interoperable across the entire spectrum
when everyone can look at and handle
different data but to be able to do that
you need to have a standard format right
and there we are looking at a number of
healthcare standards things like fire
which define how to capture healthcare
data and we are we stick to that and
then we get to the devices typically the
devices look like this so most of the
devices that we build at this moment
have either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth built in
so we're looking at other technologies
going forward but right now they tend to
be Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and and what we do
here is we basically choose a few
reference hardware platforms build the
firmware for it make sure that works
together and make that available to
various businesses to build their
devices so and and we also build the
Android and iOS side libraries for it so
that the devices can talk to again in
the blue the profiles that we use for
Bluetooth for example we try to stick as
much as possible to the standard
Bluetooth profiles there are certain
cases where if you have a complex device
that does not fit into any existing
profile so for example if I want to get
sensor data from a toothbrush saying
which part of the mode is pressed well
or not and so on that's something that's
difficult to do with standard Bluetooth
profiles in that case we do use some
custom profiles but we try to limit that
as much as possible so some of the key
challenges with devices that we
typically see is it's extremely easy to
do a denial of service attack on
yourself so I think a few years ago we
had this devices are non-random right so
if any if a user is to switch something
on simply because all users are not the
same that's it it is randomized by
default it's okay but if you program all
your devices to
wake up at 5:00 a.m. see it if I am UTC
every morning and check for a software
update and then if you sell a few tens
of millions of those devices then yeah
every morning you you kind of bring
yourself down or you're looking at huge
cost so that's something that we need to
really think about and make sure that we
randomized that enough
that's because IOT really scales in
terms of number of devices so if you
think of toothbrushes I don't know how
many millions we sell every year and if
they're all connected yeah this is an
extremely important one and the other
thing that we spend a lot of time and
effort on is ble on Android phones right
so Android has a stack Bailey has a
standard but still every phone has a
slightly different shape and every phone
has a slightly different Bluetooth stack
and they behave really differently and
things just don't work so we have to
actually spend a lot of time making that
work and we try to do that in one place
in the platform so that every every
application doesn't have to struggle
with it
and it device itself yeah this is I
won't go through all of this but
basically the idea is that we have a
kind of checklist to make sure that the
device itself is fully secure and we go
to a number of points to ensure so
things like firmware update right sounds
obvious but if you look at a number of
devices they simply don't allow their
firmware to be updated so if you have a
device out there and if there is an
issue found on it there's nothing you
can do to fix it and if your firmware is
obtainable how do you sign your firmware
how do you make sure that the secure
okay so now coming back to the platform
bit of this you see the building blocks
at all these levels so the building
blocks at the device level at the app
level and at the cloud level and if you
have if we as a platform build is
building blocks and there are a number
of propositions using them you basically
see that yeah there's a huge
combinatorial complexity so you have
different versions of devices talking to
different versions of apps talking to
different versions of the
pakkun and release it's extremely
important that we kind of understand how
this is all going who was talking to who
and maintain the a pair compatibility
and so on
so the biggest amount of the work and
effort that we do is largely around this
area to ensure that that API stay
backwards compatible that we can still
support a certain number of devices and
we also have to be explicitly clear
sorry yes yes exactly
so that's what I was getting so what we
need to do is we need to have very
well-defined lifecycle management to say
hey these are the versions that we
support on for for these things in the
platform and we need to have yeah a huge
number of integration tests automated
running every night whatever to ensure
that these these things are completely
continuously working right otherwise
there's simply no way and again that's
something we also learn the hardware you
can do one or two things manually even
if it's just a couple of days or
whatever but the moment you have ten
different versions and ten different
countries and so on it just explodes and
there's no way you can handle that yeah
and yeah I think it's also feels funny
to say a number of these things and the
conference like this one right because I
think if you really look at the software
world things like continuous integration
and continuous testing are all obvious
well then if you really go into
enterprise and pure healthcare a lot of
this is new stuff so basically what you
see happening here is that every every
company is turning into a software
company right every company needs to
turn into a software company and needs
to embrace the state-of-the-art on all
of this otherwise it just doesn't work
and I think whoever does that well this
is the one that's kind of yeah so with
that a bit of a conclusion on having
done all of this so does it always say
make sense to buy the platform the
reason I asked the question is if you
look at the previous one the the
compatibility and the things that you
need to do around it it takes a pretty
I am want of effort to get this running
on a platform so if you need to make a
change for a certain feature you have to
ensure that all everything stays
backwards compatibility of to ensure
that all the things that are working on
your platform stay working which
actually makes that more expensive
change compared to something that you
could do just in a solution right so
that's a trade-off that we always have
to think about always make sure that
we've thought about it enough that it
really makes sense to spend the effort
to put something in a platform and only
do that if it makes sense and the other
thing that we do that helps us a lot is
the harvesting bit so what we try to do
is if if there is a feature that is
really needed by one solution where it's
interesting for the platform just go
ahead and build it in the solution do it
quick learn mature it and at a certain
point you can always have a state out of
the path now to the solution back into
the platform and and then it takes a bit
of effort to make it general enough and
so on but at least you've you've
exercised the feature mature rate and
you understand exactly how it needs to
work yeah so yeah that's mostly what I
had</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
