presentation today I want to tell you
something about robot soccer at start
with I want to tell you something about
our dream the dream of 2050 so for a
moment I want to take you there to that
moment to 2050 you're not here in a
conference room you're actually very
close to a soccer field imagine this is
the soccer field I actually brought a
robot so it looks like a soccer field of
course but your guy you're all very
happy of course because you're very
close to the field you're going to watch
one of the greatest matches in history
it's going to be a match between
humanoid robots and the world's champion
the world champion the human world
champion and it's actually very
interesting match it's a very thick it's
very exciting until the last minute but
in the end and this will be the first
time in history and you were all there
you saw a team of autonomous humanoid
robots win from the human world champion
well that's our dream and I was speaking
about our who are we we are the robocup
Federation we are an international
organization of researchers that all
have a specific focus we work on robots
that play autonomous soccer we want to
realize this dream of 2050 actually what
do we do we focus on artificial
intelligence and we want to promote this
we want to promote robotics and of
course what better way to do that with a
game of soccer so we do that with
different robots in a lot of different
leagues i have to tell you this up front
so on the left you see the small size
leak these are really small robots and
they focus mainly on strategy in the
middle you see a familiar robot it's
actually one of ours we play in the
middle size sleek
the name explains it all I guess and on
the right you actually see a team of nao
robots playing in the standard platform
league and that's actually where they
really focus on walking running kicking
a ball with the humanoid robot and that
this picture almost sums everything you
need for autonomous robot soccer so what
does the robocup Federation do aside
from that they organize a world
championship and a lot of different
other events all around the world an
example is for example the World
Championship we just had it was in live
sheep in Germany and actually it was
quite good World Championship as i can
tell as i'm a member of tech united and
actually we became the world champion in
middle size league of 2016 to actually
give you already a bit of a flavor of
course you see or as you're standing and
yelling this was just after we made our
last goal let me show you a quick video
and how it actually looks that actually
looks if some of these robots are moving
on a field
so we have a normal kickoff and actually
in this case you can see that the cyan
robot so the ones with a sign marker are
ours just like the one here the ones
with magenta markers are the Chinese
team water and they actually always we
face them a lot in the finals of the
World Championship this is a beautiful
goal I'm the same myself the match was
really interesting as you can see I put
it on right there was a 33 score after
regular the time and as you can see the
teams are really making it quite tense
so actually after a while we actually
came to a situation which never happened
before and RoboCup and I think we'll see
it after this beautiful goal this is
penalty series which actually never
happened and well our robot we started
off with five Chinese penalties none of
them went in and we actually needed only
one and then of course we were quite
happy and then you see thats only like
seven days of hard work or actually a
whole year of course but seven days
without particular without little sleep
and without too much programming and
then suddenly you're very happy of
course because you're the next world
champion so who are we again who are we
so we are tech united you can recognize
this we all have the same ideas about
fashion as you can tell maybe by the
t-shirts we are a team of 15 human
players and we have five field players
one goalkeeper and one thing which we
called we usually call it the beast but
this time we'd call it prototype it's
actually a different platform and this
team actually plays on World
Championships in the msl tech United
also consists of another team which is
more focused on their situations at home
but I will come back to that later so
for the moment remember that United
consists of two teams this is only the
mslt
which you see over here so this is one
of our turtles as we call them Dec
United RoboCup team limited editions so
this is the robot we use to play
autonomous soccer so as I told you
before the humanoid robots which we'll
have hopefully in 2050 beating the world
champion I have to do a lot have to
possess a lot of skill so we've tried to
put most of those skills already in
these robots so how did we do that we
actually have an omni vision unit which
is here at the top of the robot and it's
actually a camera which is looking up
into a parabolic mirror and with that
the robot can actually see everything
around it but only on the floor and
actually have the ball if I would take
the ball and i would lift it up in the
air at this point you wouldn't see the
ball because he's looking into the
mirror and then down again that's why we
actually implemented a kinect version to
Center and she might know this Center is
not sold for very long time so we
actually got our hands on it this year
and we actually use it for a first time
at the world championship this year so
what it actually does it's here in this
black bar you see at the front of the
robot and it actually helps if we want
to track high balls in front of the
robot of course this omniVision unit
gives you a 360 degrees view of the
field which is of course great imagine
you would be a field player yourself you
could also see what's happening right
behind you that would be great with the
Kinect we actually have also depth so we
can actually see ball coming way better
than with the omnivision unit so those
two centres are mainly used to perceive
the state of the game so what's going on
that's really important in soccer what's
going on on the field what's the current
state of the game where is the ball
where are my peers where's the opponent
where am I which is also a really
interesting question of course so these
sensors make sure we have a really good
view about the state of the game this
state of the game is actually created
embedded computer which is on there of
course you can imagine I don't know if
you just saw it on the screen but these
robots also collide that's also why we
have yellow and red cards so this
embedded computer of course has to be
sturdy and robust and just make sure if
we crash into another robot we don't get
lost and another fun fact we have an
active ball handling system which is
actually what you see here in the front
these two levers and they actually sit
on top of the ball and they have small
wheels why do you have small wheels we
need to roll the ball in a natural way
over the field so we cannot grasp the
ball and move it like a just like this
over the field but we have to roll it so
what we actually did is on the end of
those levers there's a wheel which is
actually like rolling the ball with the
robot and aside from that we have a
solenoid a big electromagnet inside the
robot which is used to kick the ball you
can actually see it if you hear up the
screen there is a small pin which will
actually hit the ball at a very high
speed then we can actually shoot the
ball up to 12 meters a second which is
quite quick and hopefully it can pass
the keeper and then people will say I
didn't even see a ball until I saw it
behind me that's usually what we aim for
then we also have a holonomic base which
is actually a base with Omni wheels and
that actually means that we are very
agile on the field our robots can move
at any moment they can move to the right
to the left they can move to the front
they can actually turn and do any
combination of the above so the best
thing is in combination with this active
ball handling system we can actually be
as agile as we can move we can also
dribble unfortunately I cannot show you
now with the ball handling system
enabled but you can see for yourself
tomorrow we'll present at the meet the
speakers and robot in the foyer
downstairs and we can actually show you
that we are very agile we can just carry
it rolled around and robot will
move the ball with it in any direction
we want maybe some of you got a question
at this moment why on earth are you
building robots that play soccer why are
not saving the world for example well we
have some particular raises for that
first of all we're not only aiming for
these robots that play soccer as I told
you tech night it also consists of a
different team this is actually the at
home team which actually has two robots
which are more general purpose so you
can actually see the white one over here
that's amigo and this one on the left
it's sergio i can tell you the rest of
the team is human so maybe some of you
were honoring or two robots in the
picture and these robots are built to
function in a home so I actually have a
short movie of that as well so here
you'll see mostly amigo performing at
the robocup 2014 and in this case you
already see a lot of difference there is
no RoboCup field or at least there's no
soccer field in this way and the robot
is just picking stuff it has to follow
people so it should be able that there
is like a person walking through the
view on a I can tell you on a RoboCup
field you should not do that it could
should be able to interact with people
so it has speech recognition but it can
also speak for itself it can get into a
conversation as you can see pic it can
pick up stuff and bring it back to the
operator who requested the object so
let's see aside from those caring robots
those general burbs robots we also have
the rescue robots that's a whole
different league of the RoboCup and
these are actually building robots that
are able to go into like buildings that
collapsed or environments which are very
hazardous difficult to drive through and
this is actually oh this is actually
something they already used in some
crash sites i think it was in japan when
a nuclear
reactor broke that's actually where they
already use these robots and of course
why do we play soccer well I think I
only have to show you this video to make
you understand the answer to this
question this was an ant over our home
base we I can say we have quite some
fans over there so not only we went
crazy but in this case also the audience
went crazy you have to imagine in
Germany it was maybe a little bit more
exciting but this is only five seconds
before the end of the regular time we
scored 22 at that point so everybody was
already on the edge of their seat and
then we made the to do so at that moment
a lot of energy comes free in the old
stadium oh let me see and of course one
of the most important things is
enthusing young people for robotics and
that's actually what the whole theme
thinks is great when we are at playing
soccer and there are so many children
looking at those esee what we are doing
we are hoping that we're inspiring them
in becoming maybe also robotics engineer
or doing something mechanical so those
are like the intermediate goals of
RoboCup so we're playing soccer to
develop technologies and for example
perceiving the state of the game general
purpose robots and that all to promote
research for robotics and artificial
intelligence I want to thank you for
agenda attention right now thank you you
all yeah let's give him a hand thank you
very much
you are not done yet do not download
your part of the panel I like to invite
the rest of the panel to come up to talk
about the future of robotics and so
you're on and then and Greg please come
up and sit at the panel and please
submit your questions as you see fit we
have one here while the panel is sitting
down so the question goes around the
interconnectivity between your robots
are they sending information to each
other are they acting independently of
each other no in this case the robots
are really communicating via Wi-Fi of
course that's really important a soccer
is a team play game just like we humans
also robots is really important to make
sure that they are communicating with
them there's only one striker there's
only but we have two defenders actually
one striker another attacker a
goalkeeper and they all have to be
communicating to make sure they are not
interfering with each other and also
what's another thing we're researching
multi-agent systems which we actually
use the fact that we have multiple
robots to actually improve the state of
the game we have so for example if this
robot doesn't know that the ball for
example is around that corner but there
is another robot which can see the ball
actually they will communicate such that
day together create a complete world
model that's actually the two main
functions perfect thanks a lot have a
seat and then i'll try to moderate this
and need good questions as well i'll
start by asking the panelists just to
address maybe in a in a couple of
minutes when we say the future of
robotics and we think about the robot
extreme as sort of everything included i
guess what comes what comes to mind you
know what's what's your point of view of
the future of robotics from you our area
of expertise i'm going to start out with
them so i am a complete interloper on
this panel I don't have an area of
expertise I just SAT near the front
because I can hear better from
so what do I think I I was at the gate
this morning and my brain was going it
does feel like we're on the verge of the
fourth Industrial Revolution we've had
industrial then we've had technology and
now we're getting into like machine
learning and robotics and I see those
things as very much interlinked it's not
just deep learning a machine learning
it's it's also building the devices that
can respond so we're talking about then
it in his talk this morning was talking
about its feedback loops that used to
take days or you know coming out of
minutes coming out two numbers of
milliseconds so the two airborne create
machines can bounce a ball to each other
and sustain that because they can that
they can they can to keep the feedback
go and I quickly so at that point
suddenly like you know I sort of see
this incredible world opening up that I
can't even begin to imagine and I know
it sounds like hyperbole by honestly I
don't know where we'll be in 20 years
and I love that I don't know where we'll
be in 20 years all right thanks a great
guy we actually comes from Universal
robots as the lead software guy a few
words from you on the future of robotics
as you see it I think one of the big
things were going to be seeing is the
interconnectivity I think a lot of these
robots are going to be connected up
connected to the cloud I think they're
going to be passing information to each
other to improve the overall automation
yeah I think that we're going to
beginning to see the blurring of the
lines between the robotics and what the
humans actually do so thank you John
yeah as then I'm also totally not an
expert on this field but I do have some
vicious and the wish is that all these
robotics
and I've seen a lot of videos on youtube
because I had to prepare for this panel
discussion and and as that's how there's
a lot of like it seems there's a lot of
technical stuff robots and things
driving around and toys but all not very
useful at the moment it's it's very
exciting and but I think what I would
like to look more into is how can you
take use of it like practical use maybe
in your home because if what you have is
your own then you would like to have
some help in your home and maybe start
with something that okay let's have
something basic you would like to have
it to do for you and this is what I'm
thinking about when I'm looking at all
these things and possibilities so use
them as a tool to integrate and and take
use of it very good who said do you have
any thoughts on what's your dream come
true on robotics for the future yeah
yeah it's very interesting i also the
industrial ready the fourth Industrial
Revolution but I think it's maybe even a
revolution which is far bigger than that
or at least that's what I'm hope will
happen it will not be only industrial
but that's what I hope of course I hope
that robots like amigo and Sergio and
maybe also these turtles will just
become normal in our daily lives maybe
at some point will not be what only
watching humans soccer but also robotic
soccer I think there we are on the verge
of something really big is happening
there's a lot of change at the moment
and of course I can also cannot
perfectly predict where this is going
but I don't think robots will only be in
the industry alone anymore there will
also be in our homes entertainment I
also think for example drone racing is a
really interesting topic at the moment
and it's also growing very rapidly so I
for sure of that these things like also
entertainment at home they will just
expand like crazy very good i have a
quick question here from from the
audience so software inherits human
errors in the form of box
and how is the human error shown in
robotics maybe that salsa so yeah yeah
we don't like human errors yeah and you
can imagine it's actually really funny I
was just talking we we actually had a
question from another robot Cup team we
attack tonight it because we were
improving our software a lot if you see
tech United during a World Championship
we're always a team which is programming
during the in between games and then
uploading the next software we touch a
lot of code during such tournament and
of course there are human errors most of
the times we try to decouple as much as
possible our software to make sure that
not the entire robot starts is like
stalls but for example segmentation
faults or something we do test of course
during tournaments but most of the times
we try with decoupling try to make sure
that if there is a human error it's not
the whole robot stalling but just like
this small part very good i do have any
questions from the audience any smart
questions yeah we got one right here so
one thing I'm wondering about a lot is
as we keep automating more stuff and
adding robots and as one part of our
daily lives and infrastructure security
becomes even more important than it
already is because if a hacker takes
down some but an infrastructure or
something like that and how how would
you say we should how how should we look
at security in all this because in my
mind we're exposing a hell of a lot of
what we do normally now or going down
this route so I've got a penny about
this I would say I think security is the
presenting symptom if you like what we
should be thinking about secure ability
so as with anything sit your your secure
profile is it's you have to bake that
right in it has to be front of mind all
the way through like testability you
can't make something testable after the
fact you can't make something securable
after the fact so a lot of what I'm
seeing and again as a layman right so
I'm not I'm not deep into it like these
guys what a lot of one thing as a layman
is that makes me feel a bit safer about
that is that the overarching kind of
architectural style is small discreet
cooperating units which means
essentially hacking a unit is a fairly
isolated affair now where it gets
interesting is hacking the channels by
which they communicate and so then
you're talking about you know security
model needs to be around securing the
Datagram rather than the channel as it
were so I need to know that the messages
i'm receiving from the other players as
take it to the soccer hasn't been
injected as a toxic message from some of
the other players because i don't know
if that's not allowed but you know Frank
alert if I was not allowed that's a
shame because I be on duty because that
bad of a fantastic hack is just not
getting the other players to run around
it's ok no you know if he is so so I
think having things like really simple
basic crypto that we've already got like
signing messages like having good
sources of messages and then a lot of
the distributed technologies that are
coming out around things like Byzantine
general problems and that kind of thing
so so how do I know whether some or any
of my agents have been intercepted or
being corrupted all been replaced so
we've already were already developing
protocols in general distributed systems
so I think as long as we can make these
little autonomous units reasonably
isolated and and build secure ability in
from the ground up I think we've got a
pretty good story if we don't we're in
for a world of hurt thanks any other
thoughts on the security matter from the
panel yeah well what I would like to see
the Challenger adding to the robot
soccer will be googling need
to him also to prepare of course but I
do share the opinion I think of Dan in
this case I think you can see it quite
decoupled in this sense that security of
course it's very important but it's also
matter which is tackled in way different
fields it would be possible to merge
these for example cyber security with
robot security and indeed with the
methods then already suggested yeah
great thank you did we have a question
over here I think I saw a question no
don't know he waited till you go right
over the other side of the room it has a
history of troublemaking oh you don't
know me Greg so I was wondering the
turtles when they are playing how did he
distinguish between friends and foes or
friendly players or yeah that's actually
a really interesting one because in the
tournament I think none of the teams use
the fact that each team has a
distinctive color so in this case you
see our scientist we also have magenta
markers but when we play a game there's
it's only sign forces magenta you could
use of course vision software to extract
that sian are my peers and magenta our
opponents but we don't do that what we
do instead is that we have one robot
seeing black boxes all over the fields
and black boxes in this case represent
robots but they are classified as
objects or obstacles in this case
something you just cannot drive over or
through and what we do with the software
they're actually so they're constantly
communicating with each other and they
also communicate where they are so if I
if this turtle sees a black spot over
there and the black spot is
communicating that someone is there a
peer robot is there then you will know
at that point there is a peer robot if
that black spot is not communicating we
assume it's an opponent so that's how
that works
read and we actually have a lot of
really interesting questions coming in
here so a couple of naughty ones too by
the way thank you for those what about
the code that take decisions about human
lives like a self-driving car that we
recently heard about in the news I think
egg can choose to run over a child or
kill the driver how do we as the
software developers handle this great
dilemma we dare to put the nose into
that one you totally kill the driver for
being an idiot and buying a self-driving
car but seriously I think it's it's a
big question your honor you you dare to
give an answer or keep your thoughts
yeah I'm actually very amazed how this
self driving capabilities of the Cask
kind of were creeping in I take if I
want to make a car and I want to have it
certified to be able to drive the street
it's a huge investment and it needs to
be tested and everything but with the
but with a self-driving cars they could
just from one version of the sufferer to
the next all of a sudden they could self
drive and I think it was never tested by
any authority or anything I think maybe
the authorities was just like puzzled
and that oh okay maybe someone allowed
this and it wasn't me and and it seems
like that's how it happened but I don't
know if anyone knows better but the of
course now there are some some you know
opinions that what what are the risk and
on the other hand maybe we can all
figure out that the self-driving car can
probably drive more safely than people
using the mobile phones or doing other
stupid things while they drive so it's
really am it's really a tricky one but I
think at least there should be a debate
before having these capabilities and I
think though there were not yeah than
anything to add to that one I think
anything like this it's an ethical
dilemma it's the one thing that a
machine can't do is is reason in that
way it needs to be programmed to reason
in that way so at some point someone is
making a decision about policy now we've
already got that decision kind of
encoded in things like in the UK you
have this the regular driving speed
limit then in a town is 30 miles an hour
we have 20 mile an hour zones in
built-up areas or near schools those
kind of things so there's already the
kind of cues there if you like to drive
more carefully and higher higher risk or
higher sensitivity areas I guess the
difference between a self-driving car
and a driver is the self-driving car
will bother taking heed of those
warnings so I think in general they're
likely to drive more safely and obey the
rules it's really hard I think in any
situation you got to ask yourself not
sort of what's the least worst thing to
do but had a human being at the wheel
would there have been a different
outcome and I suspect the you know if
there is a policy and we've all agreed
what that policy is that policy is far
more likely to be enacted in that split
second by a machine than it is by a
person so yeah I don't know how I feel
about it I sort of think I feel safer
that machines would be doing it yeah
good thoughts next one I think goes to a
Greg so it goes around lawnmowers and
vacuum cleaners robots that are already
moved into my home where's the next
practical area of Robotics not tours of
visionary dreams one of the interesting
things that I've been seeing lately is
the application of insight restaurants I
know McDonald's has been looking at
trying to automate so instead of
actually going and asking someone to to
make you a hamburger it be a robot that
would actually going through the process
and then the people that are there are
really just managing and making sure
that the products are available to the
robots there's that one and I also saw
something that was kind of interesting I
mentioned it in my talk around sewing so
there was a
robot that was capable of creating a
t-shirt sewing it and normally in the
past because of the flimsiness of the
material it just wasn't really capable
but they found some application that
they could stiffen the material and be
able to do create a t-shirt so I think
we're going to start seeing a lot of new
industries in which the robotics will
start to appear great we are there's a
follow-up question to the Universal
robots side of safety how do you guys
handle safety I know you guys have non
caved robots but so how is safety
handled and yeah I think a general
question on safety very carefully so the
way we handle at the moment we've we've
baked in a safety system so you can go
in you can you can specify some of the
restrictions that they're going to be
applied to the robot in if the robot
tries to go beyond any sort of these
these restrictions it would just shut
down but I have a feeling that going
into the future is probably going to
change a little bit a lot of new
technologies are starting to be to be
designed that allow you to sense the
world around you and I have a feeling
that we'll start seeing some some of
these new technologies creeping in and
therefore you won't have to go in and
actually specify anything in regards to
okay the robot can't go beyond this
particular wall but instead if there's
someone standing there it just knows not
to go there one of the limits that I
think that we tend to see at the moment
is this the deterministic approach of
how we program robots at least when it
comes to automation this of course is
not deterministic Adele we don't know
where it's going to go we don't know how
it's going to react from the balls in
front of it but when it comes to
automation that's that's kind of a
requirement people expect it if it did a
particular behavior once we expected
that it's going to continue to Devin to
do that behavior over and over again
but that might actually start to change
especially when we start moving into
like big data and such all right so
going back to eindhoven check right so
there's a lot of questions coming in
about your soccer team right so I'll
just Radloff a couple of them so do
these robots learn from matching
experiences we we actually talked about
that at the matching matching
experiences or other matches or other
parents yet and did you give you two
more question how do they know who the
referee is and what type of sensors are
there listening to noise what type of
sensors are they equipped with yeah
those three questions the first one so
at least let me start with the referee
because it fits more more in the story I
just told so actually I was telling that
every black box is an obstacle we cannot
drive over it so actually if there is a
black obstacle which is not
communicating back we'll actually see it
as an opponent at this point it's
actually quite an actual topic and
RoboCup I can say or at least in our
league so the referee will also be a
black box and it's definitely not
communicating via Wi-Fi at least I
didn't see referee doing that so the
robot will just think it's an opponent
and that's actually something that will
not happen hopefully in the robocup is
that the referee will go into the field
in this case we have a human referee
which will always be on the line of the
field or just behind it and from there
he will referee the game so usually we
just say well if there's a an opponent
or in this case an obstacle moving on
the side of the field we just say it's
not there so in this case that also
shows that these robots they are acting
in a very dynamic environment but the
old environment has to be specified
that's of course something different
than the general-purpose robots like
amigo and Sergio lmc the other one about
sensors so there are actually a lot of
sensors most important of course are the
cameras so the Omni vision camera on top
the Kinect camera and let me see what
other sensors do we have of course are
all the more
so from the base the drive base itself
and the ball and handling there are
motors wedding coders so we can actually
do local feedback loops and also the
position of forged kicking lever and the
position of the electromagnet we can
measure them for local feedback at this
moment we're working with those because
these are events that happen in such a
small time so when we're currently
working on doing feedback on those as
well but I think those were most of the
center or we also use a compass because
there's it's actually also another
interesting thing if you look at a
soccer field of course it's symmetric so
for these robots to know at which side
of the field they are we use a compass
to determine if they are on the north or
south side or east or west or something
to handle the symmetry of the field and
then the third question was I think the
first one you mentioned well again I
think you answered most of them so thank
you for that very good I want to try to
go to a couple of these really big
questions ethical questions that are
hard to answer because urine likes that
type of stuff so in this morning second
keynote raffaello spoke about how
feedback as from connected systems
increase the risk of unusual events
there's actually a whole series of
questions around this how do we mitigate
the risk of these unusual events where
robots actually become a dangerous thing
to the human species and how should we
handle it what's what's your thought on
that whole risk and concern have any
thoughts in that yarn not really but
there well I think for I think with it
with the security I think it's important
that you don't collect I mean too much
data in one place like you have all the
keys and and all the information for one
type of system in on one server
I think that should be you know isolated
and distributed as much as possible and
whenever you collect their data it's
kind of like enana anonym data that you
can just calculate to create new
knowledge and I think that will make
things much safer where if a robot can
go crazy I think it's important that you
have as in every other system and
reliable system to shut it down in
various ways so these these things you
have been built into other kind of
machines I think it's important to have
them here as well so very good yep yeah
I think that I mean there's to access to
this is likely hidden as impact so one
of the things Rafael is talking about is
when you change the system dynamic so
you have these two apparently stable
systems when they interact in a weird
way when you strongly linked their
feedback you can create a overall
unstable system and when you're talking
about the fat tail of events so what
that's saying is that there are
particular outlier I really unlikely
event that become a lot more likely you
can still do a lot and minimize the
impact of those really unlikely events
even when they do occur so I think part
of it is a kind of conscientiousness a
duty of care when you're designing the
behavior of these things whatever they
might be doing that if they get some
really really out there signal or really
really out there data oh you know I I
appear to be flying through the air and
I'm a ground-based robot and you know
maybe something happened and I'm flying
through the air and so what should i do
in that case and should I just shut down
because there's at least when i land i'm
just a lump of metal or should I should
I you know fire off a bunch of sensors
that are designed to make me land safely
and roll even though I was designed
designed to be ground base so i think
there's there's a lot you can do to we
do this anywhere when it's only build
resilient systems is we design
for if we get some really really out
there data really really out there
feedback to say some really strange
things happening even though you know
it's the classic comment in a finally
block that says this cannot happen right
if you're in the block that says this
cannot happen for heaven's sake do
something because it just did yeah and
and it's the same sort of thing so I
think if we design for expect the
unexpected all and do something
reasonably sane even in that case I
think you can cover an awful lot of
those cases it's just evolution its
evolution good we are coming up to to
the closing here but there may be going
through the panel one by one and
regarding the question on sort of what
can the software industry or software
people give to the robotics industry or
is it all one of the same or how do you
see software and robotics sort of
coexisting creating new pic of things
and all comments and blue end I think
it's really emerged also if I look at
our team where most of us we are
mechanical engineers so we are really
into the systems and control side on
this and I think that's of course or
like the low level of robotics the lower
levels of robotics so actuation and
stuff and there I think it's really
important also to know always the
software aspects of for example motion
control loops for you shouldn't be
making any blocking calls in the motion
control of these units that will be
really stupid and but looking at the
higher levels also there i think
software is izzy is really interesting
especially now when robots for example
are connecting to clouds to servers to
databases google's tandra flow all those
things I think it will be even more
merged at the software industry and
robotics than before right you're on
some fine yeah and and this this is
exactly i think why we're sitting here
today and and why at our conferences we
have more and more IOT robotics and
and in the mix because I think in these
years everything comes together and we
have these very capable devices that can
do a lot of things but there will be you
know regular software engineers who
knows about the back end the front end
usability stuff like that to kind of
make bigger systems out of these many
parts and so I see the next ten years
really interesting in this field where
we cook it all together in some useful
appliances and not just impressive stuff
Thanks and for those of you who are not
hear of a Greg stalk maybe for the
audience a quick recap that you were
actually the first software guy inside
Universal robotics which personally I
find amazing but what are your thoughts
on what's affecting offer the robotics
industry yeah it's a mmm it is true but
yeah I actually do see that there's
going to be this this this hybrid of
differing different competencies not
just a mechanical and electronic but
also the software engineers and of
course there's other competencies it
start to come into the picture of of
course needing the testers and the UX
designers and everything else so yeah so
yeah so Douglas Adams has a lovely quote
a lovely distinction he says anything
that's invented before you're 15 has
always been there anything that's
invented between the ages of 15 and 35
is amazing and cool anything that's
invented after your 35 is unnatural and
needs to be stopped so I'm in my I'm in
my late forties and and all this
robotics and deep learning stuff is
happening around me I'm not interesting
right people who are 15 now are
interesting because they're going to
grow up in a world where this stuff is
just normal and where you know people in
their 20s and 30s now grew up with
commodity programming languages people
20 years older than that didn't
everything was proprietary and
everything was bespoke most people in
this room are using open-source just out
of
of course just because they do so the
next generation is going to come through
with commodity hardware commodity
robotics commodity deep learning
capabilities and oh my goodness what
those guys are going to cook up is going
to be quite remarkable right I'm really
excited about that so you know for me I
need to up my game as a software guy and
and start I think the the huge shift and
it is a huge shift is as a software
person to start thinking about the
materiality of things and the
physicality of things and the physics
and you know and those kind of things
and I think generally that that's likely
to make me a better developer but I
think it is it's genuine it's a thing
you need to choose to go and invest a
bunch of time in figuring out because
this is happening and it is going to be
as profound as people are saying oh cool
so bouta back to you for the closing
comment since you started out of the day
so well these robots win over humans in
2050 for real you think that's going to
happen these robots they aren't going to
win because we were I think humans they
are quite good at soccer and that's why
I think we need something which looks
quite similar so these robots are not
going to win these turtles but I think
when we were merging all the different
leaks we have a RoboCup I'm sure they
will win and I actually have a couple of
interesting comments in here about the
fear of Skynet and I think you addressed
it I trust it also in your presentation
on how you are trying to bridge the fear
with general population right so are you
afraid of Skynet no no I think in these
robots they actually really show what
robotics can also be and I think that's
what we also hope to show people that
robotics can also be fun and can be
entertaining so so with fun and
entertaining that think that's the final
words please give the panel a hint
