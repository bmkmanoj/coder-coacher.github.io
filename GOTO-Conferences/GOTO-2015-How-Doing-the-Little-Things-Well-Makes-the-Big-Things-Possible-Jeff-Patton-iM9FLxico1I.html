I've been kicking around in the agile
community since my own 2001 for those of
you that have seen me around I've known
for coining the term story mapping or
it's not it's hard to call it an
invention because well when I came up
with it I thought it was an invention I
started spraying cards out on the floor
in a shape that told the story about the
way our product works and I thought this
was a great idea
I told other people about my great idea
and they said oh yeah we kind of do
something like that too that's when I
learned that well it's kind of a pattern
and lots of other people do it and I'm
lucky enough to give in the pattern a
name maybe inlay of short
self-introduction I've been in software
development about 20 years I am an art
school dropout if you're an art school
dropout and become a software developer
at least in my company that made me the
UI person if if you're a UI person well
basically I could design user interface
that sucked less than other developers
user interface and because I could talk
to customers and users without
embarrassing my company as much as other
developers that eventually made me a
product manager and very early on I
learned well that good UI is doesn't
mean good software just like well
formatted code doesn't mean good code
that there's a lot more to it than that
and so in the agile community I've been
a squeaky wheel or a loud voice for the
inclusion of good product practice and
user experience practice and well that's
where this practice of story mapping
comes from and I spent a lot of time
teaching people a lot of cool techniques
that helped them that be more product
centric and more user centric with their
products but I realize that it actually
doesn't work it doesn't matter and what
I keep finding out over and over is I
will teach people cool new ways to do
things and for some people it really
works well for some people they'll adopt
a practice
like story mapping or well a lot of
other things that I'll that I'll teach
and it makes a big difference but for
others they'll try it and it doesn't
make any difference at all and this
concerns me now this is a guy named Mark
I was I was working with a company in
Austin and I've been working I ran a
workshop there and nine months later I
came back and ran another workshop there
and I talked with mark and I said how
are things going have you tried this
have you tried that and what's working
and he said well all those techniques
are sort of useful but at the end of the
day they don't bother that much but he
said what really matters a lot are all
these little things that we did in the
context of well we did them during the
workshop and you kind of helped us
remember that it was all these little
things that we do every day that matter
most and when how many of you are using
agile practice today in the way you work
why if you're not why are you here
look I've been working with agile
development since since the term agile
was coined starting with an extreme
programming project in 2010 agile is
going to 2001 anybody been in AB so
longer than 5 years in the room
anybody longest 10 years or more so a
couple how many of you think agile has
gotten really really complicated yeah
please that's what I was looking for it
looked today's as always Messier and has
more rules than they did when I started
with this stuff and the it seems like
the more wheels we add to it the worse
it gets and a reminder of an old axiom
that adding more process to a broken
process doesn't fix it the rules that
matter are those simple things that
aren't there so look I'm going to start
with
mine that I know of and nine that work
for me first
well when I talk about user stories I'll
remind people that stories get their
name not from how they're supposed to be
written but how they're supposed to be
used stories the word story refers to
how we can talk with each other and well
get on the same page through discussion
but one of the things I learned very
early on that is well discussion isn't
enough and documents aren't enough it's
it's well when you and I talked and we
talked about the same feature we talked
about code we talked about our customers
we talked about UI it's easy for us to
imagine different things certainly
happens when we read the same document
but it's when we take things out of our
head when I go a little bit further than
talking when I externalize my thinking
when I make it visible that we start to
see that what I'm thinking and what
you're thinking are different but it's
not that I'm right and you're wrong it's
that we see different well we see the
puzzle in different ways it's when we
start combining and refining how we see
things
well the real solution or a real
understanding is kind of buried in the
mixture of all those things it's when we
read well it's when we leave that kind
of conversation we may still say the
same feature name we may still refer to
the same customer but we leave with this
intangible state of shared understanding
and it was a combination of words and
pictures and discussion that got us
there and in most processes up up and
tell agile development but we relied on
a lot of shared documents but shared
documents that those aren't the same
thing as shared understanding now these
days in practicing scrum I see a lot of
what is a backlog grooming session
does anybody have those in their
companies so well this is an example of
what not to do when I watch a backlog
grooming session it usually starts with
projecting something like
onto the wall and usually there's a few
people paying attention to what's going
on and most people aren't and there's
this belief that if you can use your
smartphone under the table it causes you
to go invisible and when I take pictures
of people in backlog grooming sessions
it's I have a lot of these pictures and
I'm surprised at how many have people
yawning in the pictures now when we
talked about building shared
understanding that's that's not what
we're talking about building shared
understanding it's a lot more like this
it looks a lot well it has a lot of
gesturing a lot of pointing a lot of
pictures and well a lot less projecting
of stuff onto screens it's us talking us
explaining and it's us paying attention
to see if people are getting it again
when I look back through all my pictures
of people really doing this well when I
see the residue of conversations there's
always a lot of hand drawing always a
lot of things written on whiteboards and
always when I take pictures of people
doing this stuff always a lot of
pointing and gesturing so coming all
Atlassian that I will visit in Sydney at
least once a year maybe twice a year
when I get down to Australia did people
know who Atlassian is some great
everybody does it lasts in most people
do at last we make something called Giro
and something called confluence when I
go into most agile environments I will
see stuff all over their walls but
usually what I see most agile
environments are things like fast boards
and burn down charts and the residue of
doing agile planning but when I walk
into Atlassian I don't see any of that
why would they put tickets in TAS boards
on the wall they've got JIRA but the
walls are covered with stuff and what I
see on their walls are examples of the
things that they do not put in JIRA and
well the things that later might show up
in confluence as a photograph but what's
on the walls are the res
of them working with each other trying
to get on the same page about what this
feature looks like and what it does
these guys are at a stand-up meeting now
most of the time when I see people at a
stand-up meeting there's the people in a
circle talking about what they did
yesterday what they're gonna do today
and what's what's holding them back and
well these guys are doing this a little
bit differently sprayed out on the wall
is the the journey of a feature they're
working on that they're trying to get
out what they're talking about what
they're pointing to is saying I'm
working over here and I'm having trouble
here and I should wrap up today and well
there's lots of pointing and lots of
gesturing and lots of focusing on the
product that we're trying to release or
at least the representation of it on the
wall and not a lot of focusing on JIRA
and the tickets though right sticky
notes and someone will go back to JIRA
and maybe update some things if need be
but look they're using JIRA all day to
move tickets around all day if they're
going to get together and talk they're
gonna focus on the work they're trying
to get done it's a function of keeping
your eye on the ball and not on the
players that's the way they work now the
stuff we build the the stuff we build
while we're working to get together has
a well it has the quality of a vacation
photo how many you've heard me give this
the basic thing before anybody heard
this before it's just a new story sorry
you're gonna hear it again look to make
this work I've got to tell you about one
of my vacation photos those are my
daughters they're on a we're on a beach
in Hawaii and if I were to share that
with you you might you could politely
say they're cute and that looks like fun
and I notice that I wish I would do a
little work on the color on the
photograph make it look a little bit
better but look when I see the picture I
remember this particular trip to Hawaii
and in this trip we went to the Big
Island of Hawaii if you've been to the
Big Island of Hawaii the west side of
the island is really dry and arid it
looks a lot more like Idaho than it does
anyplace tropical a lot of stuff that
looks like desert and
lots of volcanic rock and every beach we
went to was either really rocky or if
there was sand at all it was covered
with people and all my kids wanted to do
was swim in the hotel pool now I spent
way too much money to go swim in hotel
pools I found a beach on TripAdvisor and
it said it's a really fabulous not many
people there but it's a little hard to
get to what hard to get to translated to
was over an hour's drive on a four-wheel
drive trail which is a bad idea in a
rental Ford Mustang and when we got
there there's a small parking lot hardly
anybody in the parking lot I'm thinking
hey this is a this looks good we get out
of the car and I'm looking for the beach
but there's no beach there's a trail
going off into the distance the trail
isn't a nice sandy trail it's a rocky
well volcanic rock trail if you've got
kids you know how this is going
my kids are begging can we just please
go back to the hotel pool and as any
good father would I told them no we're
going ahead to the beach when we got
there it was beautiful there's hardly
anybody on the beach and well we had a
great day there are sea turtles up on
the beach lots of turtles in the water
because look there's no there's not many
people there to scare them off there's
more fish there's lots of lots of great
open beach and I'm not trying to sell
you Hawaii but the important thing is I
remember all that because I was there
and you couldn't possibly know any of
that because you weren't there when
these guys had last seen are looking
back at what they put on a wall or what
they put on a board yeah there's a bit
of information there but there's a lot
of information that you could possibly
know if they were to translate
everything that's there into a document
it would still be well pretty worthless
it's the people that are there that will
know and will understand now let me see
if I can wrap this back up here there's
a mantra used for user stories it's the
card conversation confirmation mantra
and remind people that stories get their
name from the way they're supposed to be
used and the eye
well the idea is we write a car down and
then we show up and talk to somebody who
can build the software we explain what
we're thinking of and they'll listen and
if they were just listening they might
form a different picture in their head
but it's a conversation and they can ask
questions and because it's a
conversation with words and pictures
because it's a conversation focused on
solving people's problems and building
shared understanding but we bring into
it things like you are prototypes and
use cases and workflow models and
whatever else we want to bring story
doesn't mean you're not bringing
anything else in it means well we're
working differently at the end of that
conversation we arrive at a solution we
arrive at this state of shared
understanding now when things go
horribly wrong in agile development it's
well it's often because look even if we
did it right we actually talked together
we got on the same page and we produced
a document or I don't think back to
those even if something good came out of
that backlog grooming session and we got
on the same page well we well the way
it's supposed to work is if we've got to
hand something off to someone we hand it
off with a conversation but sadly the
way it often works is we drop all that
stuff into a ticket in JIRA and hand it
off and the person goes back to reading
kind of a crappy document or looking at
your vacation photos and it's not
surprising they come up with something
different effective collaboration is
there to build shared understanding and
the best documents helped us recall that
conversation now that'll be one of the
longer points I make here but it's not
enough to just communicate with
documents it's not enough to just show
up and talk it's important to make your
ideas visible get them out there let
people see them it's a small thing but
done a lot makes a big difference now
thing number two here is a lot of people
think collaboration has a lot to do with
talking and what I've learned over time
is that that's dead wrong that in fact
it's talking that gets in the way of us
getting on the same page
these people are working together
building a sticky note model there
they're building one of these storymap
things they're looking at it they're
moving things around and oddly when I
watch people work doing this the do this
well they kind of let the picture do the
talking
and they'll indicate one thing is more
important than another by moving it
above something else they'll indicate
something happens after something else
by moving it to the right there's
there's a lot less discussion in fact
it's discussion that kind of gets in the
way if you're using things on the wall
it looks stop talking let your pictures
do the work and if they well if they
don't then keep drawing organize your
simple models to communicate ideas and
look well I didn't mention this but a
lot of you use agile practices that have
sort of a brainstorming phase where well
we think of all the things that went
well this sprint or it's instead of
brainstorming out loud
brainstorm brainstorm quietly write down
all of your ideas and then share all
those ideas back which leads me to the
next thing let me see if I can explain
what I mean by Flair it is not that
anybody seen office space before look
this is a this is an example of I'm not
going to explain the Stanford d.school
Design Thinking model but what I'm going
to explain about the model is there are
lots of times when we're doing design
thinking practice where we're not
satisfied with just one idea we want to
come up with lots of ideas and then we
want to narrow down from those ideas how
about a flair and a focus and this is a
quick illustration from from the book
game storming that's a good pretty good
book on collaboration it'll talk a lot
about visualizing things but hey flowing
there means coming up with a lot of
ideas before we move on to something
else
common practice that I'll teach and work
with people on is something called a
design studio this is the aftermath of
one this is where we've
a lot of things are on the wall and
talked about them and annotated what's
best the way this works is we make sure
that we're on the same page about the
problems we're solving and then we'll
give everybody a little bit of time to
sketch their ideas independently and
we'll take anywhere from five minutes to
as much as thirty minutes and then we'll
come back together and point and gesture
and use words and pictures and share our
ideas with each other and well this is
fun but better than that it's we get a
lot of ideas out there so that when we
do start solving problems we're solving
problems with a lot of people's ideas I
was talking about well the guy in the
first part of this talk well mark of
their company they use any time they get
into a situation where the the well
where people start to argue they develop
the habit of reaching for a timer and
saying okay let's take five minutes
they'll set a timer for five minutes
everybody backs up everybody takes five
minutes to get their ideas out on paper
and then they take a minute and
everybody shares their ideas back and
what they quickly realize is best
solutions are a combination of all of
their solutions I've seen architects do
this instead of well most architectural
discussions I've observed usually
involve a bunch of smart guys going to a
room and everybody arguing until they
get their way and that takes a long time
but well this flaring first thing and
then focusing kind of helps deliberately
wide near-field of choices before making
a decision
when arguing stop take a few minutes get
your ideas out combine them with
everybody else's ideas and well that
next step is to focus a focus and me
focusing means we have to choose from
all those ideas but I found some old
pictures of me at meetings and one of
the things we'll do going into any
workshop is look time box it I don't
want to be in a room with people longer
than 60 minutes 90 minutes at the most
and I want to make sure that we've got
we've got goals and when I look back at
pictures that we've got on the wall well
we can get off target wow it's hard to
see with this projection but there's a
big P there that's a parking lot these
days I hate to call them parking lot but
well when we get off topic we'll move it
to the wall and sometimes instead of
parking lot will put feature ideas to
discuss later or problems we've got to
put into the next workshop and on the
table are well this odd thing well one
of the tricks we used to use to stay on
topic were these little signs and one
side would say tangent when we're off
topic that was a signal to say that
we're talking we're not talking about
what we came in to talk about and sold
is what will hold up a sign that says
when when people are well belaboring a
point going on and on about something
and yeah we get it let's move on and we
started with those signs and well one
day we couldn't find the signs and we
sent somebody out and said can you make
some signs and they all they could find
we're styrofoam cups they put them on
the cups and these had a nice effect
because they're easy to find on the
table and then over time we came up with
things like sold and tangent in too much
detail and that question mark and on
interesting details and well it's during
these kinds of meetings will use these
things to keep pace to keep momentum to
stay focused on what we're here to do
and then save putting it into Giro or
putting into some system for later I
found that picture because there were
some signs on the table there and one of
those signs said dork and it's likely me
that had that card played on them look
when you're working together focused to
pay attention to what you came together
for and keep checking in on those
outcomes and looked time out time things
out when when things drift not in a
slide but look when I work with when I
work with people that are new to agile
development they'll say geez I hate
because of all the meetings and when I
talk to people that have been working
with agile development for a while and
it's working for them they will say I
love it because of all the collaboration
so meetings are what we call crap
collaboration if your collaboration is
working well you may stop calling it
meetings now the other thing that makes
this thing work is I mentioned earlier
time box don't show up and spend a huge
amount of time talking and talk till
it's done set a short time box and well
people hear heard of something called
the Pomodoro Technique before and yeah
that's well the technique is named after
a tomato shaped kitchen timer came from
people in Italy and who would have ever
thought that people in Italy have a hard
time staying focused but they do the
idea is that if I've got a goal set a
short time box and look if I have
something that I think I can be done
within an hour I don't set an hour time
box I said a 20 minute time box at the
end of 20 minutes I need to stop step
back look at how far along we are and
ask are we making progress it's good
it's a good time to take a head break
and then ask how many more of these time
boxes are going to take and a mantra
that I like to use is to time box and
satisfice at the end of the time box
stop reflect and ask is this good enough
for now if you haven't heard that word
satisfies before but it's a blend of
satisfactory and sufficient it's sort of
an old words not a not a new one not a
made-up one but really it means good
enough for now
when we're doing collaborative work and
we want to work until it's not until
it's perfect but until it's good enough
now when we're working together
another problem is just too many people
everybody wanting to be involved use
less people the ideal conversation is
dinner conversation sized now if you go
out to I went to lunch today with a
friend met him here
we ate and we held a single conversation
all during lunch if you had a third
person it's pretty easy to hold a single
conversation if you had a fourth person
every once in a while it might break up
into two conversations but when you add
a fifth or a sixth it gets harder and
harder to hold a single conversation if
we can focus our conversations on small
well when you're pulling people together
hold small groups of people together I
find that if you've got two to four
people oh we can all we need is a goal
and a time box but if we've got a bigger
group of people now we need somebody to
kind of direct traffic we need some
facilitation structure sometimes how
many of you have heard of something
called planning poker before and yeah if
you're agile practitioners you know
about that and well what makes planning
poker work is the fact that it leverages
a simple facilitation structure gives us
a way to have more people working
together
if you've ever done planning poker
notice it also leverages that shutting
up thing if we all agree with each other
we don't talk about it and we use the
tool to avoid unnecessary conversation
if we've got lots of people well the
best way to tackle that is to divide and
conquer
break into small groups and merge our
results back together one thing I
remember I we used to do in agile
development in the old days is well
during an iteration planning or sprint
planning as we call it today we really
did stop and talk about all the stories
in detail and go into enough detail that
we really understood them and broke them
down into tasks and estimating that
estimated them now if I told you at the
beginning of an iteration you were going
to do that with every single story but
for a lot of you today that would sound
like it would sound completely miserable
but it wasn't for us because well we
broke into a lot of small groups we we
said okay for the next 60 minutes we're
going to work on estimating these
stories and really planning we're going
to break into small groups of three or
four we'll talk about the details we may
shift a little bit if you get bored
talking about this story move to another
one and in the end we'll stop and see
how we're doing and come back together
and share with each other where we came
up with on every one of these stories it
felt a lot less like a meeting and a lot
more like a workshop if you want to make
decisions fast work in smaller groups if
you've got a crowd to manage let them
break up into smaller groups and share
the share of the work now I've been
talking a lot about a lot of simple
collaboration things that help things go
better and I'm bridging off of what my
friends market told me that it's all
these little things that made a
difference for us all your big practices
were interesting but it's these little
things we use every day that matter now
I'm going to shift to something look
when I ask product teams when I ask
product managers when I asked people
they're doing well what is the single
biggest thing you'd recommend to teams
to start to do well it is an any agile
practice I've heard of in fact it's one
I don't hear about very much and that's
it's one I hear in the lean startup
community a bit but it's the get out of
the building practice now imagine for a
minute that you are Jane Goodall now
that if people do people know who Jane
Goodall is you still with me
it's afternoon I'm tired look Jane
Goodall studies primates and she goes
out into the field she spends a lot of
time in Africa she gathers a lot of data
brings it back and makes sense of it now
when I started with extreme programming
in 2000 there was this practice called
customer on site and the idea was that
we'd well bring somebody on site that
really deeply understood the domain or
somebody that actually was our customer
and I could imagine if an agile person
were to talk to Jane Goodall and notice
that this was horribly inefficient what
she was doing and we've got a practice
called chimpanzee on-site that will
clear all this up instead of you wasting
all that time going out in the field
really understanding chimpanzees we will
bring a chimp to you and when you've got
a question just turn to the chimpanzee
and ask them look
don't do that that's not helping a lot
of what we're doing when things really
start to go well I find that just
showing up just being where people are
makes a big difference when I go to when
I go through my photostream over the
years I see lots and lots of pictures
that look horribly boring there are lots
of vacation photos that I remember a lot
of detail about but because I was there
but there are pictures of people at work
you know this is a guy at a bank in
Wilmington and we weren't quite getting
what he was talking about the way he did
things every day so we arranged to meet
him first thing in the morning when he
did his work and watched him do it
has any these guys are just CVS Pharmacy
and is anybody's ever seen at a CVS
Pharmacy there are those pictures those
Kodak kiosks where you can bring a
camera in or put a USB stick in it and
print out a picture now the tall guy on
the right is the product manager for
that kiosk and he has been for years he
knows a lot about his product he's
watched a lot of usability testing he's
done a lot of formal interviews with his
users but you know he manages backlogs
there's a huge amount of requirements or
needs for change in the product but in
working with him first thing we did was
drag him out of the office to actually
watch people use is kiosk the guy on the
left is a user experience person a
researcher the guy standing back behind
is a the lead engineer on this team and
the really short person with white hair
does not work on their team she's been
trying to print a photograph for the
last hour and they've been watching her
and they spent the afternoon watching
lots of people do this and well at the
end of the day the the guy on the right
came back and saying this has been the
worst day of my life I've never realized
how much pain I've been inflicting on
people and but he said this has also
been the best day of my this has been a
great day because now I know how easy it
is to actually go and see this and it
makes a big difference
I will promise you you will not
prioritize the backlog the same way if
you've looked your customers in the eye
and it was a lesson learned for me long
before agile I've got lots of pictures
of talking with people as they use an
application that they're working with
and they they're pretty animated about
the way they do things that lady manages
this dress shop in Nordstrom or that
this high-end dress place in Nordstrom I
built a lot of software for
brick-and-mortar retailers and I've got
lots of pictures of these guys hard at
work this guy is a stock portfolio
manager for the company we're working
with in San Francisco I showed up and we
were hard at work building lots of well
the team was hard at work building lots
of stuff for these guys and I said can
we just can we talk to these guys we'd
better need we need really need to
understand how they're working if this
is gonna be valuable to them when we're
done I want to figure out what a day in
their life is like this back I'm not
really getting it from this backlog can
we talk to them and they said well
they're really busy people they get up
they get to the office really early in
the morning and well we can arrange a
time for you to talk to them but it may
be next week maybe the week after I said
uh well where do they work and I said
well they're down on the third floor but
you can't go there again because they're
so busy can we just go down and see what
their work environment looks like and
they said no you definitely can't do
that and well we just want to get a
couple pictures so to help us remember
it
they said you definitely cannot do that
because there's a lot of legal
ramifications about that and so don't do
that
and we said okay we waited until they
left went over the elevator hit the
third floor we went down and sure enough
there's a lot of security we can't get
through we're kind of looking outside
the window somebody comes up and said
are you trying to get in and he said
yeah and they said well come on in so we
went we walked in we stood behind and
kind of watched and well this was one of
the first guys to turn around and look
at us and say what are you guys doing
here well we're working on the new
portfolio management system and we just
need wanted to see how you guys work
and he said welcome here sit down and
let me let me show you how this goes and
he set and other people came over and we
set with a bunch of other people and
after a couple hours we really got a
feel for the way they work and what
their problems were and in the end this
guy says well this is great nobody ever
comes down here to visit us and well it
makes a difference when we talk when we
explain things back to stakeholders and
others and oddly that a lot of the
stakeholders and others haven't been
down there they'll watch them either
well well we sound smarter and actually
we sound like the ones who actually care
about the way these guys work now if I
go through my slide deck I've got lots
of these and one last one and let me
plow through here hey when do I end is
it 50 I'll I'm in good shape
I'm never early I'm gonna drag this out
then look this was Kodak again they
asked Kodak is still a company they're
still trying to make a profit there a
lot of they're trying to work on a lot
of new products and they asked me to go
to India to work with their teams in
India and I thought oh this is terrible
I cannot tell them they need to be
talking with our customers and they're
gonna send me to work without with an
outsourced development team their
customers aren't here but happily they
were fairly smart their customers were
in India the guy on the right is a
product manager the guy on the Left
designs portable printers and the guy in
the middle uses portable printers these
guys are well this is the is it the Taj
India a hotel or people know that hotel
yeah and Mumbai that's correct yeah
that's the one where the the terrorist
junk was a long time ago and out in the
water out there is a big monument and
there are lots of these guys that take
photographs of families and for 30
rupees you can get a photograph of your
family and he's got to take the picture
and print it right there for you and
this is what these guys do all day long
we go there watch these guys work talk
to them and well these guys from Kodak
are heroes because as
might expect nobody comes down to visit
them and nobody is there thrilled that
people are interested in them in the end
these guys make friends there are a lot
of people that want to help that want to
say something about the the software now
that's one last point here and one
comment that sticks in my head this is a
teague he works for a company called
edmunds.com
so anybody ever used Edmonds comm to buy
anything or look up higher information
before look at ich is in charge of the
analytics group at Edmonds comm he is
good at polling analytics from their
site and knowing exactly what people do
Edmonds had been doing that for years
there's pictures fairly old now four or
five years old but when walking in to
work with them the first thing we did
was put a big workshop together first
thing we did was schedule a whole bunch
of people that actually had used their
site to help them buy cars and well we
asked the people at Edmonds to talk to
them because they hadn't done that in a
long time so that's that's their team
and that's at each team and the lady in
front does not work on their team
she bought a car recently at the end of
this day I remember what a TKE said he
said look you know I'm the analytics guy
it's up until now that I've been
confident I can tell you precisely what
people do on our site but it's not until
today that I never realized I could tell
you why and they've been swimming in
data and knowing a lot of what's but
never really why people did what they
did and he just couldn't feel it until
they started talking to people the best
solutions come from passionate motivated
people empathy is the most powerful
motivator that I know and frankly when I
look back at that whole story thing
that's what we were meant to get when we
tell stories and I've been telling you
stories about those pictures it's the
stories that we remember it's putting
those features into context and there
was no idea of that story thing is if we
could actually talk to people that had
these problems we'd get more than the
requirements
we get empathy and the biggest reason I
see that people don't do this or don't
do a lot of other stuff is because well
like the story I was telling about the
about building a stock portfolio
management system it's because we were
told not to we were told it was against
the rules we were told that you should
be writing code or you should be doing
analysis work or other things like that
and the only only eight step I'm gonna
give you here is to just just do it act
find online an online TED talk from this
guy Tom Chee Tom Tom she runs user
experience at the Google X Division of
Google the the people that do
self-driving cars and Google glass and
other things like that the talks you'll
find from him we'll talk about them
aggressively experimenting doing a lot
of things to help them learn as fast as
they possibly can and they'll make a
point that look planning and things like
that are overrated
that and well thinking is overrated that
doing is the best kind of thinking at
the end of the day the process for me
that Trump's agile is this one this is
short for just do it
and when people well don't want to do
the right thing because it's not part of
the process or isn't written down or
don't want to talk to in court stories
to talk about stories I'll encourage
them to act and the teams that I see
that are succeeding are pretty good at
that acting thing now this is it look I
remember when I started with extreme
programming in 2000 and I had a scrum
coach the the guys the guy's name was
Rob me has anybody heard of a company
called pivotal labs before yes No yeah a
lot of people heard of pivotal labs
okay so Rob me after this company went
on to found pivotal labs but Rob me was
my coach he was a scary guy to sit with
and really a white-hot developer he knew
what he was doing and when I paired with
Rob I was gonna learn something whether
I wanted to or not but at five o'clock
Rob would roll around and tell people
stop it stop working either stop either
get out of the office or play half-life
with the rest of us that's it was that
long ago that if you're doing this and
working hard it's hard work I remember
when sprint in scrum I've heard a lot of
a scrum people say that look you can't
sprint all the time it's a long-distance
thing I remember when we were doing
these things we would sprint and we'd
take a day and not do anything
those would let those planning meetings
and discussions and review take a whole
day and we get a chance to relax get a
chance to shut down because if you are
going to sprint if you are going to work
hard you need to well you need to relax
hard too and the teams that I see
performing well know how to take five
look you're doing right doing this thing
right this stuff is exhausting get out
take time and then get back in there
now the points I wanted to make that you
know the whole talk was kind of founded
by talking with a guy that I started
with and me getting kind of lost
believing my own crap about all the
practices that I teach and him reminding
me that how those practices are good but
it's the basics getting back to the
basics that made the biggest difference
for us and when I think back to when
things were really working for me
agile in 2001 to 2005 Wow it wasn't
nearly as complicated as agile
development is today it was fairly
simple but what made it what made it
work we're doing a little bit better job
at all these simple things and with that
I'm going to call it did I we have time
for any questions we have six minutes
according to I know oh did I leave you
anything you could ask questions about
so please yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
