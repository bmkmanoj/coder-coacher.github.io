professor at Delft University of
Technology where I research spreadsheets
many of you might be thinking why are
you talking about spreadsheets at a
Developers Conference but spreadsheets
are often mislabeled people think of
spreadsheets as being data whereas
spreadsheets actually are code
spreadsheets are code if you fall asleep
now in your after lunch tip that is fine
with me as long as you get the main
message of this talk which is
spreadsheets are code that's really the
only thing that's very important to
remember I go all around the world with
this talk to spread the gospel of my
life that's right it's our guts so you
might not immediately believe me and I
have three reasons for you why
spreadsheets actually should be
considered pieces of programming and the
first reason is they're used for very
similar problems as you can see here
this is an investment calculation you
put in some parameters and you get a
results well that's something you could
have also built in Java or JavaScript or
Objective C if you want to make an app
it's not really specific a specialized
domain for a programming language you
might as well do it in a spreadsheet and
of course you could ask why why do
people do this in a spreadsheet and I
have asked people in many companies I
worked with why are you doing it in
espresso why aren't you using a real
programming language or a real program
so it turns out this might come as a
surprise to you turns out that software
developers are actually pretty bad at
making software so people that make
these kind of spreadsheets they have
trying to obtain good software either in
their own IT department within the
company or they go to their favorite IT
provider and they say hey I have this
investment model could you program it
for me into software sure says the IT
department there will be six months and
five million dollars and then if it were
true it wouldn't even be that bad but
usually than it is twelve months and
twenty million dollars and it has half
the features they want so people start
perceiving themselves as actually pretty
good programmers compared to what they
can get from the IT department so it
sort of makes sense from that
perspective okay so that's the first
reason I go to great lengths to make my
points to such great lengths in fact
that I have implemented a Turing machine
in spreadsheet formulas only to prove
that spreadsheet formulas are Turing
complete so you cannot now anymore say
hey this is not a real programming
language because look at this it is a
real programming language like all the
others exactly as powerful as any other
programming language out there and many
people very much like this Turing
machine and somewhat viral on the
internet when it appeared on
boeing-boeing it brought my website down
even for a little bit because so many
people were visiting it so that was a
hit at least in some obscure areas of
the internet so the second reason why
you should consider spreadsheets as
programming is that they suffer from
typical software engineering problems
for example only one entry spreadsheets
has a manual spreadsheets are used by an
average of twelve different people over
their lifespan that averages five years
so it really sounds like the problems we
have in programming or maybe the
programs the problems we had in
programming in the 60s and the 70s and
80s when people started to realize that
the COBOL script they once build was now
still 10 years later in use so typical
software engineering problems we see
them in spreadsheets as well so in
summary the activities the complexity
and the problems of spreadsheets are
very very similar to the problems we
have in source code spreadsheets are
code again this is important but I'm
going to go further than that
spreadsheets are not just a programming
language they are the next programming
language that
you should learn existence to
spreadsheets is futile and since you are
already here I'm going to just assume
that you want to learn to program a
spreadsheet again I have three reasons
for that first of all who knows who made
this picture from what talk it is does
anyone know yes it's it's from Brad
Victor's talk inventing on principle and
if you haven't seen it it's really
really cool
but what Brad shows you here is a
concept called live programming where on
the one hand side you have the
programming the source code and on the
other hand you have the instantiation of
that code and if you change something
here like a color immediately it will
update on the running code so there's no
added compile cycle very cool Brad we
had that since VisiCalc
spreadsheets are the first life
programming because you just change your
formula and you immediately get the
results you don't have to go to another
screen you don't have to wait for
compilation secondly spreadsheets are
purely functional somehow Haskell is is
back in fashion and everyone suddenly
likes functional programming but you
know what's also functional programming
excel it's pure functional programming
if you look at a formula in a
spreadsheet the only thing a formula can
do is get data from other cells and give
a value it's impossible for a
spreadsheet formula to create a side
effect to to make a change to a
different sound that's impossible so
it's a pure functional system who knew
thirdly why you should absolutely learn
spreadsheet programming is everyone
knows it but us really spreadsheets are
the most popular programming language in
the history of everything everyone knows
it's like your next-door neighbor is
managing his fantasy football team in a
spreadsheet your accountant is probably
doing your taxes in a stretchy everyone
knows this except us developers we say
it's real programming everyone so it's
time to change that and surprise
surprise
this session is going to help you learn
some spreadsheet programming so to
convince you how cool Excel is I'm going
to implement selection sort in a
spreadsheet to show you how you can
properly program who knows how selection
sort works okay not everyone let me
explain it
the idea of selection sort is that you
sort a list of numbers or you could sort
anything but we're sorting numbers this
time by taking oh this will be tricky
with only one hand
can I get an S oh you can be my
assistant Eric that's fine as well you
can be my assistants so you can hold
this for a minute no you go right this
is more fun than normal yes you can just
stay here you're holding the first item
in the list so you're this is the first
item in the list and the way we're going
to sort the list is we look at the first
item and we search for the minimum in
the list we take the minimum and then
it's your queue and then we swap the
minimum so we swap the minimum yes so
I'm the minimum you're the first element
we swap them yeah it's perfect so we
swap them and then we go to the next
element so every time we take the first
element thank you do you want to try it
should it be working hello is this
working yes okay yes okay I'll finish it
with one earring then selection sort
we're going to sort a list of numbers by
repeatedly swapping the minimum and the
first value so here I've just put the
index I've just put all the numbers
there because it will be easier for us
to know the index of every number in our
array so the first thing we need for
selection sort is the minimum of the
list
and luckily Excel has a built-in
function for that we take the minimum of
this range and what we can do here here
is the first trick that probably you
already didn't know instead of using the
range we can also just use the entire
row
so some people have seen it this four
columns so you do a : B and then you
have to call it but you can also do it
four routes and this is not that
important now but all the way at the end
of the implementation we are going to
need this trick and this is why I show
it to you now so we use the minimum and
what we need then is the index of the
minimum we need to know where is the
index of this minimum because we have to
find it in order to be able to swap it
and Excel has a nice function for that
called match which is going to look for
that value in this range there we go so
the value 1 is on the position 10 and
that's correct here we have 1 it's on
position then so step by step we're
going to go through the algorithm so
let's first look at when are we going to
swap and initially I'm just going to
mark the swap spots with an X and the
other ones with an underscore in order
for you to be more easily able to follow
me so if the index is equal to the index
of the minimum then we have to swap and
otherwise for now we're going to use an
underscore so we can take the formula ah
we didn't get an X on the position of
the minimum does anyone know what went
wrong here what did I forget
dollar signs yes if you drag a formula
in Excel if you drag it to the left all
the references will be automatically
updated so if we select this cell you
see that it's now taking this minimum
but also looking at the cell before it
instead of looking at this one so what
we can do to prevent that is we can put
in a dollar sign right here and then
this column will be fixed so if you drag
the formula it will not be updated and
then fuse that we get a nice little X
right over there so this is a spot we
know now that we're going to swap and
I'm going to also introduce a dollar
there because later on we're going to
drag it's all down and we want to keep
pointing at the intro so let me just put
that dollar there
don't need another quest for them okay
so we need to reverse now as well we
have the location of the minimum but we
also need the location of where are we
going to swap so initially we're going
to swap with the first value if you
remember my sweet assistant with holding
the first index that's here so now we
need to reverse operation of the match
because we have the location but we want
to know the value at that location and
there's a function in Excel for that as
well called index that gives you from
this range this range the value of this
column and that this role I'm sorry in
that column so it's going to look what
is on the first place we get 13 so we
have both components now we know the
value of the first item and the location
that's the first and the value of the
minimum and the location of the minimum
so let's first now look at this
underscore because it's easier when at
what places do we not have to swap well
that's pretty easy we're going to swap
if the index is equal to the index of
the minimum or if the index is equal to
the index of the swap and in all other
cases we're not doing anything there we
go
we have to swap locations now so we're
getting close we have no numbers yet but
at least we know that the structure of
our conditions make sense because we
have marked the spots with X's so let's
fill in this part first what value do we
get if we're not swapping any takers yes
the value from the previous row that's
pretty easy so we can just point up and
drag it down and you see for all of the
values where we're not swapping we're
just taking the previous rock and then
we still have two x's that we need to
fill out so I'm going to add some
conditional formatting here just for to
make it a bit easier for you to see
what's going on so I select the swap
make the swap value green and minimum
value yellow so it's just easier to see
what's going on
so what are we going to place here if
our value is equal to the index swap
value what do we need here in place of
this X the minimum correct there we go
if we're equal to the swap value we take
the minimum and in the other situation
if we're equal to the minimum we take
the swap value
selection sort
let's take it and drag it down hmm
the coloring already shows you that
something strange is happening so what
did I forget here what went wrong yes
yes very well so you see in the minimum
I keep taking one because I take the
minimum of just this range
well excels got you covered no worries
because there's something that's called
the offset function that moves a range
over the grid so I can take this range
and I can say in the first situation I'm
going to offset it with zero so this
minus one and then I all set it one with
two and with three before and then I
always get the minimum of the part of
the array that is not sorted yet so if
we do that Tata
isn't that nice selection sort but it's
not very readable yet so I got you
covered let's make it a little bit nicer
a little bit easier on the eyes because
I'm not going to convince a crowd of
developers with cell references though
let's make it nice however in order for
us to make it nicer we have to go really
into the scary depths of what is
possible in XML so you have to go a
little bit scarier but we will we will
come out nicely in yet so a question and
this question is nicely related to the
topic of go to comb because it the topic
is space and this crazy formula I have
here has a space in it and you could
also say if I explain this syntax to you
you can definitely say that we are
boldly going where no one has gone
before
haha it's inner space no outer space
awesome sir
so does anyone know what this funky
syntax means okay that's no problem I
didn't know it initially if I selected
maybe you get a little hint of where
we're going no so what this means is two
ranges the intersection of the two
ranges why - why is space why
just intersects and then the two ranges
in many other places in the language
spaces can be ignored so you can have a
function name and then you can put
spaces in between in the arguments it's
all fine so in many places it's
whitespace independent except for this
how do you know that Felina well I wrote
a grammar for the Excel formulas this is
how I found out that was quite hard
because of this funky things but it's
there and we can use it in a pretty nice
way to make our selection sort a little
bit nicer because what we can do is if
we make this range into an engine so we
just give this this bunch of cells we
give it a name so they are now called
index and what we can do then if we're
in a specific cell instead of pointing
directly at that e to we can say we want
to have the intersection of in of the
index range and the column we are in now
so instead of directly point to get e to
we say we won't have the intersection
between the column we are in and the
named range of index which is pretty
nice because that means you can combine
things and this e here is optional
because it's already in the range we are
in so if we remove it it will still work
so we can say from here index means
indexed at the position that we are and
we don't have to name it if we repeat
this trick because we name this index
min and min and index swap and swap we
can turn this into this
isn't that nice it's it's almost self
documenting if the index is indexed min
we swap and if the index is index what
it's the minimum yeah just like one
thing that III we have to get rid of it
but we can use the same trick because it
will be in the same row all the time
because if we're dragging down we
continuously needs the one row before us
so we want to get rid of that ugly III
and we need
even more spreadsheet magic to make that
happen there Whitney
we're going to go a little bit deeper
into the concept of names ranges like
the ones the index and the men and the
main swap were used you can do some
pretty nifty tricks using name ranges if
you know what you're doing so here I'm
going to make a names range for this
cell and like we did before
however instead of having it point to a
specific cell address we may also put in
something like a constant so we can be
fine all you need is love and then we
can use that named range
all you need is love and if you use it
it looks like this love is all you need
isn't that nice it's so nice it's poetry
in a formula we can go a bit further
than that there are other songs that I
happen to like that we can also express
using funky name ranges for example
Paolo Nutini has a wonderful song that
contains this lyric however much I love
you you will always love me more let's
model that it's a work of art so we
start with a low of constant let's say
15 is how much I love you so we just put
in a constant like we did with the
string before we can make a second
constant your love that depends on my
love so I put a formula in and that
formula uses another nametrain it's
really it's like programming so your
love is 1.3 times my love there we go
Tata so you have a named range it looks
like your name trains like a name but it
has a formula inside of it that depends
on another name right little bit more
magic one more layer of magic and then
I'm done I promise let's look at this
song by famous Dutch DJ Armin from Buda
it's called everyday I love you more so
this is a bit more elaborate than the
previous song because that was just one
indirection
you'll love I love you love more but now
it needs to get more every day so we
need a little bit more magic let's again
say
our love starts at 15 and what we can
use is a roll function and a row
function you can put in and cell address
so you can say the row of B 4 is 4 but
if you use it without an argument you
get the current roll
so the row we are in now and we can use
that to make a dependency to the cell
above it because we can say yesterday's
love is the address so we're going to
make a cell reference to the row above
us and the same column so now we have
the cell above the cell above us a c4
however what we have now is a string so
it's not yet the cell address and what
Excel has a function called indirect
which is a little bit like evil in
JavaScript where you can put in a string
and you get the result of whatever that
is that is what this is till you put in
a string and then you get the reference
of what is on that cell so intuitively
it feels like just stripping off the
quotes and you get a cell reference so
these two things are equivalent we can
use that because we now have the address
of the cell above us to turn it into a
reference there we go
yesterday's love is the indirect off the
cell above us in the same cool da the
value in the cell above us will always
work but of course we're not done yet
because now our love stays constant
every day that's a bit sad it needs to
go up otherwise it doesn't specify the
lyric requirements so we just add the
van Buuren factor of one point zero zero
four I don't know how much he loves
everyone more every day so if you put
that in we drag it down we have a
formula in the named range that depends
on the cell above it so all these cells
the interface doesn't really show it
clearly but all these cells contain
exactly this formula however everywhere
we call it it is different that's magic
right
so we can use that to for us to make our
selections so more beautiful because I
didn't come here to talk about love I
come here to talk about selection sort
so that III it can go now with the new
techniques that we just learnt because
what we can do is we can make a
reference to the previous row so the row
and this is remember in the beginning I
told you these funky syntax where you
can use one row at one time that's what
I use here so I make a reference to the
entire row above me by saying row above
me and then a colon and then again the
row above me so I can change that now
and then if I use that it will always
point to the row above me if I drag it
down and we're always pointing to the
row above me so all these cells can have
the exact same formula because it will
point to the row above me isn't that
nice if we reads like an orphan if the
index is equal to the index minimum then
swap and if the index is equal to the
index swap then minimum otherwise the
previous row I think it's a work of art
just for comparison I also made
selection sort in Python it looks like
this I don't know what I think is more
elegance okay I do know what I think is
more elegant look at that it's just one
line and it's consistent everywhere and
as as a free bonus which sort of sounds
like a joke but it's actually pretty a
pretty deep inside if you get all the
data here so you can look at the data
and programming at the same time whereas
if you were in Python it's quite hard to
see
once you're you are running it on you
would need text you tests in sort of an
alternative interface you would have
your data whereas here especially for
prototyping you can immediately see what
is going on if you use the conditional
formatting it is even easier so it's a
really nice way if you know what you're
doing to specify algorithms because you
will have that live programming aspect
that Brad Victor talks about you
immediately get your feedback in view
without lots of
vine compilation' cycles and without a
big cognitive distance between what
you're doing and how you're thinking
about it so you might think yes but you
spend hours and hours and hours thinking
about the most beautiful example to do
programming in Excel that is true I am
minutes high a minute that is very much
true however once you're in this mindset
actually Excel becomes a really nice
tool to think about these type of
problems so this is me love September
and then we can get away with friends
where we were participating in a
programming competition but we had to
solve some of the Euler puzzles which
are mathematical quizzes that you can
solve with programming so we did some of
the puzzles and for example this is post
called triangle in Excel and it is it's
really very easy to quickly generate
Pascal's triangle and for it for one of
the Euler puzzles we needed to have the
search and search number so you make it
you start with one this column stays the
same and all the others are just adding
the two adjacent cells and you drag it
down and you have postcodes triangle and
if you look at other solutions for
example this is how it looks like in c
and this is how it looks like in F sharp
it's really quite concise and elegant to
do it in a spreadsheet you just need the
two formulas you don't need to think
about what data structure
am I going to represent a triangle in
how will it look like because your
interface and your data structure are
right there and that's a decision you
don't have to make anymore and here's
another example where we did dynamic
programming in a spreadsheet where you
have on the one hand on sheet 1 you have
your input data I don't see - it gets
very easy to just calculate the maximum
of whatever you can obtain in this path
plus the value that we're going to get
in this in the cell that we're in and
again for comparison this is how it
looks in C and this is how it looks in
Haskell
whereas in Excel you just need to one
formula so yes it took me
very long time to craft a few examples
but once you know how to do it it's
actually a very very good tool and the
friend I was programming with that first
proposed we should do everything in
Haskell even okay this took a few hours
but at one point admitted that some
things were actually very easy to do in
a spreadsheet so you might think why why
why are you doing all these things
that's a fair question and now we're
going on to what is actually my real job
because this is all like my hobby
because the idea of the research that
I'm doing at Delft University of
Technology is answering this question if
spreadsheets are programming and I'm
sure all of your convinced a logical
question to ask is could we then use
methods from software engineering and
apply them on the domain of spreadsheets
would it make sense to think about
stretches in that way and I actually
wrote a PhD dissertation on this topic
on transforming methods from
self-renewing to spreadsheets and the
quick summary is yes we can we can very
easily use methods that we know that
work and so for engineering and use them
on spreadsheets instead so I'm going to
give two examples of tools we built to
help people to improve their spreadsheet
so one of the things we build is called
Bumblebee and it's a refactoring tool
for spreadsheet and make sense if it's
source code you need an IDE right so
what it does is it's a plugin into Excel
here you see it and if you select a
formula that is smelly that is a little
bit that is not well chosen for example
this one the sum of a range divided by
the count of a certain range maybe
someone would know how to more easily do
that average yes but and so maybe this
person wasn't aware of the average
function for average maybe that's not
very an assumption you can make but
there are lots of complicated formulas
that people might just not know about or
an intuitive situation is that it just
started with a son and then someone said
oh you need to divide it by account and
it evolved over
without people realizing that they could
also use building formulas though our
plugin can detect that highlight these
smelly cells and then even suggest you
rewrites so we can say hey you could
apply the sum and count to average
refactoring and you get a nice little
preview of how your formula would look
like and if you like that you could say
okay well applying for me and then it
automatically refactor your formula and
these transformations are entirely
programmable with a little language that
looks like spreadsheet formulas so we
have a number of building refactorings
but you could also define your own
refactorings so here for example here
you have the refactoring I just showed
you this term of something divided by
the count of something you can rewrite
that to the average of something and we
think that more powerful end users that
also write VB code could be able to
write this type of transformations and
then you also can go beyond the realm of
refactoring it doesn't necessarily have
to be behavior preserving anymore you
could also write transformation rules
that for instance implement new business
rules so you used to calculate a loan
based on income and now you want to
calculate it based on income and age as
well you write a rewrite rule and you
can ultimately transform all the
spreadsheets you have in a consistent
way so that's something we're currently
exploring and this is available if you
want to try it out you can go to my
website and download it it's just for
excel and for its utley just for windows
so you can try it you can play with
transformation rules add your own new
transformations and see if you like it
or advise people you know that you
spreadsheets alone to use it and then of
course after we did a refactoring tool
if you say refactoring you say testing
yes correct
if you're going to refactor your
spreadsheet then of course you wanna
also test your spreadsheet because maybe
if you're changing formulas especially
if they're not necessarily behavior
preserving at least you want to know
that they keep satisfying your test and
the interesting thing here is that this
was a typical ivory tower mistake that I
made I
thought in the beginning heaven it's
already so hard to get normal developers
to test and to convince management of
developers that testing is something you
should spend time on so how on earth are
we going to get spreadsheet developers
to test well turns out they are actually
already pretty good testers so we found
many formulas like this so this is
something that someone put in themselves
if the some of these guys is not a
hundred then I will output error and
otherwise I'll output 100% this is
really like a test and because there's
no and unit or J unit for spreadsheets
what do people use well they use
formulas but you could definitely say
this is a test this is writing an
assertion that these should always sum
up to a hundred or error and we found
lots of formulas like this and of course
you can exploit that if people already
have these type of formulas in there
stretching you can extract that into a
test suite so that's exactly what our
tool does it's cool expecto and some
more hidden behind this nice lamp expect
or and what you can do is you can find
existing tests in a spreadsheet and then
it's going to look at the entire
spreadsheet and it says hey I found
something that looked like a test the
sell-on questionnaire d-10 expresses
that the some of these guys should be a
hundred and then if you agree that that
is indeed what you wanted to test you
can say ok and you have a test week that
you can now run so you can run the test
and it says ha one of one passed this is
indeed one hundred percent isn't that
nice and in addition to that you can
also show coverage what you have test
Suites you can know all the things so
you can say ok show me what is tested
these cells are tested because we argue
the test cell is tested and also all the
cells that this cell depends on are also
tests of course this is a very loose
definition of coverage we're not talking
branch cover to your statement coverage
we're just looking at what area of your
spreadsheet at least is covered by some
test and if this is something we assume
if this is something that people are
used
good and maybe we can get to the level
also of branch gopher it's where you
have if statements and you need more
tests for them to be fully tested what
we also have here is we want to help
people to add new tests because it's not
that easy to know what you should test
so we have three four simple options you
can test the complex formula formula
with a large value or formula that has
lots of cells before it in the
calculation chain so hey you want to
test a complex formula well I found
something for you that looks pretty
complex this is there's a little nest
thing going on here maybe this is
something you want to test and you say
yes I want that you click make tests and
then you can specify some simple things
so you can say it should be a numeral B
text and upper value in lower value
again we don't necessarily need the
richness of tests that you would use for
software because the the scenario is
different we want to keep it as simple
as possible at least for this for this
point in time so he could set some
thresholds and save it and this is huh
look at that you've increased your
coverage from 6% to 8 we try to make it
a little bit of feeling for people to
add more tests and then now you have 3
per tests in your test suite that you
can pass so do some the one we already
have and now we also have these two and
this 2 is available from my website and
actually surprisingly even to me this is
going really well so over a thousand
people have already installed our plugin
and are continuously trying to test
their spreadsheets and working with it
so for research it's really interesting
to see the if these type of patterns
match the type of patterns that you see
in regular software testing there are
plugins like this for for instance
eclipse a plugin that's also made by my
research group is called watchdog that
the detects the type of test behavior
that you're doing so when you test when
you update the test when you run a test
and it would be very interesting to see
if the patterns between software
developers and spreadsheet developers
are similar in terms of testing
and in what cases they are a difference
so that's more or less all I wanted to
talk about before we go to questions
because we have some time for questions
I will quickly summarize my entire talk
in under a minute
so if you missed anything because I know
it's right after lunch so maybe you're
sleeping maybe you went to a nice pub
yesterday night so this is your second
chance to get the entire talk at least
the gist of it and if you were paying
attention of course this is optimal
preparation for question asking so the
one sentence summary spreadsheets are
cold remember this and tell all your
friends and never ever ever again say to
someone who's building a spreadsheet
you're not a real program because
spreadsheets are used for similar
programs they are Turing completes and
they suffer suffer from typical software
engineering problems they're not just a
programming language they are new and
hip and happening they are life they are
purely functional and you could even
almost say despite those two things they
are known by everyone so I showed you
that by implementing selection sort in a
spreadsheet in quite an elegant way if I
my face may say so and my research is
about applying methods from so Fran
Janine to spreadsheets because if their
code that totally makes sense and for
that I build a refactoring tool and a
testing tool that you can download from
my website if you want more information
this is my personal website where I talk
about research and you can download my
tools this is the word the website of
the research group I run where I force a
bunch of grad students to also like this
and if you want to know more you can
again you can send me a tweet also I
will be here all day also at the party
so feel free to talk about it to
approach me if you want to talk about it
or if you don't want to do that you can
also send me an email any questions
anything on the interwebs Oh lots of
things
it's this about Excel only or also about
calc and this is also about other tools
so of course the ideas that I present it
are very much generic you could use them
for any spreadsheet system however we
only implemented for it for Excel
because well that's just a de facto
standard and we want to build tools that
people use so we can monitor their
behavior so unfortunately it's not
really research work to implement for
lots of different systems that wouldn't
be necessarily something I would be
rewarded for but some parts of our core
are open source for example the grammar
I talked about is on github you can use
it and well if you want to build
something that might be a good start
hello this is a nice question what about
version control dipping and merging so
I'll say two things about that
first of all there's a British startup
called get gold spread get which is
exactly what you think it is it's it's
good for spreadsheets so that is
something if you really want to know it
to look at and also I know this is sort
of a curse words in this community but
the newest versions of SharePoint are
actually really good at doing version
control for spreadsheets you can do
authorization or worksheet level and on
cell level and you can also see
different versions there and and this is
used in the type of situations that also
spreadsheets are used so partly this
problem is quite nicely addressed by
SharePoint mmm oh yeah the same sort of
the same question again is it only
possible in Excel or also open source
software I already answered that we
often develop with several deaths in a
single software cooperation within
spreadsheets so again that would be
something that SharePoint or Google Docs
which partly address but also the
scenario is a little bit different
because typically people that make a
spreadsheet I said of course in the
beginning that a spreadsheet was used by
twelve different people but that's
typically not at the same time so
the spreadsheets aren't developed
together what typically happens is
someone makes a nice version and then
the guy in the next office says oh can I
have that spreadsheet - and then there -
and then sort of development happens
independently so really together working
on a spreadsheet I haven't seen it that
much and I don't know if that is because
the tools really don't support it or
because the process of end-user
programming is very much goal driven so
people aren't really necessarily
concerned with maintenance and test
saying they really didn't want to get
the job done which is usually a personal
goal and not not necessarily a company
goals I don't like repairing a book of
design fell well in a sentence my
dissertation is sort of a book about
design patterns so I talked here mainly
about the work on refactoring and
testing but before that there was lots
of work actually that's almost half of
my dissertation about smell detection in
spreadsheets and then if you describe
what smells are and you have anti
patterns and you have pattern so if
you're if you would really be interested
in it is if the PDF is also my website
so it's pretty nice to read if you want
to know more yeah another one you claim
that Excel has high order functions does
it yeah if you yeah so I guess I made it
I made a post about it and so if you
hack it a little bit so a similar trick
I used with with formulas in the name
trainers you can use that to mimic
higher order functions because you can
make a list of functions somewhere on
the hidden worksheet and then the
function you use could output reference
to one of those cells so you could say
then what I'm outputting is a function
and then you can apply that on yet
another set so and I mean I wrote a
quite extensive blog post about how
exactly that works with an example
spreadsheet you can download so I
recommend you read that
but then I I wouldn't necessarily say
this is something you you you should use
I say it is something if you're
interested in the theory that you could
do if this is your job I'm not
recommending this for production just
like fair disclaimer if in a year then
there are horrible
errors then Duncan crying yeah so I'm
convinced now that Excel is code or
spreadsheets are code but they are also
data right they combine the data and the
code isn't that a problem and can be
separated somehow so that you can have
the general selection sort and then the
data apply the input yeah that's a very
good question so like many of the things
I think in spreadsheets this is sort of
a double-edged sword so on the one hand
is really nice that your co-developing
your algorithm and your data as you see
me sort of doing the selection sort but
then you want to extract only the
functionality and sort of split it it
would be maybe an interesting avenue for
research to do that however a problem
there is that people really like it
especially if there are no trains like
us for abstractions it's not very easy
to do that and what many people might
not know is that actually Microsoft
Access was sort of aimed to do that so
access is an end-user programming
database this is what Microsoft thought
when they released it that it was really
for the same people that use Excel could
also use access it's for a database for
the general public however my ex I
didn't really research this from my
experience working with people and banks
and insurance companies is that that is
a big gap like everyone is on the excel
side and a few people are able to go to
a database a few people are able to
think about okay so first I design first
I write down my metadata and then I
write data and then I write calculations
on on top of it in three different views
that's not something everyone can do so
if you would want to make something to
split out the data and the calculations
somehow and I don't know I
know how you would have to overcome the
problem that you're introducing
abstractions to people who've never seen
that so I don't know if many people
would be able to make the job yes oh we
have to wait for the microphone my
lovely assistant is rushing over
otherwise the people on the video can
hear you so what's easy to teach
developers to build formulas in Excel or
to teach people to actually program it
on Python or something like that that's
a very good question well it depends on
the person and also on the goal of
course so it's probably best if we
approach it from both sides so I really
really sincerely believe that if
developers know a little bit of spread
cheating they can make in some cases
it's better to make a spreadsheet for
someone that needs a tool than to make a
system because then it will be
customizable and it will have all the
benefits so that's sort of if developers
would come a little bit to the
spreadsheet side uppy goods but also in
some cases and it's nice as you
mentioned python and also a programming
language like are there are programming
languages that make it to a broader
audience and again I don't really know
why Python is adopted so well by for
example biologists and statisticians I
don't know what what Python has that
Java doesn't there of course there are
many differences I don't know where the
difference lies so we could try to learn
from that what what programming
languages fits and users better so it
really depends on what you're doing
because one of the things that you're
mentioning is that we're gonna have a
lot of impedance between what you are
actually processing on and what you see
as a processing output so programming
language plus the visualization so for
ipython notebooks for example you can
even have documentation and execution
and all that in the same spreadsheet
that definitely has some of the benefits
of live programming and easy execution
yeah I I don't know I mean we can share
intuitions but I haven't done research
on exactly what it is I don't know so I
think it's sort of a boring answer but
it really depends in some situations
spreadsheet is fine in some situations
you might want to mean and want to learn
some programming I mean not everyone
will need that sometimes it's just
enough to be able to do some quick
offhand calculation okay if there no
more questions I thank to them for the
great talk and certainly learned a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
