years since the term DevOps was coined
and that's an interesting span of time
five years is about half of a normal
adoption cycle so it normally takes ten
years for something to become sort of
fully integrated into the way we work
and 20 years for something to be passe
and just sort of the assumed an expected
way of doing things five years is also
when you tend to see large companies
getting interested in ideas and maybe
diluting them so I'll be talking about a
number of aspects of DevOps and what it
means to be here now I'll talk about how
we got to where we are what the current
state of things is and some directions
to look at for the future so how did we
get here
DevOps as a term was created in 2009 in
fact it was created in 2009 by a
particular individual named Patrick
Dubois in order to run a conference he
needed a great name for the conference
and he decided to call it DevOps days
and the name really stuck this might
sound a little frivolous but it's got a
long tradition the term software
engineering was created for a US Air
Force conference in 1968 and so a whole
field was invented out of whole cloth
back then and so you know conference
driven development is definitely a thing
I'm gonna be open sourcing a framework
on that later on today now in terms of
this presentation I have a lot of names
of individuals to to reference and this
is trying to straddle the balance
between giving credit where credit is
due and blatant name-dropping I'm gonna
try not to do so much of the name
dropping and really give credit to the
innovators who've brought us where we
are so we have this term DevOps
Patrick created it for a conference but
the ideas didn't start there the ideas
were all
ready in the air when he created this
conference these antecedents stretch
back quite a ways so I recall in the
mid-2000s we were talking about this
thing called agile infrastructure which
was obviously modeled on agile software
development and was based around the
idea of extending the sort of agility
and flexibility you get in the codebase
into the infrastructure itself we were
also talking about infrastructure as
code the idea that the state of the
things you're building shouldn't be
described by a long document telling
humans how to execute procedures because
humans really suck at executing
procedures if you're going to write down
all the procedures give them to a shell
script so infrastructure as code was
bouncing around and even earlier than
that we had a guy promoting the idea of
infrastructure 2.0 that you should take
all the machines in your infrastructure
everything you're dealing with and treat
it like one big virtual machine that you
shouldn't be involved in assigning
resources to do jobs that's the job of
something like an operating system and
so we needed this notion of
infrastructure 2.0 which is like a
distributed operating system except not
one that Andy Tannenbaum would recognize
as an operating system but the
antecedents go even farther back I
actually had to go back into sort of the
pre web documents era to dig this one up
but cfengine
from a guy named Mark Burgess was
actually created in 1993 this was the
original ops automation software before
puppet before chef actually before the
languages that puppet and chef were
written in were created cfengine was
around and it's still around and it's a
great piece of software so what I'm
trying to say is these ideas didn't come
out of nowhere they've been around for a
long time but something made them gel
around the end of the last decade and I
think the thing that really made them
gel was the rise of virtualization and
the cloud because suddenly instead of
getting new machines once every three
years we were faced with the prospect of
getting new virtual machines
once a day or once every week or once
every six weeks and so all the questions
of deployment and configuration and
comprehending your configuration really
rose to the forefront Mark Burgess talks
about this notion of critical ratios
that many patterns of behavior are
determined when a ratio goes from
greater than 1.0 to less than 1.0 and in
this case the ratio that we're
interested in is how long does a machine
live versus how long does it take to set
up so in the old days a machine might
take a few days to set up a few weeks to
procure and it would live for a few
years when it machines gonna live for a
few years you can kind of tolerate that
level of delay in getting it set up but
if you start looking at compressing
those lifespans now you start getting
down to a point where the lifespan of
your virtual machine is approaching the
same duration of time as it takes to set
it up and something gets out of whack
you get a lot of pressure when you
approach that 1.0 value of the critical
ratio that pressure gets relieved in our
world usually in the form of more
software and so the more software here
suddenly dropped our provisioning times
from order of days to order of minutes
and I dropped the procurement time from
order of weeks to order of minutes and
this is when DevOps really began to
matter when we cross that 1.0 threshold
on infrastructure setup and delivery
time so now this is the world that we're
in a little bit of my own journey and
why I'm here talking to you today I've
been a developer pretty much all my
career except that I had this sojourn
over in operations for a while I got to
wear the pager and I got to get woken up
not only when my own software failed no
no when other people's software failed I
had to fix it in fact I was part of a
company whose entire business plan was
guaranteeing the availability of
software we didn't write
believe me this makes sense to VCS
somewhere so I did what any developer
does I wrote code to make my job easier
we had an application server I wrote a
bunch of code in Perl huge Perl oo
modules that could poke into every piece
of these application servers and deliver
me metrics and make changes
I built the production module structure
so that we could deploy easily and
frequently and keep things unchanged
that needed to be unchanged allow
developers to control some things and
ops to control what they needed to
control and I introduced version control
for our configs at the time this was a
really radical idea version control is
something that developers use it's a
programmer tool it's not an admin tool
how can it possibly help admin now I've
got another server to run the version
control server but in fact it turns out
to be pretty useful when something goes
toes-up
and you can look back and say you know
what happened or cron job was disabled
why was it disabled well so-and-so did
it in this commit at that time and there
were a few other things that I was doing
like you know giving bug reports back to
development with the line number where
the problem was that was causing the
resource leak even though I didn't have
access to the source code because I had
access to a D compiler and they were
leaving all the symbols in when they
compiled things and so during this time
I got to see firsthand how well our
software was surviving in production and
I was sort of disheartened to see that
the answer was not very well at all
most of the software that I was coming
in contact with had passed QA and it was
sort of designed and written to pass QA
and so I kind of got this idea that you
know maybe QA isn't the target and we
should really be thinking about how
things run in production that the end of
the software construction project is the
beginning of the life of the software
and so we should be planning for it to
live for some period of time and
building our organizations accordingly
so I've brought that in this book called
release it I tried to package that up
and bring it back into the development
world where I've come from and that's
why I'm here giving talks like these to
try and make sure we all appreciate
our software is only really interesting
in production and we should be getting
it there better and faster and more
reliably so that's a little history of
where this DevOps stuff came from around
2009 we were struggling to figure out
what to call this thing we had one group
talking about web operations and they
were having a little trouble
differentiating that from traditional IT
operations we knew it was different but
we couldn't quite articulate it to the
satisfaction of the ITIL based
operations managers we had terms like
high velocity being thrown in and a
conference called velocity we had a
jalopies angel' infrastructure you know
we were just searching for the right
name there was a time when we didn't
have the right name for agile software
development either some of you probably
remember this time we were talking about
lightweight methods lightweight methods
had a marketing problem you go to your
manager and say this is a
mission-critical project I think we
should use lightweight methods and what
so the right word is the difference
between lightning and a lightning bug
and when we got the word DevOps
everybody immediately went yes good word
two syllables rolls off the tongue
excellent but then we had to start
arguing about the definition what is it
what does it mean you know if Patrick
had provided a definition along with his
conference agenda that would have been
great but we immediately started arguing
about it what is DevOps what is not
DevOps am i DevOps a right now might be
I don't know so we have this guy named
John Willis who some people are
referring to as the Deming of DevOps I
like that because it makes him really
uncomfortable he shared with us the his
model that he called cams culture
automation measurement sharing and
they're in this order for a very
important reason because culture is the
thing you have to get right first if you
don't have the right kind of culture no
amount of automation will really get you
into a
frame that all sounds great and lots of
consultants can come up and say DevOps
is a culture change the trouble is
that's kind of an easy statement to make
about anything anything is a culture
change you start doing something
different you've changed the culture you
have to say what is the target culture
that we're trying to change to in order
for it to be meaningful and so I want to
help articulate the DevOps culture a
little bit the DevOps culture values
fast feedback
you heard Adrienne this morning talk
about measuring things in seconds rather
than minutes so you can get your
application redeployed 10 seconds after
you break it rather than 10 minutes the
kind of feedback we used to get about
production systems was measured in weeks
you know I make a release by posting
release notes to the ops group and
writing a change ticket and some number
of weeks later stuff goes into
production and then I find out that it
throws null pointer exceptions all over
the place
DevOps definitely values direct
connections between collaborating
individuals this is the antithesis of
the sort of cue based work order system
there usually will be artifacts and
documents created you can make a Kanban
board and be doing DevOps but actually
the communication is primary and the
artifacts are there for tracking after
the fact we do a lot of data based
communication it's not who yells the
loudest or who has an opinion about what
database technology to use or how the
application should be structured
whenever possible we actually look at
things like downtime and response time
distributions and we say this product
and this product function roughly the
same they can both meet all the QA
requirements but this one is going to
require downtime every to every time we
do a software release and this one is
not this one is going to require
centralized communication and
centralized governance this one is going
to allow decentralization and so we use
that as part of the decision-making
process and there's an interest
outgrowth of that kind of data based
communication which has to do with
queuing and the elimination of queuing
so anytime you have a communication
pattern that requires centralized
control and a gatekeeper you're
introducing delay into your process and
we'd like to get rid of that and so part
of the data based communication is how
long is it taking us to get from
check-in to live in production
collaborative and lo ceremony
you know everybody likes that nobody's
going to tell you hell no I don't want
to need that collaboration stuff but a
really key aspect is this idea of
enablement rather than self-protection
I've been in a number of Operations
groups that have a very dim view of
developers they view developers and
developer changes as the source of all
of their pain and so they do what anyone
would do they try to protect themselves
from that pain by erecting barriers and
making sure that developers can't get
through the barrier until they prove
that they're not going to cause pain the
DevOps approach is absolutely inverted
from that in two ways the first way that
it's inverted is that instead of
building automation that lets me do my
part faster I'm going to build
automation that gives you the power to
do what I used to do and where I was
going to apply judgment and analysis and
look at whatever you were doing I'm
gonna try to automate that that judgment
process so for example a typical point
of friction is around sequel or schema
changes in an our DBMS DBAs don't want
developers to write their own schema
changes because they do things like
forget to index the target of a foreign
key relationship well you can have a DBA
check every schema change that's going
through the system or you can have a
program that checks every schema change
going through the system I'd rather have
the program do it because they won't the
program won't forget something one time
the problem is something
like sequel is actually really hard to
parse reliably and examine and look at
for problems so maybe I do something
like build an environment where I can
automatically instantiate the current
database apply the change and then
inspect the results of the change this
is a kind of work that organizations
used to be reluctant to do but is
absolutely core to the idea of
enablement another way to solve the same
problem is to say we won't specify our
changes in sequel we'll specify them in
something like liquid base or rails
migrations which are easier to parse and
easier to inspect with automated tools
whatever the solution is the objective
is the same it's to get the human out of
the loop use the human to apply
knowledge and judgment in building the
automation not in executing the process
every day or every week I'll say a place
where we have a work left to do is with
that same kind of transformation in the
area of information security our InfoSec
tools today are still very manual you
run a scanner against a system it comes
back with 800 pages and a security
expert when is it down to the three
issues that actually matter or if it's
your first go-around probably the 30 or
40 issues that actually matter but
essentially every time it's the same
process tool creates large output expert
inspects output and finds out what
really matters we've got to change that
in order to get InfoSec fully integrated
into DevOps as you're looking at these
culture bullet points you're probably
thinking they sound kind of familiar
they sound a lot like these values of
simplicity communication feedback
respect courage which you may recognize
as the original XP values that's
deliberate the DevOps culture is
deliberately modeled on agile culture
and generally speaking high velocity
high trust culture now I mentioned
automation as the second point of John's
definition
when we talk about automation again
there's a somewhat of a different
perspective on the automation one aspect
of it is that we're going to use lighter
weight tools how many of you have ever
been
the subjects and/or victim of something
like an HP openview rollout okay
apologies if any of you actually work
for HP it's very painful it's very
expensive and it takes a long time so
what happens three months down the road
if you say openview isn't really helping
us if you have data that shows our
downtime hasn't changed our response
time distribution is the same our
customer satisfaction is the same but we
invested all this money in open view
well you can't rip it out because then
you'd have to write it off you're kind
of stuck with it so we tend to favor
lighter weight tools and particularly
open source tools because we can adopt
them and throw them away as the needs of
the system dictate we're not beholden to
the CFO and the accounting department
for keeping that software in service
long enough to fully depreciate it we're
typically automating things to shorten
the cycle time so a lot of ops
automation in the past focused on the
last part of the request in other words
you would file a change request and it
would go into the ticketing system and
you'd have a CR B meeting that would
approve or deny the request and after it
got approved a change window would be
scheduled and then the admin would sit
down and take five minutes or so to do
the work at the end of a two-week
process automating the last five minutes
of that process doesn't do a thing to
help you what you want to do is automate
the approval process and automate the
delay out and so we're trying to
automate in ways that increase the rate
of change and enable safer change the
automation in operations also finally
embraces some of these developer tools
we've got admins
writing Ruby code even you know good Oh
Ruby library is with tests and
everything that's a pretty cool change
Adam Jacobs talked about how I think it
was Adam maybe
Jezz or Chris you can correct me if I'm
miss quoting talked about how admins
actually use a lot of different
languages all the time they look at all
config files in the etsy directory they
look at Apache config files all of these
things are languages for configuring
systems and admins move very fluidly
through a lot of these different
languages they just don't think of it as
languages so learning Ruby as another
configuration language it's actually not
that hard mm-hmm yeah I don't know about
em for well we'll talk about that
so underlying all of this is a shift in
emphasis in the operations group from
automation for self-preservation to
automation for enablement of other
people instead of making it easier for
me to push the button I'm gonna give you
the button and along with that I also
have to give you the consequences of
pushing the button and this is when we
come to measurement so you know if if
I'm the one getting woken up and I'm the
one getting called on the carpet by the
CIO and getting yelled at literally I've
seen Alpes managers getting binders
thrown at them across a room by a CIO
I'm gonna protect myself from that first
of all I'm going to wear a face shield
in to all my meetings with the CIO and
I'm probably also going to make it so
that you can't put me in that position
well the very easiest way to do that is
actually just to put you on the hook for
delivering quality software again this
is something that Adrienne talked about
this morning it's closing a feedback
loop that's been broken for more than 10
years if you can create a problem and
throw it over the wall and I have to
suffer the consequences of that problem
two things happen first I'm going to
make the wall hire and second you never
learn
to stop creating problems but if you
create the problem and you're the one
who gets the feedback on it you're gonna
learn how to stop creating problems so
when we measure things we're going to
get away from some of the ideas that say
the measurement system you know we've
got one for admins and we've got another
one for business and another one for
marketing and so on we're actually just
going to measure everything together and
we're gonna put it all in one system
where you can correlate anything with
anything this has some dangers you can
easily fool yourself with spurious
correlations ie8 users - global warming
or something like that there's a whole
website dedicated to spurious
correlations now very fun stuff but
sometimes there are interesting
correlations that are really useful you
want to enable ad hoc measurements like
the number of pizzas being ordered by
the dev teams why is this interesting
it's not so the CFO can make the more
cheaper pizza but it turns out when you
have a lot of dev teams ordering pizzas
if it's off-hours it probably means
they're working a lot and it's a leading
indicator of turnover so you find
insight in unexpected places when you
measure everything and I'm going to come
back to this topic about information and
information flows a little bit later the
final of John's bullet points was
sharing share information share power
share knowledge we really want to get
away from the idea of information
hoarding and try and tell people as much
as they want to know or are capable of
assimilating because everyone makes
better decisions when they're more
informed the big risk in a growing and
complex organization is local
optimization I make my job easier by
pushing work out of the boundaries where
it falls into cracks between my box and
the upstream box so you know what
happens a new job gets created to handle
what's falling into the cracks there and
now I've got three boxes with two
handoffs where we could have just been
talking a little bit more
one of the important systems thinkers of
the 20th century was named Donella
Meadows she wrote many great books but
one of the papers that really hit me
very hard is called leverage points in a
system where she writes down a hierarchy
of places to intervene in a system to
make changes to it and deliberate
changes and sometimes inadvertent
changes the weakest way of making
changes to a system is with what she
calls constants and parameters these are
things like tax rates raises bonuses
incentives they will alter behavior but
those alterations can easily be
overridden by other things I'm not going
to go through all 12 of her points
although it's fascinating reading when
we get into the higher strength changes
or higher strength leverage points we
get some interesting things so strength
of negative feedback loops relative to
the size of the effect they're trying to
control gain around positive feedback
loops relative to the size of the effect
positive feedback loops always win over
negative feedback loops if you're trying
to drive a behavior out of a system you
can create a negative feedback loop but
you're way better off creating a
positive feedback loop to drive a more
desirable behavior the undesirable
behavior will just fade out of existence
when the desirable one takes over but
now look at this one structure of
information flows this one I find
fascinating because we all deal in
information and so we have a lot of
control over this particular leverage
point and if you don't believe me put a
build monitor outside your CIOs office
and I bet you that the number of failed
builds goes down now maybe the number of
builds total goes down and the size of
the changes goes up so you have to be a
little bit careful about what you reveal
but simply making information visible
anywhere will cause people to try to
change that information for instance put
a graph
on a big visible display BVD as Alistair
Coburn calls it people will move heaven
and earth to make that graph go up and
to the right
whether that's what you really want or
not it's gonna happen so make
information visible and people will act
on it and you don't have to tie it to
incentives nobodies salary has to be on
the line nobody's bonus no penalties
just make it visible it's very easy to
do these these days get a flat panel
display with a chromecast plugged into
the HDMI slot if you can't get budget
for that ask for a real-time development
quality analytics platform and go buy a
flat panel display with a chromecast
same thing looks better on a budget
request as you're revealing this
information you may be asked for
interpretation some ops people don't
like giving interpretation I had a an
ops manager one time who was asked in a
morning meeting why one of the web
servers CPU had been higher than all of
the others for the previous day and he
tap-danced around a little bit because
he really didn't want to say oh but that
was the answer we didn't know we bounced
Apache and it came back to normal and
that was good as a result of that he was
required to report the average CPU of
the web servers every day at 6 a.m. so
it could go in the handwritten daily
activity report distributed to all the
managers for two years he had to get up
get on a conference call every morning
report a number and then go back to bed
well the managers quickly stopped
looking at these numbers and my ops
manager knew this so he did what anyone
saying would do he started making it up
he took the previous day's number
adjusted it by a few percent and gave
them that number he was not an
engineering major in school for those of
you who are cringing at the idea of you
know falsifying your data
it literally didn't matter would have
been far better to teach people that the
CPU numbers didn't matter what they
really wanted to look at was the
response time distribution because
that's what the customers actually
experienced and he could have reoriented
the focus of the organization around a
useful set of numbers that would have
become a touchstone for everyone to use
and keep referring back to and look at
as we made changes like the marketing
group using the content management
system to load an extra two megabytes of
video on the home page for example
instead we had a useless bit of
information being put into a handwritten
report
so my maxim is you'll never teach
yourself out of a job when you make more
info visible teach people how to react
to it get away from notions of
incentives or questions like that just
teach people this is what normal looks
like this is what bad looks like this is
what better looks like so that everybody
is kind of moving in the same direction
the next large influence I have to talk
about is a guy named John all SpA sort
of a wise patron saint of operations
calm level-headed individual I would
trust him in any kind of a crisis
situation but he blew our minds back at
velocity 2009 with a talk called ten
deploys per day at Flickr Flickr was big
men it's bigger now and they're talking
about deploying code ten times a day
it was heretical it was radical that
numbers gone up by an order of magnitude
but since then on later reflection this
showed an insight that came from the
agile community that if something hurts
you should do it more often
now this isn't because developers are
masochists but if you do it more often
you
get better at it you'll find ways to
make it not hurt you'll find ways to
automate it rather than sort of shying
away from the pain doctors know this
very well if any of you had some kind of
surgery they'll tell you get up and move
you know don't just sit around going all
it hurts you have to move it in order to
recover it's a similar kind of thing
with deployments if you shy away from it
your deployments get bigger riskier more
likely to fail more costly all bad
things John also brought in this idea of
people being part of the system and that
there's a human factors aspect to
operations psychology matters there is
such a thing as a failure inducing
system this is one which is highly
coupled exhibits dynamic coupling
so things that are loosely coupled can
suddenly become tightly coupled like
disk IO and Ram it gives you ambiguous
or uncertain signals in your readings
and it may have operators that don't
fully understand the system that they're
operating all of these are true for the
kinds of systems that we deal with
another major contributor to this line
of thinking is Jay's humble Jezz gave us
this fantastic book called continuous
delivery which i think is a great way to
introduce DevOps into your company it's
about deployment but it's about more
than deployment it's really about
integrating the value stream all the way
through the organization and it will
lead you to DevOps and even if you don't
get all the way there you're still going
to be delivering more value per unit
time than you were before so we have
this idea in agile development of
integrating kind of the front end of the
dev line stakeholders to dev to QA we
get one team in one room working
together
DevOps extends that the rest of the way
and so we should have a unified value
stream all the way through
and those of you have had any training
and lean will recognize this as what you
do in lean you focus on the value stream
all the way through and you integrate
that value stream so here we have the
factors that came together or the ideas
that blended together and created this
idea of DevOps okay that was a long
history lesson done with that let's talk
about where we are now so we're five
years in and we've made a lot of
progress but there are still some areas
that need serious work so I'm gonna give
you my own sort of grading scale on a
bunch of different areas and how well
they've been addressed so in the in the
region of deployment we've got fantastic
tools now in fact we've got an
embarrassment of riches in the tool
space we've got the venerable cfengine
we've got chef puppet ansible salt
actually there's new ones every week so
please don't write a new deployment
system but there is a place that we're
lacking in this area all the deployment
systems sort of regard a machine as the
target of the deployment but I'm
actually not that interested in a
machine anymore I'm interested in a
whole topology of machines with parts
running in different places that all
have to know each other connect and
collaborate we don't really have much
that's doing that yet so that's that's
why it's an a- instead of an A+ when
we're talking about provisioning we're
really talking about taking you know
bare metal and getting it up to the
point where it's ready for an
application to be installed this is
actually kind of weaker than it ought to
be a lot of large organizations have
developed their own highly automated
provisioning systems their
idiosyncrasies a ssin in the way they
work they can't necessarily be picked up
and put down someplace else so we've
still got some of the old sort of
hardware standards around pixie and TFTP
we've got some tools like cobbler
sitting on top
but seriously if you've ever tried to
use cobbler
it's it's not fire-and-forget by any
means so be on provisioning fortunately
this is somewhat mitigated by the fact
that you're probably all running in the
cloud anyway and so you don't have to
deal with provisioning that often
logging is one of the places that has
really made a lot of strides I used to
be logging was either in the realm of
security and so the idea was write once
read never you collected all the logs in
some place where no one could ever look
at them or it was you know purely the
domain of commercial tools now we've got
both commercial and open source
alternatives so that that's gotten a lot
better monitoring has gotten a lot
better so we've now got fantastic tools
for sort of graphing things from logs in
you know one second or 1-minute latency
graphite has gotten a lot of traction
great tool not so great on the front end
so they're a replacement front ends for
it but a place that's struggling a bit
relative to monitoring is knowing you
know are things working so I can collect
all the metrics but I still need the
human wetware to look at it and tell me
is this normal or is this not normal and
I'll give you a couple of examples of
where anomaly detection is still kind of
not really meeting our needs so we've
got things like complex event processing
engines that can sit there and look for
you know event a occurs and then event B
or C must occur within a certain unit of
time they can aggregate a bunch of
events so you know if every single
application server is whining about not
being able to reach the database the
problem is probably the database not the
application servers so that part's okay
but one of my clients sends out a lot of
emails every morning I mean a lot of
emails and within a few minutes they
start to see logins from people clicking
in the emails or at least they're
supposed to see logins so what we have
here is a daily pattern that looks like
enough
nothing nothing huge spike nothing
nothing nothing
except that huge spike is supposed to be
you know between 20 and 30 percent of
the number of emails that they sent if
the spike doesn't occur
that's the anomaly we don't really have
tools that can do that yet there was
some talk at monitor AMA about digital
signal processing and sort of extracting
time-based patterns we're not there yet
I think advances in this area are going
to come from using older models from
cybernetics and control systems like
something called the Coleman filter
where you have a physical model of what
the system should do and you're looking
for discrepancies between what the
system should do given a set of inputs
and what it actually does of course that
requires you to build that model which
can be a little hard to keep up-to-date
with the pace of change in our systems
so we still have some challenges there
and then there's this area that I call
system comprehension or the idea that
says you know okay so you can tell me
that a machine is down but how does that
affect my users or how does it affect my
revenue we don't have much that connects
through all those layers yet there is an
architecture description language called
our cue mate that purports to do that
but it's like it's a UML profile so you
can get stencils for our cue mate but
there's nothing executable about it I
can't turn that into a monitoring system
so this is another place that we've got
some advances to make one of the cool
things that we're doing is around this
idea of forcing randomness onto the
systems to improve them so it turns out
if you do a lot of deployments to the
consuming services a lot of deployments
look like a lot of failures every
deployment looks like a little partial
failure and if that's not enough we've
got this idea of the chaos monkey that
Netflix gave us that's you know throwing
rocks at AWS servers there's also
there's also the latency monkey that can
inject random latency into your system
to see if you're sensitive to latency
they've got the chaos gorilla that will
take out an entire region if you're
meant to be balanced across regions so
these are all good ideas and I think
there's more that we can do around the
idea of exploiting randomness to make
our systems better one of the big ideas
is that development is production by
that I mean the tools and processes that
you use to develop code are just as
important to the business function of
deploying software as the production
environment is to the rest of your
business functions so dev infrastructure
should be regarded as mission-critical
we're also seeing an increasing degree
of statistical sophistication around
monitoring and analysis particularly one
of the big themes over the last few
years that velocity has been averages
are misleading they hide the story you
actually need to look at the outliers
and the long tail of every distribution
because those turn out to dominate your
customer experience and your system
capacity and when we talk about
experiments and and doing different
trials and confirming hypotheses we have
to be aware of a couple of things great
blog post on web experimentation as a
storytelling human the the part I like
about this one was he was doing an a/b
test on a system 20 different tests and
one of them the B leg of the test showed
a measurable result with you know a T
score of 0.05 and so would be deemed
statistically significant the kicker is
that his a/b test just allocated people
in two different buckets and then they
were exposed to exactly the same
experience there was no difference
between the a leg and the B leg but with
a five percent confidence level one out
of twenty tests will show you a
statistically significant result purely
by chance
and so we're starting to get a little
more awareness of how to interpret these
numbers one of the classic errors that
you see people make is running an a/b
test planned to run for say a month
after a week the results on the B leg
are so significant that they the
business says stop the test put everyone
on B this is actually a fallacy of
experimentation and anyone who's got
their you know science and engineering
degrees will tell you that you can't do
an experiment that way because you can
get a temporary fluctuation away from
the population result that will
eventually converge on what you expect
to see but if you stop early you may be
getting a spurious result and you're
adopting something that's actually
harmful so a few things to watch out for
in the coming days of DevOps does anyone
recognize this particular curve can
anyone read this particular curve it
works better in print this is the
Gartner hype cycle unlike many things
from Gartner this turns out to be really
useful this basically says something
happens that makes a new possibility in
the way we work people talk about it a
lot talk about it that we get this peak
of inflated expectations where it sounds
like everyone's doing it but it's still
just the frontrunner and then people try
to start putting it into production and
many people don't do it so well and so
after a couple of years you get this
trough of disillusionment that says you
know this can't work here it's not in
this context we're not a special unicorn
but eventually you know if you stick
with it real value gets delivered the
thing is this is all about perception
this is not about the reality of value
creation or value delivery I think right
now with DevOps we're kind of close to
this peak of inflated expectations
patience which means I expect the DevOps
backlash any minute now
I expect to see stories about how DevOps
is failing and how companies are wasting
money and how they had to roll it back
because if you're a journalist
especially that's the more interesting
narrative now it's not interesting to
have another place that succeeds in
doing something that other people have
already done what you want to do is find
the controversy and so that's why we get
that now the other thing that happens
when you're right at the peak is it
looks really valuable as a market and so
you get a lot of people trying to cash
in on the market can somebody actually
come in and sell you a new culture not
really but they can sure sell you a lot
of tools and so you get this changing
effect or changing emphasis on tools
rather than culture to an extent people
will try to sell you culture they'll
come in with consulting engagements
change management plans change
advisers change agents you name it and
they're gonna try to sell you DevOps in
a box whether this succeeds or not has
almost nothing to do with the people
coming in and consulting with you
it has entirely everything to do with
your team and your own readiness to move
in this way and create this kind of
collaboration and to do the reorg and
change the alignment of the the
organization beware of the fallacy of
emulating practices without adopting the
culture you can put in the automation
you can get rid of the CRB but if people
are still looking for gotcha moments and
people are still going to get called on
the carpet and get blamed and get
binders thrown at them you're not
actually gonna change anything
one other thing to watch out for is this
kind of fallacy of hiring a DevOps team
so I hope it's clear by now that what
I'm talking about when I say DevOps is
actually a murder
and a closer collaboration it's a
blurring of the interface between these
groups that is really not served if I
hire a bunch of new engineers label them
DevOps engineers and now put them in
between development and operations I see
this happen
unfortunately often usually what that
group actually is is a tools group
they're building tools they're building
automation and that's fine hire them
call them a tools group actually we've
we've done without tools groups for too
long we should have more of them in our
companies but calling them DevOps is
actually it's not only a misnomer but
it's a disservice so a few more problems
that we have yet to solve areas of
opportunity there's something that I
like to think of as the paradox of
automation which is the more you
automate something the less prepared you
are when it breaks this is true of cars
today versus the you know beetles from
the 1960s people who drove those who are
a lot more prepared to fix them than I
am with my computer-controlled
fuel-injected vehicle an example I love
is about this textbook the making of a
fly this is probably a really good
textbook but I'm not sure it's worth
twenty three point seven million dollars
this was a real price on Amazon another
seller headed at a great deal only
eighteen point six million dollars how
do you get a textbook that costs that
much well to really screw things up you
need a computer or in this case several
of them there was only one copy of the
book available we had two different
sellers with automated strategies one
seller this prof Neff their strategy was
price arbitrage they looked at the
highest price out there and price
there's 0.2 percent less border ebook
had a really great reputation and so
they were arbitrage hang on the
reputation they'd find the highest price
and go 127 percent with the entire
strategy that if someone bought from
them they would go buy from the other
one and then ship it through well the
bots iterated this game for a month
before someone posted a blog post
and then instantly the price was reset
to something saying but this is a case
of two kinds of automation interacting
through a shared environment and I use
this as an illustration of what happens
when we automate a bunch of things all
targeting the same environment you can
get automation that starts to step on
each other or conflict with each other
and it may only happen in rare
circumstances like when there's only one
copy of a book so what we need to
realize is none of us are working in
this sort of first order cybernetics
environment first order cybernetics is
you know a thermostat we've got a
desired output we apply some control
with feedback to get to the desired
output but long ago people talked about
second-order cybernetics where we
incorporated the builder of the device
into the system as well and we even get
to third order cybernetics where we have
a common environment that everyone has
to operate in and this is where we get
dueling BOTS and 23 million dollar books
about flies so we have to keep aware of
of this kind of thing as well so what's
next watch out for dilution like I
talked about be a little wary of
consultancies trying to sell you a
devops culture it's not a tool not a
separate team you know it can be done
keep the faith it can scale up it can
get quite big and in the words of Jesse
Robbins don't fight stupid make more
awesome thank you
that's it
