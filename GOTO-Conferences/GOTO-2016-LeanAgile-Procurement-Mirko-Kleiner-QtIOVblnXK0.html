right to be to be honest I was really
sick cough I used to work on a software
as a vendor for all over 15 years and I
don't know I've I've done over hundreds
of evaluations from a vendor side and
was always very painful we'll come to
that why
so yeah just take a seat so two years
ago I I decided to fund my own company
as an agile coach and from then on I was
coaching cost a customer on the customer
side and what I noticed this procurement
is also painful for them so it's like a
lose-lose situation and I was starting
thinking about and yeah
from my experience somehow something new
developed called lean a our procurement
and I want to talk to you to you tonight
about it I really appreciate that so
much people are here and I'm also keen
on your feedback please give some
critical feedback I try to speed up a
bit that we have time before the break
and that we can have some discussions
and questions so
first of all how we evaluate today it
feels like I call it Excel magic
some guys are told to do some evaluation
gather all the necessary features and
functions and at one moment nobody knows
exactly who wanted that why is that
important and oh yeah we have to wait
every feature and the vendor has to
estimate on that and after that we have
a this is the comparison between the the
vendors but in the end your boss will
say oh yeah
there is vendor number a but I like more
number two we decide that so why we are
doing that right on the other hand to
whom we are speaking during an
evaluation it's the wrong people I don't
say that they are unnecessary so this is
sales man right but his goal is to sell
something and afterwards it just doesn't
care what happens with it
he sells your licenses he sells the
people he sells you your product but he
doesn't really care he has other targets
so we have to think about that how we
can come around that by the way there
are also such people on the customer
side right there are also middle
managers or pure project managers that
are told do an evaluation and they have
no clue about the customer needs and
problems that this new partner or
product or whatever should so so yeah
difficult and then comes the moment
where we have an offer we have decided
but still we can't start because we
don't have a contract
so we still have a translation step with
the legal department or the procurement
department that figure out for several
weeks at they start at zero they've no
clue what what the hell you've done the
months before right so let me explain
what we are doing in a classic
procurement world we have an idea and
yeah we already work with business model
canvas so we are already lean but then
somehow we forget about being lean and
agile I don't know why but maybe we just
don't have another instrument so we
start some design story we get some
documents we do some pre selection we
get some long lists and so forth and so
forth you know that and in the meanwhile
the costs raise up but what value have
we delivered so far no paperwork okay
there is an example I've heard this year
at the conference a procurement
conference in Switzerland from the
military department from Switzerland
they've ever waited a new content
management system but they went through
all that process they made it perfect
they were very structured the military
guys they used more than two years spent
two and a half million cash out
so this think occur for a product that
is worth they they estimated with all
the options it's worth investment cause
it is
might be hundred million investment but
what options they have talk we were just
three million so where is the balance
and there something you forget maybe all
the customer needs needs have changed in
a meanwhile so I'm pretty sure that the
moment is they've started they start at
zero
or almost
so yeah I asked myself isn't there a
more agile way more lean way and most
important it also should make form right
because otherwise nobody wants to do
that so yes there is I will show you in
a minute
but before that what we have to change
from that so we have some we have heard
we have the wrong people we we are
focusing to the solution instead of the
customer problem or the customer needs
we have this translation step that is
not really helpful and prolongs our time
to market we have we are building a lot
of documents or scope we are trying to
fix the scope why we are doing that in
agile world we never fix the scope so I
what we've done is we've created two
hypotheses so first is what if we have
to do that all in one day so just break
the rules if we have to do that in one
day what we have to change okay and the
second is can we forget about all fixing
the scope and all these documents and
having it more lean more in a such way
maybe so yes we did
so what we've done we have created the
similar canvas we will come to that
inspired by the business model and lean
canvas and we will see how we we drill
down the timing the the the evaluation
period to in a best case to two days
okay you'll see that so
I mean that's all nice in a best-case
you just start so you don't need another
method for it but the thing is in the
corporate world that it's that thing
that's not realistic so we we've
produced a new instrument to overcome
that issue maybe in some years the
culture has changed that we you don't
need that right so first one page why is
one page important we want to be
comparable you want to see that on one
one view this potential partner
comparing to the other partner oh okay
that has disadvantages disadvantage okay
I take that how is it today we have
plenty of documents and nobody has a
clue what was behind it
so yeah let's go through it first of all
we have sections in the middle we have
to focus so what is this what is our
strategy where's the strategy of our
company and of the partner we want to
work with and how does that fit together
on the right hand side we have the
company facing attributes so we will
prepare that and then compare what can
the partner bring in so that we can
achieve the targets together
we will go into details and you don't
have to take the pictures we you will
get this presentation so maybe not all
of you know that but all the canvases
has this strange numbers on it and this
is cause that's order how you start
filling it out and that's the main
reason is
you follow the risk okay
the first risk is is to partner risk do
we have to right partner we have on the
right-hand side the needs we will come
to that in a with an example what that
means we have to ready to our strategies
and on the left-hand side we have two
opportunities how that does that match
together if you don't have a match we
can stop you don't have to continue then
we have the condition risk if this needs
over here they have a price tag what is
worth to spend for example if that's not
matching what the partner is offering we
can stop
and after people risk something we we've
talked initially about it the sales man
just something very important in agile
teams is the culture the soft skills do
we have a match on that as well if you
don't have a match we can stop dude I
don't deliver the right expertise on a
people level we can stop and often
forgotten yes also on the customer side
we need to think about the people who is
involved who will take over lead who
will be part of the team maybe as well
on a customer side have so much so many
times seen that they have not care about
that at all and then you have the future
risk will this be the right partner of
the rift on the initial few aspects here
of the we've solved the first problems
together you can imagine there are a lot
of talking about software companies
there are a lot of software companies
out there they like to build new stuff
that's that's cool they are enthusiastic
about that but if it goes to maintenance
and support operations they hate it
maybe they don't even have an
organization for that so that something
could be the USP if one of the part of
Evo 8 has that ok
okay so this is just the frame I have an
abstract example for you important is
currently we have already plenty of
companies and Switzerland and UK but
also in Canada they're working with that
some of them are implementing all of it
some of them using parts of it but it's
not about some 100k hundred thousand
budget project all of them or ten twenty
million and more so even for those
projects it works
so giving you some more detail we have
some strategic pillars or topics we want
to increase our revenue we want a
digitalization we want to happen
everything digital whatever your targets
are you can break it down to your
departments goals if this is something
you're evaluating for your department
and these are prioritized and waited
okay on the other hand you have epics
and these are not that the fit the same
thing as in the excel these are
solutions functions and features what we
have here are customer needs what we
have to solve to make the customer happy
there are various possibilities to solve
that
we also have existing alternatives how
we solve that today we have the time box
so this strategic pillar this is our
main focus in the first time box but we
also allow other epochs on that or no we
just want to have the epics on that you
see that if the color code doesn't have
to but what we've learned in real cases
that even talking about what is our
strategy and how this user needs or
customer needs or fitting to that brings
you to the next level because the people
are usually lost in features and
functions and we had so much surprises
and questions like what is our strategy
what is our current goal oh my god we
don't know it in transparent and then
they raised it up so there was the
manager and said okay it's that these
are okay so and then the next thing was
we forget about all the features
functions what is really worth to solve
what what really needs for the customer
so then we have the other things that
was also funny at the beginning the high
level concept you know that from from
the lean canvas it's for example x4 why
YouTube is the Flickr for videos right
so make a crisp sentence what your
company stands for and in real cases we
had there for any discussions coming up
we don't know what we are standing for
or are we are just a software company we
want to build things but you have told
us your CRM experts and this is your
product yeah we have a product but we
just want to build make projects so
you're not so enthusiastic about this
year and topic itself ok interesting
right so on the other hand we have
opportunity services copy all the
products that matches to the needs we
bring them together but we have the
customer needs and services products or
modules or whatever and how does that
match maybe you don't need all the
modules and they pay a lot of it for it
because we just want to solve that then
important is the team so name the
persons that will work together
that's hork name that from the first day
on from the vendor side given order we
will see afterwards why that's important
and then you have the cost structure
where you map the profiles of these
people to a daily rate because a daily
rate if you are in a sourcing project
for example
then you're gonna be comparable if we
just have a big number it will cost you
so much that says nothing and then we
are interested in rewards and not
company rewards we're interested in
these team rewards what these team has
achieved in the past okay so that's
really enough maybe for plenty of
evaluations it might be but we have to
be realistic there is a lot more okay
so why we need more we need transparency
agile teams need all the information to
start creativity to build new solutions
so we have on one hand side maybe behind
the strategy topics strategy map we have
behind the timing go product roadmap
that breaks it down we have a value
stream map we have a customer journey we
have architecture that shows us all we
want to have a new system how that will
fit with all the rest maybe it's also
important we want to talk about our
company culture there are plenty of
companies out there they're starting
visual visualizing their culture their
values what is important for us general
terms and conditions yeah we still have
something like that maybe but for
example Facebook started to visualize
that as well
so that it's easy to understand from one
page and we have the Seavey's we have
profiles fact sheets whatever so usually
you have all this stuff already you just
need to bring it together
and the lien proposal canvas is your
summary of all that so you print it out
you plot it out maybe it's really huge
but then it starts to be comparable so
yeah got it one page but how we get
there
ah forgot that we you remember we had
this translation step I'm not a lawyer I
did I was not really sure if this is an
actual contract but I contact the lawyer
we have a lawyer in the team and she
said Wow
you have all you need you have to find
your goals you have to find how to
cooperate and this is a natural contract
and of course there are at actions you
can this this is maybe could be a time
material contract but maybe there is
also a fixed price we don't care so the
the canvas doesn't say what you have to
do so how to do that in just one day
well it's not magic because it's lean we
have the idea so we have already the
business model canvas we have all these
attachments in the best case maybe we
have to work it out in the book a bit
more detail and bring it together and
what we do and they oneness we set up a
cross functional evaluation team that's
not new usually you already do that but
are you really doing that including
these people as well the people that
have to work together usually not there
are some middle managers and I don't
know usually you also don't include the
lawyer from the store
your procurement guy your stakeholder so
you need to have everybody in this
cross-functional evaluation team so that
you're able to decide so if you need
some representatives from the business
they're in okay then in the next step
and that could be done also on the same
day yes you just fill out the right side
of the canvas that's not magic
you can do the same time the same thing
with the business model canvas already
in an hour or something so why we can't
do that with the procurement canvas and
then becomes crazy inspired by the big
room planning you may be or familiar
with that we just need the same
cross-functional team from the vendor
side as well so we need all the people
from the vendor we need the lawyer
we need managers we need everybody that
is needed to decide answer all the
needed to the questions to fill out this
part right
and we do that all together so for
example it's a bit easier here so for
example you start with the vision what
is the vision of the company of the both
companies you'll give some insights what
we gonna try to do in what order what is
what are the user needs which people we
already have which other people they
bring in and then you maybe break this
down you just break down break it down
and create some go product roadmap
together maybe you have done that
yourself already and then you can
compare if you go further and you have
done for all the epics some lean canvas
itself you for example so already know
what it's worth to spend so you can
define a budget cap so we do all all
that together and you have all the
information in the room if all the
people in the room to the side so at the
end of the day you will just say Wow
is that what can we do it and have you a
match also on the personal side and if
not then we go in the next
so the good thing is if you with that
you maybe depends on the availability
from from the people you reduced time to
market to the minimum in a best case two
days if the first partner evaluation is
already a match then you don't have to
go further but maybe we talk about some
weeks in your account so but maybe you
do it with three or four because you're
unsure or you just want to have more
opinions on that and then two of them or
quite at the same level what you're
gonna do then
well maybe you just take the the first
phase and let them run and you decide
later with whom to continue so you you
start to work together and learn from
the cooperation how they behave what is
the tool about cetera and the good thing
is if you start early you're flexible if
the target moves to to somewhere else
so that's it in short we are track
currently this is really brand new we
just published a new website this week
we have already more than 100 volunteers
on that all over the world and just
remember the oops you don't see that
sorry
Oh doesn't work
so you have all the information there
there is also some explanation about it
and our goal is so you know some some
fancy comparison for you your boss or
your your into a new procurement manager
there's some explanations about it
yeah thanks to Joe for this statement
and and others and yeah we are really at
the very beginning of building a
community what we've gone we're really
intrinsic motivated to change the world
of procurement make it more lean more
agile more fun and I think that will be
awesome that will be really awesome and
just for you the there is a template you
can download it for free and we've
already started writing a book about it
there or which we just had the the table
of content and a lot of research and
experience done but it's not yet written
but you can already buy it and as funny
as that we have already sold one ok
that's it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
