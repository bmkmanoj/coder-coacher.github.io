started here I just want to throw it out
there that the I'm pretty interactive
I'm going to ask you guys to answer some
questions raise your hands thing like
that the last conference i was at
probably had about a hundred people in
the room all of which were developers
and i asked everybody how many people
are developers and literally no one
raised their hand so do me a solid we're
going to ask some questions I love it if
you guys could raise your hands so how
many people in the room I just want to
get a feel of like who we are so I can
figure out how to drive this
presentation forward for you guys how
many of you guys are web related
developers like HTML CSS JavaScript
sweet all right how about just like Java
also sweet okay and then any other
languages we just want to throw out you
can literally just like yell out
languages you like or something like
that node notice JavaScript that's what
coming it's close enough we're good
alright so today we're going to be doing
mobile app development with a superpower
platform with ionic now that I know who
you guys are let's talk a little bit
about me my name is matt kramer i'm the
project lead on the ionic creator
project which we will talk about a
little bit later in this presentation
i'm always on twitter you can find me at
Matthew Kramer and you can find matt
kramer calm as well if you want to get a
hold of me personally or like shoot me
an email that i will maybe respond to
that's where you can find my contact
information now before we get into ionic
in general i kind of want to walk you
guys through a story okay about my
struggle to get a nintendo 64 okay so
when I was eight years old I walked up
to my parents I said mom dad I want a
nintendo 64 for christmas and they
looked at me he said son get a job so my
father my eight year old self here not
knowing how to get job how to get money
kind of just went about my way ignored
it until a couple days later my mother
came up to me and said
have a brilliant idea for you on how you
can get all it's like I don't know 170
bucks to get your nintendo 64 you're
going to go to all the neighbors yards
and you're going to pick up their dog
poop so matt kramer super duper pooper
scooper service was born for five bucks
a week i would go to your yard pick up
after your dog leave it in the little
bag on your porch not light it on fire
and you would pay me five bucks and it
was great I do not still do this
although we'll get to that in a minute a
little bit more so I got my first one or
two clients and I went to my dad that's
a dead if I want to be a real business
if matt kramer super duper pooper
scooper service is going to get big i
need a website so i got like angelfire
com / WI 3 / business / pooper scooper
something ridiculous I've tried to find
it I can't find it anymore and that
really like back in the day got me amped
up about you know I was putting bright
red h1 tags blink tags Marquis animated
gifts of dogs pooping you know and like
that was the web back in 1998 you know
it was very simplistic but it got me
excited for programming around this time
you know everybody wanted to build a
website the web was exploding but we
were still very very simple okay no one
could do anything complex there wasn't
really not such thing as a dynamic
website yet yet again like who remembers
like under construction things you know
like every single website at him and
that was it that was like all the web
was right and then the great 2006
happened that's me i bought my first car
with money I made from when I was a
picking up dog poop and reinvested paid
off got myself a Buick Regal 1992 I've
literally accidentally drove this off a
10 foot cliff once and it survived gray
car I'm debating buying one again but
also in 2006 we had a lot of crazy stuff
happened okay jquery came out and
suddenly it was really easy for
developers as a whole to make really
dynamic websites okay in 2006 we had
things like Google Docs came out
Facebook came out and this really
dynamic
content that enriched the web was born
okay so we took someone who in 1998 like
around people in the room here web
developers did you were you guys around
like 1998 were you doing web like
earlier yeah so like a good amount of
people here so we started out doing
really simple things okay 2006 rolls
around now we're doing really complex
things like we got tools added to our
toolbox that took us and made us
stronger developers and let us move our
careers forward okay 2009 some really
crazy person decided what if we take
JavaScript and we throw it in the back
end so now you have a web developer
going from under construction gifts to
fully dynamic websites to now we're back
end developers right and some crazy guys
sitting over here Brian in 2011 or 2010
said what if we take those people and we
allow them to make mobile apps too and
phonegap was born also in 2011 angular
came out the web evolve again backbone
ember like all these things are
happening where our jobs are getting
progressively progressively more
powerful we started with a very simple
skill set and now we can do almost
anything we want Larry 2012 technology
came out where you can program robots
with JavaScript ok so animated gifts mr
key tags to where literally programming
robots with Johnny Five also in 2013
ionic comes out that's what this whole
presentation is about but as you can see
like I really just want to drive the
point home that the web has been around
for over 20 years ok our technology
stack HTML CSS JavaScript has had a
major evolution over those 20 years but
the thing is we're not going anywhere
what we're doing is we're literally
every Technic major technology robots
forgot 6 every major technology that
comes out we kind of inherit and say
let's make the web run on that and we
add to our own toolbox to our own
arsenal and so nowadays the really big
thing that's going on is I want to build
a mobile app everyone's got an idea for
a mobile app it's I use mobile apps for
almost everything i'm doing i barely use
a desktop browser unless i'm programming
like i'm sitting on the couch going on
amazon using their native app which
fantastic app everybody wants to do this
but building apps is really really
difficult okay especially if you're
going native you've got two different
code bases so right away like there's a
barrier to entry where oh you want to
make an appt pick one right and you're
going to start with that one and move on
to a second one okay entirely separate
code bases also native developers tend
to cost a lot more money than us so if
you're trying to hire a team to make an
appt native developers now you're going
to have to hire to debs maybe instead of
one it gets a lot more complicated okay
oh you want it whoops sorry you want
throne windows other platforms like that
like all of a sudden now you've got
three different code bases not fun so as
many of you know this is where hybrid
apps come in okay hybrid app it just
uses html5 JavaScript CSS to allow you
to take essentially web programming and
put it on a mobile app but also provides
you with actual API SDK level access but
leaves you in that familiar web
development environment okay i'm still
using tools to make ionic apps that i've
been used to and have been using for
years before i even knew about ionic
this whole thing is a single code base
too so you've only got one code base
running iOS Android Windows whatever you
want to do okay and a lot of people walk
up and say I even at this conference
I've had people walk up and say like oh
like you know those web apps you know
they're really slow right it's like it's
not 2007 anymore okay way back in the
day when you were trying to throw like
full jquery applications on you know the
first iphone yeah it's not going to run
that well right but since then we have
over fifty percent increase in speed of
those professors eighty-four percent
sorry not percent 84 time increase at
GPU performance and now we have things
like you know CSS transitions that are
using that GPU natively so we're getting
a lot of speeches from technology
advancing and from our web technology
advancing at the same rate yet we still
encounter a major problem right there's
no web SDK so here you have an iOS
developer let's say who has access to
all this stuff like action sheets
gestures list buttons tabs we're
literally they just say like okay throw
a tab over here link it to this add
buttons to the screen and like they've
got that SDK available to them right
it's easy to make an iOS app in native
iOS land when you're just using their
components because you don't have to
worry about speed you don't have to
worry about anything because the iOS
developers that made this SDK I've taken
care of all that stuff for you then
you've got cordova and phonegap on your
native app and we only get these two
things right here we have native app and
then webview and then nothing this is
your blank canvas right where you're
just adding you know regular HTML CSS
JavaScript you can use whatever you want
which is both a gift and a curse right
because then you have to manage speed
you have to do all this really
complicated stuff and that's the gap
that ionic tries to fill okay we try to
give you all of these components so that
you have access to side menus tabs
animations things that all these other
native SDKs give you we want to give you
for the web to make that whole process
just a lot easier for you we want to be
the people that are we reading about the
speed for you guys okay we make sure
that all of our transitions are really
fluid things like that really what we
want is we want you to focus on building
your app not on how your app should work
I'm going to repeat that we want you to
focus on building your app just what you
want it to do instead of how your app
should work we don't want you to have to
manage that navigation stack yourself we
don't want you to have to program all
that stuff from scratch okay annex built
all the web technologies you know and
love html5 css3 javascript yet again
these technologies have been around for
20 years we're not going anywhere our
skill set is increasing by adding things
like ionic to this we are super powered
by angular right now which for those of
you that don't know extends HTML with
different tags and directives and all
sorts of fun stuff where if you're
building your app you can say like okay
here's an you know an eye on list item
and then you could populate that with
different images and things like that we
really make it easy for you to just in
HTML start programming with all the
components that we offer you ionic one
uses angular 1 ionic 2 uses angular 2 so
that is a beta right now we are aiming
for release candidate next month and so
really we're trying to build on the
future of JavaScript here okay we're
trying to make sure that you get that we
are moving with the entire industry
forward with these new technologies we
want to make sure that we're optimized
for all this large-scale development to
make enterprise applications as fast as
possible we want to be performant ok
we're moving forward with the whole
industry on top of that who use the SAS
or any kind of CSS preprocessor okay so
like the bread and butter of ionic is
the fact that we have all these Styles
built in for you we use these directives
which style them that's how you get the
animations with all the CSS stuff right
but let's say you wanted to do something
like maybe change the way a transition
works or change the color like we have
positive color which defaults to blue in
ionic right and you've already
programmed your whole app using that
positive color you know you've got your
buttons hanging out using positive all
that stuff and you want to change that
to orange okay you can use sass to
literally just change that to orange
with one line of code we will recompile
all of ionic for you using SAS and you
didn't have to do any changes so yeah
access is like really big because we're
doing a lot of stuff for you guys but
we've made it really easy for you to
change it we want it to be customizable
okay so the whole thing is variable
based there's literally a file of
variables that you can find for like the
border radius of a button like that's
variable everything is variable so that
we can make this really customizable for
you guys okay we believe firmly that
your design should be your design so
take advantage of how easy it is to
change this stuff yeah this is the
various literally if you just open up
the variables jas failure boost a CSS
file like it's really easy to see how
it's it's parsed out with comments and a
lot of the variables have been named
like pretty long way so you'd know
exactly what it is so it's really easy
so we've talked about all these pieces
right how does it all fit together
because I get we get a lot of questions
like okay I want to use ionic but like
what about phonegap or what about
Cordova and it's important to note that
this whole thing is this is the stack of
your ionic app okay we've got the native
SDK layer at the bottom which is like
what allows you know access to
geolocation to the camera platform all
things like that
dov'è sits on top of that which is what
provides angular access to all those
native SDKs okay so you're going to use
the camera through Cordova from your
angular app on top of angular sits ionic
ok that's all of the directives that
transitions we work with UI router to
make sure all your pages work in anak
one and ionic tool use push pop
navigation and on top of that is your
custom code so it's just really
important to note that like we are one
piece of this puzzle that has been built
over the past you know how many years
2010 on top of Cordova and the backs of
these technologies that have really been
useful to us so I just want to hit a
little bit on some specific things about
anak two as well so anak two like I said
use this angular 2 this is fully modern
modular object-oriented JavaScript ok
this is like a future for people that
literally program in just like regular
Java it literally feels like home in
typescript typescript we provide the
option to that we do just yes 2015 it
compiles down to es5 the whole shebang
so if you want to check out addict to
you can go to our website and play with
that right there everything really like
like I said we're going forward with the
industry here angular 2 just went RC 0
we're going RC 0 next month now the
other thing you want to talk about
though is now we're going to go like
rapid fire ok ionics a pretty large
ecosystem you know we start with that
CSS the JavaScript that's available to
you but there's a lot of stuff that
we've programmed to make your lives
easier and so now I want to go through
and just talk about a lot of the stuff
that we offer so really my only goal
here is to get you guys excited about
what ionic offers so you can go home and
have a better idea of maybe what you
want to look at or how you want to start
or maybe if you're already in I AG
developer I know we've got enough stuff
that sometimes projects go by the
wayside that maybe are extremely
beneficial that you guys maybe haven't
seen yet so this whole thing starts off
with ionic UI components okay we've
built a ton of stuff from scratch at
recom you guys can check out our
documentation we literally are
documentation as like a phone on the
right hand side and docs on the left and
as you scroll through it it literally
updates with the components that you're
looking at in the docks so it's super
easy for you guys to go and say up this
is what tabs look like this is what
buttons look like this is how I can
modify a button to be bigger or smaller
this is how i can head back onto a
button like all the options are right
there preview bowl with you to play with
same thing with addict to both
documentation for ionic one and two are
really easy to use with that on the
right hand side now I wanted to go
through a couple demos here so I might
squat down here we're going to have to
go over here at flight at this ok so
this I just wanted to highlight the fact
that we've done some of the speed work
for you ok when a native developer has
access to things like uicollectionview
ok they get a lot of stuff that iOS is
team has done for them ok they've
programmed it so that only things that
are visible are in their version of the
DOM and so it's really fast to scroll
through huge list natively because
they've programmed their list to
function that way right so a lot of
times you have you know I fell on victim
to this where I get a huge list of
something i rendered the whole thing to
the dom and it's like yep the this app
is slow and it's because we have to
switch to something like our collection
repeat where we've programmed collection
repeat to work exactly like
uicollectionview so here and this is
just as fast on a phone I promise this
is literally an array of three thousand
cats with a picture a name here and that
a little identifier all sorted
alphabetically ok we're literally we can
scroll this through three thousand cats
and we are still super fast because the
DOM is only loading you know what ten at
a time maybe and reusing that dominant
so as we scroll here it's taking the one
that disappeared off the top taking that
Dom element throwing it back at the
bottom and replacing that content so
when we reuse that Dom information we
get a lot more speed from that so this
is just one example we've tried to take
this care in ionic and throw this over
every
that we do we want to be fast like this
we want to make sure that we're
providing you native level speeds by
doing things like this so yeah that's
called collection repeat if you guys
want to like go home and play with that
and try like thrown a ton of stuff at it
and like one totally cool try to break
it have fun all right we're at my mouse
go alright the next thing i want to show
is i do want to show a little demo of v2
okay so v2 is awesome okay brandy and
Adam have both worked on our team on
this project for a long time and
provided a lot of care to how this thing
looks how it functions and we fixed a
lot of the stuff that people didn't like
about ionic one or angular 1 in general
okay so first thing that we're going to
see is it's got really really
nice-looking animations the speed is
fantastic who has used ui-router before
yes so UI router can be a little bit fun
a little bit complex and sometimes when
you have things like maybe a side menu
plus tabs ui-router starts to get weird
on how you set up complex navigation
like that right so one of my personal
favorite things about ionic too if you
want to check it out is this push pop
navigation style which literally states
take this content open it here okay so
there you don't have to have a huge
route file or anything like that you
just push a route to somewhere now it's
got a back button now you got the
animation all the stuff happens
magically for you and then you pop it it
goes away and that's the same thing as
going back okay so that push pop works
fantastic lots of new components I'm
going to click around this demo but if
you guys want to search for this you can
literally just Google ionic 2 conference
app it's on github you can download it
and regular angular 2 if you want to use
typescript as a typescript version for
that too so as we can see here we've got
our slider component that works really
nice and then I want you guys to watch
when I click this button okay this is
our material design that is new and
ionic to where we've done all those
animations for you do I not have enough
clarity on the screen to get the
animations to show up all right so our
colors aren't deep enough to see this
but we have full animation support for
material design baked into this thing so
literally where I click on this
tab it is emanating a circular
representation just like material design
built in fully performant fully GPU
backed and no work to you guys for doing
that so through here we also have
animations for opening and closing here
they look real nice all your components
are built in not all of them are in this
but there's your toggle we've got tabs
at the bottom okay and who's ever tried
to do tabs and side menu in ionic one
anybody it's not fun but here our side
menu opens you do speakers we go right
two speakers it new to open it in the
correct location same thing with that
about tab so our side menu tabs all that
interaction between different levels
that would normally maybe be different
Navigation stacks has all been combined
in a way where it's super easy for you
guys to program this exactly how you
want any questions about this before I
move forward sweet so on top of that I
act to and I like one both come with
platform continuity okay anionic one we
offer iOS and Android but it's not
necessarily material design and addict
too we offer iOS Android material design
and windows we're literally these three
things that's that app I just showed you
okay but all three of them are using the
exact same code base for free ok there's
we handle what we figure out what kind
of phone you're on and we automatically
show you the one that you want ok cool
thing about this too like we're talking
about SAS before where if you want to
let's say have a style be very specific
to iOS we automatically add like a
platform iOS class to the body and add
one or two where you can customize each
of these three different things
separately in your CSS if you wanted to
have that level of customization but
still ship one code base that does all
three of those things so super important
part of ionic is that you get all that
for free we've try to make it as close
to the platforms as possible and I know
that material design is really awesome
if you want to check it out in v2 the
other thing I want to mention is a icons
this is literally I think it's either
700-900 icons that are designer and
co-founder been made we're literally we
put those up for free I don't know how I
even made this many icons himself I
don't know where if
the time but there's iOS Android for iOS
Andrea but like thick and thin versions
of each one everything is available for
free for you guys to use seriously even
if you don't use anak you guys can go
grab a Hannah cons at an Accounts calm
and use that any product that you guys
want to also important to note the
framework completely MIT licensed okay
we are free to use you guys can go use
us in projects you charge for you can do
whatever you want we do not care it's
open source you can change it you can
modify it do whatever you'd like now
this whole thing is great but it's not
great if we don't have good tools
surrounding our platform so one of our
primary objectives is to give you guys
access to tools the way you like them
and to make sure those tools function
well who's used the ionic fly before our
CLI sweet so it's as easy as typing
attics start my app to get a project up
and running locally after you set up
your ionic environment and so literally
you type that it downloads a default
project you can we have side menu tabs
blank like you could pick like a premade
starter if you'd like and the fully it
makes that up and running all you have
to do is CD into that directory do ionic
serve and that opens up in your browser
like it's running on a phone okay
everything works great built into that
is also emulating so we have the
emulator support directly from our
command line if you want to pop that
open in an emulator running it out our
device also comes built in with live
reload that watches literally everything
so if you change that sass file and it
recompiled down into the CSS we detect
that reload the app for you we want to
make sure you can develop this as fast
possible worth noting too that in v2 it
has the compiler is already built in
here for you guys so if you're
programming typescript and that compile
phase needs to happen we automatically
watch those changes for you and do that
as well so you don't even need to worry
about that stuff it comes pre set up
with the configuration file to do that
step for you if you want to modify it
change it a little bit you can totally
do that but we package it with defaults
to make it as easy as possible
I know we do in v1 I don't know the
correct answer to that in v2 I check out
the docs quick but yeah so I think
whatever it is we have a fully default
configuration that you guys can change
to your heart's content now everybody
close your eyes for a second who here
prefers GUI tools / command line tools I
I know there are people here that like
gooeys I use the get I use github for
Mac okay i love gooeys i know there's a
lot of people like me ionic lab is a GUI
for our client okay so anak lab you can
download and you can use that to do the
serving you can use it to install your
platform so you can use it to do
whatever you'd like it's there for you
to sit on top of the command line
interface and make sure that you if
you're more comfortable with a GUI you
can use this I love it it's also great
because over here too if you serve with
it it actually shows you your app
running right on the right hand side in
lab so you don't even really have to
open your browser if you don't want I
anak view also completely free if you
upload your app locally to our servers
you can use ionic view to preview it
live right on your phone so every time I
upload a new version you can share with
your friends you can share it with you
know co-founders other people where they
might have it on their phone they see
you get an update you download the
update you can play with it right on
your phone we have that package there's
a lot of popular native plugins to if
you want to use things like that so
ionic view definitely use and abuse that
thing is one of my favorite features of
the whole thing speaking those native we
have ng cordova as well as ionic native
ionic native is just the v2 and g
cordova they're basically the same thing
which is if you use cordova plugins like
for accessing the camera a lot of those
are written in straight javascript where
they don't work with angular callbacks
very well because you're not inside the
scope we've wrapped over 60 of those
four ng cordova and a nickname where
we've got the most popular ones
pre-wrapped to work with angular for you
we want using those native plugins to be
easy instead of hey i called the camera
and my angular app isn't updating why ok
check that out it's super super easy
another really good way to get started
with ionic is to check out our
marketplace okay the attic marketplace
has starters plugins themes all sorts of
stuff both free and paid we don't take
any money or any cut from this we
literally just let people put their
projects on here kind of as a free way
to get traffic and free way to get their
name out there so also if you guys are
making any themes plugins anything like
that feel free to add them to the ionic
marketplace I can't even tell you how
many downloads or things this gets go
here check out the plugins check out the
themes we've got you know fire based
authentication starters lots of
different stuff that's been added to
that as well as premium themes where if
you wanted like a really custom look
there are developers out there who have
made beautiful themes that you can
download and use I think most of them
charge like less than 20 bucks for some
of their themes so great way to kind of
get a bootstrap on that my project is
ionic creator how many people in this
room consider themselves maybe more of a
like designer or non coder okay not a
whole lot so a lot of programmers a lot
of people look at me and they say I'm a
programmer I don't need to use a
drag-and-drop tool to start my app you
know why would I want to do drag and
drop that seems like you know a lot of
people say it's a it's kids toy they go
back to the days of Dreamweaver things
like that we've taken that all new
account as we were working on creator so
creators a drag and drop app builder
built really for both the designers and
programmers okay so this thing takes
care of all your routing for you for
view one so as you're linking buttons
together and things like that it's
dynamically creating the routes file in
the background for you it supports side
menu plus tabs which is normally a very
difficult concept we handle all of that
for you and it even supports views being
open in multiple tabs which in ionic v1
you can't really do but we kind of tried
to inherit that push pop bring it into
creator and support that in v1 so I
highly encourage even if you're a
developer to go ahead and check out
ionic v1 via creator make your app in
there it exports full ionic projects
that you can use locally for free we
still don't own anything this still this
does have a pro player
gives you a couple additional features
but completely free to check it out to
export your project anything like that
like we're not restricting any of the
components or anything so definitely
check that out if you guys like this is
seriously the easiest way to if you
haven't played with ionic yet check out
creator just to give it a play with it
where we have a mobile app you can view
it on your phone you know the whole
thing next thing I want to talk about is
our showcase you know another question
we get really often is okay ionic school
but like prove to me that a real app can
be made in ionic that is beautiful that
works really good proof to me that it
can be performing so we started the
ionic showcase where we have if have
apps likes work at chef step mall Z
where these beautiful beautiful apps
some of which I think one of these guys
was just on a shark tank right so like
these people are getting big they're
getting money they're doing very well
and these are all backed by ionic this
page like Scrolls forever if you guys
are making ionic apps and you want your
app on here as well you can submit it to
the store we normally look at that about
once a week and try to get you guys on
here as well now I don't like that was a
lot of stuff really fast a lot of
different pieces of our tool I don't
want to go through these three super
deep I playground it was kind of a
little experiment we did where you can
program in ionic app a single page
ionica on the side and have it update
automatically on the right for you think
of it like a very rudimentary like code
pen or something like that but for Anna
caps if you guys want to play around
playground is pretty sweet app camp is a
learning site for v1 so if you like
don't know angular at all and you just
kind of want to go there and learn
angular alongside ionic one and like
some of the crazy terms like directives
totally check out app camp we also have
jobs board so if you're using an attic
and you want to get a job using ionic we
have a full jobs board that you can
check out now everything I just
mentioned except for creator what's up
yeah yeah
ionic lab so attic lab is basically the
same thing as serving it from the
command line you know when you serve it
from the command line it'll bring you up
in a mobile sized picture where you're
playing that it's literally just that
but in lab that's a great question right
now I'm not sure I know that we've been
looking at kind of revamping lab and
giving it a little bit more love so that
could be something that happens soon it
is built literally an electron so it
shouldn't be too far off or do we
already support it we might already
support it I'd give it a check all right
get a whole get a hold of the team on
Twitter and we'll check it out so that
all except for creator everything I just
talked about was like free completely
part of the team creators got a free
plan I want to talk a little bit about
our platform just because the stuff
really is used to make your life easier
we have very small plans if you want to
get started right now it's in beta so
it's completely free for you guys to
check out we offer a lot of stuff in
this the first of which is the recently
launched an authentication which
literally lets you take your mobile app
and integrate with twitter facebook
linkedin like all this stuff i think we
even allow custom authentication if you
want to hook that up where this thing
remember state so if you open up your
Appetit logged in automatically like
that whole authentication layers
programmed for you who loves programming
authentication no one in the room no
hands should go up it's the worst it's
one of my least favorite things to make
we try to make it super easy on top of
authentication we also have push
notification support and both of those
things work together so push
notifications also not fun you have to
manage your device IDs what user
accounts are associated with you have to
integrate with multiple platforms all
the snap fun stuff ionic push has made
sure that we can do all of that we are
sending very very large number of push
through this platform every single day
it is built for enterprise usage this
thing is amazingly fast it works great
who here
uses a Windows machine but wants to
build an iOS app all right couple of
people you can't really do that so we
made ionic build which is a packaging
service that will allow you to send your
application to the cloud we send you
back an IPA or an APK file just through
your email that you can download that
and put it in the app stores so we try
to get you as close to the App Store as
possible no matter what platform you're
on you could still build in the cloud
and get those native files deploy is
great I dog food this for creator mobile
app where we use this to let me back up
HTML CSS and JavaScript I'll consider
assets by the Android and iOS platforms
as an asset you can dynamically change
assets on your phone without going
through the App Store process again so
normally you have to wait like two weeks
to get your app updated because we're
using HTML CSS and JavaScript and those
are considered assets Apple is okay with
us updating those on the fly it's never
really been an issue for Android but
Apple is very easy easy going on
updating those assets on the flooding so
we created a deploy service we're from
your local machine you can upload a new
version of your app okay and say deploy
this to all the phones that have my app
installed and I you those users will
instantly on their phone get a message
in your app without saying update to the
latest version click it automatically
everything updates because most of your
app is HTML CSS and JavaScript you can
change your features drastically add new
stuff all the time because you don't
have to wait for the app store anymore
major bug fix you can get out in an hour
which I've done before instead of
waiting two weeks for the Apple approval
process and it works in Android too so
you just don't have to resubmit so it
makes that super easy now this whole
thing has kind of been used you know a
lot of people still think is this
enterprise ready we've got a lot of
people already using ionic on an
enterprise level I can't necessarily
talk about specifically what they're
using it for you know we've got people
using this for a lot of internal apps oh
marketplace style app some inventory
management stuff but there are a lot of
big companies already using ionic
locally we've even got the Department of
Veterans Affairs up there and
harley-davidson and from Milwaukee on
top of that we also have man the color
around this is not good we also have
anak enterprise which comes with like
SLA support and all those things that
enterprise users want and love increased
support the ability for us to actually
look at your code if you need help with
your code and kind of get an right for
you all that's available in ionic
enterprise so if that's something that
your company would be more comfortable
with checking out hanak under an
enterprise environment that's something
that we do offer it also builds in
security to your local app and there's
lots of other cool stuff now this whole
thing is great but it wouldn't be
anything without the community that we
have available to a hack ionic has grown
rapidly since we launched in 2013 and
our community is massive I know there
was just last week and ionic Chicago
meet up that we that was thrown by local
community members that's something we
don't even have direct involvement with
our community has popped up like over a
hundred active meetup groups throughout
the world on top of that our forum in
like speaking not as an ionic employee
but just speaking as a developer now our
forum is ridiculously active compared to
other technologies that I tried to see
and use in the past like go on there
there's stuff from minutes ago I
guarantee it people are on there helping
each other out all the time so if you
have questions forms a great place to go
so what's going on is we work directly
with the angular core team on a weekly
basis so yet again that's part of our
kind of community involvement where we
have phone calls with the people who are
working on angular core to make sure
that their vision moving forward with
angular 2 or modifications to angular 1
really aligns with our vision of what
needed to change or what needs to happen
in the future so we literally are on
phone calls with them saying hey you
know we got the new beta release of
ionic or of angular 2 it works really
good but we wish this extra option was
here to make our push pop routing system
work a little bit better like we have
that kind of relationship with them and
it's very strong yeah yep yep we get
together and talk I know we flew out
there and literally had like half a day
in a conference room with their team
that they just set aside for us like we
have very close close relationship thing
to a team on top of that other community
stuff who uses like slack at work
anybody so we have a slack group that
literally anyone can join it's got over
6,000 people in it right now if you just
search ionic worldwide slack you will
find a link where you can invite
yourself to it and join that
automatically yet again there's a ton of
people in there hanging out all the time
willing to help everybody out and Mike
our developer advocate also hangs out in
there great place to ask questions and
socialize with people people post job
postings people critique other people's
designs there all the time really a
great especially if you're already using
slack for work like just throw another
slack group and I know I'm in like seven
of them so if you I know we talked about
a ton of stuff this is my favorite URL
to go to to find out everything about
ionic okay go to ionic dot io / discover
we just launched this page a little
while ago and it is literally just
little boxes with descriptions of
everything I just talked about okay
every ionic lab has its own link in
description the platform has its own
link description anything you want to
find go to an io / discover it'll be
there it's super easy to navigate that
way you're not kind of jumping back and
forth all of our documentation is only
through from there as well this
presentation is available at five calm
matt kramer / ionic dash super-powered
you can find me on twitter at matt
