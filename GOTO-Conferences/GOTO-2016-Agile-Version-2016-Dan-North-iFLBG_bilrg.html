bit of time thinking about where agile
is come on that journey so we are well
we're 15 years in agile being a thing
but we'll get to that let's first of all
let's let's start the beginning who here
was actually just quick show of hands
who's been in the IT or in technology
for less than 20 years right most of you
okay so for you guys
scrum has always existed there has never
been a time without scrum who was
writing code in the 90s
Wow another lot of hands fantastic okay
so 90s development looks a bit like this
we had big projects I mean big projects
multi-year projects typically tens of
millions of pounds or dollars hundreds
of millions of Crona was normal 8 2016 I
am still working with organizations that
have 10 million pound multi-year
projects so you know I'm trying to bring
them along it's it's all fun so large
large projects that was normal ok
multi-year projects was normal we had
people in deep functional silos so you
would have analysts would do analysis
and then if handoff the requirements
document to designers and architects and
they would create functional
specifications they would go off to the
another set of designers that would
create detailed functional
specifications they would go to
programmers and the programmers would
turn functional specs into code and
they'd dump the code on the testers and
the testers would go oh god code and
then they'd try and fixed or to tell you
what was wrong with the code and then
eventually we're going to write and that
happened ok and so there's lots of slow
fragmented technology we we take
languages for granted now mostly in the
90s you either have proprietary
languages or you had a million different
dialects of C++ c plus plus is a great
language you can change two lines of
code back in the 90s
and it would take you about half a day
to get a build so it only take like
maybe only 10 or 15 minutes to compile
but then linking took our
okay so is this big slow process so you
tended to work in bigger batches you'd
make more changes at once because the
cycle time the amount of time it took to
get feedback was really long and and
here's the thing we were in the 90s or
in fact probably even now largely
software development all the stuff that
we do is a relatively brand new sphere
so it's a question I asked a lot put
your hands up if you have a parent NIT
this makes me happy
I reckon probably about thirty or forty
hands went up then every year I asked
this question more hands go up okay I
asked this question ten years ago none
right we're basically making this up
we are in an entirely made-up profession
most of us have job titles that didn't
exist 20 years ago okay and and so what
happens when you don't when you're
making something up is you look for
metaphor you look for things you can
borrow and we borrowed civil engineering
we thought with civil engineering looks
respectable it looks quite rigorous and
quite sensible and so let's use civil
engineering as our metaphor for software
development so that's why we have roles
like architects that's why we talk about
software builds and and there's a whole
bunch of other things that we get from
civil engineering as well so civil
engineering I'm building a hospital I'm
building a road or something okay hmm so
what does that mean that means that the
cost of errors Rises exponentially in
fact probably steeper than exponentially
so if I'm designing a hospital and I
show you my picture here's my picture of
a hospital and then someone says hey but
the car park you've put it a long way
from the entrance to the accident and
emergency so where that where the
ambulance is going to go okay right so
let's just rub it out and put it over
there okay that makes more sense and so
we can lay it out because it's just
pencil on paper once I start if I've
mostly built the hospital and then
someone spots that the car parks in the
wrong place that's a really expensive
time to discover that and so what we do
is we have all these formal handoffs
okay so we make sure that we've done the
rigor we front-load
all the risk so we have a plan now and
that plan is very intolerant of slippage
John Gant invented a model with Gantt
chart and the Gantt chart is about
sequencing dependent stages so there's
no point having plasterers turn up when
there's no walls yet but also there's no
point having bricklayers turned up if
there's no bricks so I need to have the
materials arriving at the right point in
the schedule I need to have the people
arriving at the right point in the
schedule if I order too much material
that's waste if I order too little
material then I've got people standing
around idle and that's waste so I've got
my plan is very very I need to do a huge
amount of planning does this does this
sound familiar
this sound like what we do and so
because of this there's a huge amount of
assurance and rigor around the handoffs
handoffs is basically asked covering at
scale yeah so I'm going to make sure
that when I hand it off to you what I'm
doing is I'm saying right it's now your
problem thank you
I'm done yeah so what do we do in
software we look at this and and we
carry those assumptions we assume that
the cost of errors Rises exponentially
we assume that we need assurance through
formal handoffs and because of those
assumptions we end up with the same
intolerant plan and the same detailed
expensive handoffs and it turns out
those things are just an assumption so
this is the nineties this is we're doing
big project plans I was doing this big
project plans big rigor big upfront
design big upfront planning and then and
then a thing happened then a thing
happened this is that's that's Martin
there you can tell because he's standing
at the front pointing at things kind of
what he does know so this this chap here
this is Bob Martin so Bob Martin Uncle
Bob he he was he was just as frustrated
as everyone else and what had happened
was a whole bunch of his peers had
independently decided this was
ridiculous this was a very silly way to
write software and there must be better
ways to write software and so they all
independently spun up different ways of
writing software and gave them names so
there was crystal there was dsdm there
was adaptive there was feature driven
develop
FDD there was scrum there was extreme
programming they were the whole plethora
of these little methods that came up and
bulb sort of reached out to his network
and he said listen there's we've got a
lot more in common than we have
different we should all get together and
give it a name and so they did and and
as as Linda ricing has pointed out more
than once
it's a Council of middle-aged white guys
okay because we tend to have fairly
homogeneous networks and this is
something that I have become very
sensitized to over the years but at the
time so you've got a bunch of people
there including the guys who invented
scrum the guys who invented XP the guys
who invented so all of these different
things and they came together and they
said we should make a statement about
what it is we care about and so they
invented the thing they live rightly
drafted the agile manifesto and the
manifesto it's a set of values but more
than that it's a set of principles and
it has some really fab principles so it
says we value early and continuous
delivery of software that's really
important we value we welcome changing
requirements this was like anathema to
the 90s world like you're crazy this is
2001 February 2001 in a log cabin in a
place called Snowbird it's a ski resort
in Utah and basically spent the weekend
skiing and eating and drinking and
hanging out and did true story that did
this the year before as well but forgot
to do any work and then and then they
got together in in February 2001 and
went wait a minute we should have some
outfit this time and so yeah deliver
frequently and and all of these things
if you look at this thing and go like
well this is clearly obvious then it
means we're winning right because back
in the 90s or back in the early 2000s
this was completely countercultural
business and developers working together
was unheard of and this was a direct
threat to the power of the PMO right and
the power of the change board yeah it
was developers talking to relative pros
of like dogs and cats lying together
this is crazy this is the end of times
building projects around motivated
individuals and valuing face-to-face
communication
there's more working software as a
measure of progress self-organizing
teams technical excellent good design
simplicity right simplicity stands alone
sustainable pace for sponsors and bunch
of other people and regular reflection
and tuning we're not just going to slap
in a process and then just go we're
going to regularly we're going to
regularly reflect we're going to
retrospect okay and the point of all
this was to create a brand so the point
of all this was to create an umbrella
term to give a product a distinctive
identity so this is what branding is
about it that you notice a thing in the
80s there was a the coca cola wars so
Pepsi and Coca Cola were going head to
head and Pepsi did this it was a global
- it started in the US and it went
around the world they would put unmarked
cups in front of someone of Pepsi and
Cola it's called the Pepsi challenge and
and you could you do a blind taste test
of these things and universally people
will go yet Pepsi tastes nicer than Coke
because Pepsi tastes nicer than Coke
here's the thing it doesn't matter
because brand right the reason it
doesn't matter is on a hot day you walk
into a shop and you say I'll take a can
of coke because all that's in your head
is that visual of the red can with the
stripe down it with the little bead of
of water running down it that's all
you're thinking right I knew it and it
makes the noise and then you sit and you
go oh yeah everything about it is
branded yeah a saint of coca-cola
invented father Christmas that's how
good they are at branding okay so the
agile Brandon is all of this stuff but
then a thing happened the thing that
happened is certification the thing that
happened is a pyramid selling scheme one
of the most successful pyramid selling
schemes certainly in technology history
possibly in history boom the scrum brand
happened now and it's no fault of scrums
that they just had by far the best
marketing model okay it's the it's a
spectacularly successful Ponzi scheme
you you go and spend two days in a
residential class and you come away
master right or if you're a business
analyst you go away and spend two days
on a different residential class o
product owner yeah and suddenly
magically all of your habits and all of
your routines and everything you know
has changed
but you've got a piece of paper and your
boss likes pieces of paper right and so
we can roll everyone through it Andy
Hunt the pragmatic programmer calls its
sheepdip training just next one next one
next one and and it's not scrums fault
that they want okay they just have a
much better marketing machine and but
what is unusual is the things that they
value so scrum is a project management
method rather than a software delivery
method that's the thing they were trying
to wrangle they were trying to wrangle
certainty and they were trying to
wrangle assurance to middle management
and the way you do that is you you have
velocity and burn up and burn down and
and story points and backlogs and
features and all that stuff yeah and so
certain elements of them of the
manifesto got dropped and so then what
happens is this we've rolled forward now
15 years and we have this this this like
I just this is a screen grab from about
this time last year I'll take it about
capital one and who are on an agile
journey and apparently doing pretty well
and and I just see this phrase again
again the agile methodology we are the
agile method we're using the agile
method right anyone using anyone saying
they're using the agile method doesn't
understand the term agile as it's meant
right angela is a branding it's an
umbrella branding term for a whole class
of methods and so we have the agile
method but what's happened is now in the
20 times in our current decade okay
people like the message of agile they
like it it gives one nice warm fuzzies
assurance frequent delivery we like that
so smaller projects most of us these
days work on month multiple month
projects rather multiple year projects
it's unusual to be on a two or three
year who here is on a more than a
year-long project right now okay that's
probably about less than 20% of you
that's I mean it's still a depressingly
large number of hand
right and I feel for all of you and
anyone sitting next to someone who just
put their hand up give them a hug okay
that they need your love they need your
support but mostly we're doing smaller
projects that's just normal now we have
this thing called feature teams
cross-functional feature teams is kind
of normal now it's really unusual
apart from testing we could offshore
testing right because I don't know why
but apparently that's the thing so it's
a bit apart you know mostly we have
cross-functional feature teams it's only
it's unusual not to have analysts and
developers and all those guys all
sitting in the same group of people
hanging out doing work together however
certainly in a system of work where
cross-functional feature teams isn't the
right shape we find it doesn't work very
well I was working with a a large
American bank in the UK in London and in
New York and in London that rolled out
scrum and it was kind of going okay
about 150 people in New York about 250
people that rolled out to grow and it
was kind of a disaster and we didn't
really know why and the guys in the
state for beating themselves up and
their guys in London were going you
don't know what you're doing and and you
look at it and it was the kind of work
they were doing was completely at odds
with having cross-functional feature
teams okay there are assumptions buried
in cross-functional feature teams so if
you're if you're it's a landscape of
your work is largely homogeneous if it's
all enterprise Java business apps or
whatever then you can have a bunch of
generic enterprise Java business teams
that's fine if your work is massively
heterogeneous so you've got 25 different
completely different mainframe systems
each of which takes 10 years to get good
at understanding then chucking everyone
in a bag and making cross-functional
feature teams is simply not going to
work you need to do a different thing
incremental delivery that's what we're
doing we like to call-- we like to call
it iterative delivery but we very rarely
go back in iterate we very rarely go
back and change that code or change that
feature we're mostly adding new features
so oh I'll go with incremental delivery
so you know this this all looks pretty
good this all looks fairly agile except
the money we said I'm sold
money yeah we get upstream batching of
money and your budgets and then big
project budgets and then big project
budgets are signed off by stage gate one
stage gate two you know and and you need
to stand in front of a board and ask
them for money and then downstream we've
still got the the change board who has a
change board there's a change board that
you have to get things signed off
through not as many hands as I thought
who can just release stuff when they
want to so the rest of you just lied
then there's someone in between you and
production right so we downstream
batching of releases so I can't just I
finished something so let's push it into
production so there's a name for this
water scrum full okay so upstream we're
doing all the analysis and the
requirements downstream you've got all
the release stuff you can play scrum in
the middle if you want you can do what
you like just make sure it's already on
this date otherwise heads will roll okay
and so this is where at which kind of
leaves us with a bit of a challenge
which is where do we go next
do you like what I did here's that cloud
with a question mark I was very happy
with that where do we go next
well I think where we go next is this is
we go back and review the premise that
led to agile methods in the first place
all of these agile methods are you can
think of them as point solutions okay
XP is a point solution scrum is a point
solution crystal is a crystal slightly
different it's a family of methods but
mostly they're kind of a point solution
so what happened was people had these
these things they value basically lean
operations all the sort of principles of
lean operations you know trust the
people nearest the work federate
responsibilities all those kind of
things as toyota says we build people
and people build cars and let's
understand those lean principles and
apply those to our current context and
see what see what that method would look
like yes so if we're if we think that
scrum is on state-of-the-art things
scrum is 20 years old yes from is over
20 years old early 90s
so the first rule of lean operations is
you move the people to the work this is
different from most Western firms where
you move the work between the people
remember those silos also cannot earlier
on ok that's moving the work to the
people so the people sit there and the
work is moved around moving work around
is expensive moving work around takes
time and time is the thing we care about
okay well to reduce lead time so moving
the people to the work um
but remember that they're people so in
order to create a modern method the
first thing I would do is or the first
thing I do do is model the work what
kind of work are we trying to do without
understanding what work we're trying to
do we cannot have an opinion about what
shape the people should be around that
work but remember they are actually
human beings they have hopes and
aspirations and fears and people they
like working with and people they don't
like working with and kinds of work they
like doing and so one of the most
effective ways I've seen of moving
people to the work is asking people so I
just did a workshop last week with one
of my clients and we've got a bunch of
people in a room and we said this is
what the work looks like for the next
three months and they went oh no one's
ever told us that before and we said
right there's about 80 of you in this
room there's a whole bunch of works it's
probably more work than there is people
but let's solve for that as we go what
kinds of things I do you think you could
help with and be do you want to do I
think someone's asking me what I want to
do at work and they organize themselves
there was some you know kicking and
screaming and tears or whatever because
it's never easy but we ended up with a
bunch of people assembled around a bunch
of work that they had autonomy they had
chosen where they wanted to end up it
was a very exciting they then we went
for a drink
um build your own lightsaber okay
understand the principles that are
sitting here but then build your own
lightsaber but design your own process
there's not the agile process and
remember scrum is a point solution that
XP as a point solution all of these
things are useful buckets to dip into
for practices okay if you find the way
scrum does planning useful go use it if
you find the way XP has people working
in pairs go do that
I think people working in pairs is one
of the most powerful
learning and delivery models I've ever
come across in 25 years it's a very
exciting way to work
I don't know how deeply introvert people
feel about working in pairs because I'm
not a deeply introvert people the ones
I've asked are usually too polite to say
how they really feel and so again we
need to be sensitive to the fact that
human beings here bill Joan light saber
embrace what I call radical diversity
okay remember that Council of
middle-aged white guys
okay it's not Bob's fault that his
circle of friends was mostly look like
Bob okay because that's normal that's
just what we do and it's were actively
acting to counter that someone of my
speakers today Steve for she is
vehemently radically vocally Pro
diversity I am also very radically Pro
diversity jazz humble is Pro diversity
is not ironic that the three people are
named of middle-aged white guys but so
radical diversity is this is get people
into your organization who absolutely
think I don't think like you right who
you know don't think like you that thing
about hiring for culture fit that's
hiring for homogeneity that is hiring
for failure okay culture fit is here's
where we're at if you think you can
contribute something here and you think
you want to come and challenge some of
this I want you I want you here I want
cultural diversity I want racial
diversity I want gender diversity I want
people who think differently from me not
through some political correct thing
just because I think you get better
results like that you get a better
system of work and then my latest thing
the thing I've been carrying about for
the last probably three or four years
now what does a team look like at scale
right the fact that I can even start
puzzling about this is a massive
accolade to the agile movement right the
the stuff that these guys are trying to
solve they were trying to get any work
done in the 90s these methods have been
so successful that now I can start
thinking about you know these guys are
trying to get eight to ten people
pointing in the same direction
I can now think about getting eighty to
a hundred people facing the same
direction tony grout is getting 12,000
people facing in the same direction this
is completely insane right twenty years
ago we didn't even have
thinking tools to take that on so that's
pretty exciting
um measure business impact right so we
used to measure story points now we need
to now we can get things into production
fast enough that we can build ship and
measure and get real data so less is
more right so we want less software so
that means that developer productivity
isn't a thing we don't measure
productivity we've it's never been a
thing neither velocity okay these are
all internal vanity metrics embrace
continuous delivery what does that mean
two weeks is an illusion having a two
week planning window made sense when I
had a four or six month build when I can
spin up a thousand servers in the
morning right two weeks is a crazy talk
okay this is why my Douglas Adams
reference two weeks is an illusion month
two months doubly so outcomes create
options getting stuff into production
creates options okay that means that we
can start making decisions based on real
data and real feedback rather than
speculative crystal ball gazing and then
requirements emerge so that means that
now we want to look at rolling objects
rather than committee capex
so that means that we want to have
incremental venture funding rather than
big annual budgets and finally we want
to look at investment collaboration so
we want to collaborate with business
stakeholders about how and where we
spend money rather than simply providing
detailed estimate that we all know
allies into someone else's decision
process would you use a 1990s computer
now to get work done that would be a
silly thing to do so why would you use a
1990s method that's an equally silly
thing to do so here's our manifesto um
this is what I change you know so we
don't worry about software so much as
value okay software's a means to an end
remember this was written by roomful of
programmers after a weekend of skiing
and drinking okay these guys have very
software obsessed
that's what makes them good changing
requirements it's not just changing its
emerging requirements it's not that we
change our minds because we're fickle
it's that requirements emerge because
we're learning ok everything that used
to happen frequently or regular
now happens almost continually we can
get continual delivery business and
developers and everyone else is working
together right we're broadening the
spectrum now we don't have projects
projects are a way of batching money we
think now in terms of product and and
user capability working software is is
nice and all but I want business impact
I want to measure a dial moving in the
organization somewhere and sustainable
pace goes to all stakeholders it goes
downstream to the Machine room to the
operations and support guys it goes out
to the administrators it's not just the
users and team anymore and I believe
Linda ricing is going to be talking
about this today you know we've used to
have a periodic cycle of of
retrospectives every n weeks but this
about shifting your mindset to being a
continually reflecting mindset so we're
always looking around it's a Kaizen
mindset so for continual change but you
know what I think if it wasn't bad for a
first draft I think they've done ok
there so with that I'm going to wish you
a fantastic conference and enjoy the
rest of your two days thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
