dating sites and its really went to
introduce a little bit about neo4j the
the title of the talk was chosen by our
marketing department because they think
chicago is nothing but financial
companies just like an 80s people
thought you know Chicago is nothing
about gang violence and back into 30
there's nothing but gangsters not true
but that's the general idea so who i am
i'm maksim RZ i live in downtown Chicago
so I'm a local guy I blog about neo4j at
maximum RC com you can find me on
Twitter you can email me and there's my
github account I have really really
horrible memory so to make up for that I
blog about everything I learn and I put
it on github as well so there's like 200
github projects out there they're all
MIT license proof of concept demos
things you can do linear for J that I've
learned over the last few years and if
you're a mid-level or senior engineer
and you don't have a technical blog you
don't keep open source stuff and get up
I'm going to you know push you to try to
do that find a voice online and just
tell the world about what you learn
because for everything that you learn
today you know somebody is behind you
who hasn't learned it yet and could
benefit from your knowledge from your
experience from the fact that you read
the manual to some crazy tone and you've
learned something new there's tons of
juniors out there and even people you're
you know at your level that haven't
learned everything there's so many
different things to learn you really got
to get out there and blog more about it
but anyway let's continue so this talk
is about aliens I mean it's about graphs
right that's what we're going to learn
so if you really have an itching to go
to a different talk here's your chance
to otherwise to ignore one of my graphs
today so we think about graphs we think
about the fig the large five companies
out there that kind of we're running the
consumer web space right these are the
interest graphs of social graphs and
tenth graph the payment graph in the
mobile graph and we think about who are
these companies that own these graphs
they're the Google's the world apples
Facebook's you know wats up Twitter they
own oh they all own their own little
niche graph out there and the value is
not in the company the value is not in
the values in the graph you have to
recognize that that's that's what the
value is and once you have that graphic
it's bigger bigger more complex it's
harder to to enter that space and try to
beat them because they already own them
think about all the graphs out there and
who is entering those grouser who is
owning those graphs but today we're
going to talk about specific set of
graphs we're going to top of the five
graphs of love okay so the five we
picked out here are things like the
friends of friends graph and this is the
real world basis for how most people
flying dates right you ask your friends
hey do you know any single people that
you know might be compatible with me try
to hook me up or your friends just
randomly set you up on dates but these
things have weights as well you know how
the kind of person your best friend
chooses for you is very different from
your but your family chooses for you you
know your aunt wants you to marry some
nice young man over there your
girlfriend knows you very well and she
knows that the kind of guy you did isn't
the nice young man over there and some
of these graphs can be awesome so they
can be awkward we'll see a little more
about that but finding the right person
out there requires that you be
compatible right do you have shared
passions shared interests or that they
have things that you want traits that
you know you both want any other person
to have or you may just want them
individually to have and then there's
what you're looking for you're looking
for a long-term or short-term
relationship these are difficult of
passion graphs are out there and the
location long distance relationships are
pretty horrible they usually break down
so you want to find somebody local and
finding somebody look at where do you
find this single people where do you go
where should you meet to where should
you go date these is the location graph
of love well then you have the safety
graph we know someone anyone can beat
rate to be anyone online right that's
what's the old adage on the internet
nobody knows you're a dog right so
finding true identity of these people
and then the liars and the cheaters I
think I read somewhere that fifty
percent of people on tinder are already
in long-term relationships with other
people right which is pretty horrible
you do have some dating sites that are
specifically with cheaters like what's
called uh actually something something
on I don't go in that site so I wouldn't
know
but it's there believe me and then
privacy issues right so if you do know
about somebody maybe you think about
ditching your current partner and find
someone else you don't accidentally
match them on a dating profile that
would be really bad and we can awkward
it was like that margarita song all
right and then you have a spam graph you
know these are the people when you get
cooked baits and people are asking you
want to pay 20 bucks to watch them on
cam and you're like yeah no and then you
have the professionals which I don't
kind of spam all right so the five got
to love can then be broken down to this
friends graph passion graph a location
graph is safety graph and then our spam
graph that were gonna try to avoid so
let's take a little bit more we have
Jeremy here he's a dater he single he's
handsome he's friendly it's nothing like
me I'm he's looking for for a day so the
first thing he does is he goes out to
his friends and he says maybe I can date
some of my current friends alright and
he looks around for good website i can
do this for you and guess what somebody
built that right there's a bang good
friends I don't goes you guys remember
these guys they got in trouble a couple
of times one for the name from words
with friends I get sued by those guys
then Apple took them down because it has
some racy pictures on their site and it
was really meant to be pg-13 and
obviously it was just kind of crude so
they became down but still follow the
same idea which is get down and get a
date wait wait one of your friends but
you realize after about a hundred people
or so you run out of friends and that's
not a huge dating pool to go on right so
somebody noted that was a stupid idea
but been good friends are friends not
that that would be something all right
so all right let's go beyond yester
single line of friends and go to our
friends of friends now we're trying to
see a bit more of a graph right it's not
just a list of your friends but a list
of individually of their friends finding
the perfect date there but obviously
that's not enough you eventually run out
of friends of friends because you're
horrible person know you want state you
and you got to go deeper all right so
you get into the friends of friends
graph and so on and so forth until it in
the end you can possibly did everyone in
the planet one way shape or form
alright so this is either graphs friends
or friends are the simplest graph and
one of the graphs we start out with when
we introduce graph databases on this
query language of how things are
connected right in this case we have a
two users we have Dan and Ann and
they're going to be represented in our
system here as nodes and they're
connected to each other by a friends
relationship and so we have here a label
for type of node and name of Dan and
another label for a type of node person
with the name of an and this is kind of
how we we base everything out and that's
all we have in this graph database
systems and these graphs it's just know
it's in relationships there's no tables
there's no foreign key so nothing to
attach on these notes are kinda just
floating on air connected to each other
creating a structure of your system and
this query language cipher that we have
is what we hopefully will eventually
replace something like sequel it's the
languages meant to express the kind of
things we're looking at nowadays we're
not looking at your single tables and
rose the records of data we're looking
at hierarchies we're looking at how
things are connected and many things
down the line if you ever written
complex sequel query like this you know
it's horrible you know that one little
typo is a big mess and unlike the
developers who can put a semicolon at
the end of a line and say okay I
understand what that line of code does
when you're a sequel developer you have
to understand what the whole thing does
and it's horrible they have to get that
in out of your head as you go on I
suffered through like four years of
doing nothing but store procedure
optimization so I know what I'm talking
about it's horrible Wade cipher it kind
of comes out down a little bit you don't
have to worry so much about the joints
because they're done in those
relationships but when i put cipher on
the side for now we're going to keep
going let's look at the passion graph so
what passions is many things one of them
is interest so we have Jonathan over
here and he likes food he's a foodie he
likes interesting meals he's willing to
spend 400 bucks go eat you know some
crazy flavors he's never had before in
his life and he's looking for people who
shared those same interests so he's
looking for a date who is you know in
this case he's looking for a woman who
is also interested in food right and
this is the cypher career you would
write for that you'd say
the pattern in the graph where this
other dates that I'm calling a person
here is a node that has reported that
they like this interest which is called
Hootie and have a gender of female and
the graph the graph Cory will go out
there and match that pattern in the
graph and bring back a set of results
that you can possibly date easy enough
so likes and interests people are pretty
public about them this is the question
asks you know how many pages is an
average Facebook user like per country
and in the US were pretty open about
that kind of stuff I mean and I've seen
people who have thousands of likes
they're like anything and everything and
they're willing to tell you that they're
like anything and everything they're
pretty open you know people talk about
privacy this privacy that privacy is
dead you know it's unfortunately died a
long time ago when these social networks
came along I had a project called neo
graphs rich where I basically downloaded
a bunch of facebook data in lets you
query like Facebook Graph search and I
put it out there I put it online and I
said connect and give me your data and
I'm also gonna grab all your friends
data and guess what about had about a
million people's profiles in like two
weeks that goes even if you're super
private with your data your friends are
not your friends are horrible people and
they'll give your data to some random
person on the internet for nothing all
right so they can play with a demo and
that's what happened and then I put like
30 gigs worth of data in a week all
right so let's continue besides the
things that you like the things you're
interested in you also describe yourself
in certain ways and you describe your
potential mate to be certain way right
you're looking for someone who's modest
and respectful or spontaneous you know
ourselves warm or who's friendly all
those kind of things I think that either
you describe yourself as or someone else
can have but the traits don't go just
with just adjectives it could be
anything remember the graph doesn't care
what the node represents it could be
hates cats loves justin bieber or wait
the other way around right loves cats
it's justin bieber anything you want it
to be i could work as a trade with
eharmony you have like this preset list
of questions like 20 or 50 questions you
have to answer and they make some match
on that and say this is the perfect
match but that's we're more we have way
more dimensions than 50 questions
there's many more things that we care
about they're not in those 50 questions
the graph does
care all right and then location your
soul mate could be across the world and
that's too bad because you'll never date
them right most of the time you're stuck
with the soul mates that are around you
they may not be perfect but they'll be
close enough so here's a way to say
within a specific distance you know how
two kilometers 100 miles go find in
people who who match what I want in this
case is very simple it just wants all
women boom there it is not very
discriminatory so let's think about
Chicago and where we are how many of the
guys have been to three dots and a dash
a few people all right so if you haven't
been it's an interesting place it's a
little hidden what's neat about it is
foo foo drinks so all they serve is
these crazy drinks with like pineapples
and strawberries and and flowers in them
and they're like 50 bucks they're really
crazy and have like no alcohol
whatsoever but that attracts a certain
clientele so if you're a young man
single lookin for date that's where they
all went so i recommend that if you're
in that demographic I've been together
with somebody for 12 years so I never go
there but I'm just saying that's what to
do later tonight all right so location
matters right where to go where to find
people who are compatible with you so
let's let's go ahead and recommend some
love here we want to find soul mates in
the graph by a couple different things
when we want to find it afore you
energetic would like dogs so I've good
sense of humor who are tidy but not
crazy not not OCD types and then we want
to be in the same location that are
sexually compatible otherwise to be
weird and then more important they have
the traits that I want and want the
traits that i have right so we want to
be this to be a mutually beneficial
relationship not a one-sided love affair
so how do we do this with the graph oh
my god here's this crazy cipher query
but this 10 lines of code is a
recommendation engine this thin lines of
code is all you need to build a dating
site so let's kind of parse through it
together we start up here with a person
this is the person who is going to be
looking for love right here's max
looking for the he lives in a city and
we're looking for other people who live
in the same
it doesn't have to be a city it could be
a zip code it could be a state it's just
a location in general and I'm calling
things that I go along but they don't
have to be what's there and it's okay
well the other person has to have the
same orientation that I do right so
either we're both straight or we will
have the same gender that X star is
telling you it's either this or that but
not both at the same time so far so good
then I ask for things and say okay I
want that this person have a few things
so I want them to have to be on a tall
rich blonde supermodel and she wants me
to be fat bald nose neo4j so that is the
perfect match for me and her we're
pretty compatible so bring back the name
of the city and then I do this other
match because here I'm looking to have
just one single trick at least I have
one thing compatible with them the next
one says give y'all give me all of it
and notice me over here and me all the
way at the end it's a circle right it's
a pattern you're going out to things
that I want these are attributes that
this person has and the requirements
that they want me to have as well so
it's a complex connection there and then
I'm going to bring them all back collect
the names of the attributes in the
requirements and then order them by the
number of things that we match in common
the reason I do this is because I want
to build a UI that looks like this all
right here's louvenia she lives in
Philadelphia and she matched these four
people Chad McKinley gene and Keith on a
bunch of different scores these random
adjectives but it could be anything it
doesn't matter what it is and so she
should probably go out with chetan
Philadelphian and hopefully have a happy
life so this is great and this is what
dating site should do there's only one
small problem with this algorithm and
with this dating site right what happens
after you find your soulmate you never
go back to that dating site again all
right I built one of these for a job
board and I said I can find the perfect
candidate for a position and the perfect
position for a candidate and they told
me that's fantastic get out because what
they want is the highest number of
applicants to any particular job because
they get paid by volume not by finding
the perfect match yeah so
what makes sense to us may not make
sense for the business so keep that in
mind when you build these systems the
perfect engineering solution may not be
the worst business solution you come up
with a similar idea here all right then
safety so we found the perfect match
this person looks great but let's learn
a little bit more about them right
what's wrong with this type of graph we
have Jennifer she works for Jake so Jake
is team lead and Jennifer's on the team
member jake has a friend Peter and then
Peters friend andreas she doesn't want
to date her boss you don't want to
what's a work what you eat that's a
bad idea and peter is too closely Jake
for comfort she doesn't want to date
Peter either but andreas is a friend of
a friend of a friend that's good enough
I mean that's the minimum they're quite
a distance for an offhand type
relationship we're gonna have to worry
about HR or anything like that so you
want to be able to say exclude all those
people who are already family or already
co-workers or have some other kind of
professional relationship with you maybe
they want to date anyone who's been UX
before or maybe an ex of your friend
because that gets weird sometimes ooh so
you have to know more than just the
specific traits about somebody all right
and then we have Liars right how many
people lie on the resume liars all right
exactly everyone lies on the resume
everyone linkedin profile is full of
 that's the bottom line right you
have to be what they think you are and
then you'll figure out later you learn
it on the job no big deal all right so
we have to deal with these people right
so here's Jake again he's still like
Jennifer but he's married to Lucy all
right he's a cheater and we don't want
anything to do with him so Jennifer
rather date someone like andreas who is
a friend of losing instead nothing
connected to see Jake there so you get a
figure out who these people are how
they're really connected and exclude the
ones we don't really want all right
let's say goes it look Jonathan we
looked at him earlier and then he said
okay you know what I'm going to give you
my social network profile and give you
my Twitter camera linkedin my facebook
so i can log in easy right that's the
value i get i can log in to your site
easier now look at the value we're going
to get from this ok who do you follow
what are you real interests
and we see drug lord the high life
cocaine so white you know so based on
the I mean why would you follow a drug
dealer online is beyond me but assuming
that you do and it's not even like weed
it's like coke and meth assuming that
you do and you're insane plus your
retard let's find out information right
and then we look at the presence of
tweets you know and he's talking about
Walter White and the huge fan of making
drugs this is probably a fake count
somebody made but still hilarious right
you know if you met a drug dealer last
weekend he was awesome buddies Griffin
was a nice lady as well okay this guy
isn't that job but we can do is we can
extract information evidence so you know
what you've demonstrated an interest in
hardcore drugs so we're going to add
that to your profile you know you didn't
tell us that we're going to add it to
your profile because somebody out there
may say you know what I totally want a
druggie boyfriend there you go although
more likely they probably don't want a
druggie boyfriend so they would exclude
you from from a lot of the dating pool
that it's out there but it's not just
this as many other things right maybe
your political inclinations are way that
you wouldn't talk about it but not
something you want or your some of these
other alternative dating sites well
you're not really telling us about
yourself when you're lying about who you
are you know sometimes all those
beautiful women online i really like 45
real dudes in their underwear right who
just want to chat that's cool and all
but it that's not what you're into then
you don't want to want to exclude those
people out from your potential matches
all right well then we have the spam
graph this is the best graph because
it's everywhere so you click on
someone's profile you seem to be talking
everything's good and they go hey by the
way I'm a singer-songwriter check it
check me out and load listen to this
song that I wrote and then you click on
it and it some frigging pop up to buy
their album you know or download
something from Spotify or whatever it is
and they're basically just BOTS selling
you music so you want to get rid of all
of those you also want to get rid of the
cam girls and boys right oh hi nice to
meet you you want to see me online it's
going to cost you twenty bucks an hour
to watch me on video right those are
always kind of creepy unless you're into
that you know like the point that in my
guy just been chatting online with babes
all day
and then you have the worst kind of spam
which is the professionals I found this
article to be hilarious anybody here
from California know why present well
this is a reason for that because it
sucks over there it's so expensive even
the prostitute can't live there which is
pretty insane so you want to get rid of
all those people from the dating pool
because they're useless where they just
clicked in my from it alright so that's
the dating world and some of the
dangerous and some of spam some of the
things that are out there now let's look
at finance a little bit more what do we
have in finance no more serious here so
we have this payment graph the payment
GAF can cause of a lot of things
including fraud you know risk analysis
chargebacks things like that we have the
consumer customer graph who are these
people how are they connected you know
who do they work for who are these
companies subsidiaries of and so on and
so forth and also mobile things you know
you have acid graphs looking at
analytics in your portfolio risk
management there as well how tightly are
you into one sector or another depends
on different assets some of you may not
even know unless you do individual level
asset management and then market and
sentiment analysis as well what's the
market doing what they telling you and
compliance although so they asked the
graphs are out there on the entitlement
side identity management you have a
brand new trader where does he have
access to trade how big can his
positions be what is he allowed to do
what systems allowed to touch what
research is he allowed to know about you
know he can't know about what other team
is doing because they're selling the
product he's buying the product and
they're supposed to be separated by a
wall I know those kind of access manage
and authorization damn things and then
you have master data management you know
where is this data come from what does
it all mean you know what's a hierarchy
look like what does governess look you
know what is it golden record with our
data and kind of keeping that in track
and make sure it all make sense so let's
drill in a little bit more the Five Guys
finance right payment customers
entitlements assets and master data now
these are all made up there's more than
these fibrous and they're a little bit
different depending on how you look at
it the idea here is to look at the data
you have think about the things you're
working with and sort of see the graphs
in your data so payment graph start with
that so look at into it all right you
have a payment a payment is from one
entity to another entity simple
transaction I pay you for a good or
service but we know something about
these entities we know uniquely who they
are is a person is a company what is it
how much do we transact what kind of
volume do we have is in each other are
we buying just one thing once a year are
we buying something once a month once a
week once a day what are we doing I'm a
big of our volume is are we doing with
you know why do we want this thing's why
do we want to know this graph of
payments because we can extract
information of it we can predict some
things out of it we can look and say
this business is earning this or the
growth curve looks like that or this
particular consumer of set of consumers
of cluster of consumers it tends to act
in this certain way or not act in the
certain way and saying that looks like a
fraudulent transaction because this type
of consumer would not buy that
big-screen TV after the Super Bowl
that'd be stupid so trying to figure
those things out you know and we talking
about a fascist of a fascist of a
consumer you know not only their
identity like who they are but also what
we know about them based on social
network profiles to demographics and
demographics are tricky because you have
you know this 50 levels or so that you
can get but the reality is you can go
really deep on demographics you can do a
specifically how somebody else and no
two people are like everyone's very
unique snowflake understanding that and
getting that out is important and on the
business side as well oh you know
there's a couple of graphs out there you
don't think about that it's a small
business graph like think about groupon
they're here I want to exhibitor booths
owning that graph is very critical the
restaurant graph you like OpenTable and
understanding done looking into that the
the foodie diners graph and owning that
graph how valuable is that the sports
bar graph what bars do you go to to
follow your favorite team as you travel
around the country selling stuff you
know all those kind of things and
capturing these consumer to business and
also business-to-business transactions
like one of the big banks that's one of
our customers what they do is is the
risk analysis on these kind of
business-to-business transactions and
they see well for the longest time
you've interact with this business and
their major consumer of yours but then
recently they started buying from your
suppliers all right so I want to look at
you individual
I'm going to look at your ecosystem and
the whole graph around you and seeing
how that supply of any relationship
works out because the time you go ask
for a big commercial loan is when you're
in trouble right or before you get in
trouble rather hopefully if you're smart
so banks are wary of those kind of
things here's another payment graphic
example and the idea is you don't want
to capture every single transaction
that's horrible instead what you want to
do is roll them up you say these two
companies transact with each other 25
times this month the volume was 3
million dollars that represents you know
a tight relationship or a loose
relationship or some kind of distinction
that you have and then you do analysis
on that individual transaction records
there's too many of them think about the
number of credit card charges per day in
the US this is a huge number that stuff
goes to Hadoop and then you extract a
smaller graph out of that you put that
in neon you do analysis on that all
right and then here's another payment
graph example of everything from a
fraudulent cardholder going on the way
back out to the verifier but we'll skip
this slide it's kind of boring let's
continue on to the consumer graph the
customer graph rather corporations
they're all customers of each other they
all belong to each other in some way
shape or form they're also belonged to
industries and sub industries and it's
all just kind of connected it's all very
graph related and hierarchy is a graph
think about who your boss is really as
well that you report to someone you may
have a project manager report to you
have your your 20 different ways kind of
to go to the top or to get permissions
for things it's not really a hierarchy
anymore not even in the traditional
sense and companies are the same way
there are many many ties together being
able to understand all that and then
also kind of putting them together right
metadata management and just 360-degree
view of your customer one of our retail
customers is doing this 360 view what
they want to do at the end of the year
it's two weeks before Christmas you're a
thirty-five-year-old male single you
have no kids you have this family and
you gotta buy them all presents so this
is horrific right you got to go out
there and go to walmart or go to these
stores and try to figure out what to buy
for your uncle
your knees when you have no idea what if
they had all your data what if you was a
site and said based on all your family
the ones you usually buy gifts too we
know that you're 12 units will like
these pair of black boots she wouldn't
like anything pink in ponies she wants
his black booth because she's into goth
and her size is eight whatever all right
and you do this for everyone and you
have a long list of 20 people and at the
bottom you have this Buy button a
thousand dollars right you hit the buy
button it buys all other gifts ship so
to all of them you've done your shopping
in one click right that's the dream that
they're pursuing and laziness especially
for people who have money all right
fantastic and then the social stigma
what do I buy my you know my cousin or
my niece I'm like what do you buy a
seven-year-old girl I have no idea but
target does or I'm sorry I bullseye
dicom des right they'll figure it out
alright continue on me forget myself
into more trouble alright synthetic
identities in fraud here's another part
right and that is you have a fake phone
number or fake address and you build up
these fake people over time you hadn't
heard about this was a couple years ago
I think we're over a long period of time
I think was like six or nine months
these guys came in and built these fake
identities they open the counts on the a
deterrent acted like real people they
would take out loans they would pay him
back to use credit cards and so it looks
like real human beings and then one day
they all max out the credit cards so get
a whole bunch of cash and then there
were no heard from again it was like a
10,000 accountants or something like
that so they walked away with like 250
million some crazy amount of money all
in one day gone right but if they had
done graph analysis they would realize
you know what penalties people live in
the same place and another 10 have the
same phone number you know and they all
have all these little tips information
didn't make sense was there we could
have known that but now they didn't
again they didn't dig into the data that
you saw individual transactions and they
were playing individual buyers
individual selves holy payback you know
his his credibility month he's a perfect
consumer now resolve it's all lies yeah
so you can just keep going right
exponentially one new fake address that
gets validated by the system when you
fake phone number like is validated by a
system it increases them or fake
personas you have buy tons and tons
I think it was almost two years now this
company came to us and said okay look we
we process transactions for this gaming
thing and we get a lot of fraud so one
of the biggest problems we have is they
get a transaction we have an IP address
a customer count a criticar number and
amount the things are buying and we get
you know thousands of these a second and
sometimes fraudulent but we catch it a
second later we just lost a thousand
transactions I thought things went
through so what can we do and they had
this grid their actual vendor here of 10
machines out there it was processing
these systems as they went along and
trying to prevent the fire from
happening so they came to us and said
what can you do well we said well this
is a graph so i can connect every single
credit card has ever been used by an IP
address for an email address or a
consumer account together and i can
query those really quickly i can figure
out if they're not supposed to be there
right so if a single credit card gets
used by six accounts it's probably a bad
idea if a single IP address gives you 50
credit cards probably a bad idea
something is happening there you may
want to look into that so we were
managed to get there I thought the
requests per second on a single laptop
but they were not satisfied they said
well that's great but we already do that
with this grid system we don't really
need to buy you guys to do this kind of
thing so the challenge is brought down
and said okay no worries we can actually
make it go faster because the pain point
there was how we were interfacing with
you for did not the actual relationships
and the traversals themselves we got
them to eight thousand requests per
second taking the code and putting it
behind a high-speed java web server and
they were still not satisfied they were
still not happy so then we said okay
fine let's switch the WebSocket since
then and now we're doing twenty eight
thousand requests per second on web
sites because all we're doing is
following relationships and
relationships in a graph database are
basically following pointers in memory
how fast can your CPU follow a pointer
and memory very very fast so we have
this problem may be doing real-time
fraud detection and you need to stop a
thousand bad transactions from happening
in the first six milliseconds that's
something we can help you do
something to think about they're all
right let's switch on to entitle my
graph so identity management is how most
of the times this isn't represented like
hierarchies you belong to a group the
law degree belongs to another group and
it's all tonight little need hierarchy
but it never works out the way and this
is a wonderful talk Ian glazier here
talking about entity manage if you deal
with that space so if you have to deal
with identities in your system all right
18 minutes of your life you will get
back and basically the answer comes out
to hire keys don't work you really have
to switch to some kind of graph based
system I'll give you another idea
another place where higher keys don't
work and that is insurance if you have
thousands of sales people who are your
insurance salespeople they're not
employees with their contractors they
move around they sell different products
different promotions they switch from
one company to the next keeping track of
that in a hierarchy and oracle database
is def now this company came to us from
the insurance one instead we're losing
millions of dollars in over paying
commissions they're not under paying
because if they're under pain obviously
the sales got to come in and beat them
over the head with it they were over
paying millions of dollars a month why
because they had a bad system
hierarchies don't work so they're
ripping that out putting it all into a
graph where it makes more sense and they
actually do better nonsense a little
money now the sales people are going to
be pissed but you know the company will
be happy so that's what counts all right
and then access control so this is a
simple way to think about security is a
graph right people's groups memberships
security flags all of those things that
graph if you have this type of issue
this type of domain that you deal with
any causes pain you know I graph is the
right place to put it and kind of get
your answer that way and as an example
blog posts on permission resolution on
how to do it with you for jay is fairly
easy something to go through that but if
you want more information but beyond the
link when the slides that it's say
alright acid grass so portfolio
analytics you know what are those
mortgage-backed securities made out of
what are the underlying assets all the
way at the bottom of these things and
how can we do analysis on this a lot of
these pricing a lot of these products
get price once day once a week once a
month what do we do at real time you
know how would that change things what
can what kind of arbitrage can you get
out of there
also acid mansion on the IT settings if
you have a physical networks all the big
trading firms you know networks are
critical and servers and speeds and
configurations in all this need to work
together need to work fast being able to
manage that and seeing what happens if I
pulled this switch what happens if I
change its configuration what happens if
the server goes now all the things you
need to know and the physical Network
Maps really well to a network in the
graph and then risk analysis kind of
went over a little bit that is how do
you annoy us risk along the path not
just individually not just at the sub
level but overall the whole system what
could possibly happen and isn't tricks
they're all the things like supply chain
risks this is one of the interesting use
cases out there they're trying to take
supply chains and actually make products
out of them so you'll be able to buy and
sell insurance on supply chains so if
something goes down you have an
earthquake in Malaysia and you can buy
hard drives anymore or yeah China
decides not to share some of their rare
earth materials anymore how does that
affect your pipeline how does that
affect companies and what can you do to
arbitrage ursell dat so here's a cyber
query to do something like this right
for a specific fine fund find all the
assets that belong to that fund gave me
all the list I don't care how many steps
you have to go I don't care how deep you
have to find this item in the graph go
ahead and bring that all back to me and
then let me do some analysis on there
when you have these deeply nested
relationships these deeply nested asses
or surpasses all the way down the graph
can find them for you it doesn't really
carry we have funds of funds of funds
you work in the hedge fund industry and
you're dealing with those kind of things
get down to the individual assets see
what your risk profile really looks like
down at that level not at the made-up
level higher up and always see the
signal query for this is horrific with
them to commend anyone trying to do that
either all right and then master data so
research right where'd you get your
information for what are these things
mean how they all connect it together
how can you put them in a single place
and make sense of it all how do you
reconcile it different information
somebody telling you to buy it somebody
telling you to sell what do they really
mean what are they really talking about
how do you connect it all together and
you have things like this right who
remembers this from a few years ago
where they said Obama had been blowing
up in an explorer
somewhere and it caused like a little
mini crash for like a few seconds here
people thought it was real people that
was true right anyone can get on Twitter
and say anything that anything can be
retweeted any number of times all right
and it could be a complete lie and
they'll find it in a minute but in that
minute how much money did you lose or
what happened remember this this is a
little bit closer to home model w right
I'm most talking about then you think he
was building and as a joke or in April
first he said it's going to be like a
like a watch but really it's a new
battery pack thing you know forth a
couple of minutes there you know stock
went through the roof as well and they
came back down now see other kind of
understand information in context if
they prefer first ignore all the
information and this should have but you
know sometime the data fees will say
ignore this because there's a neighbor
fool joke the tutor stuff won't all
right you know they don't have that
context built in and then linked data
take that information you get and find
out what it really means in the bigger
picture maybe you don't know anything
about Pharma but if somebody comes out
with a research paper to tell you
something important how does that
translate what does that look like what
have they really discovered
understanding that information is kind
of critical and you have all these
sources out there make sure and it's all
just a graph of how things are connected
alright so those are the five graphs of
Finance you know and we recommend
obviously using something like me using
a graph database to manage these parts
of your infrastructure the reason why
I'm going to skip this it's like I'm
running out of time here okay I'll do
this one all right so graphs are really
good for a lot of things one of the
things we get used for a lot is
recommendations kind of like an opera
the research so I'm going to take you to
this quick story you have toy story if
you just watch this great movie where do
you watch next simple recommendation
engine so you'll tell you okay you watch
toy story the next thing you should
watch is a bug's life okay and then
after you watch a bug's life what's the
next thing you should watch well if you
go kind of by this maybe you should
watch human centipede
which is probably a bad idea for little
kids to watch I haven't seen it
necessary it is so we don't want to do
that instead we want to do some
filtering to our recommendations we want
to add something like john r us to a
recommendation say okay take a look at
this movie see how people have rated
this movie and see they liked it give it
a high rating see all the people that
had also liked this moving give it a
higher rating and find out what else
they have liked that I haven't seen yet
that has the same genre right so we want
to stick with kid-friendly movies not
the human centipede that's a data model
it's really really simple we're going to
build a recombination and yet based on
this if you can think of your data as a
graph you can do these kind of neat
things so you have people you have
movies they're connected to each other
by ratings by people who watch them
let's build something all right so
here's my top 25 movie recommendation
quick this is basically a netflix clone
combination engine in six lines of
cipher query and they're all color-coded
but it's kind of hard to see so we
looked at a toy story and we said okay I
want to find people who like Toy Story
who have watched other movies and given
us all the movies high ratings so they
like toy story and they gave another
movie high rating greater than 7 and I
want this other movie to have this same
genre as I do does the movie that I do
the watch-whers toy story and then I
want to make sure that I have not seen
that movie so I have a knot relationship
i say i want to make sure that i have
not rated or washed this unseen movie
and that's important because the graph
can tell you what's there and what's not
there really quickly versus in sequel or
some of these other no single store
finding out what's not there is very
very painful to do russ and a big deal
just chase them all and it's down there
it's not there anymore and then at the
end you say ok find the top 25 order
them by it just any order and bring back
to me and that's it all right there's no
magic there's no crazy matrix there's no
weird math you have to do it's a simple
query and you get your answer back
fairly quickly which is kind of nice and
people get blown away about how easy it
is to build recommendation engines on
graphs and not just that but a lot more
other things as well all right so why do
we do this why do we use this graph
and that is because relational databases
even though they are named relational
suck at handling relationships they have
these foreign keys going everywhere and
you have to follow find them in an
indexing try to find the answer and it
gets worse and worse and worse asked
your data gets bigger right you have
performance degradation every time your
table gets very joint he escaped echo
the number of joint tables increases it
all just sucks and that's where they
know single movement came around but
there's a divergence in the no seeker
moment what they realize was okay you
know what this is not do joins at all
let's just go build column family so
this is the documents where everything
is together we don't have to join
anything and graph databases they went
the other way and say no you know what
we're going to save those joints to desk
we're going to take those relationships
and make them first-class citizens in a
data model and then we can query on them
real time that's the difference between
the two right these no sequel databases
say okay I'm a key value store okay
that's fantastic how do i connect this
key value to that key by you I don't
know you have to figure out you know oh
I'm a document store ok I have these
things that build up a document
connected but how do i connect this
document to the other deck you know
whether my own good luck with that as
well in the column families or like I
don't even deal with relationships we
have these column things and that's all
we care about we could finaid some
things but not good for others with the
graphs we build this relationship right
we have this thing here that next pieces
of data together nobody else does and
that's really the secret that will trick
to the whole thing there's no joining
logic needed because it's all saved down
to disk say down to memory and obviously
you have to be acid right you saw the
jepson talk earlier he's trashing these
eventually consistent stores why because
you can lose data you can do tunks of it
in in a graph that you can't play
eventually consistent you can't even
play these half acid have not stuff
because you cannot have relationships
going off to know where you cannot cut
here and say well I got half a
relationship and the other one half goes
nowhere unfortunately you can so instead
what we do is we give you full a secure
and see them we say everything's going
to work on this single box and
everything's going to be happy here we
don't distribute your graph or multiple
boxes we don't run into the same
problems without you instead we ask you
to do one thing that is buy more ram
as you database gets bigger that would
dissolve graph problems is to buy more
ram and make your life a lot easier and
the will thing you get back by doing
this is performance right neo4j doesn't
care how big your data set is assuming
it's in memory doesn't care how big the
joint tables are how many of them you
get that's relevant to us all we care
about is how many relationships do we
have to traverse to get the right answer
that's all that matters and a single
core can do about 2 million traversals
per second so we have the 32 core system
you know you're doing 64 million joules
per second it's going to be very very
fast to traverse most answers and most
queries really take between 10,000 and
100,000 out relationships to get your
answer how many friends you have 10 100
how many friends are friends you have
maybe 10,000 that's it it's really
easily cost you maybe 10 milliseconds to
get the answering clean you want from
there and that's really the whole little
trick to it all we care about is the
number of hops you have to make to get
your answer not the big the size of data
set so the takeaway is to reimagine your
data as a graph look into the sims
systems you're dealing with and think of
him in a different way I was at this
airline company last week we're going to
call them unamerican and on American
Airlines has this 15 year old flight
scheduling system they built and see it
worked great for they couldn't have and
now the data is kind of big they want to
connect it to other things and they're
having issues things are breaking down
and 15 years ago people didn't believe
in unit tests imagine that so it's like
15 thousand million lines of c code with
no unit tests anywhere they change one
thing it breaks half the crap they're
having problems so unamerican camp
doesn't say listen we realize this is a
graph problem we want to rebuild our
scheduling engine in this way and that's
what I spent last week doing and not
sleeping I getting them started on this
proof-of-concept on how to build a
scheduling engine so if you think about
data you have you're dealing with these
tumors you're dealing with medicine you
dealing with drug interactions dealing
with payments you're dealing with acids
and how they relate you know find the
graph there find their relationship
there and save now to this may
them real make them first-class citizens
and then you can do all cuz I need stuff
without data that's it thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
