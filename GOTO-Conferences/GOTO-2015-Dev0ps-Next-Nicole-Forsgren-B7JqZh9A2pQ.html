talking about DevOps and kind of what
we're seeing coming up next so someone
asked me to kind of give you know what
what this means coming out of lean so
I'm not going to give an overview of
DevOps and Lane but why should we care
so basically a couple what some
subtitles could be is what this means
for our bottom line or another alternate
title is I tell can suck it that was
awesome penguins on this morning so here
we go and hopefully this is not ignite
style let's see what happens so so for
years we've all been investing in IT
think it's going to affect the bottom
line by the way it doesn't like ever so
for 40 or 50 years all these investments
in IT have never impacted the bottom
line like ever we've like had this
adorable pipe dream that it's going to
and it just doesn't and years and years
or decades of research it it hasn't
affected the bottom line if it has it
maybe did but after years so for the
first time we're starting to see these
hit the bottom line but only if we can
combine it with this full transformation
this full reengineering shift that is a
company with a cultural transformation
re-engineering transformation a practice
and process transformation that now
we're calling DevOps or a lot of people
are calling DevOps it has to be end to
end it has to include everything that's
the only way it's starting to hit but
now the data is showing it it's showing
it over and over and it's really really
exciting and this is what the lean
transformation is promising to IT
and why is this the case it's because
any other company so any company could
go buy a server throat in the closet
give it really pretty up lighting but
any other company could buy the same
server or competitor server and throw in
a central closet or any other company
could do something similarly difficult
you know you could buy an ERP system you
could develop a really difficult product
but it wasn't going to contribute to the
bottom line and why was this it's
because it wasn't going to get you an
advantage or at least not a competitive
advantage and if it was a competitive
advantage it was not going to be what we
call a sustainable competitive advantage
it was going to be a point of parity it
would help you keep up it would never be
a point of distinction it wasn't going
to help you get ahead DevOps has changed
that it looks very very much like the
Lena Toyota transformation that we saw
in manufacturing a lot like Dan pointed
out we move the people to the work the
work needs to become smaller we need to
be able to make these changes quickly
fast move it into production see that
business impact so that we can make
changes quickly this is what we mean
when we say that it has this massive
reengineering shift this is why we can
finally see these changes to maximize
the efficiency to cut costs to make this
impact on the bottom line so DevOps is
good for IT performance and this IT
performance translates finally into
organizational outcomes and this is huge
so for years aighty has been seen as a
cost center and by the way that's not
like a bad thing but it's it hasn't
really been a competitive advantage and
now it finally is
these are our glory days ago by the way
like holler for the people with American
accent and I dropped the l ok so that
was then so this all started in the late
like Ott's John all spon Paul Hammond
Devon ops cooperation at flickr so they
talked about doing ten deploys per day
and people in the audience at velocity
kind of lose like lost their minds some
people thought this was revolutionary
and amazing other people thought this
was like the most horrid thing you could
possibly do to your ops team and so
people who are in the audience just
remember it people who weren't in the
audience like ripples went out some
people thought they were full of it and
there's no way it was real and then you
know some people are familiar with these
stats that I think which come out of
2013 these are amazon stats these are
production in host environments only
okay just over a thousand max deploys in
a thing single hour this is the deploy
every 11 and a half seconds
approximately 10,000 hosts receiving
deploys on average maximum number of
hosts receiving deploys is 30,000 okay
now check this out now keep in mind this
is these are companies that have like
they're doing the DevOps they've seen
the way the truth of the length they
have undergone the entire DevOps
transformation now this is etsy Mike
Britain gave a talk called continuous
deployment the dirty details in 2013 he
reported etsy code deployment what's
required 6 to 14 hours and what they
called their deployment army now took 15
minutes in one person he was reporting
30 deploys per day 50 deploys per day
March 2014 he reported q con here in
London
between March 2014 and april 2014 at
chef comp etsy was then reporting eighty
to ninety two plays per day so the
researchers who worked on the state of
DevOps report for 2015 when these
numbers were all put together they
wondered is there a way to break the
mythical man month if you have
completely undergone the DevOps
transformation what happens so an
analysis was run deploys per day per
developer if you have completely
undergone the DevOps transformation so
this this analysis only looked at
companies or organizations and teams
that have completely undergone the
DevOps transformation they're doing at
least I believe daily deploys look what
happens so low performers medium to
performers high performers if you look
at high performers as they decrease the
number of developers this looks a lot
like Etsy's deployment once you have
your DevOps framework and infrastructure
and practices in place you can increase
the number of developers and increase
the number of delivery and deployments
that you have in place research suggests
that the transformation is worth it
you'll have some growing pains but guess
what
you can see these increases if you're
first starting this journey this is
going to be painful if you're halfway
along this journey you're not really
going to see it but once you're along
the way things will be good okay so we
know that DevOps is good for IT so I was
lead investigator on the 2014 state of
Devil's report there's lots of peer
review happening with that data right
now so we looked at measuring DevOps an
IT performance the way we proxied IT
performance here we looked at deploy
frequency again this wasn't delivery
right we want to be able to deliver push
code whenever it makes sense for the
business so we looked at deploy
frequency mean time to recover and lead
time for changes so high performing dev
ops teams have more throughput so by the
way this is where I choke and sucking
ITIL suggest that you should always
balance throughput and stability the way
that you balance throughput and
stability as you sacrifice throughput in
order to get stability the analysis that
i'm working on peer review right now
I've controlled for the data several
several different ways shows that
throughput instability move in tandem
consistently all of the time low IT
performers their throughput instability
move together if you're not doing them
well they will both be low medium
performers they are always medium and
they always move together high
performers throughput instability always
move together and they move at the
highest levels all of these things are
statistically significant and they
always move together there is no such
thing as a trade off as soon as you move
one down the other moves down with it
that's what I mean when I say like the
trade-offs just don't work ok so the
highest performing dev ops teams when I
compare my high performers and my low
performers we get more throughput high
compared to low we see 30 times more
frequent deployments in both your 2015
and 2014 and 200 times faster lead times
on their peers 2015 and 2014 both
now we also see more stability again
these move in tandem interesting thing
2015 versus 2014-2015 we see 60 times
more change success rate and faster mttr
168 times it's looking like companies
are maximizing stability just a little
bit mostly because once they get their
throughput optimized they don't
necessarily need to deploy every five
seconds when they can already deploy
every hour they can they just don't have
to they're making those decisions based
on business needs and business cases ok
DevOps promises and delivers more
throughput and more stability in tandem
without the trade-offs that I tail calls
for so what does this mean for us more
throughput these are our stats again so
we can think about what this means for
us in business these are the things that
lean promises for us in this new world
of technology software delivery new
content delivery what does it mean for
us a new content delivery what about
value and savings around a/b testing
what about value around speed to market
or compliance and regulatory changes or
security what happens when there's a new
ssl vulnerability how quickly can we get
that out so Adrian mentioned this there
was a paper put out by co Xavier at all
talked about online experimentation at
Microsoft evaluating well designed and
executed experiments that were designed
to improve a key metric only about
one-third were successful in improving
the key metric so if we know which one
third those are you can keep those in
place if we know which to third those
are
not we can pull those out let's say we
want to be lazy and only include those
one-third what can we do with the other
two-thirds of our time vacation go have
a beer we can do all sorts of things we
can optimize on those one-third but if
we don't know what those one-third are
what sort of position are we in okay now
let's look at stability we also have
more stability what does this mean for
us again around value in savings around
reliability value in savings around up
time also compliance security and
reputation around compliance and
security we all know the netflix case
when i'm sure several of us do when
amazon went down and everyone went down
except netflix because they had been
using chaos monkey you don't choose
chaos monkey chaos monkey chooses you
what can we all do when we have more
resilient systems you know everyone else
thought that Netflix was being treated
special no they were treating themselves
special because they were used to
failure they had more stable resilient
systems now there are also key factors
that correlate with each of these mttr
lead time for changes deployment for
frequency version control for all
production artifacts happens to
correlate with all of them so having
your code and by the way that's for all
production artifacts so that's
application code source control
configuration management infrastructure
having everything in a repository and
that's in part so you can spin
everything up recreate as you need
providing infrastructure and test
environments providing environments for
dev test QA everyone for all of your
cross-functional teams so they can spin
it up whenever they want so it's cheap
and easy and fast
monitoring automated testing continuous
delivery also super important culture
job satisfaction climate for learning
lest we forget this is not just about
automation and tooling and practice and
process we really need to have that
culture and that climate in place that
allows us to do experimentation so
DevOps is good for organizations let's
also cut to the bottom line right
high-performing IT organizations when
compared to those low-performing IT
organizations twice as likely to exceed
profitability market share and
productivity goals this is worldwide
this is across all types of
organizations industries now the number
on the right this was for respondents
who volunteered their stock ticker so
this is limited to companies who are
traded on US stock exchange but for
those that did fifty percent higher
market cap growth over three years so by
the way this is also not like startups
and unicorns and only while op shops so
when we go in and look at the data this
is also this is primarily not primarily
majority because its stock market
companies financial institutions retail
organizations of course large tech
organizations but clearly not just
startups and web op shops because
they're publicly traded so also when we
look at main contributing store
organization performance IT performance
and strong strong DevOps practices was a
huge contributor organizational culture
and climate for learning job sat was the
number one predictor but when we go back
and look at the literature that's
actually that's held for decades
when we take a look at organizational
culture so this is sort of interesting
how many here so we can take a look
let's let's review quickly pathological
or power-oriented cultures tend to be
characterized by low cooperation
messengers are shot responsibilities are
shirked bridging is discouraged failure
Lisa scapegoating and novelty is crushed
bureaucratic or rural oriented cultures
there's modest cooperation messengers
are neglected now our responsibilities
bridging tolerated failure leads to
justice novelty can lead to problems
generative or performance oriented also
called a trust rounded culture hi
cooperation messengers are trained risks
or shared bridging is encouraged failure
least inquiry novelty is implemented who
here hmm has a friend who works in a
power oriented culture okay who here has
a friend who works in a rural oriented
culture okay and who here works it's
oriented culture and who here did not
dare answer for their friend fan jezik
okay results from the 2014 study showed
that about half half of the respondents
and this this was based on over 9000 we
were almost at 9300 respondents and and
data on this covers about 20,000 people
now so we've got really really solid
data your ear about half the people are
enroll oriented about a third word
performance-oriented about fifteen
percent were in power in it and I will
note that when we look at high medium
and low performers there is a
statistically significant difference
with most of the high performers
belonging in or or seeing representation
in those generative cultures
and and that really is a significantly
strong predictor of strong performance
and strong DevOps and and why take a
look at a quote from Scott Scott cook it
into it so the call-outs are mine but by
installing a rapid innovation culture we
performed 165 experiments in the peak
three months of tax season so in the
states do you guys do Texas you guys
have like taxis in here so we have to
let our taxes and taxes are always do a
certain time every single year our
business result conversion rate of the
website is up fifty percent employee
result everyone loves it because their
new ideas can make it to market okay go
back five or 10 years 15 years who would
ever dare do experiment on a live web
site in the peak of tax season like
think back to the 90s style programming
there is no way you would dare do that
but when else are you going to figure
out when someone would want something
except during peak tax season and also
look at the second part conversion rate
of the website is up so your customers
are liking it better but what else did
he mention he mentioned the employees
are happy how cool is that not only is
he making more money but he's explicitly
calling out that his own employees are
happier because their ideas are making
it to market and also what he didn't
really mention there no ideas can make
it to market but also their no ideas can
make it to test and if they don't like
it they can just pull it out I'm
guessing no one's getting screamed at if
it didn't work because you can try it
this is awesome a great story Greg
linden at amazon so Greg had had this
great idea where so I assume we've all
been to the supermarket in the store and
there's they always have like at
checkout they always have all the candy
right there to which I'm a sucker for
I'm half the time I get candy or if you
ever have kids like they always want
candy so I end up by candy so Greg had
this great idea that at checkout at
amazon
like offer suggestions for what you
should buy at checkout okay the problem
or the challenge of that is that like at
the supermarket you're already
physically trapped in line and I'm not
going to walk out at Amazon you could
click away so he presented this idea
though to a senior vice president the
senior vice president was like yeah
absolutely not no this is a horrible
idea because if I get distracted I can
leave the website I can navigate away
cute adorable nice idea absolutely not
Greg packs up his things like he showed
him a fully functional prototype drops
his head walks out of the office goes
back to his own office writes up an a/b
test pushes it into production comes
back after a few weeks and shows him
drastic increases in revenue so he sort
of just expressly went against the
wishes of a senior vice president like
how many here could do that that like
probably more here than could even five
or ten years ago but that's not
incredibly common that's the hallmark of
a novelty encouraged data-driven culture
and Greg writes this up later in his
blog I think building this culture is
the key to innovation creativity must
flow from everywhere whether you're a
summer intern or the CTO any good idea
must seek an objective test preferably a
test that exposes the idea to real
customers everyone must be able to
experiment learn and iterate it's also
worth noting they had the infrastructure
built and available that provided the
ability for him to do an a/b test not
everyone has that available it was all
so easy for him to push that through
so job SATs also a strong strong
predictor of organization performance so
by the way great thing to do top
correlates of job satisfaction hi trust
organizational culture climate of
learning win-win relationships between
people that are traditionally siloed
proactive monitoring and auto scaling
use of version control automated testing
things that help you do your job easier
provide people the resources they need
to get their job done so by the way out
of the 2015 DevOps survey we know so by
the way this is pretty picture is in the
2015 DevOps survey practice this is a
fully tested predictive statistical
model done with partial least squares we
know that comprehensive fast reliable
test deployment automation trunk based
development continuous integration
application code a nap and system
configuration all in version control
those are all CD these contribute to
higher IT performance lower change fail
rates lower levels of deployment pain
and these all contribute to higher
levels of organizational performance so
we know that CD practices are good for
organizations we also know that lean
management practices are good for
organizations effective whip limits that
drive process improvement visual
displays to monitor quality and
productivity of that whip use of
application performance and interest
infrastructure monitoring tools to make
business decisions all contribute to
lean management those help reinforce
that strong generative work culture that
help contribute to IT performance and
help contribute to that or performance
by the way lean management also
decreases levels of burnout that we see
in workers or at least contribute to
perceived levels of burnout which
quite honestly is almost as good if I
don't feel burned out that's a strong
first step so DevOps isn't just IT it's
the practice of IT it's how we get the
job done it's the tooling in the
automation which is a good first step
but we also need the practice in the
process of how we get there it's also
the culture this is the lien of the
software and the technology
transformation revolution so again we
need all of the pieces in order to
contribute to that bottom line that
we've been talking about thank you very
much for your time
