everyone got their coffee I'm having
mine it's gonna it's interesting getting
this slot after the conference party so
I'll try and keep everyone awake so
we'll start off by asking some questions
just to see if everyone is awake here's
a statement a software system can best
be designed if the testing is interlaced
with the design instead of being used
after the design sounds a bit like TDD
to me how do we think said that and when
did there say that anyone willing to
volunteer a decade was it the 90s was
this chant back Ward Cunningham someone
else and he died kids 60s fifties yeah
going back this was the 60s this was a
guy called Alan Jeff perlis back in 1968
so we can't award our TDD and 60 it
anybody know who Alan jet perlis is very
little noise coming back anyone heard of
the Chilean awards yeah
he's the first recipient of the cheering
Awards we've got great memory of our
industry don'twe it's kind of stuff
going back I think we ended up doing
some kind of crazy things and I love to
collect photographs off the internet
right maybe is this how we do
engineering do we remember our history
this is from Russia where she gets no
monopoly on this let's look at my own
country that's supposed to be a fuse you
start to see this crazy stuff that's out
there I cannot think how do we build
software the funny thing is I've seen a
lot of software that's kind of badly
done let's look at something a bit
neater a bit cleaner but from the other
side of the world Australia seems to be
a bit of a global phenomenon we have
doing these crazy things with our
software this can went run last year is
this is this the sort of core of our
industries this is what we do quite
possibly now if I start funny in this
interesting so here's some
advertisements for CDs fans talking
about their cars and they're talking
here about hi one of their cars has 1.7
million lines of code in a raptor
fighter but they have 6.5 million lines
of code in their car way more software
in the car than there is in the most
advanced fighter aircraft in the world
today this is kind of interesting
there's a lot a lot of software it can
look was further than this they even
brag about it in their advertisements
where they're talking about 250 times
more code than a fighter are 250 times
more code than the space shuttle did
this marketing apartment and understand
anything about code 250 times what was
in the space shuttle yeah a few of those
went wrong as well hey we're gonna be
driving around in these things and it's
kind of scary I've seen various figures
on how much code is in the latest
Tesla's at the low end I've heard of two
hundred and twenty million lines of code
in the high hand three hundred and fifty
million lines of code we're trusting our
lives to our software are we really a
disciplined engineering profession that
the world is gonna be based on us going
forward I think it's kind of interesting
I want to explore this question but to
put some stuff in context I kind of like
to think that how many generations of
programmers do we have our industry
hasn't been around that long in many
ways like anybody here say they're a
second generation programmer mother or
father programmed any third generation
programmers not a lot really and you
said think of other disciplines where
you hand these down through generations
we get much better at stuff with time so
we're kind of young we're kind of
working at art so I was involved in a
number of standards in the 1990s
building software trying to do it better
so ISO 9001
27001 these are a kind of interesting
ways we tried to write better software
and what I find from this is we went
from having crop to having
well-documented crop software didn't get
any better so another way to look at
this is we're kind of living in the era
of software alchemy we're making this
all better like physics in the 1600s
like Isaac Newton done some great work
he was also one of the most significant
alchemists of the time where alchemy is
trying to turn lead into gold we're kind
of searching for these silver bullets
the kind of crazy things that we're
doing I want to explore the subject of
engineering I know we hear a lot in our
industry about are we doing engineering
are we doing science are we doing a
craft there's kind of interesting
arguments on lots of sides it's always
kind of fascinated me sort of where we
fit in this sort of spectrum by
background I'm a computer scientist
computer science major at university I
spent a lot of time in engineering
department has seen other engineering
disciplines so I think how do we fit
with this so let's kind of go back a bit
so one of the confessions I can make is
I was educated in Ireland by nuns so the
good old Catholic religion was beaten
into me including Latin and you should
go back to light in this world we
actually get to see some the history of
engineering so the original term meaning
sort of cleverness or to contrive or
devise there's definitely a bit of
contriving and devising in our software
but the first reference to engineering
as a term comes back to sofa by the
1300s in Old French and is to do with
the military designing sort of people
who designed stuff that worked for a
machine like a catapult or some sort of
weapon of war and so engineering is kind
of steeped in the military in many ways
unfortunately it's the kind of
interesting thing of our history
most sort of technological advancements
are driven by war in the military quite
often we their leader a god
civil engineering it's a term and that
was pretty much everything else that
wasn't military at the time so would you
like this sort of evolving thing over
time where we start off with military
and then
civil but let's go to the font of all
human knowledge Wikipedia and see what
they've got to say about engineering
so the definition of engineering on the
Wikipedia is engineers must work within
constraints I think this is very true I
write Java most des I feel very
constrained now these constraints can be
also two different layers there could be
available resources that's definitely
something is it physical is it
imaginative is the technical limitations
yeah we are dealing with these
limitations one of the most important
points for me about engineering is
flexibility for future modifications and
additions this is so applicable to
software we are always having to modify
an adopts offer think about even if
you're working on a greenfield project
this week you're probably modifying code
you wrote last week and code you wrote
six months ago was effectively written
by someone else
so having code that's readable
understandable easy to modify easy to
add to its kind of key and that's very
much a core tenant of a lot of
engineering but there's other factors
that need to go into what we're working
on so we got to care about cost we got a
care about marketability productivity
but particularly safety safety is very
strong in most engineering disciplines I
would argue it's actually quite strong
in our discipline we don't just practice
it enough so think of things like memory
safety concurrency safety there's lots
of practice and different ways the 54
people in our teams and how we function
and when we understand these constraints
and limitations we can look at what we
need to produce so that's the kind of
definition that doesn't sound like a
million miles away from the things that
we should be carrying about so what does
a great scientist think of engineering
versus science so direct quote from
Albert Einstein Santis investigate
thought which already is engineers
create thought that has never been the
create the future very much a lot of
what we are doing is career in the
future I'd even steal from Allen care he
talked about hi you don't need to
predict the future you go ahead and
invent it in some ways is
which an interesting thing so software
engineering as a term what does this
come from where does it all come back to
well it's exactly 50 years ago that
software engineering was first used as a
term one of the first references is this
paper sort of going back to 1967 they
talk about software engineering in this
paper
we're become popularized was this woman
Margaret Hamilton she very much did
great work to make software engineering
become known as a concept don'ts mummy
using things herself so things that we
have today like priority scheduling
human-in-the-loop and to antastic
they all come from this great lady she
worked at NASA worked on the lunar
landings but also sort of ended up
eventually running the software division
at NASA who's who's director of
engineering there for that and instilled
some great engineering practices I've
been privileged enough to work with some
people who worked in that department and
how they approached software development
is really interesting and how it does
truly focus on engineering so some of
the history of this and work goes
forward so going back again to 1968
so forty-nine years ago there was a
conference host at up in Germany it was
run by NATO this is a brilliant paper I
really recommend you read this if you
get a chance after it the great thing
about conferences in those days is they
recorded the proceedings offered so all
of the interesting bits are captured and
minuted and they're in this paper so
it's a beautiful rate but let me pull
out some points from this conference and
because there was some really
interesting things happening there and
things sad so here's a little bit the
design process is an iterative one now
remember the context 1968 flowchart
until you think you understand the
problem write code until you realize you
don't go back and redo the flowchart
write some more code and iterate to you
feel you have the correct solution
iterative development described in the
60s what went wrong that we went off and
done waterfall not showing signs of
learning so
so here's another one reliability really
is a design issue we have to design
these things in upfront I find a
particular interest in how the quality
attributes are ignored so performance
security reliability usability all of
these things is you can't add them after
it has to be part of the design process
we've got to do this
I like how to finish it with if you
don't do these things you might as well
give up we try to add this on at the end
there's a lot we can learn from this oh
this is a great one the good systems
that are presently working were written
by small groups more than 20 program is
working on a project is usually
disastrous I think that still holds true
today in many cases another one on
approach begin with skeletal coding so
rather than aiming at finished code the
first 46 coding steps should be aimed at
exploring interfaces size the critical
modules complexity adequacy of those
modules some critical items should be
checked out bring the hard things to the
front I'll talk more about that later
and kind of one of the really great ones
that was pulled out in this thing
because this was the military there was
a lot of the Navy present there a lot of
the Air Force and the Air Force made the
point that to keep your wings as a pilot
you've got to fly a minimum number of
hours per month they were saying in the
60s that we should be having programmers
and senior architects who are writing a
minimum number of lines of code per
month we still see that to be it going
on I think it is absolutely insane that
people claim to be an architect or a
lead in some ways I don't write code I
use other professions to look at if you
were the chief surgeon in a hospital you
would still perform operations you
wouldn't go telling everybody else what
to do and never practice yourself like
we are a practice we need to reinforce
this by regular activity this is a
classic one I've seen a lot so they're
talking about how
the programmers are working with their
customers so many people who designed so
for referring to the users they are them
it's the sort of them enough thing
that's coming about they took about how
most designers are of the software are
designing it for their own benefit not
for the benefit of the customers I'd be
really quite crude about this and say a
lot of what I see in teams is technical
masturbation that's kind of what it is
people are doing stuff for their own
gratification rather than for the
customer we need to be focused on what
we're building and why we're building it
so there's some fascinating bits from
this thing there's a lot of query people
there
Allen Jaya perlis who I give that
original quote from was our third
conference and that was one of his
pieces that was there another person who
was there was Dykstra since him in the
Netherlands it makes sense to even pick
on some of what he's got to say one of
the papers I've read of his that I think
is very interesting is he talked on the
cruelty of really teaching computer
science and what's involved or not
Dijkstra is a kind of interesting
character there's some brilliance in
there but he's a bit of an acquired
taste in some ways his opinions are very
strong but in this particular paper he
pulled that a couple of really
interesting points that I think are
worth exploring one is this concept of
radical novelty and how he describes
that software is so different from the
things that we've done before we don't
really have a frame of reference right
as humans we do really well by teaching
with storytelling analogy metaphor
there's some of our Mian tools for
communicating
unfortunately there's some things we try
to communicate that there is not a
metaphor or something we can use to help
us in this so Dykstra talked about when
you try to create these links if the
things that we're trying to deal with
that's already familiar if they're not
the same they become hopelessly
inadequate in fact they're quite
misleading and this he moved on to give
some really good examples and he says
like so if you go back further in time
what are other examples of this so the
relativity and quantum mechanics if
you've ever stood understood those
they're very very different from
anything else you can't put them in a
silicon
common context other leader or examples
is the atomic bomb or the contraceptive
pill we're talking about things that are
so fundamentally different they're the
radical novelty is so high that it
shakes the foundations of society these
are things that change governments
change religions change ways of thinking
apart and some of what we're doing now
with the internet is on the same scale
the internet is changing the world in
such a fundamental way the same as some
of these previous sorts of things so you
say that good we got to be a were and
also don't be afraid to sort of try to
explain the difficult stuff and actually
just hunker down and go for it because
these some of these things are difficult
and we have to put the effort in he
talked about it and how do we approach
this what are the two major things we
need to do when we approach stuff well
one of them is the divide and rule he
talked about so decomposition we need to
learn how to decompose things at an
unprecedented scale that we've just
never had to do it before so you take
the example of the Tesla hundreds of
millions of lines of software that's
inside there how do you understand that
how do you reason about that it has to
have decomposition on an unprecedented
scale to have any idea what's going on
so these are skills that we need to be
practicing illness sort of weekly or
even dearly be assess how do we
decompose problems how do we extra
abstract problems and not the pure form
of abstraction not the law of leaky
abstractions that we talked about from
Joel Spolsky but real abstraction
particularly in the mathematical context
he then pointed out as well that
software has really interesting facet to
it is that when we make a change to it
the amplification of those changes is
again totally unprecedented it's drastic
we can change one bit and a complete
software system fails it can be a
catastrophic failure by just getting one
bit wrong now there's things we can do
to isolate and constrain that but we
have to actively think about it we can't
just be sort of lacks or slapdash about
this because the implications are just
so significant to getting it wrong most
other things that we do as humans don't
have that sort of ski
that we can make those sort of things go
wrong so that's a kind of interesting
history of engineering of science and
some of the things that there are some
things to think about in there I kind of
recommend go back and read some of the
works of our history for subject is grit
but it's kind of interesting other side
to this soon I mentioned that I'm a
computer science major by background my
minor when I was at university was
behavioral psychology and it's a
fascinating subject to look into as
humans are really key to how we all work
how we interact in this and sort of
being aware of this but one of the
things you'll learn from any sort of
studies of psychology is that we are
very much a product of our own
experiences so the experiences we have
in life very much makes us who we are in
many ways so all the kind of explore
that is a subject so if we look at
engineering as a history how do we
engineer ourselves how can we change how
we approach our own ways of looking at
this so the purpose in some context I
found an uncomfortable truth on many
projects and companies I've dealt with
in my history and other people I've
talked to have seen this very similar
thing that very often the people who
make significant change and significant
progress particularly on software
projects is usually a very small number
it's usually one or a very small group
of people often working outside the
standard process they're the people who
often get stuff done and so you can why
is that what's different about them
what's unique about them and I want to
sort of polite some of what I have
observed in myself and others sort of
looking at some of these individuals on
what they do and how they approach
things but if we look at learning as a
way of approaching something I don't
have to break this down into three parts
what should we learn as individuals if
we want to be good engineers work but
learning that which is also interesting
and then how do we go about the learning
process itself so break this down into
the three categories
what should we learn I kind of argue
upfront the things like algorithms and
data structures are fundamental to what
we do I've been programming since the
1980s and I find that things that I
learned back in the 1980s about you
choice of algorithms good choice of data
structures still are valuable to me
today you can go back and you can read
the works of Knuth and it is still
valuable today also in history I've
learned things like I knew WebLogic 6.4
really really well at one stage is that
any good to me at all today
he's the thing I'm a big fan of The
Simpsons and so to think of Homer he
talks about everything you learn when
you learn something new something else
gets pushed out that's important I think
when I spent a long time learning logic
6.4 it was not good something important
went at that stage so these algorithms
these data structures they're not
something you'll use every single day
but that kind of fundamental building
blocks to how we approach stuff there's
a lot to be learned from not just
picking the right data structures for a
relationship knowing I'm having an
awareness of different algorithms is
really good in influencing how you write
your own code this is kind of just one
of the building blocks I think another
really strong when it's design
fundamentals all right when I'm talking
about design fundamentals I'm talking
about understanding coupling cohesion
separation of concerns single
responsibility principle a lot of people
can sort of talk about these things they
can mention them but if you look at
their code it doesn't truly represent it
like what are you practicing every day I
know people talk about coupling I'll
give you a simple example
you call a method or a function and
you're good to pass something in it so
say for example you had a customer and
you just want to have the customer
identity their ID whatever that happens
to be do you pass in the whole customer
object now you're coupled to the
customer or do you pass in just the
identity now you're only coupled to that
these little things every day or start
to make a difference in your design we
got to be practicing them so we're
getting good at them and they'll stay
with you at all times
single responsible
the really house with understanding just
what something does makes it easier to
name the talk about all of these sort of
things
and underlying a lot of this is
programming paradigms object orientation
procedural but we find that a lot of
people are all programmers and maybe
procedural programmers functional is
kind of taking off in a big way but
there's also things like set theory
logic programming also different ways of
looking at problem spaces it really
helps your approaches on that I wrote a
lot of prologue at one stage in my life
I am incredibly comfortable now with
recursion and you can solve problems in
interesting ways
if you've practiced with that functional
techniques are wonderful to bring even
if you're an object-oriented programming
or procedural programmer there's a lot
to be learned from things like monotonic
functions pure functions different ways
of approaching stuff we can learn from
these ideas so have that diversity of
input is really important if you're kind
of one-track I'm an old programmer and
that's all I do around the procedure
programmer I'm a functional programmer
and you don't look at the otherwise
you've limited your toolbox there's a
lot of ways we can stimulate our brains
and give us different ways of thinking
this also helps with things like
decomposition herbs and abstraction
Dijkstra talked about how key this is if
we need to be able to reason about our
problem spaces we gotta get good a
decomposition is it behavioral
decomposition is it functional is it
theater whatever there's lots of
different ways we can decompose problems
but we need to be thinking about them
understanding them going and reading
about them and learning about these
sorts of things not learning about the
latest sort of JavaScript framework or
learn the latest Java frame or whatever
it happens to be let's face it if you
learn a new JavaScript framework it's
probably out of date next week it's like
learning milk so it goes steel so
quickly learn the things that matter and
under this like I keep finding this is
very very true if there was one subject
at school I wish I'd paid more attention
to and that's mathematics I would
challenge anybody who says mathematics
is not important that they're a person
that doesn't truly understand
mathematics it is so fundamental
how everything works but also really
importantly is not just understanding it
it's understanding how to apply it I
work a lot in the performance space so
I'm very familiar with things like
queueing theory and littles law and
Universal scalability law and all those
sorts of things but when you truly
understand some of the mathematics
behind that you start spotting it in
lots of places that it's not obvious for
example littles law will hear about it
turns up a networking theory called bond
with the lab product it's actually the
core of agile and lean manufacturing is
all about littles law so understanding
that mathematics is actually why those
sort of things work we can't hide from
some of this stuff I learned statistics
at school I found a deadly dull and
boring and then as an adult at one stage
I wrote a robot to play a poker
I went back and revisited statistics
it's a wonderful subject rich in
interesting now when I'm approaching
like big data problems I've got the
mathematics behind me that really helps
me understand this but what really
stands out in this is we're needing to
go parlo in the future we're not going
to get faster single cores and
mathematics is the key to that so you
gotta be able to look at a problem I'll
make it commutative and associative and
you can't think I remember that kind of
a little bit from school you might even
sort of think oh yes but the ordering of
the grouping but spotting it and when to
apply it all the time is things that
really matter from making the scale up
and making it clean and efficient I kind
of laughed in this area the things very
important is we're moving into this
world of distributed systems it's kind
of it's here it's concurrent it's
distributed that means things are
communicating with each other we've got
to really understand the fundamentals of
communication protocols of interaction
Kodak's wares of working so on a sort of
basic level understanding protocols is
really really important there's great
bodies of work and networking and other
services from the past we can look at
the ITF is a great source of knowledge
for a lot of this most people just get
stuff talking together and don't
understand the fundamentals of how
communications work and I'm gonna star
in this subject because it so applies at
other levels it's how humans interact so
drives are patterned
as well and it gives you sort of take
from Conway's law all software takes on
the shape of the organization that built
it so organisations with good
communication structures tend to have
software with good communication
instructors we can adjust we end up
having really what we practice on how we
approach things we can't ignore this and
the kind of point data to the current
meme that's gone around at the moment is
it
we've got monoliths and we're gonna go
to micro services and when you've got a
monolith and if the monolith is big and
steamy and smelly what's gonna happen if
you break it up into micro services what
happens to anything that's smelly when
you increase the surface area of it it
smells a lot more you got to get the
fundamentals right before adding even
more complexity and surface area to
stuff you gotta keep practicing these so
where can we learn well kind of the
thing that's really front and center is
personal practice to get grit at
anything you've got to practice you've
got to put your 10,000 arse in if
anybody's ever learned music learn to
sport learn something that requires real
dedication they'll understand what I
mean by this we got to put the practice
in so a lot of the previous things I'm
talking about the decomposition the
theater structures the paradigms all on
souza unless you're practicing it on a
daily level practicing it right you
won't get better
now if a background in sports and one of
the things my coaches drilled into me
whenever I was young and to listen
really really hard is when you are
practicing over and over again if you
practice bad habits they become
instinctual you have to practice good
habits so when you find yourself
applying the design patterns do you
apply them correctly with good
discipline because if you don't you're
not making them reflexive to do them in
a bad way so we've got to think and
catch yourself almost every day doing
the right things so the you're drilling
when you drill things over and over
again they become the way you act under
pressure and we do all get under
pressure at times so make sure your
personal practice is correct do not be
practicing the bad wears over and over
again because that will land become
instinctual
we need to learn from people and so the
other people that we work with and
interact with the teams we join are so
influential to how we develop and how we
evolve as people now some of us get
lucky and we get such great teams to
work with great people to work with but
we gotta try and influence that in some
ways I would give a call I'd to the
industry as a whole if you're working
with bad teams and bad people go work
somewhere else there is enough great
work out there that you can go find good
organizations to work with don't work
with organizations that just do bad
things it's one of the nice things about
our industries we have the choice so go
and exercise that choice and they kind
of pull it out even further if you're a
manager or someone who runs a team if
you have a problem person in the team
try to fix them or remove them don't let
the team be destroyed by bad behavior
people who behaved really badly can
downwards a team and damage everybody
else in our team so easy so we can't
always get the ideal teams we can't
always get the idea of people how do we
compensate if some of that well
there's great papers there's great
documentation of the history of our
subject out there we don't read enough
that I've referenced a few papers in
this so far I'll talk about a few more
things as we go on but there's a great
world of stuff out there personally I
never read as much of the papers until
about 10 years ago and I worked with
some people who helped me understand
that so some of those people who worked
in NASA who have I have had the pleasure
of working with that's one of the things
they taught me is to read research
papers there's a lot to be learned and
gleaned from that there's a lot of great
history and our subject not just the
research papers reading other code
Stephen King the author was once - asked
how do you become a great writer his
response was first you must read a lot
and become a great reader that is so
true with code as well
you've got to read other people's code
to learn from it and so we should be
writing code to be read as like the
modifications for future adaptations is
so key as an engineering discipline and
we've got to also read lots of it
our industry doing a lot of stuff
proprietary has stifled this to an
extent we should be able to study other
great works and this would be a common
thing open-source is healthy not most
other professions the great work gets
studied we're not doing that enough they
if you want to become a great musician
go watch other great musicians ideally
jam with them play with them
you want to come created sport you go
play a sport with the grid people you
don't do it on your own you got to
interact with them and you've got
observe what they do because humans are
good at MINIX
we're great at mimicking other things so
let's go read some good stuff some great
examples out there so one of the people
I think moved industry forward in some
nice waves is John Carmack id Software a
lot of his software for the games
engines of quake and doom has now been
open sourced you think C is an ugly
language go read his C code it's not at
all
we can blame languages for lots of
things but more often it's the person
rather than the language you can have
grip really nice high quality code
written in almost any language if the
author cares enough and develops it in
the right way when we go to learn on
projects we could enter a project
there's so much we don't know this is
something we just have to accept is we
are doing lots of new things there's
lots we don't know what's one of the
most important things you can do on a
project bring the heart on the one stuff
up the front do the hard stuff first
it gives you the maximum amount of time
to get to understand to do the research
to fix what you need to fix them move
forward it really helps you simple
little things our instincts is we'll
walk away from the hard stuff we'll
leave it to later maybe it'll go away
like we talk about doing things at the
last responsible moment that gets
misunderstood you start practicing the
hard stuff up front so you got plenty of
chance to get it right and we're in this
world I were we've got the Internet
there's so much online resources that we
can go and study for this we can go and
learn from the kind of really
interesting thing is no longer is recall
a useful skill I remember sort of doing
job interviews sort of in the early
loyalties and people are asking you to
recall facts all of the time it's a
skill that's almost irrelevant now
because we just go look it up we just
google for it the real skill is
understanding what is good that's out
there in this vast sea of information so
when we're going back to the copying and
pasting of Stack Overflow what do we
copy and Pierce what do we look at and
how do we decide what is right but a lot
of thought is science and science will
teach us how to do those things better
so let's look at how we learn can a
first and foremost than this is
automated all boring repetitive tasks if
you don't you won't have the time to do
all of the other things you need to do
time is the most precious resource we
all have in our personal lives on on our
projects and everywhere and the way we
get more time is we automate everything
like who here does not have a/c I built
these dads who's really proud that the
CI is good this kind of starts to get
interested we can a book coming home
where are the things like continuous
integration is important Egypt commits
bill happening in under three minutes is
your acceptance bill completing in under
20 minutes if not the behaviors if your
team will change quite significantly so
focusing on some of those important
things having that great CI environment
is one of the things I was most pried
off at lmax is we had a great continuous
integration environment and at times it
wasn't as good as we ultimately would
like it but having tens of thousands of
tasks meant we just had a quality of our
code base that is very rare normally but
you have to invest in it you have to
have that effort put in to get it right
when we've done that it then freezes up
to look at other things and I think one
of the things with that is focusing on
the feedback cycles so when you go to
learn anything you want to shorten the
distance as much as possible between
needing announcer and getting that
feedback so you do an experiment you're
doing whatever it happens to be how do
you make those feedback cycles as short
as possible this is why we try to get CI
to run quickly we get the answer quickly
I've worked in a lot of startups and
it's amazing how people go off and also
to crazy directions
there's lots of stuff you don't know
IOSCO it was a very simple question is
how can you find out the answer for that
for the minimum investment because
everything is an investment how do you
find that answer right for the minimum
of investment in time money people
whatever happens to be and we did all
this by experimentation so engineering
is an interesting disciplines
underpinned by science in many ways and
one of the greatest things we have about
science is a scientific method part of
thought is we have to do lots of
experiments and experiments are the way
we can reason about the things that we
deal with so we got to get good at them
we've got to put together good quality
experiments we've got to have the
hypothesis we're being testing and then
get good at measuring so make sure we're
measuring the things are measuring the
rights of the things I'm not just being
misled Fineman talked about applying
scientific honesty so you can have
science but if you don't apply it
correctly exam I'll try to make this
point in normal times like mathematics
is good but you got to get good at
applying at engineering is good but you
got to get good at applying it science
is good but you got to get good at
applying it don't deceive yourself so
you do an experiment you go to measure
you get some results don't try to fit
the results to what you want the answer
to be you've got to find the model that
is really what the data is telling you
and sort of working for that we're very
easy to deceive it's something all of us
have as a weaknesses we'll go into
something with a preconception with a
bias with whatever it is we've got to
let the dealer take us away from our
biases if we can don't try to pull it
back the other way but that's just done
to admitting not to ourselves and
dealing with it I'm probably the most
important point I have on this if
there's one thing you can do to change
your working practices going forward is
what I call revisit and refine we'll do
lots of interesting things and one of
the things that behavioral psychology
and behavioral science teach us it's a
little about how the human brain works
so if you're good to do something you'll
fill up your short-term memory with the
tasks that you're working on when you go
to review what you've just done as
you're often just replaying out of your
short-term memory
so for the CPU nerds in the room this is
your cache this is what you're working
sad you're due you're dealing with so
let's make a simple example I'm gonna
write I'm really important email that
needs to go out to a whole company I
write the email and I proofread it
straight afterwards you will have lots
of mistakes and did you don't see
because you will be using what's in your
memory what your intent was not what you
actually did so what should you do is
would you set it aside you go off and
you do something else and you come back
later and then you revisit it and you
review again you will spot things that
you didn't see if you just reviewed it
straight away there's lots of great
examples of business particularly with
code I we've come to papers Tony Hoare
another one of the Turing award winners
he done CSP and other things he's to
have multiple papers going on any given
point in time and he didn't just do a P
ever finish it and publish it he let
them have a duration he let them back in
where you let them to just do it for a
while so he'd do it I'd leave it aside
go and do something else come back
review it and refine it when they've
done that a few times and he was happy
there was not too many more issues with
it then he would publish I've been
practicing this with my own code and I
find it has been one of the biggest
differences to the quality of my code is
I write something it's not complete it's
reached a point where I'm happy with it
for now I'll move on I'll do another
task I plan in time to come back read
review and refine it so you revisit and
you refine you find mistakes you'll find
more elegant ways of dealing with
something you can find a way of making
that code cleaner you improve it and you
move on and you just keep this pipeline
going all of the time where you're doing
multiple things in a pipeline and you
just come back to them again it makes a
huge difference to improve in quality
and how you work and to go back to the
kind of finish off this section with the
one of the true tenants of engineering
I'm going to take a thing from Margaret
Hamilton and how she approach things so
whenever the lunar lander started having
issues and one of the things that she
had designed that see if that was
priority scheduling and two things like
things will go wrong by our nature we
start thinking very negatively about it
how she looked at it positively so
things went wrong the positive assertion
to how the brain works is she thought
what must I preserve not what can go
wrong
subtle kind of differences but sort of
thinking about what can go wrong
starts to become really important so
here's a call I'd for another paper this
is a peer for the toxified production
outages in some data intensive
applications and what were the causes of
those there's a sort of rich seam of
different causes inside there but a
really strong st. theme through this was
ignored errors like most of the
production outages that they're find
could have been called by unit tests
there was errors that had emptied to our
empty cats blocks and error handlers
ignored error codes returned from
functions there's a large percentage of
these things that had cats block for an
exception with the to do inside most
fixed before production this is not
professional it's bit like the unit
testing thing is like we've not reached
the point where a lot of people don't
touch the code probably don't do CI to
me this is like surgery when surgeons
used to argue about how they should wash
their hands there's a hygiene factor to
this there's a level of professionalism
that it is irresponsible to be just
hacking code and throwing it out at now
and we will end up getting pulled up on
this as an industry we gotta get better
we've got to get cleaner on this so kind
of let's look at this in closing what
are some things that you need to think
about I like this concept of thinking
about lines of code spent there's only
so much we can retain in our brains at
any point in time some evidence suggests
that if you're working on a system if it
gets more than about 10,000 lines of
code for what you're responsible it's
difficult to make changes difficult to
understand the implications of that so
keeping it small and working out how do
we decompose at an interesting level
that goes kind of further with this sue
John Carmack who I mentioned earlier he
done quake and doom he talked about how
removing lines of code is a good thing
but removing speed is even better I'll
find one of the ways to
measure projects and get genuine
improvements there's lots of ways you
can measure stuff and people game a
system one of the things I find is very
successful is measuring lines of code
deleted and measuring nothing else how
it really next in an improvement to a
system makes it smaller cleaner it also
gets ruthless about cutting out features
that just aren't paying for themselves
same thing can be said for steered
minimize this stuff it makes it much
easier to understand about it it's
things like other engineering
disciplines have learned this like inner
craft the perfect aircraft or spacecraft
is the one in which is nothing left you
can take off it everything is there
everything has a purpose and everything
is clearly out in value if something is
costing more than the value that is
returning it is not economic in the
software it shouldn't be there and so
everything does have a cost but also
everything should have a benefit and we
got to get those things we're up
together so kind of thinking about this
don't feel bad we are kind of living in
this yearís all four alchemy we're
working this out we're sort of we're not
totally building on the shoulders of
giants yet so we're not like physics
where everybody knows who Newton
Einstein Dirac fine and all those people
are we we barely even know archery an
award winners which seems to be a common
thing and by the way we lost another
great one on Monday with wacker who's
one of the few from Palo Alto has gone
let us learn from some of this but the
kind of interesting thing is what we do
is really cool it's really nice in many
ways it's it's a job that we're almost
paid to play and we're shape in the
future and it's really great so on that
I'll finish up and thank you very much
