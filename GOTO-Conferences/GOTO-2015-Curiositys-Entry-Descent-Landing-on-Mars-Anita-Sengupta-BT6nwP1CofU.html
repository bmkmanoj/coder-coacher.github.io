everyone can hear me okay great so I am
new to Sengupta I am an aerospace
engineer by training I've gotten all my
degrees in aerospace engineering but my
specialty is actually in plasma
propulsion systems so that means
technically I am a rocket scientist
which I know you will appreciate not
everyone does so my talk today is about
curiosity's entry descent and landing on
Mars and so entry descent landing which
for an acronym we use is called ADL is
how you actually get exo-atmospheric and
land on the surface of another planet
and then hopefully if that planet has an
atmosphere you can actually use that
atmosphere to help you slow down
and so curiosity is the largest Rover
that we've ever built at NASA to land on
Mars and it had a unique challenge being
able to the surface which I'll go
through during the course of this talk
but in terms of this first slide here
you can actually see a picture of the
rover which is a selfie that it took of
itself everyone takes selfies nowadays
it does that by piecing together images
into mosaics you can actually see the
entire rover and oh you know is there a
laser pointer on this serve oh is it the
red button no okay there we go so one of
these craters here is actually Gale
Crater which is with a crater that we
landed the rover on Mars in August of
2012 but to start off with the talk I
wanted to play a video and this video is
called seven minutes of Terror some of
you may have seen it because it went
viral if you haven't seen it then you'll
enjoy it so and this talks about the
challenges of landing something the size
of a small car on the surface of the
planet Mars starting from a speed of
around 13,000 miles an hour so you
couldn't click in there
when people look at it it looks crazy
that's a very natural thing sometimes
when we look at it it looks crazy it is
the result of reasoned engineering
thought but it still looks crazy
the top of the atmosphere down to the
surface
it takes a seven minutes it takes 14
minutes or so for the signal from the
spacecraft to make it to earth that's
how far Mars is away from us so when we
first get word that we touched the top
of the atmosphere
the vehicle has been a lot
we're dead on the surface for at least
seven minutes
entry descent and landing also known as
EDL is referred to as a seven minutes of
Terror because we've got literally seven
minutes to get from the top the
atmosphere to the surface of Mars going
from 13,000 miles an hour to zero and
perfect sequence perfect choreography
perfect timing and the computer has to
do it all by itself would no help from
the ground if any one thing doesn't work
just right it's game over we slam into
the atmosphere and developed so much
aerodynamic drag our heat shield it
heats up and it glows like the surface
of the Sun 1600 degrees during entry the
vehicles not already slowing down
violently through the atmosphere but
also they are guiding like an airplane
to be able to land in a very narrow
constrained space this is one of the
biggest challenges that we're facing and
one that we have never attempted on Mars
Mars is actually really hard to slow
down because it has just enough
atmosphere that you have to deal with it
otherwise it will destroy your
spacecraft on the other hand it doesn't
have enough atmosphere to finish the job
we're still going about a thousand miles
an hour
so at that point we use a parachute a
parachute is the largest and strongest
supersonic parachute that we've ever
built to date it has to be able to
withstand sixty five thousand pounds of
force even though the parachute itself
only weighs about 100 pounds when it
opens up that fast it's a neck snapping
nine G's at that point we have to get
that heat shield off it's like a big
lens cap blocking our view of the ground
to the radar the radar has to take just
the right altitude and velocity
measurements at just the right time or
the rest of the landing sequence won't
work
this big huge parachute that we've got
will only slow us down to about 200
miles now that's not slow enough to land
so we have no choice but we gotta cut it
off and come down in Rockets once you
turn those rocket motors on you don't do
something weird you're gonna smack right
back into the parachute so the first
thing we do is make this really radical
diver can either fly off to the side
diverting away from the parachute
killing our horizontal velocity and our
vertical velocity getting the rover
moving straight up and down so to look
at the surface with its radar and see
where we're going to land when we head
straight down to the bottom of a crater
right beside six kilometer high note
we can't get those rocket engines to
post-event because if you were to
descend compulsively with our engines
all the way to the ground we would
essentially create this massive dust
cloud that dust cloud could then go and
land on the road it could damage
mechanisms and it could damage
instruments so the way we solve that
problem is by using the sky created 20
metres above the surface we have to
lower the rover below us or it's heaven
it's 21 feet long and then gently
deposited on its wheels Harvester
as the rover touches down and is now on
the ground the descent state it's in a
collision course with a robot we must
cut the bridle immediately and flight in
the same stage away to a safe distance
from the road
so as you know we were successful we
landed it on August 5th of 2012 and it
was uh it was a great feat for certainly
the team at JPL on the team all over
NASA who developed the rover it was a
great feat for all humanity because the
data that we collect with the rover is
actually open to the entire public
domain for anyone to analyze and for
anyone to understand so that is a great
movie that we put together but now I'm
gonna talk to you as to why do we
actually explore Mars and the reason why
you explore Mars is that we want to
understand about how Mars evolved so
this picture here you can see the planet
on the left is Earth the plan of the
rightest Mars and you can see an obvious
difference right Mars is very dry it
doesn't have any water on the surface it
doesn't look like it has much of an
atmosphere whereas Earth has you know
oceans in a thick atmosphere but what
planetary scientists believe is that the
formation of the solar system Mars and
Earth actually used to be the same as
each other in terms of actually having
water and a thick atmosphere so what
happened why is it that Earth is still a
beautiful place to live but planets like
Venus and Mars are actually inhospitable
so Venus by contrast has an incredibly
thick atmosphere not 470 degrees
centigrade on the surface and 100
atmospheres of pressure whereas Mars has
almost no atmosphere about 1% of what we
have here on earth
purely carbon dioxide and no appreciable
water flowing on the surface so we don't
know how or why the planets evolved the
way we do and will we answer those
questions by sending spacecraft to visit
those planets and then if you were lucky
be able to send Rovers and Landers to
drive around the surface of the planet
that collect important scientific
information and then the other reason
why is that eventually we'll leave this
planet and there are different
destinations that we can go to and one
of the most likely destinations that we
go to to send future human colony is
Mars it's not that far away and it does
actually have resources on the surface
that we can utilize so some interesting
facts about Mars is um the day on Mars
who thinks the day on Mars is shorter
than Earth chopin's longer it's a little
bit longer
it's about 24.6 hours so that's actually
very similar to Earth Day which means
that yes you have a point six hours
every day which means that the people
who drive the rover end up having to
work in the middle of night sometimes
during the month but in general it
wouldn't be that difficult for our body
to be able to acclimate to that news or
circadian rhythm cycle now because Mars
is smaller the grab
is less than it is on earth so it's
about one-third the gravity so that has
some deleterious effects on the human
body in the sense that we're used to you
know operating 1g so if people were born
on Mars they would have very difficult
time living on earth and even if you've
seen that movie John Carter maybe they'd
be able to jump really high and they'd
actually be taller than they are so we
don't know that's an interesting aside
but from a infrastructure perspective
since the gravity is lower it's actually
going to be easier for us to you know
install large structures for example or
move large objects around now an
interesting fact about Mars is that it
does have a wide range of temperatures
so even though it does get very cold in
the polar regions during the night time
in the winter season it can actually get
up to around the California winter time
of around 40 degrees Fahrenheit in the
equatorial regions during the daylight
so the temperature isn't that
inhospitable from a human colonization
perspective now of course the primary
problem is that it doesn't have much of
an atmosphere is about 1% of the
atmospheric density on the surface as it
is as compared to earth and the
atmosphere is made up of co2 and
obviously we can't breathe co2 but you
can see in co2 there's an o2 so if you
can electrolyze that you'd actually be
able to make use of some of the
institute resources on Mars to actually
provide an oxygen supply for example now
from a planetary science perspective
which is primarily what we do at JPL is
trying to understand how the planets
evolved how the universe evolved and
where we're headed next Mars has a
really fascinating history so the
picture you see on the upper right
Olympus Mons is actually a volcano an
extinct volcano and it's actually the
largest mountain air solar system it's
about three times as high as Mount
Everest so what that means is that at
some point in Mars has passed had a very
active geological history but now that
geological history or that geological
activity appears to be dead and we don't
understand why could that somehow be
related to why there's no longer an
atmosphere we don't know and so that's
why making these measurements and
sending the spacecraft and Rovers there
helps us to answer the question and then
you can kind of see down here this is
called the Earth's Marineris it's the
scar that goes across the center of a
planet and it's Mars's version of the
Grand Canyon but it's about six times as
deep so that means probably at some
point in Mars has passed it did have a
lot of water flowing on the surface
creating these amazing surface features
but where did the water go did it all
disappear and evaporate or is it frozen
in the subsurface if it's frozen in the
subsurface and it's
available for future human colonization
to use potentially so does who thinks
Mars has moons it does it has two moons
Phobos and Deimos now these a little bit
different looking than our moon they're
smaller which means that they haven't
turned into sort of a spherical object
due to the you know compression under
their own gravitational force so they
still look potato shaped so one of the
candidate architecture is to actually
set up a colony that actually lands on
these moons first which is much easier
since the moons are small they have very
low gravitational acceleration much
easier to land on a loggia body than the
high-g body and then eventually have
people there go from there down to the
surface of Mars so we actually could use
these moons for mining resources as well
they could have minerals that we would
need for a future human colony and they
may actually have water froze in the
mirror interior which could be mined and
used by future human use now who thinks
me falling under water on Mars
show of hands we have so one of the
tenants of the Mars exploration program
we have at NASA is to follow the water
and so that's we've been doing for the
past I guess 15 years or so and we know
that large bodies of water did once
exist on the surface and we've actually
found water to date so the picture that
you can see on the lower left here this
was taken underneath the Phoenix lander
in 2005 and as the lander was coming in
its retro propulsive descent towards the
surface it's jet engines were actually
kicking up all the dust on the surface
and they exposed this icy patch beneath
and so we believe this to be salt water
ice so it's a Brian type of mixture so
you know but at perhaps evidence of a
past ocean and we know from
spectroscopic measurements that we've
taken from orbit that in the polar
regions there is also a lot of frozen
water which means that yes some of the
water may have evaporated but a lot of
the water it probably still is in the
subsurface
a frozen state in this Bryan state so
another fascinating recent finding is
that there's actually flowing water we
think on the surface of Mars very thin
very small flows but we've located these
places all across the planet called
gullies off the sides of cliff faces on
these impact craters or it appears that
at certain times of the year things flow
out of the sides of the cliff faces and
we don't know what that is but we can
speculate that that actually could be
water in the subsurface aquifers as the
heats up and cools it's tilted and it's
actually like Earth actually melts and
comes out the side and here's another
picture here which shows you over a
three month period these flows coming
off of the sides of these edges of these
spaces and so we have never been to
these locations yet we've taken all
these pictures from orbit with the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter but this is a
potential future destination that we
could go to if we can come up with a
rover which repels down the side of the
cliff face for example so the really
interesting thing about Mars though it's
a very difficult place to land so the
United States is the only country that's
actually been successful in sending
something to land on Mars the Russians
had failed previously and the European
Union had failed previously and they
actually recently found evidence of the
crash-landed beagle lander which gave
them some indication of what went wrong
but to date we've only done it here at
NASA in the United States we've had
seven successful landings to Viking
landers in the 1970s the Pathfinder
Sojourner Rover which is tiny little
baby Rover during the 1990s Spirit and
Opportunity the Mars exploration Rovers
in the early 2000s Phoenix lander which
was a lander more towards the polar
regions of Mars in the mid 2000s and
then most recently of course curiosity
which landed in August of 2012 under
mechs mission coming up actually in 2016
which is in sight which is going to be a
lander which is gonna look for Mars
quakes so remember I mentioned before
about the past
volcanic activity it's actually going to
search and see whether I can sense any
detection of any vibrations on the
surface in the location that it's going
to and seems are some of the interesting
pictures that we've taken over the
course of the years when you visited
Mars you know what we do use and I'm
sure you use in your field as well as
you you learn from all your past
experiences and this shows you the
evolution your Rover technology over the
past I guess 20 years or so so this is
the Sojourner Rover you can see here
baby-sized rover it was sort of the
return of the Mars program in the mid
1990s spirt an opportunity Rovers here
you know say so big and then of course
our more sophisticated Curiosity rover
which uses nuclear power as opposed to
solar arrays that the other two Rovers
do which gives it much more capability
I'll talk about that a little bit later
but you can see in terms of size the
reason why we make them larger is it
gives you a larger wheelbase if you have
a larger wheelbase you can carry more
payload you can do more science so
that's really why you have a larger
Rovers you could maintain the same sir
pressure and increase your scientific
capabilities so the Mars Science
Laboratory mission has a very unique
purpose from all emissions before and
it's actually to determine whether or
not Mars could once have been habitable
and so it has a very advanced suite of
instruments to make that determination
and specifically looking for the
presence of organics because you can't
have life we don't believe that organics
and to be able to detect organics
requires far more sophisticated suite of
instruments than has been sent in the
past and it happens to be a much heavier
much larger instrument hence the larger
Rover we also had a very specific desire
to go to a location on the surface which
we think would have been more likely to
be habitable in the other so I would say
curiosity was probably the first mission
to Mars where the science community
actually drove the selection of the
landing site versus the other way around
versus this is where we think we can
land you what can you do there this is
the case where they wanted to land there
and we decided to make a very precise
entry descent landing system to get them
there so that means precision landing
and being able to land something much
heavier for the scientific capability
and so this is a suite of some of the
technologies which I'll walk through in
a video which is a bit more explanatory
but it's a couple to what I was saying
before in terms of worried we want to go
the science community has access to very
detailed images of the surface of the
planet so by taking a look at the
surface features with the highrise
instrument on board the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter they can actually
make a determination that that looks to
be a very interesting landing site and
they selected Gale Crater because they
believe that to be the site of an
ancient water body so either a riverbed
or a lake bed and we're better to assess
where life could have once been or where
life even could still be than in the
base of a water body and then as you
know anything about no geology when you
have water it lays down instead of
sedimentary rock layers which allows you
to investigate sort of changes over time
so it allow you to give better insight
into the evolution of the planet and the
picture up top is sort of a Mercator
projection map of Mars where you can see
the different locations that we've
landed in the past so here's the Mars
exploration over here and here's gerd
crater over here so of course you'll
never actually drive from that location
to that location so there are very
distinct locations to give us new
scientific information and so the goal
of the rover from a science perspective
then is to determine sort of the
biological potential of the planet by
taking a look at the presence of
organics from a mineralogical
perspective
and from an elemental perspective and
understand how water actually played
that role in the determination of the
objects that we look at and then a very
unique measurement that hasn't been done
before is the measurement of radiation
on the surface because as we all know
radiation is bad right it causes cancer
radiation destroys DNA destroys RNA so
if the surface radiation levels are too
high and then that would suggest that
whatever organisms do exist perhaps they
couldn't exist on the surface they would
have to exist on the subsurface and then
also for the purposes of future human
living on the planet surface you'd want
to understand what the radiation levels
were so you would know how to develop
enough shielding to keep out those
radiation levels to keep people safe
so that's a very unique measurement so
this gives you a nice view of where it
was we were trying to land so this is
Gale Crater in the middle of Gale Crater
you can see Mount sharp which is a six
kilometre high mountain and on the edge
of the crater you can see the crater
wall so what that means from a landing
accuracy perspective we have to have
enough precision so that we wouldn't hit
the side of the mountain or hit the side
of the crater so that actually drove us
to a much more precise landing system
than we've ever done before
basically by an order of magnitude
improvement and in terms of the size of
our landing ellipse which is our
statistical estimate of the range of
space on the surface that we may land
because of uncertainties wind
uncertainties and aerodynamic properties
this is how we determined how precise
our landing system needed to be to avoid
either landing onto the side of the
crater or letting us inside of the
mountain you get an idea of basically
how big this is relative to the size of
downtown Los Angeles I don't have a
chance to look up what the size of
downtown Chicago
what's a reference but you're probably
not all perfect I'll go anyway so now
this is our bullseye map on Mars so the
reason why this is important to explain
the engineering complexity is that the
prior emissions to Mars this is the
Viking mission this is their landing
ellipse 174 miles wide
this was the landing ellipse requirement
for curiosity so it's you know an order
of magnitude or more improvement of what
had been done in the past so we have to
fly out all those uncertainties by
essentially flying the rover using lift
modulator or modulation of the lift
vector to be able to target to where we
want it to go that's all done
autonomously because it can't be done
from Earth so it was a very unique
engineering challenge from that
perspective so if you can click into
this video I'll talk you through a
little bit more of the technical
challenges so you can you can play
of eating ell and a planetary
atmospheres you actually use aerodynamic
drag to slow yourself down so even
though the Martian atmosphere is thin
it's still there the early enemy drag
actually takes out a lot of energy takes
out about 90% 95% of the energy during
the descent on the heat shield then the
heat shield actually prevent you from
basically burning up when you get down
to around a thousand miles an hour you
actually can't slow down anymore you've
hit terminal velocity so you deploy a
supersonic parachute that slows you down
to around 200 miles an hour
then you pick terminal velocity again
you can't slow down any further then you
have to use retro rockets to take out
the rest of your velocity and the rest
of your kinetic energy and we decided to
do something slightly different here
from Viking and from NER and from
Phoenix and that was to not go retro
propulsive all the way to the ground but
instead use the sky crane maneuver to
increase the distance between the exit
plane of those engines in the ground to
prevent too much dust from being picked
up and to allow the rover to be the
actual landed platform so it looks very
complicated very sophisticated it was it
required a lot of modeling and
simulation actually to get us to where
we need it to be but it allowed us to
land a much larger payload with more
precision and on a surface with a higher
ground slope which is of interest to the
science community so that was the
architecture that we developed and we
certainly built off of oh you can get
off the video now actually so this is
kind of a 2 dimensional view of the
entry descent and landing system Soyuz
aerodynamic drag for those of you who
don't know what aerodynamic drag is if
you're going on the freeway you put your
arm up the window you feel the buffeting
force on your arm that's aerodynamic
drag so that actually slows you down and
if you take out about about 95% of your
energy during this hypersonic to
supersonic descent stage on the heat
shield but I always give this example to
little kids but you know when you rub
your hands together they get warm sort
of friction so if you think of the
friction with the atmosphere it actually
causes the heat shield to reach the
surface temperature of the Sun that's
pretty hot right and so you have a very
specific technology called a heat shield
which accommodates that energy by
essentially burning up and dissipating
it protecting the rover inside it
essentially a room temperature so
imagine that surface temperature of the
Sun room temperature inside a pretty big
thermal challenge more so than what you
have to deal with in a computer I think
but some fans footwork so like I said
you can't go any slower because the
atmosphere or so then you've reached her
to deploy a very large parachute the
size of the parachute has to be much
larger on Murs than it does on earth
because the atmosphere is so thin so
this is actually a great example our
parachute basically was the size of this
room pretty much so it had to be that
big to handle a little tiny Rover
because the atmosphere is so thin and we
were going so fast we actually go two
times the speed of sound is when the
parachute gets deployed once again you
hit terminal velocity you have to do the
rest on retrorockets and if you if you
want to ask me questions as to why we
use airbags on one versus a Rockets on
the other I'll tell you offline but okay
so my primary role in the mission was
the development of a supersonic
parachute so I'm gonna show you some
parachute videos because those are a lot
of fun but Mars parachute is the same
thing as an earth parachute has anyone
here done any sport parachuting okay I
won't because I've seen too many
parachutes blow up I was tempted to and
I'm like no that thing just turned
inside out and crash-landed so it's not
gonna happen but it's a little bit
different because in supersonic
environment you have incredible
aerodynamic instability that you don't
get here on earth but our parachute 70
feet in diameter you can see the size of
the people in the car there emily is a
very specific parachute which designed
for use in supersonic conditions and
here gives you another this is an
international regulation sized football
fields you can fit about six of them in
there that's how big it is and you can
play this video so the way that we make
sure that a parachute works is we have
to test it if you can click into the
video sorry and so one of the ways we
tested is we actually drop it off the
helicopter let it accelerate to the
right velocity with earth based density
to give us the same load that it would
see on Mars and so this is when the very
first test that we did it looks very
beautiful looks like a jellyfish like to
call it we had one that failed miserably
before this I didn't show you that one
but but it was it was interesting but we
learned from our mistakes and we fix it
so so I always like to show this because
I can see that your community has the
same problem that my community has
insufficient number of women in the
field so and I would like to encourage
you with daughters out there to please
encourage them to you know do something
in STEM science technology engineering
math because there's not enough women in
your field in my field and that needs to
be changed so if you want to play this
video so this is really interesting so
this is what a parachute actually does
on Mars compared to what I first showed
you it
spirits is something called an area
oscillation which is a supersonic
instability which causes the parachute
to collapse and inflate collapsing
inflate and can actually destroy it so
the challenge of the mission from mSL's
perspective was to understand what that
environment was going to be like at two
times the speed of sound and design a
parachute to survive that without ever
being able to test it in this type of
environment it's impossible because you
would have you have to basically spend
200 million dollars just to do a single
test and then your mission will get
canceled and so the way we solve that
problem is we used physics and we use
computational fluid dynamics we actually
use supercomputer clusters to run
simulations of basically differential
equations coated up into the
supercomputer cluster to see actually
how the parachute behave by defining the
aerodynamic environment and so you can
click into this one this is one of our
very sophisticated simulations so this
is showing you basically the flow field
but in terms of Mach number which is non
dimensionalized velocity and the rover
basically is inside of something called
an entry vehicle which produces a lot of
turbulence it's sort of like a lot of
energy is cascading off at the back of
it that nasty-looking flow then goes
inside of the parachute and then causes
it to collapse inflate collapsing
inflate and nobody knew why this
happened before until we actually went
off and ran these simulations so in the
past they couldn't have done this
because they didn't have access to
supercomputers they didn't have access
to advanced computational tools so this
is my plug for your industry here that
we use computer simulations for just
about everything nowadays because it
allows us to be much more sophisticated
to be able to design something ahead of
time instead of doing guess and check
guess in check so if we go to the the
next slide Lia also made little tiny
parachutes and put them in a wind tunnel
which simulates the Martian environment
to make sure that our computer
simulations would actually work so we
use the concept of verification and
validation in the aerospace engineering
field just like you do for testing out
your simulations so we did these
experiments purposely to validate our
computer simulations to know that we
could trust what they were actually
telling us you can click into this video
here so this was one taken with my
iPhone I think
so I think iPhone maybe have like 30
frames per second 50 frames per second
so definitely tell us think so we go to
the next one you can cook in this video
we use high speed imaging at 3,000
frames per second this is actually
what's happening to one of these little
parachutes they're collapsing or plating
collapse and inflating and so this is
obviously sped up so you get or slowed
down or others that you can see it and
then we used um photogrammetric
reconstruction techniques to actually do
image processing to define what the
shape of the parachute was as a function
of time and so we use little dots just
like they do in Hollywood and then use a
particle tracking algorithm and a
computer simulation to actually tell you
what that shape is as a function of time
and you can correlate it to the load and
there's other engineering parameters you
can get off of so this is actually how
we validated this parachute to make sure
that it would survive on Mars is with
the computer simulations and validating
our computer simulations with
experiments so that's kind of a
something unique that we've never done
before
now this is another fun one just as also
another side you can put it you can play
this video so this is something called a
Schiller video it's an interferometric
technique which actually allows you to
see how the density is changing in front
of the parachute so this is actually
what's happening is that you can
actually see the flow being sucked out
of the parachute being pushed back in
sucked back out pushed back in and
because of that it causes the parachute
to collapse and inflate collapsin
inflate so we understood from a physics
perspective what actually happened and
then we were able to use this to define
what the load would be at the smaller
scale and then scale it up to the full
size to determine how strong we need to
make the parachute so this is how we're
able to use computer simulations and
experimental techniques to validate our
approach that we could design a very
strong parachutes that worked out well
for us so my primary portion of the
mission was in developing and qualified
the parachute and also working partially
on the sky crane but I won't talk about
anymore now I'll focus more on the rover
and some of the interesting science
information that we've already collected
so this is curiosity curiosity is
basically the size and the mass of a
mini-cooper
am I hardly behind schedule by the way
or is it okay okay so this is curiosity
actually my friend who wants my
undergraduate school who amazingly I
never knew was working in the project
like how the later is working on it and
so the rover has to have eyes right
because the rover drives around
autonomously on the surface of Mars so
it uses its eyes or its cameras to
tech hazards as well as to take collect
scientific information and so it uses
once again image processing within
itself to detect those hazards and avoid
them so it doesn't drive off a cliff for
example so it's always very much couple
but something but is interesting this is
more from the hardware side of your
industry is that space computers are
probably bout ten to fifteen years
behind commercial computers you know for
home use and that's because of the
radiation environment so it takes a long
time a lot of money to qualify something
for use in radiates high radiation
environment otherwise we'll just fail
basically so a rover also has to have
the ability just like you'd like to
touch somebody or touch something if you
went to Mars the rover also has to have
the ability to touch things so it can
make contact measurements and so it has
a drill it has a scoop and so it's
actually able to determine what's going
on in the subsurface so like for example
if you touch the top of the table you
would think the table was made out of
cotton when in fact it may be out of
woods you have to take the tablecloth
off determine what it is so we have two
scotch off the top of the rocks to be
able to determine what the composition
of the rocks actually are so how long
does it take to get to Mars takes about
nine months but as long as it takes for
human being to gestate so it takes more
years to actually develop the mission
takes anywhere between five to seven
years to develop a mission of this
sophistication now on this particular
mission you can click in this video now
we put a camera on the underside of the
rover so this is the actual view of the
rover to setting towards the surface of
the planet you can actually see the heat
shield falling away so we've never done
this before and so this was done
obviously because it's really awesome to
have this kind of pictures but it has
scientific work has engineering value as
well because with these images in future
we could use image post-processing real
time onboard the rover to use it for a
way to avoid hazards on the ground so it
would see something it would choose to
fly over this wedge fly over that way so
this was our first time demonstrating
this technology being able to collect
these images and then you would have to
be able to post process them real time
to be able to use that to avoid hazards
as you go towards the ground but at this
point it's still rocking back and forth
it's actually on the parachute during
this descent and then all of a sudden
you'll start to see it slow down and
move off to the side that's when it
actually goes off and does the diver at
maneuver which is just pretty neat but
as you can see as we approach the
surface you see a lot of pitting on the
surface this is all inside of Gale
Crater
but even inside of Gale Crater there's
additional craters due to you know
meteorite impacts on the surface so now
we're doing the divert maneuver this is
on the eighth land
engines or retrorockets towards the
surface and then soon you'll see the
start of the sky crane maneuver and the
rover's mobility system will fall down
you'll actually see its wheel in view
that happened just a few minutes and
then at that point in time you start to
see a lot of dust generated so this is
about you know two times the height of
this room the rover's coming down coming
down being loaded on this tether all the
dust is being kicked up because the
engines have so much energy in them that
actually impart themselves into the soil
and so our greatest fear was that we
would get to this point right the the
landing will be successful and then the
bridles wouldn't cut and then the rover
be dragged across the ground and you
know that one have a mission over so
that would been terrible right and so
the very first image that we saw after
landing the rover was command to send an
image of its landing site location back
to us was this image up here on the left
so it was pretty exciting is you can
imagine Mirabal screaming and hugging
each other and you've seen all the funny
movies online it looks like but it's
quite satisfying to have accomplished
that um but at the same time I think it
was about a 15-minute time delay between
Earth and Mars so when we got the signal
that the rover had actually released
from the cruise stage it had already
landed that was the scary parts
everything we were seeing was basically
looking back in time as the telemetry
came in and the really fascinating thing
is that Mars really does look like Earth
it looks like the Nevada desert pretty
much know from an engineer's perspective
this was our calculation of the landing
ellipse where we thought we might land
this is where we actually landed that
means we did a great job so our computer
simulations and here once again we use
Monte Carlo simulations where we run
multiple cases to do a statistical
estimate with all a range of
uncertainties where we think we're gonna
land that's what this landing ellipse is
it gives us I think our Six Sigma
probability of where we're gonna be
based off of those uncertainty so we did
a great job there this is my favorite
picture so we're having this great party
afterwards like 5:00 in the morning and
then finally this image got download we
had the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
shift its locations so that it would be
able to snap a picture of the rover
under the descent of the parachute which
of course means that we have to have
some knowledge what the environment was
gonna be so if the winds were too high
we would missed it we actually got my
picture so of course I'd like that cuz I
mean so it worked great so even if a
crash landed at least I had that picture
knowing the my part worked but but
clearly the whole thing did work and so
you know we've been driving for almost a
thousand Sol's a thousand days on on
Mars ten kilometers because we stopped a
lot to take science measurements along
the way
it's been tremendously successful so far
and so just to give you an idea of some
of the science measurements we've taken
I'll wrap it up with this so we do scoop
the soil so we can scoop the soil we put
it inside of our easy bake oven and we
cook it to determine what the
composition is upper soil so that works
out really well we have something called
chemcam which actually fires a laser at
a rock about this distance away
vaporizes the rock the vaporization
leaves a signature a spectroscopic
signature which allows us to determine
the elemental composition of anything we
like by adapting it with the lasers
that's pretty neat we have a weather
station on board this is a picture of
the weather station and so we're able to
take measurements of the pressure the
temperature and the winds on the surface
of the planet what you can see here is
basically the diurnal variation so we
get hot we get cold we get hot we get
cold as you would expect this system
goes you know behind the surface at the
planet and then another really important
measurement we make is the radiation
levels and what we found is that the
radiation levels are high but they're
not too high we could come up with
shielding to be able to protect people
and the radiation levels during the
daytime when the pressures really thick
are much lower than they are during the
night time where the pressure goes down
which means that the atmosphere is
helping to attenuate some of that
radiation so in fact the transit to Mars
in interplanetary space would be much
worse than the radiation environment on
the surface of the planet which means
that will be our driving radiation case
as opposed to the surface conditions
these are some of the other science
instruments this is our Sam instrument
which is sample analysis on more Mars
this is a mass spectrometer which allows
us to determine the presence of organics
and I think we actually have detected
methane which is an organic and I'd like
to show this laser so it's not as
Extreme as this but but it is how it
works it does vaporize things and you
probably would not want to get in the
way of a blazer because they probably
would have burn a hole in your shirt or
something like that so if you do plan on
going there avoid it and and so here
this is actually that's what it is see
this is a rocks you're seeing before and
after lacings and if you were on twitter
at all during the landing you hear
people saying pew pew pew from the
twitter feed that's what that was for
for the lasing of the frogs and so this
is a view of the underside of the rover
taken by the camera on the edge of the
thing and one of the sad things is one
of the things which is failing initially
is actually the wheels are we're super
thin to make them lightweight because on
any spacecraft
NASA's king or queen and so the wheels
actually have holes in them though but
in some locations because the rocks are
so difficult to drive over this is uh
speaking contact with a large rock which
kind of looks like a pyramid so everyone
would take picture of that one and this
is a really important one which is sort
of confirmation confirmation from a
geological perspective that indeed we
did land in an ancient water body and so
the picture on the left we picture on
the right is what an ancient dried-up
riverbed looks like on earth and this is
what the location that we learned at
Mars so we landed in Gale Crater which
was a lake bed and the level of water
there based off of our analysis of the
rocks was about knee deep so it's pretty
exciting so at some point a long long
time ago there was a lake there which
was about you know two feet deep
anymore of course it's dried up it's
pretty exciting and some other
interesting findings that we found the
presence of phyllosilicates I don't know
viewer chemists but they are formed in
the presence of water also confirming
that it was a waterbed location and the
soil here is actually alkaline and so
soil neutral being neutral is more
habitable for lifetime life forms for
example than and acidic soils that's a
unique findings this location which we
had not found in any of the other
admissions that we've had to Mars so to
wrap it up you can play on this video so
this was the first two years well first
twelve months and two minutes so this is
it takes pictures every single day and
so this is right from landing so this
goes through an entire year's worth of
work so you can see the rover is working
constantly it never gets to sleep but it
does sleep of course at night when the
Sun Goes Down and it just it's pretty
amazing when you see it because it it
really doesn't feel like it's another
planet it really does feel like it's
Earth but in fact it is Mars and
hopefully one day we'll be able to go
there so that's pretty exciting and so
is there intelligence on Mars well guess
clearly because we've sent several
intelligent beings there maybe more next
I don't know who's more intelligent but
and then would you want to live on Mars
right so it is a challenge we would have
to live in habitats right because of the
fact that the density is low and that we
have to provide ourselves with oxygen
but it is something which could be done
and it's actually easier to live on Mars
than it is on space station because the
space station you're in a complete
vacuum right emerge you have gravity and
you have an app you have atmospheric
pressure that you can even pump into
pressurized yourself example so just to
kind of wrap this up you know we had
about over 3000 people worked on this
mission so yes it does cost a lot of
money to create these missions but
they're actually jobs for engineers and
scientists and and for the sake and
purpose of science we have
many countries who work in the
development of the instruments for
example and all of the images that we
collect they're all publicly available
they're all on the web so they're all
for anyone to analyze so the rover isn't
JPL's Rover it isn't NASA's Rover it's
any proposed Rover right because the
data is accessible for anyone to take a
look at and so this was a very recent
picture that got posted within the past
three days which is basically sunset on
Mars and it's pretty beautiful and it
just drives home the point that you know
we do live in the solar system with
other planets and hopefully one day we
can get to those other locations too so
I'm happy to take questions now or
during the dinner about the dinner but
the party afterwards so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
