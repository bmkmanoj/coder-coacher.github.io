sitting through this entire track about
open data Andy government and some real
life things that people are doing with
open data and II government systems and
how we helping citizens live a better
life making a difference to communities
and I'm kind of going to go on to the
flip side the B side of that simply
because that's kind of like the default
position from where I come from and
we're talking about activism and the
relationship between activism and open
data and while we've seen what people
have really done what am I actually
going to do is put down something that I
think that we could do so it is more for
of a thought experiment or a speculative
view of what we need to do to make
ordinary people take control and apply
the right pressures to the rights
organizations and at the right levels so
that's where the activism part comes in
now the word activism if I say you
someone's an activist I don't know what
images come to your mind maybe flower
power you know hippies Greenpeace yeah
okay yeah and they're actually quite
militants right but where I come from
which is south africa you know when you
say you're an activist it is not this
quiet you know single-file walking down
the street it is really really intense
you know you kind of like chant who's
who's you know and then someone will
shout out at a different pitch Papa Papa
and then someone will go Amara Amara
which means power strength and then the
rest of the people will chant back we're
too which is to the people so that is my
history you know once you get tsunami
class waves of people flowing through
the city doing this and it scares the
heck out of everyone so you know I
started off growing up in South Africa
pre 1992 before we became a democracy
you're actually an activist by default
you don't have a choice that's just the
way it was you know and the very first
time I protested was at the age of eight
I was in grade 2 was nineteen
seventy-seven one year before that
children between the ages of 8 to 16
were protesting against having to be
forced to learn in the medium of
Afrikaans not English or not in the NATO
first language and in the year 1976
about 500 kill children were killed as a
result of the protest and some time in
1977 in the school that I was aged 8 the
highest grade we had in that school was
grade 6 so no grade 8 so that's about 12
13 years old and one day after you know
school assembly few of the older kids
walked out onto the field and I followed
them and it was as social activist it
was the worst planned protest ever
because right across the road from our
school was the police station okay and
so they just went knocked on the door
and says please come get these kids back
into the class but most frightening
thing for me as a you know enthusiastic
activists at that stage was the
headmaster come in says that's now I'm
going to tell your father get back into
the class and so I went back into the
class and I didn't do anything for the
next ten years so you know in those
early years growing up you go through
just following the masses in that way
but along the way you basically just
learned how to follow the rules of
society nothing else and it's only when
you get to those teenage years that you
start actually questioning why certain
things are like that and the rules of
society with completely extraordinary
you know you kind of knew when you walk
through town that across that road was
white businesses
we lived on this side and you don't
cross on that side and you stayed on the
side and those restaurants and pubs were
not for us those were for us so just
really really odd for me to explain that
to you but it was so much part of our
lives that it you just like wove into
your life and you said this is what you
didn't this is what you didn't do but in
1985 the state of emergency was declared
and by state of emergency it meant
certain things like you could not be
seen outside after a certain curfew
right off let's say seven pm a gathering
of more than a few people in a public
space was constituted or construed as a
as a protest and you could have been
arrested so it's that kind of life right
and it's at that stage that we started
as students as school kids also
protesting again and a few of my friends
with expelled in all sorts of things but
by the time you get to year later one of
the aspects of powers given to the
security forces with the state of
emergency is that you could detain
someone without trial basically
incarcerate them keep them in jail for
as long as you want and you don't have
to ask any questions and in nineteen
seven 1986 when I was 17 years old my
older brother was four years older than
me was studying at he was doing his
fourth year of medical studies of
becoming a doctor and the university
that he went to was one of the most
active student bodies in terms of
protest and he and many others were in a
protest one day and he was arrested
taken a detention I remember coming home
from school and my parents with their
completely shell-shocked what are we
going to do we don't know even know
which jail or prison he's in how do you
reach him and six weeks later he gets
released six weeks in detention without
trial and what do you feel as the
seventeen-year-old is just anger and
hatred that's all nothing else complete
anger and hatred
you know and then you grow up and you
start going to university and and then
you start understanding a little bit
more and you start getting a bit more
organized as someone who's involved in
social protest at about the same time
the trade unions got together and united
under one Federation known as a
configuration or Congress of South
African trade unions cassato and they
were mostly motivated by socialists
thinking and the worker comes first and
they had the slogan called the people
shall govern you know and used to have
protests signed something like that and
we as students had t-shirts called the
purple shall govern and it's because
when we were protesting the security
forces used to come up with a huge
tanker and in this water tanker was not
water but purple paint and there was a
guy that SAT there and he just sprayed
us and if you ended up with purple paint
you were the enemy and you got picked up
and you got jailed etc so insane things
like that and nineteen ninety three four
sword we actually were on the brink of a
civil war the person you see here his
name is chris hani his assassination
almost led to a civil war at that time
he was considered most probably the
second most popular leader black leader
after Nelson Mandela that in the country
his assassination was untimely in the
middle of negotiations of how to
transition to a better government and
the irony is that his his assassination
accelerated the effort towards a
democratic first election in 1994 so if
you lived in that period as I have you
don't have a choice you have to be part
of the system of this and so around
I look at my life in to eat in two
phases now you know pre 1992 and post
1992 and I now see it as a privilege
when I speak to people that I actually
lived through both periods and in a
couple years time if I'm still alive
it'll be I will be in a position we all
have lived under democracy for longer
than when I've learned that lived under
pressure and that's a significant thing
for me so I hope to live to that time
but the question in terms of the theme
of this track is that would data have
made a difference to us in those
distinct periods what data have made a
difference to what we were doing you
know and as a geek and as a software
developer like many of you I want to
believe it is I really do you know so
that is my natural instinct to say yeah
of course you know data is everything
but I'm not sure about that and so I'm
going to test that uncertainty of mine
by sharing with you a little bit more so
this was this is the second most
beautiful you know city being
represented at this conference this is
Cape Town ok that's a google image
Google Earth image on that side and this
is slightly off short just taking this
photograph of it we have this crazy
mountain in the middle called Table
Mountain it's now been voted as a
natural wonder of the world but it
messes up everything from transport and
even cell phone towers and coverage and
things like that but most of you would
see this bottom photograph but I'm
interested in the top corner up there
which is a place called Chi leecher
which is a suburb in Cape Town it's it's
an interesting server it actually means
in in the dominant language of the
people who originally lived there that
the cause our people it its name the
name Kiley Jeanine's new home and so
this is the extent of which it actually
occupies of cape town right and the
coastline along that part is actually
quite dramatic it's a dramatically
beautiful coastline white sandy beaches
a few places with a scraggy rocky
coastline that just dips away
but if we go in a little bit closer
right every little square rectangle that
you see there is actually a house it
really is all right and you'll see that
some roads are just informally just made
by people walking but if we go down to
street level this is what you see these
are the houses that you see now yes they
are very very poor people living here
but their families living here there's
people where two parents are working at
a very low paying job right what was
probably two or three kids maybe four
kids that are going to school and they
live here and they will build a house
out of anything that they find and this
is a dramatic two sides to South African
life that you have people erecting up
their own houses and yet we have an
obligation from the city or government
perspective to provide them with
electricity so you have this cobweb of
electricity just going out to little
shacks and if you put up your house you
know over in a couple of hours and you
don't have electricity you help yourself
you know it's dangerous but you do and
look at that you know it's something
about a testament to human tenacity that
someone will so find a satellite dish
and put it up on the shack but another
part of Kylie chia is that there's
almost no bulk sewage so what we have
there those glue little things are
portable toilets that you might find at
a rock concert or something like that
and a company won the contract to
actually install this drug Kylie teacher
and its dotted all over the place and
they have a service level agreement to
come and clean it but they don't okay
they absolutely don't and so we have
these chemical toilets being shared by
multitude of these shacks these
houses because there isn't sufficient
box bulk sewage installed in the suburb
and so people protested this year I'm
talking about this year June this year
people started protesting is in the most
shocking means possible that is they
took the contents of these portable
toilets bagged them and started putting
them at city offices so you'll see up
here Cape Town it became known as the
pool Wars Cape Town to 180 people
arrested if you look at right at the
bottom a group actually managed to get
to Cape Town International Airport and
make a deposit as well right but it was
quite frenetic you know there's people
here ordinary people living in this
substandard conditions that stood up and
actually started telling everyone hey
this is not on we want better service
okay but what happened was that those
two newest articles there those two
links or the first one is DA's
Democratic Alliance is the official
opposition to the present party that's
holding government and so on that side
is the ANC and so it degraded into a
battle for political points who's next
year's the next election so why did
nearly 4 million residents of Cape Town
not know about this issue sooner it's
not that it the toilets were installed
last or a week before that been
installed it for a long long time you
know how widespread is it is an only 4k
leecher or are the other parts of cape
town that are also affected most
importantly for me as a citizen of Cape
Town is that why did we let this become
a political battle as opposed to a
people battle and so my perception is
that because it was 180 200 people that
were just making noise again growing
useless losses right that kind of stuff
and the media feeds into that you know
and and it and the media is also
responsible for creating this perception
that it is a political battle but let's
look at some of the data behind that and
I did some trolling to try to find some
of this data
so Kyle each itself is about 29 square
kilometers an extent there's about
400,000 people living in khayelitsha
right and that's just a fact okay and
that reaches to your mind and in your
mind you study in your thinking about
what does this fact mean 400,000 people
okay 400,000 people means it's about
thirteen thousand seven hundred people
per square kilometer put you in a
different way so if I stood here like
this i mean my wingspan is more than a
meter but a square meter on average is
14 people standing here the square meter
on average that's a density of living in
Khayelitsha okay there's about 2,000
people that share about on average 11
flush toilets 2,000 people all right so
we're taking some facts and we're
distilling it down and to give you some
idea if everyone in Denmark had to live
in that same density at that same
density Denmark only needs to be about
400 square kilometers alright so that's
the density that we're talking about so
what I'm actually doing with you is that
I'm actually taking some raw data and
i'm distilling it down into some facts
that reaches not just your mind but your
heart as well okay and that is what we
need to do with data it touches the mind
but we need to also touch the heart and
so another way i can say that is that
you know 180 people per flush toilet or
on average people in khayelitsha need to
queue up every eight minutes to use the
toilet once in a day if you want to use
a flush toilet that's what it means but
to make this appeal even more to your
heart and not your mind 25 kilometers
away birdseye 25 kilometers away there's
another suburb called durbanville
roughly the same size and extent which
is about 27 square kilometers it has
55,000 people living there right that's
about two thousand people per square
kilometer and has you know I said one
flush toilet but it's a middle-class
income suburb and there's most probably
two bathrooms at how
and an average for people use two
bathrooms 25 kilometers apart and we
have this such a contrast now from an
activism point of view what we want to
do is bring awareness to this imbalance
it's not that we're actually know how to
solve it solving it is a different
problem because to achieve the same
ratio of people to flush toilets in
collegiate have to build a hundred
thousand toilets in Khayelitsha I don't
think we could even do that right now so
we have to come up with other solutions
but as an activist you're going to bring
attention to this problem and you want
to appeal to the minds of people so
where did I find this data the data is
out there it's not all open data so i
trolled statistics south africa i did a
contract with them also knew some people
in statistics south africa gave me some
census data so i could get you know most
latest population stuff there's a report
of the Cailleach in django toilet social
audit which was an NGO that went around
and did an audit of this Shengo is the
name of the company that was awarded
contract there's a website open data for
africa which has some information as
well wikipedia has summoned but we know
what wikipedia is like and various
qualitative information from various
websites and i went through the various
websites and was actually the effort of
correlating what data is most probably
correct by looking at it from different
angles so you zone in and triangulate to
get some accurate data so what would we
do differently if we had access to data
what if everyone had access to this data
what would we do differently the thing
is that you know if you just offer data
to social activists they have no idea
what to do with it they can't do
anything with their data it's a very
little value until it is geeks like us
that have the ability to write software
to manipulate data to distill it into
knowledge into fact
and the way we present that and offer
that to our colleagues on the social
side who are standing on the street in
protesting that is the way we actually
reach out and make people aware of the
efforts and campaigns for certain things
so it is about distillation into facts
that appeal to hearts and minds and in
that order hearts and minds a classic
example of this is actually algos An
Inconvenient Truth they took a large
volume of data crunched it down whether
you agree with his views or not it
doesn't matter and it wasn't about the
documentary it was the dramatic
visualizations then he actually put up
that stick with people do one or two
facts are of an hour long or hour and a
half long documentary that stick with
people so that's what sticks so it's a
stick ability of this data that we're
after as social activists and so we have
this concept of open data and digital
activists need to discover things in the
state that's what we're after right and
when we discover that we want to share
that and when we share that it becomes
common knowledge it's easily digestible
anyone could read this understand what
it means it evokes a feeling in you and
social activists need to share they need
to take this common knowledge or
knowledge and make it common by sharing
it and distributing it to the right
people and bringing an awareness to us
right so open data for digital activist
is the freedom to destroy is the freedom
to discover something in data and social
activists about the freedom to
distribute so there's many aspects which
I think are necessary for this freedom
to discover but I'm going to pick up on
three things and the first one is
friction and sharing of data sets the
second one is how do we actually
combined data and the third one is that
why do I even have to find out which
server it's on I should just I should
just find it right
but as a prerequisite and this comes
from the Free Software Foundation
efforts and of which from which open
data was born out of I like to refer to
as software freedoms as opposed to free
software free software confuses people
as it is free you don't have to pay
anything for it but these are these
appeal to our human rights so software
freedoms is about the freedom to execute
and modify software freedom to
distribute it freedom to share changes
and on the open data side data freedoms
as freedom to access reuse redistribute
available as a whole and it's machine
readable now these are normally codified
in licenses like GPL and others so it's
normally codified in that that's what
those licenses give you it gives you a
way to actually describe that these
freedoms are being honored but let's
just look at this frictionless sharing
of data with open data it's an attention
on one side you you wish you had some
kind of standardized format and the
promises that if you have the standard
format and then everything will be
easily shareable right and at the other
side there's let's just produce data in
the lowest common denominator and if
it's in the lowest common denominator
it's equally shareable right but the
problem is that when we start creating
standards especially around data we have
a tendency to go overboard and start
adorning it to make it as rich as
possible right so we end up with these
huge monstrosity of standards which
actually feel really difficult to do
comply to and the problem with the
lowest common denominator is that whoops
hold on is that they're completely
anemic by anaamika means there's no
richness to the data they don't you
there's not much more you can pick out
apart from a value and may perhaps the
name of what the data represents but the
constraint is actually metadata the
things about the data that's important
that's what the constraint is with the
standards-based you're going to have to
provide that metadata pretty early
right so there's a cost attached to
providing metadata with anemic you know
close common denominator you never know
when you want to get that metadata and
if you'll get it at all and so we have
this challenge around metadata and I
believe it's the challenge that's not
going to go away you know but to give
you an idea about what we mean by
metadata any concept can be described in
two parts which is its meaning its
definition within a context and the
variables that which we can use to
measure this concept and that's the main
type range of values and sometimes we
classify that these ranges mean these
things these values for color represent
green is a choice but it's really
important that we get this right and so
why is this important so I'll give you
an example how do you compare poverty
between two countries it turns out you
know and it's from my time that I spent
with statistics south africa that
poverty is a very controversial problem
to define it's a really controversial
thing right so if we had to try to do
that there's a whole bunch of different
organizations that have defined poverty
in different ways and this is just a
poverty threshold the US Census Bureau
the World Bank UNESCO World Health
organized all have different definitions
and methodologies and mountains of
research has gone into defining a
poverty threshold the US Census Bureau
has about 48 poverty thresholds South
Africa has two when I think maybe we
need a little bit more but South
africa-based their work on the World
Bank and it was an adjustment for
sub-saharan economies and one of the
adjustment was that what's the cost of
firewood for heat right whereas everyone
else is what's the cost of electricity
who we talking about firewood so there's
a kind of just minus have so we can't
talk about poverty unless we talk about
the metadata and it means that we can't
actually compare poverty between
countries unless we have the metadata
even with the metadata it becomes
but we have a better chance no metadata
no analysis as simple as that the error
margins are far too high our
interpretation of that is far too loose
so the problem with the strict data
format is that it creates a high barrier
to entry to become to become
participatory in sharing your data sets
when you have a standard it means that
we have to put effort to comply to that
and that compliance is actually a choice
you know I can choose whether I want to
comply to the standard or not it doesn't
make a difference with I don't but the
cost of metadata doesn't go away at some
point I have to provide this data
whether it's late or early a front or in
flight it doesn't matter so there's a
notion here that perhaps we just need
the simplest extensible format for
metadata and the lowest common
denominator for the actual data and I
was pleased to find the open knowledge
foundation has a data package standard
that they're promoting which i think is
a step in the right direction and by
their own choice it's jason which is
reasonably extendable they don't impose
any particular structure to that but you
use json for metadata and csv for data
and you take the two and you bundle it
up and that becomes a data package that
you can share with people between people
so that's a step in the right direction
whether it's jason or y am awake somali
doesn't matter but it's that separation
of let's focus the standards that's
extensible on on metadata and use the
lowest common denominator for the data
itself the next one is too hard remix in
how do you compose how do you actually
do that how how do you actually work
with the data how do we want to work
with the data as a digital activist and
so when you do lower the barrier for
sharing data sets you lower the barrier
for getting in and that is what you're
talking about by frictionless data sets
then the constraint shifts to how do you
get facts out how do you get knowledge
out I throw data in how do I get
knowledge out so the constraint shifts
to that
and it's not an easy problem to solve
not at all and we're talking here about
many things it's about our mental effort
as well as a cost of computation of
working with data sets please don't
confuse this cost of computation with
big data I don't think we're yet in the
land of big data when it comes to open
data there's lots and lots and lots of
little data sets out there that we could
actually do quite well within a
spreadsheet into it you know or some
reasonable tooling but this is not a big
data problem yet it will become a big
data problem when we eventually get
access to our private data that becomes
a big data problem until then we'll
fight that battle so why is composition
of data really valuable for us because
let's take an example when its per
capita income interesting it's when I
start correlating it with other things
so I might want to look at what is it
what is the correlation between infant
mortality and per capita income or I
might be interested in what is the
correlation between per capita income
were parent to child HIV infections if
I'm interested in health systems within
an African context or developing country
context so it implies that the really
interesting things about data the facts
that we really want to surface like I
did with the toilet issues at Kylie gia
looks in the intersection of data not in
a single data set it also implies that
we actually want to get raw unsanitized
data that we want to actually be want
you're able to sanitize not post
processed data that statistical
organizations provide we want to have
the option to actually deal with the raw
data as well and so here's an idea that
I have and I tested this to some extent
that what if we took every data set and
just split it into every single column
that's possible and treat each column as
a single data set so basically smash it
into pieces right and thereafter
to find data based on values remove
duplication and say that hey here's this
name aslam and what other data which
other columns does aslam appear in and
when I start doing that then I start
seeing the relationship between things
that were previously i thought we're
disconnected now how do we actually do
that I don't know I really don't know
but there's some things that I have
tried I've tried the first option in
which is set based in it and that is
working with a few million rows of data
splitting it up throwing it into
something like ridaz and using readers
to do set intersections of data to find
what are the intersections and what are
the things that are lurking in between
and that's reasonable you know it could
be graph-based which graph works with
values not you know not names of columns
and things or it could be something else
you know but it doesn't matter what we
eventually come up with I think there's
opportunity here for us to deuce to
solve certain things and it might not be
one size fits all one strategy for
everything it might be peculiar to the
way your data is distributed that or the
nature of the data that you want to want
to work through that or that will force
you to choose a particular strategy so
it's only when we are able to do that
that we can look for trends and that is
a mental effort that's cost of thinking
about how to what do we see in this data
is we're putting down hypotheses and
proving or disproving that so there is a
tool that actually does this it's called
click view by qliktech problem is that
it fails prerequisites its proprietary
and over and above that is expensive and
I don't think anyone's actually prepared
to go and get licensing but I use it
because is a free single users version
of it out there and that's what I use
okay but what we're really after is
software that satisfies those
prerequisites as well because it appeals
to our freedom from a human rights
perspective as well and the last bit is
that
activists need is location independence
and that is that let's stop looking
around finding stop sharing URLs to find
the data we should be able to gather the
data that we need in a better more
intelligent way and I was pleased you
know this is a quote by Aaron Schwartz
the late Aaron Schwartz who's who for
many people is is a beacon but for me is
a beacon of courage in the work that
he's done as an activist but I was
really pleased to find this piece of
unfinished work that was published
freely and in here he was talking about
the ProgrammableWeb and he says well
perhaps peer-to-peer is we were actually
going to end up because it gives us the
best of both worlds gives us a chance to
collaborate as well as modify locally
and and it reminded me of why don't we
start sharing data sets using something
like BitTorrent style the beauty of this
is that the publisher relinquishes all
responsibility of getting the data out
if you want it moves responsibility over
to the people actually want the data and
that's what BitTorrent does if you want
it you'll find a way to get that torrent
file and then it doesn't have to where
it's located you will pull in all the
bits and pieces and you will reconstruct
your data set or your file as you wish
so what are we talking about here for
digital activist is that we try to turn
open data in technologies that the first
thing we're interested in is lowering
the cost of participation that is by
actually having frictionless data sets
and then we want to lower the cost of
discovery right by having appropriate
tooling for doing data composition and
and trend and analysis and then lower
the cost of sharing and when we do that
then it becomes a mental cost mostly but
the world doesn't stop there because we
also need to collaborate with our
friends on the social side who are
organizers of things and so for the
social activist we need knowledge close
at hand ability to reach people and
bility to get feedback Martin was
talking about in the previous talk about
how what a difficult problem it is to
acquire feedback
from citizens and that's not different
but just to remind you what activism is
all about so activism is a call for
people to gather to apply pressure for a
cause that's what it is it doesn't
matter what kind of what kind of
pressure weather or what kind of cause
with a social political environmental it
doesn't matter you know but most
commonly it's used to stop exploitation
to alleviate some kind of under
development this is a horrible world
that's being used by the media and has
become quite ubiquitous and we say it's
the developing countries actually it's
the underdeveloped countries it's not
developing it's a euphemism it's been
it's been glossed over it's
underdeveloped right and it comes from
unfair agreements for things that we
need to hang in access to so that's most
commonly what kind of activism that I
have been exposed to but largely it's
about establishing new social contracts
most establishing new relationships and
so activists are the facilitators
they're the Shepherd's for actually
asking us to establish new relationships
and those new relationships are born
when we have equal and fair agreements
between different people that's what it
comes down to is that we establish an
agreement to say this is the way we will
work and behave and collaborate and and
live life that's what we're after so
this knowledge close at hand an
interesting thing is federated wiki's by
Ward Cunningham and it just popped up
when I was preparing and bring research
for this is it well that is
significantly different because our our
understanding of a wiki is that multiple
authors on the same document but he's
saying hey there's another way to do
this is a single author for a single
document but if there's many of us that
are single authors for our documents
with local storage localized to myspace
a Federation of those creates this
bigger wiki and that's an interesting
idea of maybe that is some way that we
actually shared these kinds of
infographics and n facts and knowledge
there's also about how do we reach
people reaching people is is not about
shotgun marketing and it's not about
getting your message out on Twitter so
facebook or anything like that this is
about very very specific marketing and
you speak to social activist there's a
lot of marketing theory and strategy
goes into this they even do a/b testing
will write the message out like this and
send it out to that group and will write
a message in word it like that is
centered in that group and will collect
feedback and see which one is more
appropriate there will be times in the
day that will send a message art this is
science this is not in my days of
activism where it was whispering and
clandestine hoods and you meet up in the
dark type of thing you know so and the
whole idea here is that it's to create
awareness and there's many times we want
that communication to be private anyway
and how do you receive feedback the
trick with this feedback is that it's
not always the feedback on the channel
that you went out so I could have sent
out a bunch of smss but in there SMS I
will call for you to pledge your support
for our effort by phoning this
particular number and hanging up a must
call right and the reason why activists
would do something like that is that one
person if I send the SMS Russell Russell
will tell Dan sitting on the end and say
hey Dan now saw this SMS and Dan will
actually phone when he never got the SMS
but I want the feedback that there's one
more p one more person that's actually
interested in what we're doing so open
data is not the end game at all not at
all not for me so it's just a
prerequisite so that it can actually
carve out news new social contracts and
relationships and I've software
developers that is something that we can
actually get involved in because it is
largely a from a digital side about data
science and about the tooling that we
have that we can create for ourselves
around data set so that we can make dat
assigns a little bit easier and so you
know just to summarize what we're
talking about here so my idea here and
the vision that I'm trying to put
forward whether with materializing not
something that will speak for itself in
years or months to come is that
frictionless datasets make it easier for
us to compose new data sets that will so
that we can discover new facts and that
can share these facts in an independent
way so that social activists can
distribute it and when they distributed
widely we take this knowledge and remake
it common knowledge so this brings me
back to nineteen ninety-two and would it
have been valuable pre-1990 to there was
international call for economic boycott
of South Africa at that point in time we
just trusted our leaders and said yes
boycott but it was asked the people on
the ground that actually had to make the
sacrifice for economic boycotts and
there's one day that woke up I'll
trivialize it you wake up one day and
there's no more pepsi okay kodak
disappears okay IBM supposedly
disappeared but they were there in the
defense department's so they are that
kind so the sacrifice that if we
understood the sacrifice that we are
making and the impact of an economic
boycott on the mound white minority
government at that point in time perhaps
we would have appreciated it better but
we didn't have the tooling and the
access to data that we have today so
perhaps it wouldn't have made any
difference these days we're fighting
against corruption in a fledgling
democracy we've gone from euphoria of
you know dismantling apartheid and we're
all great rainbow nation to complete
corruption okay a few people are just
exploiting the system so we want to know
how much is being siphoned off the top
right we want to know what is the money
trail at what cost to all people what
could we have done with that and those
are interesting questions to be answered
and this data out there that we might
have to dig really deep that's not open
but we can get access to them like i
have a few people that i know at stats
sh don't record that part so there is
where they are ways to do that I they
will let me out a of of Denmark but
there's some ideological questions that
we need answering as well which I don't
want to talk about now but it is
important so how soon will it be before
open date is exploited for evil
you know that is something we should be
cognizant off because this guy get it do
you all good things can be used for evil
what are the consequences if you
consider data as a natural resource like
gold and oil and you know I certainly
hope you don't have to trade data
because that's what we're doing at the
moment but what are the agreements that
are in place should we have to consider
the data as a natural resource so that
we can actually alter social contracts
and then you know in the Internet of
Things we heard this morning when we
track we're being introduced and someone
said by 2020 there's going to be 50
billion devices connected to the
Internet and so privacy is the next
freedom and we're not talking about that
the the desire to switch off and say
please leave me alone is going to become
a big thing I think and that's what
we're going to give up when we go
towards this Internet of Things and
associated with that is how do we get
access to the data that we are providing
how do I get my data back which is the
challenges of we fighting about right
now and to wrap up the reason why I'm
wearing a t-shirt with the cow on it
it's in goonie cow from South Africa its
indigenous to South Africa and it's a
t-shirt from a concert that I went to
buy this guy Johnny Clegg single
songwriter from South Africa one of my
favorite singer songwriters very close
to the same level as Bob Marley but
there's a song that he sings called scat
llings of Africa and he considers that
his favorite song and he says magic
machine cannot match human being human
being that's an African idea and what is
appealing to hear is this idea of
African idea of ubuntu that is people
exist because of other people I exist
because you exist and you make me exist
and that trumps machinery and so because
of us that exists because of each other
and he appeals to the scatterings of
Africa he's an anthropologist he studied
anthropology he lectured anthropology
and so the scheduling of Africa is a is
going back to the the cradle of mankind
comes from Africa and so you're all
scatter length of Africa every single
one of you have been uprooted
and so we're all on the road to peel a
manga pillar manga is this imaginary
world where lies don't exist and that's
where you find the ultimate truth and
there's many of us that are already on
this road so in your own little world
your own little community you can
actually make a difference you really
really can make a difference as a geek
you can go and make a difference by
actually playing with data and you spare
time and sharing that with people and if
you're on the other side of the
organizing side you can come join me and
do this as well so activism for me is
about common knowledge not just about
raw data thank you okay so the question
is that I propose you take you tick data
sources and then start exploring it and
and there's a possibility that a very
strong possibility that you actually
don't even know what you're looking for
so you don't even know what data you're
looking for but you have a question that
needs answering so how do you go about
doing that so I had a question that
needed answering about Kyle eacha so I
went hoovering around looking for data
that actually supported that that that
statement of declaring your ignorance to
say that hey I actually don't know this
what can I use to do that is a very
common way it's kind of very forensics
style of thinking is that here's a scene
and what can i discern from the scene
and it might be data that's tangential
to that that you can use to infer
certain things in the scene so I don't
think there's one one way of solving
that problem one way of approaching it
yes so how do we ensure quality of data
how do we know it's not manipulated at
the source I'll take that in two parts
how do you know it's not manipulated the
source how do we ensure quality of data
you can't ensure quality of data and no
data is all one hundred percent accurate
if the data is coming from a statistical
organisation at a national or research
level they have an obligation to present
error margins as well so you have an
idea of that you can also use different
data sets around the set space there on
the same concepts to correlate where
that the quality of data and the error
margins on that how do you know the data
has not been doctored and fiddled it's a
different problem and I've deliberately
left out this wild idea of using drm for
date is it so I don't know how to solve
that problem but it is a reality and I
think that also feeds into the
ideological question of when does it
start being used for evil yeah yeah so
there's lots of problems to be solved
and I just want to put down some ideas
of where I think we could be moving
which would be I believe store better
than where we're at at the moment anyone
else okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
