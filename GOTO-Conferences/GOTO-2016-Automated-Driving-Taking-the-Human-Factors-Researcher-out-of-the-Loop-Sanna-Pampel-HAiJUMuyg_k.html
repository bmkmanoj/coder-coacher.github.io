are interested in this topic please yeah
as I have said right my session in the
end I'm yeah I'd like to have some
feedback especially because this is my
my first go to a conference presentation
I'm normally having kind of more
academic type of presentations I start
with introducing myself properly so i
actually was once a member of enter
software development teams I've been
coding back then for four years after my
university degree in information systems
but although it was really exciting and
to do this work and to work with the
latest frameworks and kind of be part of
a scrum team I found the users of the
technology really like really
interesting so I've been looking for a
PhD topic and then I found the ideal
topic so interesting in the University
of Leeds and that one was about mental
models in the in the driving domain so i
actually did my PhD on mental models of
eco-driving so from the kind of really
deep like software development work from
the coding I went all the way to the
human being to the kind of psychology
side of things and after i submitted my
PhD basically three days later I started
my job in the University of Nottingham
where I'm now working as a research
fellow for automotive human factors so I
stopped a bit bit back towards
engineering again and i'm mostly kind of
working with automotive human machine
interfaces so i've been working with
mirrorless cars for example that was my
first project where the cars don't have
the side mirrors outside but instead
they have screens on the inside of the
cars and the images are related by from
from cameras that are can be placed
anywhere outside of the vehicle I've
also been working with kind of emotions
and experiences doing driving and I'm
kind of moving towards human machine
interfaces and partially automated
driving which many in my field are
working with at the moment
one too far so I'm in the human factors
research group we are about 25 staff
members 30 PhD students and we
researched kind of human factors in a
really wild field wide field so we're
looking at novel technologies and
complex systems which also reaches
towards philosophy actually we're
looking a lot at safety implications of
systems and then what kind of effects
does the use of systems have on trust
and then user behavior and behavioral
adaptations there's a photo of my mind
well so the people of my colleagues the
driving people in the within the group
we are about five staff members and a
PhD students most of our work is funded
by car manufacturers but also by the EU
and the UK government and we're working
with in the automotive field we're
working with different issues about
human machine interfaces a lot has to do
with workload and stress and distraction
as you're trying to drive and operate
like the system which kind of system any
kind of system at the same time can
really kind of make your life a bit more
more difficult if we don't design them
properly but we are also looking at
under load so if driving feels really
nice and feels really nice and easy do
you think you can then take more risks
and actually drive faster because you
kind of feel so safe and oh you may be
over trust some systems as well
especially when it comes to automations
of course we're looking at comfort and
fit issues is it easy for you to reach
the controls do you prefer touch pads
over buttons or let language interfaces
easier or not and of course there
there's still work to do in the field of
mental models which is about drivers the
way drivers kind of understand and learn
the different driving tasks and to see
also whether it's possible to automotive
parts of them
so and then after this introduction
let's get to my get back to my
presentation to the question so um as
we're looking into into automated
driving and especially kind of coming
towards driverless cars as we don't have
the driver anymore does it also mean
that we don't need kind of human factors
research anymore because i heerd
actually a lot I think maybe
hypothesized it could be a widespread
opinion among amongst engineers and just
kind of had this question in my mind and
I wanted to get to the get more to the
bottom of this and when I was asked to
present at go to I thought that's my
chance so why are we looking at
automated cars in the first place I mean
what kind of problems do they solve so
traffic I mean it's very nice to drive
in Denmark this this picture here on the
situation in this situation is more like
how it is in the UK because guys it's
British driver spend a lot of time in
traffic jams and with the with
implications on their well-being and
their productivity at the same time
driving is not particularly safe and
when you look at the accident statistics
ninety percent of the accidents can be
traced back to human error so there's
some promise that things will be more
efficient and safer and quicker with
automation so at this point I want to
make sure we're speaking to say the same
language the few definitions automated
means that certain tasks are taking over
by machines and it still means that
other tasks that can done by a human
being so in terms of cars it could mean
that the longitudinal control could be
taking over could be done by the car
that would be like an adaptive cruise
control for example but the driver still
needs to steer so it can be like a more
or less good teamwork situation between
the car and the human being
at any time it can also mean that at
some times the car is having the full
control and at other times the driver is
having full control and then we're
getting to take overs and handovers a
take over is the situation when the
drivers initiating that kind of taking
back the control so it often works by
the driver overriding the automation by
an input into the steering wheel or by
pressing a gas or brake pedal a hand
over is initiated by the vehicle the
vehicle is just reaching the limits of
its capabilities yeah and then is
issuing some kind of alarm and handing
back through the control to the driver
when we talk about autonomous we talk
about kind of fully driverless cars that
is where even a blind person could drive
from from A to B because the car just
doesn't need to be controlled
vehicle automation is understood to have
several levels I chose the
classification by the Society of
Automotive Engineers another one you
find a lot in the media is by the Nitza
the US Department for transportation
just one level less but I I prefer this
one it has a bit more detail so the
levels ranged from zero to five and kind
of from zero to five the vehicle as you
can see in the green pluses is getting
more and more control whereas the
operator the drivers having less control
over the levels level zero is no
automation at all so the driver is doing
the entire set of driving tasks one
thing that the vehicle could still do is
to issue warnings there are lane
departure warning zor forward collision
warning but I found it quite difficult
to find a vehicle as it's just issuing
warnings but not in any other way
helping the driver so I put a picture of
a 40 up here level to a third level one
is assisted automation so that means
that the driver must be ready to take
control at all times and monitor the
driving environment continuously so such
systems for example include cruise
control and adaptive cruise control so
where the cars at least in certain
conditions able to do the longitudinal
control or the lateral control where the
car is kind of staying within Elaine can
also include parking assistance for
example or some combination of these
systems one example this is picture from
a phobia folk song golf is an adaptive
cruise control kind of system where the
car is following a car in front at about
a constant distance and other examples
are kind of park assists and kind of
simple stop and go is at very
all speeds on the motorway in traffic
jams level two is partial automations so
this is kind of getting a bit more
sophisticated the driver in this level
is still obliged to to have full
situation awareness to be fully aware of
anything that's around and to be able to
respond and take over at any time so
it's not given that the car can actually
handle all situations an example is an
adaptive cruise control that's not able
to break so it's like like an adaptive
cruise control system that's
manipulating the gas pedal and coasting
and giving more gas and coasting again
but when a break is required the driver
needs to press on the brake so one
example is the in the message spends the
distronic plus with steering assist so
it's like an adaptive cruise control
with steering so to some degrees the car
can actually drive on its own but that's
not reliable and the human being needs
to be there and the human needs to
observe the environment at all times so
then we're getting a level further and
we're looking at conditional automation
here the car is actually dry able to
drive on its own and to monitor the
environment in certain conditions for
example just on the motorway or just
like in in slower traffic and congestion
and doing those times the driver can
also kind of divert the attention for a
bit but they still need to be able to
take back control and to drive so I put
a picture of the tesla appeal because
that is actually that's a good example
of of a car being able to take into to
drive on the motorway it's like like a
chauffeur on the highway or on the
traffic jam
when we talk about level four we are not
expecting the human being to be fully
capable and able at all times to
actually drive there's a bit more kind
of tolerance and the driver might just
be required at some points to take over
some of the control oh it might even be
possible that the car is completely
autonomous on the motorway only and as
an example I put up a Google pod
although it's there's just some
discussion basically which card belongs
exactly to which level but it's expected
that such cars can actually do quite a
high level of automation already another
example would be a highway pilot that is
able to to do this adha platooning to
kind of dog onto other cars on the
highway on its own and off again and
double five is the full automation where
the car can on its own drive from point
A to point B and everything the driver
needs to do is to the one who's the
driver the pin human has to do is to
switch on the system and to put in the
destination one example I found is the
park shuttle in in Rotterdam it's like
an autonomous shuttle system that's
working in this kind of business park
type environment at very low speeds and
it's quite restricted and it still works
with kind of magnetic guidance in the
road
so the current state of the art is at
level three basically so the major car
manufacturers the Hyneman and
manufacturers all are all bringing level
3 automation onto the market and but
there are also car manufacturers who
bring two who kind of make this
technology more affordable for the
masses so it's it's not just for those
people with a lot of money so it seems
like automation will be available and I
also want to make make make clear that
cash last current level of automation is
a level three so legally there needs to
be a capable driver on the driver's seat
and able to drive at all times so it's
not a fully autonomous vehicle um
whether Google is on level three or four
it's not not yet really clear what has
been shown is that it is still happening
that the Google car is reaching the ends
of its limits and handing the control
back to the driver so they're hundreds
of those situations recorded at the same
time they're also about at the time when
I look this up about 70 takeovers
recorded where those which were
initiated by the driver a proper level
five like full automation it's not
expected to be on the roads out there
able to drive fully from one point to
another it's not expected for another 10
years or more the opinions differ I mean
some people say it takes 20-30 years
looking at level 3 level 3 automation or
say in general the intermediate levels
where the cars is that cars taking over
the automation for some sometimes and
the driver is driving actively at other
times it's a big big big field in
research and development and SS still
needs to be this responsible driver in
the car and kind of
having the driver engaged in the driving
task is yeah it's not very easy so I'm
having this is a video from a from an
experiment we did it doesn't have any
sound at the moment but the system is
giving the control to the participant
very soon so that is so the system you
can see on the green ball is perfectly
comfortable driving on a motorway on its
own and the participants kind of took
her hands of the steering wheel quite
soon trusted quite soon and she's
relaxing having some water looking
around and picking up her phone and
actually will pick up her phone at some
point and yeah people are getting quite
kind of detached from the driving tell
us quite quite soon I'm I noticed as
myself even people who report that they
don't really trust automation when they
get into the situation very soon they
detach and kind of yeah I'm not engaged
anymore in the driving and as the the
level of the green bar shows in the
situation is fine but it's also kind of
deteriorating start deteriorating so
from it just went from green to orange
so the participant still has a phone but
she is kind of every now and then
looking at the driving environment and
looking at the system what's happening
here is you know the cars on the
motorway and it's kind of able to follow
the traffic in front but there's some
for coming up unfortunately the quality
of this video always a bit it's not very
good so I can't really show the driving
environment so the participant is still
quite quite disengaged and is looking at
her phone in another participant in the
same experiment was what she can feel
I ok so now she put her her phone away
and this getting kind of ready is
looking around yes that one hand already
on the steering wheel so she's quite
just you just set up is its kind of
ready to drive is monitoring the system
she's probably expecting that something
is about to happen and there's no sound
no sound yet but once the once this bar
is getting over to read there will be a
loud beep and the the control will be
handed over to the driver you can see
that quite soon but in this situation it
looks it looks really good I mean the
participant is doing a very good job in
looking around and and kind of getting
ready to drive at any moment so this
would happen yeah so here we are so
system is red cars not able to do this
task anymore a loud beep is coming on
and the car still driving but there will
soon be a symbol and then the yeah so
now the the participant is driving again
and you can see on her steering
movements that it's quite easy for her
to drive again and to have control over
the car so I show you another
participant so he's so the car is taking
control now so he's taking the hand of
the steering wheel taking out a research
paper and reading and he is reading he's
reading the entire drive he's very very
concentrated on the paper and that's the
only thing he does he has a pen as well
to make notes and so he lets the the
system drive the system drive and do its
job and as you can see on the green bars
it's working perfectly so now fast
forward probably 15-20 minutes
and the system is at ya it's very limit
and the driver doesn't notice it at all
or the participant in the vehicle has no
idea loud beep wiggle on the driver is
throwing away the paper noticing that he
still has the pen in the hand puts the
pen away and there we are again and you
see the biggest earring movements to
kind of there are rather big Corrections
showing that it was not very confident
in the situation and needed a bit of
corrections to to get back into the lane
into into stable driving so level 3
automation is very problematic so if the
car is driving drivers are getting
fatigued they're getting tired and
wander away with their minds and it can
take a very long time for the drivers to
take over again Natasha mirrored from
east university conducted to study two
years ago where she found that it can
take up to 15 seconds for driver to take
control and it can take up to 40 seconds
to be fully able to control the vehicle
again like with smooth steering
movements and to be kind of securely in
the lane and that is a very long time
considering the split seconds and kids
um sometimes take to get into a critical
situation over time skills and can
degrade eight you have the case that the
tasks that are automated are usually the
ones that are easier so imagine the
drivers are kind of getting this kid
over time and then suddenly have to take
over when life is hard when there's rain
and fog and the situation is very
complex of course I mean when drivers
trusts and have experience with
automation or the other way around for s
they experience the automation the trust
increases Achille to over trust and some
complacency and in the end I can also be
misused and you might see in the video
clips by Tesla drivers or non-drivers
sitting in the backseat that is not very
smart it was actually not not allowed
do because there still needs to be a
driver it's not autonomous driving but
there's the risk so we also got to the
first fatalities in this level of
automation we are looking at possible
solutions in research with this so we're
looking at re-engaged in the driver
keeping the driver in the loop how can
we do this they have been different ways
to kind of keep the driver engaged in
driving one way is to simply give tasks
back to the driver so let the driver do
some things and that the car do some
things but why are we then kind of
looking at it automation another way is
to measure the driver state and to even
give back control to the driver when
they get into tires which is kind of an
interesting kind of conflict so what's
going on at the moment in research and
innovation is a look at fully autonomous
driving so instead of increasing the
automation level by level functionality
that functionality and getting the human
out step by step the idea is to look at
like fully autonomous driving and it's
quite a different ball game not to look
anymore at the the pesky human was
getting tired and distracted and doing
making mistakes and this is more about
artificial intelligence and and learning
like machine learning a deep learning
it's about kind of maps and it's it's
it's quite kind of different in some
ways and that's why several car
manufacturers and technology companies
and also government projects are kind of
getting together to in to kind of
separate research and development
streams and
to explore and to develop full
automation further and this is this is a
real kind of disruptive element in this
so it's not just about having autonomous
vehicles on the road there are other
kind of developments and technologies
that are come coming with this at the
same time for example electric vehicles
like really kind of light vehicles but
also car sharing and different types of
kind of ownership or business models so
then it's expected that with the
autonomous vehicles a lot more will
change so this is about overcoming the
intermediate levels and Tesla for
example they announced that they would
have fully autonomous vehicles within
two years I'm yeah we'll see i'm not
social and ford announced that they
might be able to launch them by 2021 and
of course there are many others there
are many many developments going on at
the moment is really exciting including
goober actually so and question for me
is does this mean that we do not need to
take the human into account basically
how will buy job look then look like
then when we're not researching the kind
of human in the intermediate levels but
there are still humans in the vehicles
there are the humans outside of the
vehicles and divided all in the white
kind of traffic environment and the
entire society regarding the humans in
vehicles of course I need to trust and
to in order to adopt the cars and has
just been a survey a few days ago
showing that there is actually not a lot
of trust in full automation the drivers
many people actually still want or still
expected that they're able to drive at
any times interestingly people with
experience with Tesla's don't say don't
require that humans are
able to drive so much so they'd trust
the full automation more about when it
comes to kind of emotions it's not so
much about doing the trip anymore it's
about good making sure that drivers or
people have good experiences in cars
comfort includes motion sickness which
is a big problem especially in our
simulator experiments but it will also
be in future cars yeah and this can
hopefully be kind of all enhanced with
the communication with with the car with
the development of natural language
interfaces the car will be able to be
more maybe like a like a friend or like
an assistant a bit like kid in Knight
Rider with whom you can talk and
interact and who can then kind of assist
you and care for you when you're like
tired and ask you whether you want to
listen to some music and all kinds of
and we're looking also at the activities
people are doing performing when they're
not driving would they still be using a
satellite navigation system for example
because I think actually it seems like
they do although they're not kind of
guided from one place to another they
might still be using a sat-nav to
interact with the outside environment
it's kind of know where they are and to
look up where the next cafe is car
manufacturers such as audio Jaguar Land
Rover don't yet fully expect that the
drivers are happy to be fully removed
from a driving task because for many
people driving is actually fun say if
you drive like really fast on a motorway
or so and so so will this be prohibited
in the future and how would the
customers handle that or would people
just be able to drive in on racetracks
or within certain safe boundaries on the
motorway but then again is when if
pleasure is risk how does that fit
together then we have the humans
directly outside of the vehicles and for
them
the safety is it's crucial it's very
important because and also over time
they need to kind of trust and accept
that there are these autonomous vehicles
in their environment a lot of or several
research projects look at fully
autonomous vehicles in like more
pedestrianised areas this would be
really kind of slow vehicles and it's
like trust and and the safety within
like cyclists and pedestrians is a big
issue at the same time people need to be
able to communicate with the driver say
with eye contact it's not it's not so
easy anymore and so that weighs the cast
can still signal to the driver that so
to other people that they are recognized
and it's safe for them to cross the road
when we're looking at the transition
period from menu driving to having like
more autonomous vehicles on the road to
fully towards just having autonomous
traffic they also kind of regional and
cultural differences that might change
over time and all kinds of feedback
needs to be fed back needs to be fed
into research and development which will
be ultimate eyes as well but the
transition is going to be a very very
interesting phase when we look at the
traffic environment this has been
mentioned yesterday as well in the
robotics panel discussion ethics ethical
considerations because there are certain
dilemmas where you need to decide for
example between kind of let the driver
crash into a wall or turn and kill
another person and similar conflicts are
there as well between the driver or the
car driving straight ahead and doing
nothing and killing one person or the
car kind of steering around and killing
five people and who is making these
decisions are these the engineers only
or will there be kind of regulations
or will it be possible for the driver to
make this decision but how should it
work within a few split seconds and then
there will be all kinds of effects on
the safety and travel quality travel
time will hopefully be shorter and
lifestyles as well so cars are not just
like status symbols and at the moment
just lost our status symbols in
especially in some areas but hopefully
autonomous cars will also be able to
improve lives of people with mobility
issues and make it possible for them to
participate in society and then we'll
have connected vehicles of course
because cars will talk to each other but
then cars will also be able to to feed
any kind of critical information of
problems with in the outside on the
outside world or about the driver to
other vehicles or authorities and this
picture is kind of a cute example of
kind of a misuse of saved saved cars as
as people kind of believe that
autonomous cars would stop for everyone
at all times you could just kind of walk
in front of them and they stop for you
and sometimes it works even that that a
seagull can block and like a container
harbor so because because the autonomous
vehicles wouldn't wouldn't would move I
know few words about the society so
because it still for autonomous vehicles
are the laws and regulations there's
still so much to solve especially like
in more in some countries and less than
others but that's that's so considered
one of the big problems to overcome we
don't know yet how what the effects will
be on on unemployment because I mean
there there is a lot of potential for
employment but in the UK for example
there about 700,000 professional drivers
and how their lives would look like in a
few years time I
I hope that too bad and this interesting
development where they talked about when
I talked about the the disruptive
element of this it's also that people
might don't have to own a car anymore
you could just a theory order your your
car order a car with a nap and then it
comes and then it brings to anywhere and
you can just get rid of it at any point
and it drives away on its own and you
could kind of offer this as a mobility
as a as a full service which and also
includes train trips or plane trips or
so and then the issues with the security
at insurance security because cart can
be hacked everything can be hacked and
has been shown it has been been done and
security improvements have been
performed as well and at the end the end
would this they'll have info effects on
the other how would the insurance of the
future then they look like because who's
forward would be in a wooden accident be
if it's not the driver and who would
then kind of pay for it i think the car
manufacturers would take a lot of the
blame and responsibility so a few words
about AI so what that is enabling is
young lot more comfortable I easy
maintenance car is doing a lot for you
of course I mean knowing about the
driver state and you can learn a lot
about the driver state actually at the
moment is possible for us to measure
like steering inputs and pedal inputs
and to kind of infer from it whether
your tie it or not but you can also use
eye tracking for example and detect
certain patterns and eye movements to
learn a bit more about about your state
simple example of a tire you're blinking
more if you stress you're concentrating
more on the road in front and would it
be necessary for the car to adapt to the
drivers personality and needs if you're
if you're aggressive if you want to rush
the autonomous card with the same I
should it be just like I don't
comfortable for everyone not just for
certain people and drive kind of slowly
like Rolls Royce and I don't know
elegantly s the cars are learning in the
road they may pick up human bad habits
we talked about yesterday in the deep
learning session as well the Google car
accident was actually a nice example of
this so what happened in the Google car
accident is that the gugak I learned
that cars are actually at junctions at
times creating like an informal right
turning lane a right turning lane that
doesn't exist but people still kind of
drive into this non-existent lane and
the Google car did the same in the end
but another car in the actual right lane
did not expect this from the google car
and because of this misunderstanding
those cars crashed into each other
nothing that happened is just like to
damage slightly damaged cars but it has
implications on kind of the cast the
autonomous cars vehicles behavior so
over time I'm sure we will find ways
that kind of learning mechanisms can can
adapt that you for example put some
rules and play so this wouldn't happen
but would this always makes sense for
for human beings so I'm not sure whether
autonomous vehicles to drive like humans
or whether they should drive like
machines because there's an expectation
that autonomous vehicles are just like
really smooth like trains or like like
platoons and just take over all this
work and the move will be fine with that
but there is a lot of research that
shows that humans except and prefer more
human like behavior in vehicle
automation for example humans would not
be comfortable to drive around as curves
to be driven around curves as fast as
cars actually safely can at the same
time they don't are not comfortable
necessary with the short distances that
are necessary to have the benefit
it's of platooning so there will be some
kind of time maybe for humans to adapt
overcast to adapt so maybe autonomous
vehicles will be like a better human
version but what is that and does this
mean the same for all humans and I'm
sure there will be disappointment as
well so I'm as a researcher yeah I'm
trying to kind of be part of addressing
these challenges now although like the
fully autonomous cars out there in the
wild don't exist yet they're just like
only in limited areas with like limited
speeds but we have many questions yeah
and how can we basically how can we find
the answers now so in human factors we
kind of looking at the problems and boil
them down to really define research
research questions and once we have the
questions we might actually be able to
answer or approximate the answers to
some degree and without having the full
scenario there I mean we can't do like
big studies where we kind of quantify
these effects but we are able to maybe
like like the study in the simulator
research part of it for example in the
videos we were looking we were
researching what drivers or people are
doing as they are sitting in an
autonomous vehicle or automated vehicle
automated for some time if we for
example want to look at the effects of
autonomous vehicles on elderly people
and whether it's possible for them to
participate more in society we might
also just as well give taxi vouchers to
to those people and see how they use
them and how it changes their lives and
SN cars are becoming increasingly
automated and we might have autonomous
cars on the roads at some point there
are more opportunities to actually
research this and to find answers to
those questions
so as a summary so there are loads of
promises and expectations that come with
automations they're supposed to increase
safety and vote capacity but at the
moment as we have asked you out like in
those intermediate levels of automation
it's very exciting research field but
it's it's very problematic to kind of
engage or re-engage the driver when it's
necessary hence several car manufactures
and technology companies are kind of
getting together to go all the way to
full automation but the human factors
challenges still remain so we still have
the humans in vehicles and outside of
the vehicles in the environment and
society and the interesting challenge is
coming with artificial intelligence and
we're trying our best in research to
kind of tackle these questions now
before autonomous vehicles actually out
there properly in use so coming back to
the question which with which I started
the presentation so are we taking the
human factors researcher out of the loop
and I'm saying no because the humans
still need to be considered so that's
all thank
