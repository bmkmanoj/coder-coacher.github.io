not to spoil it thank you for being here
I know it's late it's been a long day
long conference I will try and keep you
entertained hi I'm Chris my lifestyle is
not as glamorous as Diana just made it
sounds I guess I'm I spend my life being
pretty tired at the moment but it's cool
to be here so thank you I'm a user
experience person and I might often
start at all with something like this
it's a bit harsh maybe it's kind of
funny um but actually I'm here today to
really present a manifesto of pragmatism
rather than idealism which is not to say
that I'm not an idealist but I want us
to think about being pragmatic so for
example this interface is fine under
certain circumstances I have no problem
with this interface if the user is the
people who are using it our subject
matter experts and they know what
everything means that's fine that's
great no problems I have no problem with
it if the information in the UI is
grouped in such a way that makes sense
to the users that's fine too I have no
problem if it works for real users in a
real scenario like they can actually use
this it's effective it's efficient great
and I have no problem if this is better
than the thing that they were using
before if this helps them get what they
need better so pragmatism very very big
on pragmatism so Russell ssin gave an
awesome opening to this conference to
the moon thank you TMO for the photo by
the way I
it's a great talk it's an aspirational
talk it's like yeah yeah we should give
the moon man it's cool right it's
amazing it's so weird actually to be on
this stage and see the photo with him on
the stage and now someone's taking a
photo of me on this yeah I guess that's
what we mean when we talk about
iteration um yeah this is such a great
talk right like it's so motivating and
powerful and then you sort of look at
like what aspiration looks like in a
design context um and things get more
complicated and honestly if roasted like
if I'd known when I was going to give
this this talk and it was going to be
the closing session of the conference
and I'd known that russ was going to
open with to the moon then this would be
a really short talk because I would just
make a five-minute presentation that was
basically how do we get to the moon one
step at a time duh right that's that's
how we do it um and I think sometimes in
design we don't think about that kind of
iterative approach people having grand
ideas right people are like I'm a
creative wait i'm creating I'm you know
sometimes people think about design is
this kind of this perfect process where
you go away and you're quiet and you
think and then you present this thing
and say there it is it's finished it's
beautiful take it build it and that's
awesome but that's not designed that's
really really not designed I have a very
different view of what design should be
I'm not saying that we shouldn't be
aspirational but I'm saying it's hard to
start anything if we're aspirational and
stakeholders don't care if you write
beautiful code this is my colleague Lena
on stage in India last week she's right
stakeholders do not care if your code is
beautiful so they don't care about that
level of aspiration if you're a designer
nobody cares as much as you do about
your beautiful you i right
it's yours it's your baby you made it
it's amazing everyone's like wow yeah
whatever does it work how am I going to
build it really really you want that in
JavaScript really and so it the
aspirational thing we should always like
be thinking about the aspirational thing
but actually pragmatically it's like
well how do we get there and I think
that what we should do is we should
approach design as scientists and
engineers I nearly became an engineer
actually it was it was this close I went
to university to study engineering and
then after five weeks I was like wow I
like the science i like the computing
engineering me but it didn't you know
didn't work for me but I became a
scientist and I think how we approach
design is a lot about science and i'm
not talking about making beautiful
things i'm talking about making
functional things effective things
things that work for real people a
mighty of designers just this and i
don't think this is that dissimilar to
what you will do all day build test
iterate right that's that's my job and
in fact I'm not paid to have an opinion
to me an opinion is it's okay to have an
opinion but you need more than that I
need I get paid to validate design
choices to actually show designs to real
people and test them and see whether
they're good whether they're the right
thing and I love this quote the network
now so obviously and explicitly extends
beyond the bounds of any individual
being able to say anything useful or
conclusive on or about it in isolation
that telling someone your opinion is
like telling them about your dreams
right you know that's nice but so what
and if we just rein that in a little bit
telling someone your design opinion is
like telling them about your dreams
great have a dream but validate the
dream it's really important you can't
just have that dream and be uncritical
about it and go here's my dream their
build it doesn't work like that
I'm all about quotes today it would seem
and God We Trust all others must bring
data it's so important to bring that
data this is what data looks like by the
way this is awesome right I could watch
this all day this to me is an indication
that something needs to change right so
good the only way to know if your design
is going to trip people up is to test it
no one looking at that tent design
probably thought oh that's a tripping
hazard you know so put it in front of
people test it look for data another way
of thinking about this another quote is
no battle plan survives contact with the
enemy fray old quote very famous slight
adjustment no design survives contact
with the user you can have it in your
head it can be amazing in your head put
it in front someone two minutes later
you're like why yeah it's really really
hard to put a design in front of a user
and not find out that it is in some way
fundamentally broken the more you know
about that user or those users the
better the design will probably be but
if it's the first draft near I'm sorry I
don't know the source to attribute this
to this came to me on the Internet this
is user centered design we will talk a
lot about user centered design the idea
that we ask people what they need and
they tell us and we observe what they do
and we listen to what they say we build
a thing this is user centered design
so this is what happens when instead of
observing and listening we kind of go if
I were a user and I can only smell the
user yes they want they want validation
messages probably not so when we
certainly think about what users might
want we're kidding ourselves a little
bit we don't really know and the thing
is that users are the number one experts
about whether your design works or not
so we should find them and we should ask
them a side note our brains are really
terrible things they're really they're
like they're amazing they can come up
with programming and maths and art and
all kinds of amazing things but if you
put them in front of EU I they are
really stupid they're really stupid
often they they miss things you know
they just you know for some reason we're
really bad at perceiving information in
the kind of you I forum on a screen this
quote from Russell sins talk stuck with
me he said that ancient machine couldn't
really do both things at the same time
so it crashed and I thought oh brains
are like that if you get a brain to do
two different things it will crash often
I can't do two things it doesn't
parallel process it does extremely fast
serial processing but not parallel
processing and sometimes near sometimes
it just Falls right over it is true
users do entirely misunderstand
propositions they miss huge calls to
action they ignore clear basic microcopy
this is because brains are not very good
I'm sorry so we have to work really hard
to accommodate how brains actually work
we have to be tolerant of users behavior
because really what it's telling us is
this is how the brain works this is how
people perceive information so i want to
share with you today some examples of
when good design intentions were just
not enough and when i learned
I know it's not the same like learning
from someone else's mistakes is never as
good as learning from your own but
hopefully you can enjoy you know my
mistakes and maybe laugh at them maybe
learn from them and by the way good
design intentions are never enough on
their own so i want to show you these in
the spirit of you know we all make
mistakes but we pick ourselves up we
carry on so I'm sorry that have real
screenshots of this um i was i worked at
skype for a little while and I didn't
have the presence of mind to actually
take screenshots of the situation but
this is my reinterpretation of what
happened so for a while people use skype
still right or does everyone use like
google hangouts now once upon a time we
all use skype right okay good some
people at least so you know you have
your various options kind of your menu
up there and you have like your contacts
library here right and if you click on
one contact it kind of brings up some
information about that person may be a
photo maybe some other stuff and this
was at a time when we wanted to test the
idea of having tags so you could tag
people like friends family colleagues
work whatever and so we asked people to
add some tags so they clicked on the
call to action that seemed to work
brought up a modal okay you can add some
tags great ready to add those tags where
the tags go like the tags are right
there but because this was a new user
interface like they haven't added tags
before they didn't know nobody really
knew where the tags are gone I'm so
strange they're right there and this
reminded me of something and it's a
thing called change blindness which you
might have come across before and i want
to show you an example of change
blindness because it is cool and it's
one of the ways in which the brain is
not very good so here's a nice picture a
little old I think it's nice couple
having a date the picture is going to
flicker and something is going to change
and when you see the thing change when
you work out what it is I want you to
put up your hand so here we go flickr
what is changing can you if you can see
it can you put up your hands maybe it's
easier everyone at the back is putting
up their hand this is really interesting
maybe it's hard to refute at the front
okay right you can put your hands down
thank you um for those who still can't
see it that railing is moving up and
down yeah I took ages to notice that
right like some of you got it pretty
quick some of you took a long time that
that's no reflection on you as a person
but what's interesting about this is the
way that it can be really difficult to
spot I'm going to stop that because kind
of too much and what what's happening in
change blindness right is that
essentially when anything anytime there
is like a discontinuity like a blink of
some kind your perceptual system kind of
loses a lot of a fine detail it keeps
the big picture you know the sense of
what is happening your you know your
mind is hanging onto the narrative the
story but it loses these little fine
details and so any discontinuity like
that like a wipe can lose little things
and you just retain the whole and if you
if you're the scene is not familiar then
you might retain less and so I thought
wait a minute this is what's happening
with this this modal and this happens
actually in real life a lot like you
drive in the rain you have the wipers
and it's actually really dangerous to be
driving in the rain with the wipers
because you can lose small details like
you know that you're driving you know
that there are two other cars but you
might not see a change in speed of an
another car you might not see if someone
steps out into the road so change
blindness is you know it's very
interesting but it also has lots of
really practical applications but this
is not a road safety lecture so I want
to go back to to this so what's
happening here right is that the person
clicks on the Moodle we dismiss the
modal and the scene is kind of roughly
the same as they left it but they've
lost that fine detail because of that
white because of that
modal to not modal situation so what you
want really is something to show when
you've when you've wiped the screen in
this way you want to kind of indicate
hey something has happened and using
animation or something like that as a
way to call attention to the thing that
has happened can really work very well
so I guess that was the thing that I
learned very early in my UI career was
like you've got to call attention to
things when you wipe the screen because
that's really important otherwise people
may not you know they may miss those
details I've done quite a bit of work in
the last couple of years on the
government UK site I don't know if
people know about this this is the UK
government website and it had a lot of
money and a lot of attention to try and
improve it you can see that it's not
beautiful but it's as functional as they
know how to make it and in particular I
worked on the service for visas and
immigration so for people who want to
come to the UK to work or to study or on
holiday and we had to deal with a lot of
legal jargon a lot of kind of you know
policy basically and one of the first
things that I learned was that if you
show people a whole bunch of texts they
don't care the longer you make the text
the faster they scroll now this was a
little artificial because we were not
asking people to make a real application
for the visa form but still the sins we
showed them like a big body attacks they
were like Manning yeah yeah whatever and
they would scroll which made me think of
this and actually I feel like we've kind
of trained people to scroll through long
bodies of text does anyone actually read
all of this no hands I you know
increasingly we're just like whatever
honestly if I had to design a UI for the
end user license agreement I would
probably just do this because no one
reads it no one cares you know if they
click the button it's because they're
saying okay you got me you own me you
own everything it's all yours I just
want to use this software so a lesson a
really important lesson was if you want
people to read it you've got to make it
short people do not want to read a lot
of text and then we come to the form
itself this is a very early draft you
can see it's not really styled what we
found was that we put everything into
you know one long form like everything
about you where you're coming from and
like you know he were and people missed
a lot of the fields like we would get a
lot of Poe going on the page where
people would throw errors because they
missed one field and it would bring them
back again and I can't again I didn't
take a screen shot at the time I'm
better at taking screenshots now but at
the time it didn't occur to me to take
one but I found a similar thing you know
any long web forum right will do exactly
this if you miss out multiple fields
then it kind of usually gives you this
this laundry list at the top of here's
all the things you didn't do and then if
you actually want to go to the fields
you've got to kind of scroll down and go
through all the fields and the user
experience of missing multiple fields or
dealing with multiple errors on the page
is pretty horrible actually and so I
think it's really important that we let
people gracefully recover from mistakes
and you can do that in a couple of ways
you can make your error process and nice
you can make it timely you can make it
highly visible and you can make short
web forum pages one of the things that
I've seen is that people who are filling
in web forms where each page is very
short they don't mind clicking next next
next continue you continue because to
them it feels like the experience is
fast cuz they're traveling through all
these pages really fast if you give
someone a long web form and they kind of
the page loads and they just look at it
and you can just see them go
oh right so sometimes the subjective
experience of having to fill in the form
can be altered just by that so actually
it reminds me of another story about a
Houston Airport I think somewhere in
them Texas where people got very tired
of they would get off the plane and then
they would wait for the baggage and the
baggage took half an hour and that
everybody was tired and bored and they
couldn't fix the problem really of
getting the baggage off the plane any
faster but what they could do was they
could make people walk a much more long
route to get to the baggage carousel and
so by the time you got to the baggage
carousel your luggage was coming and
people stop complaining about it so
subjective time can be really important
like sometimes it's not about objective
time sometimes it's just what what do
you feel is happening you know how do
you feel time is passing and so we go
back to this forum it's long you know
these long pages with lots of mistakes
and one of the reasons I think we were
getting errors from this one the reasons
people were missing out fields and then
they would have to go back and fill them
in was that if you look at this this is
not empty fields this is not a form
waiting to be filled in there is stuff
there already and this really ties into
this idea that Caroline Jarrett promotes
which is that forms are a conversation
so when you look at where people
actually fixate this is from I tracking
day so if you look where people fixate
in a forum it's often the fields they
want to jump from empty field to empty
field to empty feel they want to get
through it fast as they can maybe they
don't even want to read the labels if
they can kind of get a rough idea from
you know looking around the field they
just want to put the first thing in that
they can and I've seen this happen for
real so this is a another client that I
work for recently where um I saw someone
they see look at this page and they I
knew where they were looking cuz their
mouse the cursor actually went where
they were looking they move the cursor
and they went okay field of study yep
academic status yep okay
get started those are not full fields
right those are actually labels for the
fields that you're supposed to complete
so they click straight on the button
through an error because she was
required to actually fill in this
information so if you put text into
these fields then you're breaking up
that conversational flow you want to
have a conversation you've got to kind
of very clearly say okay here's my turn
nationality here's your turn type in the
box and so unlike that so you got to
take turns and it's only polite right
like it's nice when you're having a
conversation to let the other person
speak and that's what Caroline Jarrett
is talking about to say be nice be
polite take your turn wait for the
answer ask the next question now we had
a lot of fun with this form when it came
to one tiny thing asking people their
name simplest thing in the world right
nope so there are some countries of the
world where people only have like their
name is only one thing they don't have
you know like a first name and a family
name and we wanted to allow those people
to use the form normally what would
happen is if you have different fields
for first name and family name then if
you only have one name then there would
be an instruction somewhere to say oh
please put like a star in the box if you
only have you know in the empty box but
these forms are like the legal documents
and when you get to the end there's this
thing that says if you have put anything
incorrect you know you you'll be in a
lot of trouble we may refuse your
application blah blah blah and the
person typing this is going to go well
my name isn't star why should I put that
that's not my name and so we wanted week
because of the backend system we weren't
allowed to have a single box for a name
which would have sold everything but we
couldn't do it because there was some
back-end system that we were integrating
with it demanded two fields and the
options were you know put a star in or
let's do something else and so he said
okay let's see something else we don't
want to make these people put a star in
that's that's rubbish so okay so
what about I only have one name and then
if they click on that they'll be able to
tell us what the name is and so we put
this in front of users in the hope that
they would give us some feedback on this
bearing in mind that the likelihood of
finding a user who actually was in this
situation right like who only had one
that one name one one piece of their
name was tiny and this is pretty much
what happened so what they actually said
to us was well I do only have one name
I've never been married I I do only have
one name I don't have a middle name so I
just have my first name and my family
name so we thought okay well we'll
change it I only have a single name
guess what right so people were like
well I do only have a single name I've
never been married so this is hard and
there we went around about four times
this was like the first thing in the
form and we found like four times to try
and get this right and in the end we
ended up with this which was a good fix
for two reasons so first of all we said
I'm not sure how to enter my name right
and that expanded and you can see some
of the text here and that was great
because if you were sure how to enter
your name you didn't have to think
anymore about it right you could just
skip right over that but for people who
weren't sure the likelihood of them only
having a single name so one you know my
name is one word was pretty small so we
dealt with the more common cases first
like maybe you have a junior after your
name or the third or something like that
and then if you still if that still
doesn't apply to you fine ok you can say
I don't have a given and family name my
name is one word right this minority
case hidden away in there and that
seemed to work pretty well um and that
was a really kind of humbling experience
actually to spend this many rounds of
testing with users finding out how to
ask this basic question but it's a
really great design pattern which is I'm
not sure about X where X is just you
know the thing that you're asking people
to fill in
a really nice design pattern it can
easily be skipped over by people who
don't need to see it but for people who
are not sure what to do with your form
and their eyes are looking around the
page what to do next they can find that
and go great that that's for me but
you're not necessarily being specific
about what their problem is you're just
saying okay you have some kind of
problem and then we get to the sectional
criminal convictions right because when
someone applies for a visa you have to
ask them about their criminal
convictions and I never swim down was
basically people would read the question
and go do I have any nope straight to
the no button I'm not a criminal nope
and that was unfortunate because um
sorry actually it included speeding
tickets right lots of people have
speeding tickets or kind of minor
traffic offenses you know for driving
but people just didn't see that at all
they just went up not a criminal next
and one of the reasons I think this is
happening is because of how people read
like this is I tracking data from people
reading a website this is people who
read in English so left to right and you
can see that they read in this kind of F
shape pattern where the mostly scanning
the left hand side and they're reading
behavior kind of trails off as they go
that way and so when we're putting
something like speeding tickets which
lots of people might have in that area
and makes them less likely to actually
see it it's kind of hidden and so we
ended up with this which I was much
stronger which is okay what do you have
you're going to tell us about one thing
at a time and you might have a criminal
conviction we don't think so but we're
going to put that at the top and then
you might have a driving offense so it's
right there so people can hopefully you
know read it's right on the left-hand
side and that tested much better so I
include this really just to say that the
wrong words and in the wrong places so
you know asking questions like are you a
criminal of course not you know hiding
the really important and the really
majority case over on the right can
sometimes just get completely lost and
we had to learn that the hard way
this is another fun one so there was a
question on the work visa about are you
applying for a visa in a shortage
occupation now a shortage occupation is
this really specific idea that there are
defined areas that the government
selectively wants people to come in on
work visas for because there are not
enough people in the UK doing that job
but when we put this in front of people
everybody went oh yeah I'm applying for
a work visa of course it's a shortage
occupation otherwise I wouldn't be
applying right because people's
understanding of what a shortage
occupation was wasn't this technical
legal precise thing it was like well if
I'm applying for a work visa I guess you
need people like me but no so this
helped us understand users mental models
right like users have a kind of
everybody has a kind of a set of mental
models about how the world works you
know a kind of a structure like how the
world is but in sort of simple basic
terms and these uses mental models were
totally reasonable that if you're
applying for a work visa it's because we
need more people doing that kind of job
and it also reminds me of another time
at skype where we did testing of the
product with people who were in there
maybe 50s and 60s and they weren't very
familiar with computers or phones but
they understood this basic principle
that skype is like a telephone for your
computer very straightforward right so
we got them to go to skype.com when we
got them to download the app onto the
desktop and then we said okay what are
you going to do now and a few of them
said well now I'm going to use my phone
and I said ok how's that going to work
and they were like well it's on my phone
now right because I downloaded it on the
desktop computer and it's not their
fault you know no one was stupid it's
just that's their mental model we don't
have a very tight mental model of how
skype works they just know it's like you
know a phone but on your computer so
that's that's illuminating that really
helps you know that
you think about how you design the
service it helps you think about the
words that you use to talk about the
service it's amazing so inferring mental
models from users behavior is just so
much fun here's no one from visa world
proving you have enough money now the
policy intent here the intent of the the
people who allow you to come into the
country is that you you must arrive with
some money you must have some means so
that you don't come to the UK and then
you have nothing while you wait to start
your work you know that you're going to
get paid for your visa work but people
didn't really get that um people thought
that initially that this actually meant
that this was how you were going to pay
for your visa completely fair right
that's the mental model we're asking
about money because we want to know if
you can pay for your visa now we're
asking about money because we want to
know that you'll be okay coming to the
UK for the first little while and so the
demands were you've got to have 945
pounds continuously for the last 90 days
in a bank account and you have to send
this document showing this so that last
90 days and you have to make sure the
most recent document is less than 31
days old so hang on I going to show the
last 90 days but the most recent
document can be up to 31 days old but 31
days old when is it 31 days now or when
I submit the application or wait but if
I submit the application tomorrow then I
don't have the statements for the last
90 days it's the last 89 days this is
really hard right and that the beauty of
this is that by trying to write simple
explanations of what was required it
showed everybody everybody in that part
of government how weird these
instructions are the simpler you try and
make the UI the more it shows you the
ridiculousness underneath you know if
you're designing a really simple clear
you I it basically exposes like the
business logic to proper scrutiny it
basically says look here's what you're
asking are you sure you
ask that these two things seem kind of
different to me and that's a really nice
way to get internal stakeholders to look
at what they're actually asking users to
do when it's right there 90 days 31 days
old they admitted okay yeah that's the
stuff that's that's difficult for people
to think about I like it when people say
okay yeah maybe that's not so good means
I'm doing my job well I just like to
make trouble basically so I talk about
this stuff with people a lot and they
say well that's great cruise but i have
no ux resource i have no money i don't
have a UX person I don't have a user
researcher I don't have any of this
stuff how can I do this it seems like it
would be expensive and to which I say
that doesn't matter doesn't matter you
can do with whatever you have right now
I promise so the first thing that you
need to do is get out of your own head
and I don't mean drink lots of beer I
mean you you can't be in your own head
when you're asking these questions right
when you're spending time with users
when you're looking at your designs you
have to see someone else's perspective
because you are not the user sometimes
it really helps to get out of the
building you know too much your team
knows too much you need to take a step
back you need to go and find people who
don't understand this like you
understand it you need to talk to at
least one person who is either an actual
user or a proxy user which is to say
someone who is demographically similar
or someone who wants to be able to do
similar things someone who is a little
bit like the people that you're trying
to reach and it will reward you this
quote encapsulate for me Luke Jones
saying I've never left a research
session thinking I have learned nothing
today every time you sit down with
someone you will learn at least one
thing sometimes you learn ten things
it's always worth doing and it doesn't
have to cost a lot you can spend half an
hour with someone you can buy them a
coffee give them some biscuits just
listen to them some people just want to
be listened to it honestly it costs
nothing to spend a little bit of time
with someone who doesn't know your
product like you know your product
and then do it again if you can doesn't
have to cost a lot of time or effort if
you can get it on video so there's
software out there that will help you do
all this to record people while they're
interacting with the UI and that's great
because you can play it back to people
later and you can review it yourself and
you can get all the things that you
weren't able to note down because you
were too busy asking questions and by
the way we don't blindfold our users
that's not what we do this person can
actually see I just wanted a little bit
of anonymity here and this is what you
want right when your video is this kind
of thing like you know for out 6 users
fell down coming out of the tent that's
that's day so that's meaningful and then
when you have that you want to share it
they don't look very happy right there
watching users in pain and that that
pleases me right this is when I know I'm
doing my job is when a room full of
people are watching video that I've
showed them and everyone's going that's
that's what I do that honestly that is
the kind of the pinnacle of what I do
for a living is getting people to feel
the pain that the users felt because now
we can have a conversation about what we
need to fix right this is the moment
when everyone's feeling a bit vulnerable
and like they want to do something
because it's not nice to watch people
being confused especially if you thought
your product was great and the design
was amazing and this is why you should
be doing that because to get feedback
and to decide to do something about it
early in the project it's so cheap it
can just cost a few hours of your time
very very little if you leave it until
the end it's going to cost a lot there's
going to be re work to do which you know
costs money the cost of delay right
extra development time that you don't
need or if you decide not like if you
leave all the the research and if you
leave all the testing if your design
until the end of the project then people
might say oh it doesn't matter we'll
just go live anyway it'll have to do and
that's a huge risk to put something out
there that isn't the right thing for the
people who are using it so you play the
videos you show them to people a senior
of stakeholders you can manage and you
watch them squirm and then you say right
let's fix it and they go okay yeah we
should probably fix that and if they
still don't then you go out and you get
more data and you do it again the
following week and what this does is it
reduces project risk so this is when we
were going to go live with our visas for
applicants from China and we had a lot
of work to do and not very much time to
do it because we can given a really hard
deadline and we made it we got out on
time and we did it in part because we
did regularly use a research we showed
the pain to the the development team
into the stakeholders and we watch them
feel that pain and then they said okay
you're right this needs to change and we
did a lot of that very early on if we
left it until the end until they wanted
to do their user acceptance testing I
hate that phrase it's too late at the
end for user acceptance testing users
have to accept that the products going
to go live in user acceptance testing
that's not good so really what I'm
saying is you want to make people
uncomfortable until your users have
stopped being uncomfortable share the
pain this is slightly overused quote
from Steve Jobs it says stay hungry stay
foolish I'd like to change that I'd like
say stay humble prepare to feel foolish
because you will a lot but it's worth it
you gotta park your ego this is not
about you it's not about your beautiful
design it's not about your beautiful
code it's about what the users need that
is all you should be interested in so
we're not talking about some creative
vision it's good
have that in mind but day to day that
can't be what it's about it has to be
about putting it in front of real users
getting real feedback has to be about
engaging with the product owner and
making sure that they understand the
feedback making sure that they can see
what's going wrong and making sure that
what they want and what the business
wants is aligned with what users need
and you got to look for this wherever
you find this if it's important if it's
something that actually matters you've
got to share that with people video is
great for this in the way that you're
enjoying watching this stakeholders love
watching short clips a video where stuff
goes wrong well I love watching
stakeholders watching the video they
hate it they feel pain but that's good
they should feel pain so then do this
and if something really matters if you
go and you put your products in front of
people you put your designs in front of
people something genuinely matters
you'll see it if it's really a problem
you'll see it if it's not a problem
don't worry about it like you can go in
there with a really strong opinion about
well this will never work and sometimes
it works great and you have to swallow
your words so be humble and just go okay
right I have a secret idea that this
design is not great but if I don't say
anything then if it tests okay I don't
look like an idiot and if it doesn't
test well if there are clearly problems
then you come back and you look like you
just discovered Antarctica or something
because you can come back and go look I
got all this video this doesn't work at
all who knew even if you knew you know
keep it in here but genuinely if a
design works for users don't worry about
it it's okay whether it's your design or
someone else's design doesn't matter
don't have an opinion I mean you can but
there's no point right test it see what
happens so I guess to wrap up really
like you can't always get what you want
if what you want is that creative vision
than that handing over of something
magical like the Sistine Chapel or
something right you know we're kind of
goddess
giving a spark of life you know it's not
going to be that it's never going to be
that but if you listen to what users
actually need then you will get what you
need which is a product that works which
is designs that do what they need to do
and that is how we get to the moon one
step at a time thank you
thank you Chris I actually have one
question let me just reload this yeah it
stays it one question okay okay how
would you balanced design versus its
counterpart security what a great
question this comes up for me a lot that
kind of that conflict between usability
and security right like you want
something particularly for important
things like say the visa application you
want something that's going to be secure
people are going to use a secure
password but you need them to be able to
remember it and login this is like one
of the discussions for our ages so I
guess both sides have to give a little
bit so i'll tell you an example from the
visa situation where basically the the
part of government that deals with visas
said we have all of these rules about
what kind of passwords someone must set
you know it must be at least eight
characters long it must contain at least
one special character must contain at
least one number something something
something else i cannot contain you know
any common words or whatever and then we
tried making you I where we explained
this and I showed it to someone who's
specialism is writing clear copy for the
web and she said I can't understand this
no one will understand this um and it
was true it was really hard to
understand and it was especially hard to
understand where you had met some of the
criteria but not all so you only had you
know you had three of the four things
that you needed for a secure password it
was very difficult to help people
recover from that and so we went back
and we said no one will apply for a visa
no one will create an account if you
make it this hard and the security
people said well okay and they made it a
little bit easier we still needed a
slightly more complex password like you
couldn't enter you know password had to
be more complicated than that but they
had to give or no one was going to use
the system so this sounds like a cheap
answer I guess but like everyone has to
compromise a
little bit and but that question will
never get old because people always want
to be really businesses always want to
be really secure users always want to be
able to use the service so good thank
you very much Chris thank you very much
for the talk thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
