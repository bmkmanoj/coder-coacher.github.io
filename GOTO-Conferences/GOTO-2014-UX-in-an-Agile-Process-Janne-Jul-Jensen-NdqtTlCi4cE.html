here today I have been told that Dan is
speaking in the other rooms I'll have to
talk to him about that tonight he's
stealing my thunder
but that's how it is all right a bit
about Who I am just so you know
originally I am a software engineer I
graduated from Albert University in 2003
and at that time I graduated in within
user experience but the industry had not
yet realized what user experience
designers could do so it was hard
getting a job luckily I was offered a
position as a researcher at my
University and that went so well that
they offered me a PhD scholarship as
well so I went ahead and took that and
then back to researching and then I
realized okay now I've been doing this
for eight years and I've never actually
put it into practice in the real world
maybe I should see if this is actually
worth something
so I went ahead and got hired at Troy
walk and I've been there for nearly
three and a half years now and I'm happy
to say that much more than what I could
have possibly hoped for is usable in the
real world so that's fantastic that's
about me I would like to know a bit
about you guys as well such as where you
from meaning how many of you are from a
classical software company alright three
well as a software company that does
nothing else and that's the main
business developing software alright
about half anyone that is in the IT
department of a major business that does
something else as their primary one any
designers in here one to sort of any
people in charge of the business part
yes a couple as well all right so mostly
developers
all right I think I got those two mixed
up because that was the next question
what do you guys do how many are here
are purebred software developers alright
about 60 70 percent that's that's what I
expected and now more than just the
raise of hands what is your user
experience interest what is your
interest in in this field
come on yep go ahead okay and that's
creating problems currently or yes yeah
all right yes okay all right so that's
your primary profile all right anyone
else no all right last one before we get
started what do you guys hope to take
away from this talk I think I can
fulfill that then huh yeah yeah
all right well let's get look at it this
is a case study of a project we did
where we developed an app for a big bank
in Denmark and just so you know a bit
about this Bank because I don't presume
you know much about Denmark or banks in
Denmark in general it was founded in
1871 under a different name back then
but but it's still the same Bank
it has 2.2 million customers and just
for you guys to put it into perspective
for you guys in Denmark has a population
total population of 5.5 million so they
have quite a few they have about 40% of
the population under the wings so it's a
big bank in Danish standards at least in
Denmark they have about 300 departments
they have 6,000 employees and worldwide
they have 20,000 employees because they
don't only operate in Denmark they
operate in 15 different countries
Denmark being the primary one which is
also the reason for the name Danske Bank
meaning Danish bank they they wanted an
app and they wanted an app quite early
before apps were something that
everybody had and the funny thing was
that this was not something that started
from the high up in the bank this was
something that started on a grassroot
level it was some of the people that the
man on the floor employees who thought
this could be fun to dabble with the
problem was they they didn't have the
money for it so they managed to raise a
small pot of money to start a
proof-of-concept on this and then take
it from there and see if it would work
and if it would they would go up high
and see if they
can get the money for the project but
because this was very early in in the
app story they did not know what to
expect of this this was what they wanted
they wanted to make the first and best
mobile bank app in Denmark making the
first one that's not hard to measure
making the best one a bit a little bit
more difficult because what is best so
they put up some success criteria and in
hindsight those were modest bear in mind
that Denmark is a small country they
wanted 10,000 downloads and they wanted
five positive enquiries in any of their
department people actually came in and
said we would like to change banks to
you guys because you have a cool app so
modest goals but given that this was
early in the app history they did not
know what to expect they have a set of
core values expertise integrity value
creation commitment and availability and
what they wanted with this app was to
address this one availability because
there are 300 departments that they have
in Denmark today has gone down from
about a thousand only a few years back
so as they're closing down departments
and saving money that way they have to
make themselves available to the
customers some somehow somehow else and
this was one of their ideas this is a
Danish slide I'm going to translate it
for you it came out of a customer survey
that they did and they realized that
they have quite demanding customers
because what it says is I want to be
able to go to the bank whenever it suits
me 24/7 my bank has to be available no
matter where I am it has to work all the
time I want to decide how I contact my
bank
I prefer personal contact my friends are
my expert panel now I want to be able to
adapt the product I buy to my needs so
they aren't actually shy about what
they're demanding of their banks and
this was some of the things that the
Danish bank wanted to address with this
app
a bit about the case characteristics
it's a well known topic it's private
banking the basic banking and in Denmark
out of the 5.5 million people we are in
Denmark four million use online banking
so that's quite high that's total that's
not only in dental bank that's total and
so it's a very well-known topic and
didn't even though if you look at the
online banking across banks it's very
similar the way it functions its its
minor details that differ between them
we also looked at what they already had
they had existing services at Danske
Bank they had online banking that they
had had since 2000 so that had been in
existence for nearly ten years when we
started this broader project and then
they had mobile banking meaning they had
a website of their online banking
service they had that as a mobile
banking service that had been started in
2003 and that never really caught on so
it didn't have that many users but we of
course looked into what they already had
to find out what we wanted to make that
also meant that the functionality was
well defined they had to be able to view
their accounts they had to be able to
view their transactions in each account
they had to be able to transfer money
from one count to another in bank
between own accounts to other people to
other banks and so on and they had to be
able to pay bills these four were the
four primary functionalities that this
app had to cover and then they also
wanted a way to contact the bank via
this app that makes sense it's a phone
so of course you would want to do
something like that and because of the
mobility of the air of an app and a
mobile phone they wanted a currency
calculator in there as well so these six
functionalities were what they were
aiming at but there were some challenges
because everybody who is in user
experiences do and has been doing that
for a while have been reading the books
about how such a project should go but
the real world never matches the
textbook and
in this case that was the same thing we
had some challenges that we needed to
look into user needs are they the same
regardless of platform we knew what the
user needs were on a website on the
online banking system but we didn't know
if it was it would be the same on a
mobile app how do we actually use the
hardware of the platform when the
functionality is this fixed then you
have to think out of the box to actually
make use of all this fancy hardware how
do we avoid that the designers delayed
the developers in this process how do we
test this when it's under an NDA and NDA
people know that time yeah good because
that was the case with this project how
do we test it with users then how do we
test when we can't test anything live
and finally we had a fixed release date
and when I say fixed release say
everybody has a fixed release date
everything hasn't a deadline this was a
little bit more fixed than usual and
I'll get back to why so these were some
of the challenges that we were facing in
this project we were using scrum as our
agile method and I presume most people
know scrum correct yeah anyone doesn't
know okay I won't go into detail in some
of the things that we looked into where
how are we going to estimate the size
and the scale of this project because
this was the first app we were ever
making as a software company so we had
no idea what pitfalls there were and and
how we could how badly we could get away
with this in estimation estimation wise
so we had to look into some way of
making this estimation more secure and
what we did was the proof of concept
where we took what we estimated was 10%
of the total app made that found out how
long that took how much money that cost
and then we had a better idea of how
much would the total project take
another thing we did was that on the
product backlog we included
you X the reason for this is that when
the customer is is prioritizing on the
backlog it should be visible to them
that UX is not something that just comes
for free UX takes time UX cost money so
if you prioritize UX on whatever
functionality might be then you might
actually have to put something else
further down the list so that worked
quite well
we worked instruments of course two-week
sprints and what we did was meet the UX
one week or one sprint ahead and I'll
get back to that with a more detailed
timeline later we also had well we also
made sure that we had a product owner in
the bank that prioritized UX this was
not that hard to find because as you
remember one of the goals was to make
the first and best app and the best part
is usually covered with the UX so they
prioritize UX and that's very very
important because if you all know it if
you don't have a product OMA owner that
prioritizes UX that's usually the first
thing to get cut when you're in time
trouble all right
and finally testing when do we test the
UX and how do we test it as we go along
and of course this is this is one of my
favorite drawings because it really does
tell what the advantages of doing agile
is that you can be a lot of people on a
project and you all think that you're
thinking about this project the same way
but it isn't until you start talking
together you realize that we're not
thinking about this the same way at all
and especially if you have developers
and and you Xers and graphical designers
and product owners and you know various
different profiles and it isn't until
you actually start talking together that
then you modify everybody's way of
thinking about the product it isn't the
same still but it's a lot closer to
being the same than it was over here and
in a project like this where where time
was an issue and money was an issue it
was very very important that we didn't
on a tangent never came back we had to
make sure that everybody was on the same
page all the time a bit about the time
planning and this is not the full
project couldn't fit that on a slide
it's just to illustrate to you how we
worked in parallel because that I see a
lot when people are working in working
in scrum teams that it becomes agile
sort of like waterfall model anyway
where they have loops where they are
sprints where they are doing design and
then they have sprints where they're
doing graphics and then they have spritz
where they do developments and a few
spirits where they're testing and then
you might as well do a waterfall model
anyways this is not the case a we
actually did work in parallel of course
I had to start off making interaction
design because until I have drawn a
minimum of sketches of what we're making
nobody will be able to code anything the
problem is you always have some
developers who are eager to get started
and for them to not start making
something that then is completely in in
add edge with what I'm drawing we start
them doing other stuff you know getting
a hole through to the bank and making
sure they confess the right data and
doing back-end and all that sort of
thing that does not require them to do
front-end development just yet but then
the more the most trigger-happy
developers can be put on this dude
instead until I have something to show
them once I have started and I am a bit
into my design then the iPhone team
starts the reason that I'm not done yet
is because I start out by making the
overall structure saying okay this is
how we should in broad strides navigate
this app I haven't decided it on every
little detail every little button and
every in every functionality but I've
made the overall structure and then I've
designed one functionality all the way
through the book to the bottom because
that's the one functionality that I can
then hand over and let them start
developing while they develop that I'm
drawing the next functionality making
wireframes flat
at some point I'm done with my
wireframes and they are usually not done
developing just yet that doesn't mean
that I let go of the project because
then after that and that's that's the
beauty of the agile process that's what
it's supposedly good at handling is
change the world changes we become more
and more knowledgeable as a project
progresses and for that to actually have
an impact into the project it won't
unless I'm ready to actually clarify and
correct and expand on the usability as
we go along based on what we've learned
so far so what I started out making is
not necessarily what was made completely
in the end because some things were
expand that some things were changed
minor changes things were clarified
because I had misunderstood something in
the domain or whatever so I keep
following the project after I have
delivered the initial interaction design
two weeks after the iPhone team starts
then the Android team starts why do I
not why do they not run in complete
parallel anyone know you're nodding
second of all
the core technology standpoint
you're exactly right and that was the
reason we did it that if they had been
running incomplete parallel then they
would be making the same mistakes both
both teams at the same time instead
because the iPhone started then they
could pass on whatever they had learned
to the Android team and then prevent
them from making the same mistakes also
it turns out that that works quite well
in the end because once interaction
design is done the first development of
on the iPhone front end is done and the
coat the back end is done we can start
testing the iPhone and we test that in
all three parameters that means we do
white box and black box and unity tests
and all that sort of stuff there and we
test the back end as well of course and
then we test the UX so this what I made
here is that actually what has then been
implemented or are there little details
that were lost in translation somewhere
and the reason that this is smart is
because those of you who make apps know
that there is this thing at the end
where you have 14 days we send something
into Apple and then you hope you get a
thumbs up back basically you don't know
what they're doing that you don't know
how they do you don't really know
anything you just send it off and then
you hope you get a thumbs up back and
average it takes 14 days sometimes it
takes longer if some one of the times I
have known that to take longer is if
they have just come out with the new iOS
that looks radically different when iOS
7 came out everybody was doing iOS 7
graphic updates meaning that the wait
time there was a lot longer for a period
of time because they were really busy
going through all of these apps that
came in the good thing about this is
that while the iPhone app is lying there
with Apple waiting to be approved then
we can do the same with Android and test
the Android white board black box all
those technical tests and of course test
the UX and it's not because these are
that different the functionality is the
same the look and feel of it should be
the same but there are certain ways of
navigating that are different between
the two platforms and the worst thing I
know is to see an iPhone an iPhone app
on an Android platform because people
who choose an Android phone they choose
so actively because they don't want an
iPhone often so if you have chosen an
Android because you didn't want an
iPhone then you don't want iPhone apps
on your phone
so you have to be sure that you keep the
standards of the two platforms and
that's what I'm checking for and that's
why I'm checking back both of them
vigorously all right so as you can see
here and and basically this part is the
one that's much longer than what would
fit on the slide so in far most of the
project we actually do work in parallel
all of us without anybody hindering
anybody else and I could actually add
another arrow on there called graphics
because graphics needs to be developed
along the way as well and that runs in
parallel is more parallel more or less
with this one all the way from the start
so we can have five different profiles
all working in parallel most of the
project except for a few weeks in the
beginning all right as I said we did a
proof-of-concept to one to actually make
sure that we could estimate this more
correctly and to because this was
something that started from the bottom
of Danish Bank and they did not have the
money for the full app but they wanted
this tested and they got the money to do
a proof-of-concept
at first so what we did was three basic
workflows we did the log on because we
knew that there would be something about
security issues and that sort of thing
that we had to handle and and that could
pose problems we did account overview
the reason being that we knew that this
app was going to contain a lot of lists
list of transaction list of account and
list of currencies list of whatever so
we had to make sure how how long does it
take to make one of these and finally
the currency calculator because that in
look-and-feel
was very different from the two others
so that way we could actually have a
decent way of doing an estimation of the
entire project afterwards these are not
screenshots of these exact three things
but these are some of the screen show
of the early proof concept where the
menu is a wheel with a lot of pies one
of the login screens and one of the
transfer money screens the initial
transfer money screens that we were
dabbling with the scope of this was two
and a half months and it was yes now
they actually carry them with them we
agree on that but that's a whole
different story because that's that's on
the highest level in the government
decided that it has to be these things
that you use for blah blah it's not
something that we could beat this
project we want it to but it was not
something we could beat I'll get back to
more on that later because there's a
whole different story there but you're
right you are definitely right so it was
time boxed because we didn't want this
to run off into oblivion so it was time
boxed and it had to include design which
was unusual because usually proof of
concept don't include design not UX nor
graphical design this included all of it
because as I said they prioritized UX
and they prioritized the the look and
feel of the app as being just as
important as the functionality all right
we had some use patterns because they
had existing services that they did
extensive extensive statistics on and
collected all data behind the scenes
there and we could use quite a lot of
that they have 1.2 million customers on
online banking out of the 2.2 that they
had back then those 1.2 million
customers do 7.5 million logins per
month so they actually quite active it
this is a very used service and they had
all sorts of uses statistics from this
so well how often do they log on when
they log on how often for which pages
are they on for how long which features
do they use the most
from what page to what page do they
usually navigate all that sort of thing
we could dive into and use as much of it
as we could in the app so that was one
way of getting to know enough
information the thing was this was under
an NDA we could not go out and ask the
user and that's what we use that's what
the textbook says we should do but we
couldn't so we had to somehow get the
information elsewhere this was one of
the ways but it's not the only one we
had them make a survey they hired an
external company and made a an anonymous
survey so the people answering did not
know this came from danske bank and they
were asked if they would use a mobile
bank if they had won some entities
present said they would and then they
will of course asked what would you use
it for mostly 51% wanted to see the
balance of their account 40% wanted to
transfer money 32 wanted to pay bills
and 31 to see transactions this was of
course guessed by potential users
because we all know that what they think
they will be using it for is not
necessarily what they end up using it
for or how they end up using it but at
least it gave us an indication that
there's an interest here people could
see themselves using this yeah this was
this was before there wasn't much out
there when this came out we of course
also asked them what would be the
biggest hindrance for you to not use it
and not surprisingly it was security and
you can say that that's not really logic
because the why would a and a mobile
phone be any less secure than a PC but
for some reason to users that it's
perceived that way and that's what we
were battling with that you have
security and then you have perceived
security and you can have very high
actual security if people don't perceive
it that way they
won't use it so you have to have both or
if you are crook you only go with
perceived security we're not crooks so
we want it both we wanted them to feel
that this is a very secure system so we
went for two-factor login and in Denmark
that's by your social security number
and then a service code that you get
from the bank which is a four digit PIN
code and finally this NIM edy it's
called Danish paper based security
solution it looks like this and people
carry it around and yes I know it's
ancient but that's how it is that's how
it is and the worst part is it doesn't
even actually run the nem ID because
that's a Java applet so that can't run
in the app so we are only picking
bagging on the piece of paper not the
actual software solution and that's been
a tug of war for I don't know five six
years by now that the banks won't use
this system that they had that the
government has proposed because it is
not fit for this purpose so there's a
battle going on there we're trying to
stay out of it and then go ahead with
what we do so that's that's what we
started with that changed later on and
I'll go back to put to that later the
design process I started out by
sketching something like this it's not
pretty
takes three minutes to make and it tells
you what you need to know basically so
there's a top bar here with the headline
the back button there's a locate me
there's a map here with some pins on it
that pin is open it says address and
then there's more access to more
information here and there's a bar at
the bottom where you can switch between
ListView and card or map view and a
couple of other options down there it's
not ready but if you show that to your
client they can very easily look at it
not and say yes it's something along
those lines we want I don't want any
more time invested in something like
this than highly necessary until I've
had them not
because anytime invested in it if they
don't not is waste it so there's no
point but of course at some point you
want to make it a bit neater one of the
reason being that I don't write in a
continuous font size 12 so it's hard for
me to judge where you can actually fit
into a picture if it's only hand
hand-drawn then you move it to the
computer and say okay if I actually put
it in computer and make it a bit nicer
can I fit everything there and as you
can see I ended up removing these two
options down here and instead making the
button fill the the the entire bar and
then instead make another bar up here
where you can switch between three
different views on the map so things
happen from this one to that one not in
functionality it's the same
functionality but in the arrangement of
things in the screen and after that
comes graphics the reason it doesn't
come until then is because if you go
back a while why was UX something that
why was this a discipline that started
happening it was a discipline that
started happening because there were too
many software projects where you ended
up developing something that the user
didn't want which meant it became very
expensive to changing it into what the
user did want that could be prevented by
having it only on paper until the
customer had nodded and say yeah that's
what we're making everybody has been
doing these specific long long long
specification documents that then you
haggle over afterwards because did this
line mean this or that depending on who
you ask
it's the same with graphic designers it
also is very expensive to have them redo
graphics if they don't need to so
there's no point in having them make
graphics until you've actually done this
step and had the client nod and saying
yeah it's something like this we want
then they start making graphics and make
it look nice so this is still just a
wireframe there's no there's no 3d
effects there's no rounded corners and
there's no colors there's nothing on
there except just wireframes
and these of course can also be put into
AA that was not even on there yeah of
course design motions it was not like I
said I care if I'd it and correct it and
expanded as we went along and that meant
that some of the things changed many
times during the development phase one
of them one of the things that changed
the most was the logging partly because
of this whole discussion with the the
with the the card the paper card so here
you have social security number it was
split into two field then you had the
active card and then you had log on and
this has become a customer down here
that's how it started out looking then
that was changed because the bank
insisted that you should not only be
able to log on with your social security
number you should also be able to log on
with your customer number which is a
random generated number that you have in
your bank they insisted on that so we
introduced this one and and then you
either filled in your social security
number or if you have chosen this one
you filled in your customer number still
personal code and then log on active
card had disappeared because that was
the time when we weren't sure to do
active card or nem ID or a third
solution so it changed again and it
changed again because we found out that
this customer number nobody could
remember that because it was a random
generated one so nobody ever used it the
bank still didn't want to get rid of it
so what we did do was say user ID up
here instead
so not social security number not
customer name but just user ID and then
they could enter either and then the
backend would recognize whether it was
one of the other and now we had the
service code of four or four digits and
it says next on here because then what
came next was the paper ID but as I said
there's security and then there's
perceived security we wanted them to
perceive this as being highly secure but
security is often at edge with comfort
people are lazy they can't be bothered
with a long login process so this had
been out this version here had been out
for three months or something like that
and then we started getting complaints
that it was it took too long to login so
what we did instead was change it to
this one still the user ID and your
service code but now it says log on
instead of next the reason being that
now you did not have to use that paper
card to log in initially because viewing
and economy does not damage it so that
that can be less secure than if you're
actually affecting the economy that
means if you're transferring money or
paying bills you would still have to use
this paper card but it was delayed until
when you actually use these these
functionalities rather than just logging
in to see you economy and that the
reason for this was that you remember
the survey and saying what people would
use it for the use pattern today is much
different people log in at least once a
day to see the balance on their account
that's all they log in for second most
used one is actually the transactions
that was the lowest on the list before
but the reason they people log in to see
their transactions is because they want
to see has my salary gone in or has the
money somebody old me gone in that sort
of thing and it's not until third and
fourth-place in use that you find paying
bill and transferring money so that's
why we want it to delay the hassle of
the login process to that late
all right using the platform we want it
to make sure that once we go once we go
on this new platform that offers a lot
of hardware that can be used in
different ways that we actually make use
of it because otherwise there's no point
and the more obvious one is of course
the currency there's a currency
calculator in there online banking today
but it's not being used very much and
it's it's hidden much further down into
the system the reason being that when do
you need a currency calculator when
you're on holiday when you are on
holiday you're not in front of your
computer at home and you're not on the
internet so people didn't need it in
their online bank because that was not
the use scenario where they needed it
but now they do need it a lot more
because now it's on their mobile and
they actually have that with them so
they have it where they need it that's
why that was made a much more prominent
feature in the app than it is in the
online bank this one is a little more
unusual
this is a typical Danish bill that's how
they all look had the same structure
with the amount here the date here the
amount over here because this is the
receipt slip that you get over here
something about who is being paid by and
- and that sort of thing and down here
you have this long long long code that
you have to type in correctly and people
never get it right because it starts by
two digits and then you have 16 digits
and then you have another eight digits
and they are what appears to be randomly
generated so chances of getting that
right in the first go are really not
that good especially not on a mobile
phone and so we found out that because
these all look the same and they are all
using the same font you could use
picture recognition software on these
numbers so you can go in and you get
like a like a normal picture taking
screen but there's only this way you
actually take a picture and then you
focus that on that line of numbers and
it fills it straight into the app and
then you can pay your bill you only need
to
the amount and the date so that was an
unusual way of making use of the camera
which is usually for taking pictures but
in this case useful for picture
recognition instead and that was hugely
popular with with the users when that
came out and then of course using the
GPS to locate nearest branches and
nearest ATMs and that sort of thing is
also a classical way of using the
hardware in the platform so despite the
functionality being very fixed and very
familiar it is actually possible to use
some of the hardware that's at your at
your disposal
we had testing challenges because this
was under an NDA the reason for this was
that the bank wanted to keep this secret
for their competition and they knew that
some of their competitors were doing
something similar they didn't know how
far along they were and they didn't want
them to know that they were doing the
same thing what was weird was that we
were doing both apps both teams were in
the same software house and we were not
allowed to talk to each other so we
often you have projects being on an NDA
but you can usually discuss this with
your colleagues
we couldn't people didn't even know who
we worked for in this team we were just
the blue team but not not usually we are
named by the customer we are working for
we were just the blue team and then
people had to guess meaning we could
talk about it over lunch and kit in case
the green team was sitting there as well
and you know it was ridiculous but
that's how it was they really really
were fierce on this competition of being
there first with this app also Danske
Bank is a very old and stoic Bank and
they have this rumor of being very
conservative old-fashioned and that sort
of thing I think a lot of banks do and
they wanted the element of surprise they
want it to come out and saying AHA you
might think we're old and conservative
and whatnot but we can actually be hit
with the young people because we've been
doing something like this as well you
didn't expect that did you so they
wanted that and also they wanted the
control of the release they wanted to be
sure that this didn't visit out and was
blown up in the media before they could
actually you know present the the result
themselves and the control of the
release was also the reason that we had
a deadline that was a lot more firm than
deadlines usually are because in this
project the amount of money spent on the
app I think they spent somewhere between
50 and 70 times as much on advertising
for it and that came out on that date
there were posters everywhere on every
bus shed in every city in Denmark it was
on TV commercials it was a full-page ads
in the newspapers big banners on all
main stations in Denmark and so on so
forth and that was rolled out on the
15th of September imagine if the app was
not in the App Store by then that would
be bad because when you start a PR
marketing machine like that you can't
stop it right away that takes a while so
we had to have it in the App Store and
ready to download on that date otherwise
it would be a huge problem the other
problem we had with testing was that we
had no live data of course we couldn't
test on live data that would jeopardize
the customers finances and ultimately
jeopardize the bank's rumor and
reputation and economy as well so we
couldn't test on live data so what did
we do instead well we of course did
continuous test every Sprint and that
means technical tests as well as UX
testing and any kind of tests we could
run internally but on top of that we had
the bank employee 50 testers that were
supposed to test this every Sprint and
you have a lot of clients doing this
they say okay well we'll test this
internally and then you find out that
okay yeah they have spotted a few people
and say you can test this when you have
time but they never have time these 50
testers will actually assign this job
and time every week to do so
so they had a certain time every week
where they were supposed to test this
and that was huge because that gave us a
lot to work with so they had dedicated
test time where they weren't supposed to
do anything else as we came along with
the app we started making test cases
saying okay these test cases you should
go through every week to make sure that
we didn't break something since last
week and as it went further along we
started automating some of them because
there was a lot of them at the end so we
started automating as much of these
tests as we could and finally because I
couldn't do usability tests with actual
users so I had to do expert evaluations
instead going through it with heuristics
next to it and see what guidelines are
being broken and where and then suggest
fixes based on that is this as good as
if you can involve the customers of
course not is it better than not doing
anything at all and just give up oh yes
it is you can get quite far with
something like this
we didn't have live data to test on but
the bank had a test environment the
problem with the test environment was
that he was dummy data and as it always
is with dummy data they're usually not
very accurate or very realistic and
there usually isn't enough of it either
the good thing about it was that we
could test this everywhere because that
was always that log in or that
environment was always available to us
and it was only us who could look in but
for instance if I did a transfer between
two accounts yeah I could see that I
could go through all of the screens but
then when I went back to those accounts
nothing had changed that was some of the
problems that we were running into with
the test environment but they also had
something called a system environment
the system environment was real data so
it's not completely true when I said we
couldn't have real data or we couldn't
have lied data but we could have real
data what they did was take an enormous
amount of customers and all of their
data and then jumble that up and mix it
and match it and and and you know
completely anonymize it so nobody could
be recognized and none of it was you
know the way it actually looks in the
real world but it made it realistic and
made sure that we had a lot more data to
test on the problem with this was we
could only use this at the bank in the
beginning meaning that every time we had
to test anything in the system
environment we had to go to the bank's
premises that was a hassle because you
all know it as developers that you code
something then you compile it then you
run it and so now it does not work then
you redo bla bla bla and ii haven't go
back and forth every time you had to do
something now that was a real hassle
after one and a half years we finally
managed to get a connection a secure
connection to the bank so now we could
actually also test from the offices
which helped a huge deal and then
finally of course there's the production
environment that's live data and you can
test that from everywhere the problem is
everyone can test it so then it's a race
against time see who finds the
errors that come that far before us and
chances are the customers will they are
they are numbers by far all right we
also made sure that the feedback we got
that we collected that meticulously
because since we couldn't test with
users everything we could get from the
internal testers was important so we had
a system where they had to report in
what the problem was which platform had
happened on which version of the app it
happened in orbit which version of the
iOS it was running who should take care
of it and that one was important because
you that's what prevents it from falling
between two chairs of course as many
details as they could can they recreate
it what were they doing when it happened
so on so forth an attachment mainly
screenshots of whatever it was that
happens but other things as well could
be relevant and and that worked really
well because that way we were sure that
we made the most of any kind of feedback
that we got in this process the timeline
with the bank because this happened in
2010 the proof of concept but a lot has
happened since then
proof of concept was in May 2010 actual
app came out in September December then
we started being able to pay bills with
camera then in 2011 they expanded it
with an entire investment functionality
where people could look at their
portfolios and trade and that sort of
thing then it came to iPad and
investment for iPad as well then a new
visual design because now the visual
design guide had changed so they made a
new visual design for it then we did
Windows Phone 7 then we did spending
overview where you could see where have
you actually spent your money at that
past month how much on groceries how
much on utilities how much our mortgage
and so on and so forth so people have an
idea of where is my economy going then
they started making corporate apps
various types of business apps and then
in later on we came out with mobile pay
which is a way of doing small payments
back and forth through your mobile phone
only having people's phone number and
finally mobile pay business so this has
been a this started out with a small
idea that some people in the bank had
with a small portion of money and look
where we are four years later how much
we made for them I think if I count
every app we made for them I think we're
way past 20 apps and it was only the
first time it was under an NDA this was
the banner on the main square of the
capital of Denmark when they came out
with their iPad app I think it's about
40 times 50 meters big so they were not
shy about it afterwards they definitely
wanted to to make more of it this is
mobile pay and how that looks very very
easy way of transferring money between
people without having people to count
numbers and that sort of thing that you
usually don't have you usually only have
their phone number it wipes across banks
so you don't have to be a Danish bank
customer which is very smart and finally
five point five million people in
Denmark 1.5 million have downloaded this
app I would say that's a huge success
for any app to have that kind of push
through in any in any country they've
done a lot of social and media and
crowdsourcing so they did an idea bank
for their smartphone on Facebook after
the initial one came out they got 263
ideas with 3000 votes and these are some
of the ideas and the huge thing about
this was the fact that these were then
implemented and their customers loved
that that they actually were able to
have an impact on this app and where it
should go what should happen next that
made them connect more with their with
their clients so they did the same thing
five had when that came out little few
ideas but more votes and finally the
best idea was rewarded with a cake and
that's not a big deal but the fun thing
is that these are not stock photos these
are the actual developers that
originally came up with this idea in the
bank that are on that cake and I think
that's cool that they get the credit
alright so how did it go
this is just some of the things this is
transfers between own accounts transfers
within the bank transfers to other banks
and payments and as you can see it's
just going up up up all of the users
success criteria 10,000 downloads five
positive inquiries that was the original
the actual 750,000 downloads and more
than three thousand new customers so
yeah I would say it's a success 3.6
million login per month and the big one
is that in September last year they
actually ended up having more users on
their app than they have on the web so
they cross that line remember I
mentioned a mobile website that is the
mobile website that's the launch of the
app it's a big difference because this
could do the same thing but the
difference between these two were UX and
this is just some of the press that it's
been getting Danske Bank is beating
Nordea which is the the biggest
competitor in a new mobile bank test the
Danish people love the iPhone Bank
Danish Bank gets new customers via
mobile Bank Danish Bank is having huge
success with camera payments and then on
mobile pay mobile pay is expanding the
head start on the competitors mobile pay
is beating the the out of others it's
basically what it says and here it says
it's it is blowing swip off the tracks
whippers is the nearest competitor in
this thing and also to test they win
that as well but and that's more
important this one because one thing is
the press but the ratings and that's on
this one that one is on android that one
is on iphone very good ratings all along
and not only in the Danish one across
all countries so Danish one Swedish one
Norwegian one Finnish one Irish and
English all doing good in their
respective countries so this is an
example of how well it can actually go
even though you have anything but a
textbook development process with all
sorts of complications and hindrances
along the way it can go well if you
think out of the box of how to solve
these problems that's what I had
questions yeah yeah yes yeah we did a
Windows Phone 7 as well but Windows
Phone 7 is not particularly much used in
then like I think about 3% have a
Windows Phone 7 so we only did basic
basic banking on that we haven't done
investment on it although I think that's
coming out just about now on these I
think by now we about 20 to 25 people
working on it but that's doing four
projects or something like that the
original team that did the iPhone and
Android basic banking app was 7 or 8
people and that was done in in the what
was that from May to September something
on that so four months that that
includes everything close everything huh
infrastructure to but that was the good
thing the bank had the infrastructure
yeah so the backend was me I mean we
only had to do a middleware development
to actually piggyback or on the back end
they had because they had that from the
online bank otherwise it would have take
longer you right all right other
questions yeah
with the same way we've always done with
them except now we once in a while we do
user testing now because now is not
under an NDA anymore is out there so now
we can do user testing at least it's on
some of it but other than that we still
have the 50 internal testers at the bank
and we still test everything the
developers and the UX and the graphic
designers all of us test it continuously
that's basically or that's that's mainly
based on on test cases standardized test
cases that we go through every time and
as many of those are automated as we can
and also that actually was one of the
reasons that we created a spin-off
company called less painful which is
because they want it less painful
testing
that's the name less painful and and
what they do is they have I am not
completely into it but what they've done
is they've written a test procedure
where you can you can hook in as many
phones as you want and then write a test
scenario that you have to press this
button then you have to wait this long
and then you have to press here or swipe
there or whatever and it will go through
that movement on all of these phones and
every time it's done it one of these
commands it will take a screenshot and
the report you get out of that is a line
of screenshots across but what is really
good about that is because you can scan
across and say okay is there any of
those that look broken compared to the
others and also if at some point it
crashes then okay now that one is no
longer providing screenshots but the
rest are then you know there's a problem
with that specific platform there
because it's with the amount of androids
and also by now the amount of different
iPhones testing on all of them and
testing all functionality on all of them
is a monumental task so that's why they
came out with this system and that works
quite well actually all right
users expectations changed over the
years they become increasingly demanding
because as they see more and more apps
out there and they they move more and
more of their digital world onto the
mobile phone rather than the computer
and because they can compare across to
other apps and see how well they do they
become increasingly demanding because
they won't accept that we fall behind
because they say well others can do that
why can't you so they are very demanding
and they keep us on our toes definitely
all right thank you very much yes we
constantly run two week sprint yeah we
have other projects where we want where
most of them we run two week sprint we
have a few that we have been running
one-week sprints but that's a bit short
so mostly its two-week Sprint's all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
