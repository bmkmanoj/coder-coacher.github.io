my cut-down CV this sin theory is what
qualifies me to talk about managing my
career because I've had a lot of them
and basically I started off as an
undergraduate working for Ford Motor
Company I kind of came through the web
development almost all of that Java I
came through the web development a view
back towards server side staff then
ended up working on the destructor Lmax
for financial exchange and ended up
doing MongoDB so I've worked on a lot of
different domains a lot of different
companies and I've kind of kind of half
purposefully steered my career through
that stuff to get this range of domain
experience I am but really what I'm
interested in is about you because
otherwise I'm just going to tell you all
about me and I want it to be more
applicable to you guys so is anyone here
just starting out on their technical
career graduates or switching into
technical career okay I would like less
than two years experience ish okay
two years plus two to two to five years
ish okay five to ten years it's a chunk
of you more than ten years that's a big
chunk of you more than 20 years yay I'm
going to ask you guys to share some of
your experiences because I haven't got
there yet not yet and so that's quite a
varied range of people with a varied
range of experiences so there's there's
going to be some stuff which is
applicable for some of you some which is
applicable for all of you a natural
factors let's split it into three
different sections I apologize for this
slide I said this quite a lot of
material to cover and this is the sort
of the themes that we can cover if you
want to we've got the the investing bit
is really around its billable for all of
you regardless of whether you're and
whether you're starting out whether
you're and trying to continue your
career whether you want to stay where
you are and do something more useful in
your current job or whether you want to
switch so there's a bunch of stuff
around the investing side so and some of
this stuff is covered in this morning's
keynote or at least touched upon so I'm
hoping to go over probably a fair chunk
of that because it's probably applicable
to most of you
and there's a whole bit on things to do
if you want to stay where you are right
now and including things like getting
promoted and then there's obviously a
whole load of stuff around how to get a
new job and how to move on and how to
find the new job so um I guess what I
need to know is which subjects are you
most interested in who's really
interested in finding out about the
investing side of stuff the more general
stuff some of you okay who wants to know
about how to do best where they are
including getting promoted and salary
and stuff okay since I said salary
everyone yeah me and moving on finding
the new job careers of CVS and stuff
like that okay hopefully your companies
aren't watching this video right now and
this is all in complete confidentiality
so sadly that means they're sort of
split three different ways and now I
have to cover all of the material and
great okay I'm just going to have to do
it really quickly you know as developers
we tend to think about the skills maybe
that we're going to learn but not
necessarily about how to manage our
career and that's some of what I wanted
to talk about what like how how I
thought about managing my career and
maybe why we should think a bit about
managing your career but I guess I'm
going to touch on that throughout the
thing hopefully maybe we'll come back to
it and so this is the kind of more
general stuff which is hopefully
applicable to all of you and and so I
want to touch on this bit a little bit
actually which is that the question that
you just raised which is what why are we
investing in our careers like what what
is the point and the point is that only
you are going to be able to manage your
own career you can find mentors and you
can find role models and you could find
team members who will help you out but
ultimately it's down to you to manage
your career it's down to you to figure
out where you're going to go next and
it's not really down to your company to
go oh we really like you we should
promote you it's really up to you to go
I'm really awesome it's really important
this whole thing this morning about
marketing yourself and telling people
why you're you're good at what you do so
this
is down to you to manage this stuff um
and something that I resisted for
probably most of my 20s is this idea of
investing my own time in my career
because I thought I can't be bothered
it's just a lot of time I spend 40 hours
a week programming I don't want to do
pet projects I don't want to do
outsource I don't want to do more work
stuff at weekends and evenings so that I
can do more work stuff I want to go run
in and I want to I want to spend time
with my family and I want to I don't
know I want to do anything which isn't
being sat in front of a computer but one
of the things I learned is that the more
time you invest in it the less shitty
your job is because you get better jobs
and you don't do that every day typing
forty hours at your desk job because
you've invested in the early years or
even throughout your whole career in
order to get a better job so it doesn't
feel like such a chore to be sat there
all the time so that's why it's
important in my opinion the first thing
you need to find out is is what you want
and I say that the first thing you need
to find out and it's also the hardest
thing and it's the thing you need to
keep coming back to again and again and
it was the thing that what does he say
this morning I made notes so that I
could remember he said yes why am I
doing this what do you want why am I
doing this and what you want is not
necessarily that terrible job interview
question of where do you see yourself
from five years time on a beach not here
you never you never tell the honest
answer to that do you yeah say well I
don't want to be here or I hope to leave
this company to go and work somewhere
better and so what you really thinking
when you say what do you want is not
what where do I want to be in five years
time but what is it you want from your
job or from your career or from your
life and that might be I want to buy a
yacht like Larry I want to spend more
time with my family I want to change the
world and my thing was I don't want to
limit myself I don't have a clear vision
I don't really know what I want to do
and I still don't know what I want to be
when I grow up so what I do want to do
is I don't want to put myself down
career avenues which block off future
choices and that's actually why I chose
computer science
to my degree because it's kind of
technical and logically so it's a kind
of useful degree and it can be used for
any job where you need a degree so I
used that to try and open up my avenues
not to try and close myself down into
programming so my what you want was
always I want to not be limited I want
to have as many options as possible
which is also why I worked at lots of
different places because I wanted to get
a range of domain experience and I don't
want to be and I didn't want any
typecast as a web developer which is why
I shifted myself into server-side
development later on so you might have
any number of reasons of what you want
and it might be things like I want to be
able to work with awesome people or I
want to be able to work flexibly so that
I can spend more time with my friends
and family or so that I can run that
marathon and you have to think about
what's important to you in your life and
that will help you shape your careers in
that direction and it when you think
about what you want you almost never
think I want to learn spring that's what
I want from my career or I want to even
I want to learn about no sequel it when
you think about what you want as a
person that's not really what you want
you think maybe that would be fun or be
interesting or it means to an end but
you don't think you know I want to spend
five years doing spring hibernate but
and this comes back to the same point
I'm just basically sticking photos in
here it's got nothing to do with my talk
and the the point is that you can't I
don't think you should just accidentally
fall into job after job after job and
even when I did a range of jobs in my
20s I kind of did make purposeful
choices however um I was on a panel last
night with Dan North and he kind of said
that he has fallen into job after job so
I guess it works for some people but I
think that if you really want the most
out of your life and therefore probably
your career or your job you need to
steer in a non junk drunken fashion
right and who was just getting started
on their whole IT career thing so
there's a fair chunk of you I want to go
through all this this fairly quickly
because it's not applicable to everyone
but there's a real bootstrapping problem
when you get started
this is true in any if you want to be a
waitress it's still true but no one
really wants to hire you when you don't
have any experience and no one and you
can't without experience you can't get a
job and without a job you don't get
experience and it's a real problem and
the other thing is that there are plenty
of people coming into the industry
because perhaps not as many as we would
like but still got loads of graduates
coming into industry and it's quite
difficult to tell them apart because
once they're coming in with their CV and
they've got computer science degree or
maybe they're cross-training from
another job and there's very little to
differentiate you from everyone else so
the key thing here is to be different
and to stand out you have to have
something which makes you different that
makes your CV stand out because your CV
is quite short it's like one page and
it's got I don't like well it depends
whether you're a more mature person
coming into the industry or whether
you're a graduate but if you're a
graduate your CV is quite short and you
you know you've got very little on there
it needs to be special so you can do
things like and this is a bit late in
the game to say some of this stuff but
internships or sponsorships are really
good for that sort of thing so I was a
sponsored student at Ford and I did a
year out between second and third year
University
so when I came out as a graduate I was
still just a graduate but I had 15
months work experience which did make a
big difference
third year project my third year project
I got that sponsored by friends company
that was great for two reasons at least
two reasons one all the time I spent
working on my third year project at
University I was being paid by the hour
I worked really hard on that process I
spent a lot of hours working on it and
it meant I did have you I had a good
quality project at the end of it
actually won one of the prizes for the
end of your project
I could fund myself to live in a nice
place and I've got on my CV that I was
doing contracting for this company
during my third year so that was another
thing that once I graduated I had 15
months undergraduate experience at Ford
and nine months or whatever contracting
experience with this company and there's
always pet projects and open source I
almost deleted the word projects after
this morning's talk where we said no
more projects but if your code is on
github somewhere
I've so I've done recruiting for
graduates at my last job and we used to
make them do these kind of ridiculous
coding exercises everyone's gone through
at some point but if your code is on
github I don't make you do a ridiculous
coding exercise because I can see your
code and that makes a big difference to
me so I can see whether you're good
developer or not Mike I see whether
you're devoted to your profession as a
developer make your CV special I've seen
some people with fairly limited work
experience with some really interesting
CVS like a one-page PDF you have to have
it in PDF because recruitment agents
will completely munch up your CV and
turn it in something completely
different if you put it in PDF format
they can't do that to you someplace and
so he had this thing where he had two
arrows two timelines going up on the one
page and he had a sort of academic stuff
on one side and here's them sort of work
and pet projects on the other side so I
could get a feel for because it's quite
difficult if you're doing bitty stuff in
a bit of academic in a bit of part-time
in a bit of this I could see what he'd
been doing over the last few years and
it made a lot of sense to me so we
called him into interview just because
his CV really stood out he'd really made
an effort and I could see that and so
that's kind of the Whistlestop tour of
that and a lot of the stuff here if I
cover CVS the resumes and interviews
will be applicable as well I think for
this I'm anyone interested in switching
roles to developer or from developer to
be a or be a tech lead into something
different a handful of you and okay I
have done this I've written my thing so
small I can't see it and I've done this
one of the things you can do one of the
things you should do is rephrase all
your work experience so that it looks
like your new role so if you're so for
example my example is I was a developer
and I wanted to try out being business
analyst I don't know why it didn't work
but I thought I'd give it a go and so
all the stuff I'd been doing as a
developer I rephrased all the stuff on
my CV so that you could see the bit
where I'd been talking to the customers
or the bit where I'd helped with user
acceptance testing or the bit where
I'd come up with text facts and all the
documentation stuff I kind of really
emphasized that side of things on my CV
so that it looked like I've been doing
be a slash developer roles all along
which I sort had which is why I thought
that doing switch and so it's an it I
find a lot of developers who feel
uncomfortable about um how should I put
it
tweaking their CV about bumping up
certain things on their CV and squishing
certain things down or when they're
interviewing with people perhaps pushing
bits of themselves which may be
inflating it slightly more than then you
would be comfortable with and we're not
really like that because as engineers we
kind of like to be a bit more factual
but that's the only way you're really
going to market yourself if you're going
to switch roles you need to make a big
thing of the stuff you've done in the
past which is applicable for the thing
you want to do now I talked mostly about
CV though you can do it internally if
you're doing it inside a company it's my
it could be easier actually because the
company knows who you are and the
company knows what you do and so then
it's kind of down to you to seek out the
projects or the roles that that that the
projects or the roles the things you
want to do the thing there is to be
persistent because you can very easily
get typecast into this one particular
role and so what you've got to do is the
same thing I checked these people and
say I'm really good at being tech lead
because you know I manage this gradual
over here which wasn't really an
official tech lead position but I did it
and the guide we took him on as a
graduate therefore I must be a good
leader and you have to sort of have
those sorts of conversations um I'm only
going to cover up briefly how much to
cover a staying technical who wants to
know about how to stay in a technical
role and and grow your technical career
a lot more of you um I don't know about
you guys but when I left University the
impression I had about being about
development and being a developer is
it's just a phase and you do it for two
to five years until you become grown-up
enough to be promoted into tech lead or
project manager anyone else feel that
get told that nods around the room
and so this is kind of constant pressure
to switch roles to be promoted and not
so much of a pressure except for
conferences like this not so much of a
pressure to get better at what you do
and less of an expectation to be paid
more for just being really good at what
you do and um in sort of 15 13 years of
my career I've actually worked quite
hard apart from trying to make the
switch a couple of times into different
roles
I've worked quite hard to stay technical
and to stay a developer and when you're
updating your CV and you see last five
jobs Job Description senior developer
some people think oh well you haven't
progressed so you have to make a big
deal of the of the differences between
the different roles that you've had you
have to be aware of this in your own
head as well you can't just keep keep
being a developer just for the sake of
keeping being developer because then
you'll just get stuck in this rut doing
the same stuff again and again and again
and you move to another job where you're
doing spring and hibernate for probably
a slightly better salary and then
another job we're doing spring and
hibernate until you want to shoot
yourself in the head so the thing about
staying technical again I've written my
notes really really sweet small there's
there's this idea of technical career
path so you can do beard junior
developer developer senior developer
technically slash architects CTO but is
that really what we mean when we say
staying technical is that getting
promoted outside of your comfort zone
who wants to just say being a developer
good developer for like as long as
possible right how many of you your
company's perhaps encouraged you to
perhaps be a leader or management is
that that the obvious career path some
of you may be this is changing I don't
know but the the key to stay in
technical is to stay ahead of the curve
it's just to keep on with your with your
technical skills now you're all out of
conference you already doing this you're
already learning about new technologies
that are out there or about ways to use
ologies that you're already using and
another great thing about conferences is
if you start talking at conferences and
you start being seen as a technical
leader
no one's necessarily going to hire you
to be a project manager they're going to
hire you for being a senior technology
person so one of the things you do to
sort of continue being a technical
person is to stay visible as a technical
person as a thought leader as someone
who knows this technology stuff and then
no one's going to hire you for the wrong
sort of thing I'm going to come back to
visibility and this sort of thing later
and so staying ahead of the curve
there's the the idea of coming to
conferences there's loads of things you
can do and I've been using Stack
Overflow a lot lately as part of my job
with MongoDB one of the things I have to
do is I do community support so I go to
stack overflow and I answer questions
and I was new to MongoDB when when I
joined the company of course I was new
but I didn't know the product when I
joined the company either and going on
Stack Overflow seeking out questions
about MongoDB and being forced to answer
them was extremely good for really
ramping up my knowledge of MongoDB
because first you look at the question
and you're like I don't know the answer
to that and then you do some research
and then you write some tests and then
you work with it and and as you do that
your knowledge of the product increases
also if you answer a question and then
someone else gives a better answer to
that question you're like all right I
didn't know that so this is an really
good gamification way of keeping your
knowledge current you know I have to go
to stack overflow and read all the
answers to the questions that sounds
incredibly boring but if you participate
it's quite a good way of ramping up your
technical knowledge in whichever one is
your chosen subject I used to use Google
Reader a lot I was very disappointed
when they shut it down and I used it for
collating mostly the blogs of people who
were thought leaders in technology so I
had a bunch of the thought works guys
were on there I had people like Joel
Spolsky back in the day when he was
still blogging and
I had Rams in repose I had a bunch of
technical blogs on there and I used to
read them all the time and those are the
people who inspired me to start my own
technical blog and who inspired me to
realize that I could continue to be a
technical person and learn would learn
new technologies that came out at the
rands blog was the first place I heard
TripIt mentioned it's an amazing tool
which I could not live with without now
so that really helped me to stay on top
of stuff back in the day i don't use
feedly as much now and I don't know if
that's because now I use Twitter a lot
more and Twitter is more lightweight so
I follow a bunch of technical people I
kind of see what they're tweeting about
so I get a much more so I'm sort of
surfing the tsunami of Twitter you get
this feeling for trends which are coming
up the words for the technologies which
are most common at the moment obviously
functionals big at the moment ruby is
going down apparently other and and then
you can dive into they post blog posts
that may or may not be interesting so I
found that a lot easier for a really
lightweight way of taking the pulse of
the technical community without having
to read books about you know Gradle for
example this is where I found out about
Gradle and the conference I found out
about Spock and these are my two
favorite things for this year these are
amazing and but coming back to the book
thing I've been using Spock and Gradle I
have used them enough that now I want to
buy a book so I can learn more about it
you don't necessarily need to go and buy
a book on all the technologies you want
to learn to stay ahead of the curve
first you just like you were saying in
the keynote this morning spend 10
minutes just play with it see what it
feels like read a couple of blogs if
you're using an anger then you can start
going a bit deeper and finding out a bit
more about it but you don't need to be
an expert on everything just be an
expert enough on the stuff you need to
know yeah mainly lists again kind of
surfing this tide of information and I'm
a member of the London Java user group
and that's a really good way for seeing
which technologies are kind of coming
and going because the new technology is
this real demand for talks on subject
and then I can go to an hour-long talk
free you know in my city and find out
enough about that technol
to get a feel for what it is and even if
I don't go to the talk the fact that
they are having talks on I don't know
closure for the next six months tells me
that closure is probably something I
should find something out about and and
user groups really great for for other
stuff like networking visibility and
things like that which I will come on to
hopefully I want to cover a little bit
non-technical skills which is not it's
not so commonly spoken about when people
are talking about their career they
almost always in the London Java
community in the Graduate Java community
a graduate developer community people
are always asking me which technology
should I learn next to get the next best
job and that's probably the most
commonly asked question second most
commonly asked question which technology
should I learn so I get hired by a bank
and then you have to ask the question
why for the money of course but people
don't say what other skills do I need to
know they might think and process they
might think do I need to know about
agile and and they might think about
things like that but what they don't ask
is is more general skills more difficult
to put your finger on and say go to this
place and learn this thing and research
skills now I spend a lot of time on
Stack Overflow it is astounding the
number of people who do not go to Google
to find the answer to their question
first it's astounding and I look at
those people and they've almost always
got an anonymous user tag with a number
on there and I think I never want to
hire you because you're going to be sat
there in my organization not even
googling for the answer which would be
bad enough just sat there asking Stack
Overflow to do your job for you research
skills really really important something
that we learn on the job as we're going
I remember in the early days I was using
Alta Vista to try and find out the
answer to my java problems and learning
your Google foo is one of the best ways
to learn about stuff right so when I'm
on Stack Overflow answering questions I
don't know the answers to I google it
and then I write a test and then I
reproduce the problem and then I post
the test on on Stack Overflow which
comes to scientific method
if I have a bug or I think I have a bug
or I want to reproduce something I write
a test for it to see if it is the way
that I want it to be or isn't the way I
want it to be then when I have a test
I can methodically go through and find
how to fix that test how to make that
test go green this sounds the most of
you're looking at me blankly as if you
know course we all do that you'd be
amazed at the number of people who
especially on place let Stack Overflow
you say the other tests to reproduce the
thing you're asking me and they say no
what's a test and you say go away so
scientific method having a hypothesis
and coming up with an experiment to
prove or disprove this hypothesis we
learned about this in school we're
engineers we should be able to do this
stuff it's a part of our job if you're
diagnosing and debugging a problem you
can't do DevOps or production support
without having some sort of scientific
method otherwise you're just going to
end up running around in circles with
your pants on fire which I have seen as
well asking questions and the junior
people wheeze to her Lmax we mostly
hired them because of their ability to
ask excellent questions in interview and
so it wasn't about their knowledge of
anything but their ability to sort of
say ok I didn't really understand this
can you explain it to me more or ok so I
think you just said this but I'm not
really confused about this bit here and
in my experience we're not really
encouraged to ask questions we're sort
of told that as engineers that we are
supposed to know the answers who is
supposed to be the solution makers not
the problem makers don't come to me with
a question come to me with the solution
and and that's kind of we get brought up
with this idea but questions are
fundamental to delivering the right
thing like why am I doing this
what is it you actually want to achieve
not how do I put a button in the middle
of the page so learning how to ask
questions and but the the counterpart to
that is of the junior guys we hired who
ask direct questions one of them didn't
make it past a probation because he kept
asking the same questions for three
months and we thought well that's nice
you're asking great questions but you're
not listening you're not learning you're
not practicing
you're not getting the muscle memory
you're not you're not exercising the
rest of your brain you're just basically
expecting other people to tell you how
to do stuff so you need to and lifting
and learning and practice this is all
kind of this feedback loop and it just
comes with you over time but I don't
really again these are fluffy things I
can't really tell you how to do these
things but these are important skills as
developers and technical people
interpersonal skills that I mean that
means all sorts of stuff but we I
believe good developers I come from more
of an agile and XP kind of thing if
you're going to do pair programming you
need to be able to talk to the person
next to you you need to be able to say
in a sensitive fashion I do not believe
the thing you are doing is the correct
thing or I think I think this is a
better way without making that person
feel you know being confrontational
about the whole thing so if a pair
programming that's important but it's
the same when you're talking to users or
business analysts or whoever it's quite
important to be able to say to them I
don't really know what it is you want to
achieve or how you want to achieve it
and you need to be able to steer that
conversation and not just have the
information come at you and be expected
to code whatever nonsense they told you
obviously they are always talking about
useful stuff but sometimes it comes
across as nonsense and this last one is
not really aimed at you guys but I
recently moved to Spain and there are
lots of very good technical people there
and there are no jobs in Spain it's a
real shame to watch them not be able to
make the most of their career because
they can't relocate to somewhere like
London where there are jobs and there is
demand because they don't have the
English levels required more often than
not actually it's just a confidence
thing they do have the English but you
need to be able to practice and you need
to have confidence in this lots of jobs
even if you're working outside of an
english-speaking country require you to
have English so that either you can talk
to the parent company also that you can
do support or you can do whatever but
it's really important it's it's sad
state fairs in my personal opinion but
in order to be good as a developer you
need to have good English skills all the
conference's that are in English more or
less all the books all the materials all
the blog stack over
all that stuff I mentioned is all in
English so it's something that needs to
be worked on all right I'm halfway
through and I've only done 1/3 of the
material is anyone interested in talking
about relocation whether to relocate is
it helpful for your career on person
come and see me afterwards and getting
work-life balance right anyone want to
talk about work-life balance
oh no okay let's talk about that I'm
really bad at that does anyone have any
really good ideas on how to get
work-life balance right yes okay so
consider your you're always busy so it
makes no difference whether you work
four hours or 10 hours you're still
going to have as much busyness as
absorbs your time so there's something
about prioritization here I'm during my
20s I kind of prioritized well as I
prioritize my career I think that's
really true in my early 20s oh I thought
my career was like a 9 to 5 and I didn't
have to invest in it and so then I had a
lots of life with my work-life balance I
guess my late 20s I thought this is
ridiculous because I have stupid jobs
and I must invest in my career to get
good jobs and and ten years later I'm
starting to perhaps notice that I should
be doing things other than stackoverflow
and work and user group staff and
talking at conferences and then crow
barring some life into my work-life
balances is a bit tricky but it requires
discipline and it requires
prioritization and it requires for me it
requires strict calendar maintenance so
weekends are special for I don't I see
in my family or you know in evenings
don't put more than two evening events
on a week or whatever so for me I find
this strict management of my time very
useful and being disciplined and but I
don't have kids or anything like that so
I can't really talk about that side of
the work-life balance but I am this has
been recorded so I don't know how honest
to be I would like at some point in my
long life to perhaps have a family that
I will care for and I do not expect to
be working 80-hour weeks when I have
kids
if I have kids and and so one of the
things I've been trying to do with my
career is get to a position where I can
call the shots a lot more with the
work/life balance thing hopefully I
don't want to say much more to being
videoed and it being different I want to
make a quick comment I mentioned this a
little bit on standing out in there as a
new developer being different is a major
advantage I've heard it said in various
forums that what obviously this is thing
called impostor syndrome where if you're
a little bit different you feel quite
challenged and you that you you don't
belong as developers we kind of grew up
feeling a little bit different and as if
we didn't belong right we we all feel a
little bit like that and so this is not
a bad state to be in and being different
for whatever reason standing out for
whatever reason is a great thing when
you're trying to get a new job
specifically if I see I used to I used
to do see be screening or come onto that
if I see like 20 CVS in in I don't I
used to do it in about ten minutes then
I need something which is going to look
different so if you've if you've run a
marathon if you climbed Everest if you
wrote a book if you I don't know all
these things which make as individuals
all these things which make us as those
are things to really pump up and to be
proud of and not something - not
something to worry about that we're
Outsiders I think that's all I'm really
going to say on that all right 34
minutes in great and who wants to talk
about staying where they are and doing a
good job of where they are
oh loads of you um and who wants to talk
about moving on and getting a new job
loads of you alright I'm going to try
and do this super super fast and I don't
respec slowly to begin with all right
visibility part one there's something
that I got told when I worked at Ford
and quite early on by a number of
different people that if I wanted to get
on inside Ford I needed to shout about
my abilities and he'd shout about who I
was and need to play the game
the
political and I really hated this I
thought that as a developer we should
let the code speak for itself we should
just be it's enough for us to be good
developers that should say enough about
us being good at our jobs sadly this is
just not true it's just not the case
even if you pay a program and you've got
someone who's looking at your code all
the time even if you do code reviews and
people will check your code it's not
enough that you do good code you have to
tell everyone have to market yourself
you have to tell people that you're good
at what you do and sometimes this means
doing things which is not tor related to
your day job and the reason is um if
someone's going to is perhaps perhaps
you in a larger organization or maybe
even works inside smaller organizations
if it comes time to do your annual
review and you're sort of saying please
sir please promote me or please madam
please promote me if they don't know
your name and if they don't know who you
are you're not going to get it no matter
how good your code is so when people are
discussing you around that table and
they're discussing it's an annual review
they discuss everyone the whole company
around that table they need to have
something that sticks in their mind that
is you which is why I say being
different is quite useful so I'm inside
your current company big or small is
always in-house curricular
extracurricular activities that you can
be involved with to give you that
visibility so for the small companies
one other Lmax I helped start the brown
bags on Monday lunch times and I would
presented it as brown bags a few times
which was a good way to get into
conference speaking because it's a nice
safe environment with a small number of
your peers and all you have to do it's
really lightweight all you have to do is
just say I worked on this cool thing
this week and this is this is what it
looks like or I discovered this new
technology let me demo it a little bit
and then we can have a discussion about
whether we should use it or not pros and
cons and it's really really lightweight
and it's a good way for you to be
position yourself as a sort of thought
leader as a serious technical person by
demonstrating technologies and by doing
the research it also keeps you ahead of
the technical curve and the pub I've
needed for this first but I thought that
probably wasn't the politically correct
thing to do and most the companies have
worked out especially consultancies
anyone work for a consultancy a few
you so you know consultancies are sort
of different because when you're doing
your day job you're not actually working
with your company or you're not working
with all of your company so you have to
work even harder at getting visibility
inside your company because you're doing
a great job for the client and they're
very happy with you and they might even
pay you loads of money to stay there but
if you want to get on inside your
company especially if it's a consultancy
but it applies to most organizations you
need to again you need this visibility
and you need to network with the people
inside your company and I found this
most useful in the pub I'm English so
maybe that's the way it works but just
going to the pub usually Fridays after
work and you don't have to go out and
get absolutely trolleys and spill your
deepest darkest secrets to these people
advise you don't do that done that too
and you can go for one drink get to chat
to people try and talk to as many people
as possible trying to the networking
thing and it sounds like a chore if
you're not really used to doing that
sort of thing but a it gets you good at
talking to people what you don't really
know that well and and be it's not
really a chore to talk to people who
work for your company if your company's
quite cool or be loads of cool people
there or even if it's not that cool
they'll still be interesting people
there and get to talk about technologies
and get to talk about what they're doing
the important thing here is not only do
you get visibility for you know this is
me and I'm awesome and non chatty and
this is what I'm working on but
especially in a consultancy but also in
other organizations you find out what
the other people are working on and they
might be working on a really cool
project and you might want to go and
work on that project and then you know
someone on that project and then you can
find out who else is on that project and
how to get yourself onto that project
it's really useful for managing your
career this informal networking thing um
right so yes so then we come to high
visibility projects so if you get
yourself on a project I did afford so
this wasn't just a consultancy thing and
I worked on a project at Ford which was
replacing the dealer ordering systems
for the guys from the guys from Land
Rover because Ford had just acquired
Land Rover it's very important that Ford
got the Land Rover guys onto a new
ordering system because they had to pay
the licensing costs for the Land Rover
projects this was pretty much
the only project they had any money for
back in nineteen 2002 and so I was on
this big project it got a lot of
management attention and it meant that
my managers manager who normally
wouldn't have known who on earth I was
knew who I was and knew what I did and
when I came to leave forward he actually
was working quite hard to retain me at
Ford because I've been on this big
project that was kind of accidental but
it was also well accidentally on purpose
I wanted to be on this project it was
the most interesting thing going and
getting what you want this is just a
quick story really insider inside your
current company this is related to the
getting on to the project that you want
I wanted to move to New York I really
wanted to move to New York I don't know
why it's just one of those things and my
company debt occurred they bought
another company called MA partners who
had an office in New York and when I
found that out I would not stop until I
found out who was responsible for
helping me potentially move out to New
York and so I told everyone I knew in
the pub I told my line manager I told my
project manager I told my friends that
this is what I wanted to do and then we
went the Christmas party and I'm still
going on about bloody New York and so
someone says okay look I actually know
someone who is going to be tasked with
increasing the technical presence over
in New York because they're a business
consultancy so this person walked me
over to this guy mark and said this is
Tricia she wants to go to New York and
in and he was you know whew we had a
long conversation or what out pretty
well and he was like yeah yeah
definitely you'll definitely be coming
to New York sounds awesome
and and it was one of those things so I
followed up on it the next day said is
this really what what we're going to do
and I basically emailed him to death
until he sent me to New York and it took
nearly a year it took me from the
Christmas party in December to the next
November before I made it out to New
York and during that time I had to
manage a lot of things to get that to
work so I then had to position myself
onto a project inside the consultancy
which was going to be a project I could
work on from New York I also had to move
house like three times because I didn't
know when I was going to New York I
didn't want to finally
year-long contract so I kind of hung
everything for that year on to this trip
to New York but I was really persistent
and it worked and I moved to New York in
2007 and then the credit crunch happened
and I moved back to London in 2008 but
it was still a very valuable experience
and I I learnt that and I'm sort of
person who doesn't normally always ask
for what I want I'm like well I've sort
of told someone that that's what I want
and and you know I'm a nice person so
they'll give it to me at some point and
it doesn't work that way if if it's not
you pestering for something that you
want someone else is going to be
pestering for what they want and they're
going to get it and that's not cool you
deserve it getting promoted who wants to
get promoted either people aren't
admitting it or no one really wants to
be promoted I'm gonna whiz over this one
a bit visibility is very very important
people we sat around the table
discussing you and they need to know who
you are and you need to know the system
and this is something I really hated as
a developer I don't want to work the
system I don't want to play politics I
don't I just want to be promoted because
I'm amazing or what I do and but the two
times actually did get promoted inside
the larger organization was because I
studied the appraisal system figured out
I failed to get promoted the first year
I thought I was going to get promoted I
failed to get promoted because I didn't
tell anyone I wanted to be promoted and
I didn't tell anyone I was really good
at what I did so I didn't get promoted
and the next year I am that's that's
what I wanted to do and which is the
same year as moving to New York actually
and I looked at the appraisal system I
looked at how it had worked and for me
the previous year
I spoke to other people who had been
promoted to find out how they had
managed it and and I found people a
compliment actually and and I kept
records throughout the entire year of
what I'd been doing all of my
accomplishments all of my achievements
because what we do is we get an annual
appraisal and we go great I'm going to
appraise myself for the last year and
you don't you appraise yourself for the
last three months or maybe the last
months or maybe this week and you had a
really
bad week he said I'm not very good at
that or am i okay at that and oh I can't
think when I did that and you just fill
it in for what your mind is telling you
is the last year and it isn't it's what
happened very very recently so if you
want to do this you have to keep a
record at least monthly of the stuff
you've done so this month what did I do
which is really awesome oh well I was
running this team and we actually hit
our target and I hit the deadline it
might be a small deadline but you hit
the deadline where not everyone would
have done that or I don't know I was in
New York and I started the brown bags in
New York and that's just a tiny thing
and when it came to six months later I
would have forgotten that it was me who
started that because it was just rolling
and it just kept going so you have to
make a note of all of these little
things so then when you mark yourself 5
out of 5 for all the different areas
you've got evidence for why you're great
at team leadership or why you're great
at technology leadership or proof of
when you handled a difficult situation
or whatever is on your stupid appraisal
form you've got proof and then when you
say you know I delivered this project on
time and under budget then people will
go oh yes you should do that that's
totally true so you need to keep
evidence otherwise people are just gonna
say okay you're great but we've got no
proof of that and pick your friends
wisely so the the one time I was going
for a promotion
oh no I would have quite liked to been
promoted if I thought about it and I was
quite good friends with my manager and
he felt bad putting me forward for
promotion because we were extremely good
friends and used to hang out all the
time so he sort of felt a moral quandary
for putting me forward because he
thought that maybe it might look like he
was favoriting his friend and next time
around didn't make friends in my manager
and basically picked a champion inside
the inner circle of people who do
discuss promotions and didn't pick my
line manager necessarily because I
didn't really have a relationship with
her but this person I sort of picked
them and asked them to to champion me
and so that worked for me that's really
only a one-off but these are things I
guess we can all learn from or not
there's other organizations I work for
smaller ones
well I haven't managed to get the
promotion I thought I deserved whatever
that means
and by promotion I just mean like I
don't know senior developer instead of
developer this stupid stuff and the the
times I haven't managed to get promotion
it appears I didn't know people to
influence and I didn't know the system
and so if you don't know those things
you're basically drifting in the wind
hoping that someone the right person is
going to notice that you're you're good
at what you do so you need to figure out
who it is you need to market yourself to
otherwise it's not going to happen
salary negotiation I've got quarter of
an hour left and we haven't done CVS and
I've got like a whole talks with the
stuff on CDs I assume people want to
talk about salary negotiation no yes
okay yeah um the quick version is quick
version is are these talks an hour long
or 40 minutes long 15 I've got five
minutes
um all right come to me afterwards for
salary negotiation I really want to talk
about um these things really quickly
visibility part to this is visibility
for if you want to move jobs you want to
get outside of your current company and
so there's things work for a well known
company this is in order of ease right
if you are working for a well-known
company you say I work for Google then
that's quite good it makes you look good
and publicly visible projects when I
worked at Ford I worked on for journey
which is the first web site in the world
for selling cars online so when I was
doing my my graduate interviews for
graduate positions then I could say look
at this website
I made that work on Netscape for know
what no one thinks that's an
accomplishment that was an
accomplishment okay so I could point
people to something I physically did I
get hub answers talked about this a bit
if your code is out there and I can see
it or if you are well-known as a
contributor people might come to you to
go and work on the projects we do this a
lot at MongoDB so we look at people in
the community who are active
contributors and if they're good at what
they do we'll just hire them that's what
we want blogging is a really great way
to get out there and be seen as being a
thought leader especially if people read
it that's useful too and so pick
little bit about what you want to blog
on but the best thing to do is blog on
something which is interesting to you
so I blog on some technical stuff but I
also blog a lot on process and how
people wind me up and that way you get
it's more it's easier to get sense of
the person and whether they're going to
fit in your team if you're blogging
about something which is passionate
you're passionate about so I mentioned a
bit about user groups to join a user
group network meet people at Lmax we
used to use the london java community a
lot for hiring so we we hired two people
from there before the guy who runs the
community who is a recruiter noticed
what I was doing and then he said Oh
we'd like to recruit for you and I'm
like I asked you six months ago and you
haven't done anything so that was really
that was a really great way for us to
get people that were good fits for Lmax
because we could talk to them in a more
casual environment and we could see what
they were interested in and at Lmax
because we did a lot of pair programming
how you were as a person is quite
important it's really important that we
get on with you so meeting you at user
group is a really good way for us to
figure out whether we like you or not
and conferences so speaking at
conferences attending conferences this
is a really good way to get your name
out there and it's easier than you think
as well so user groups I was sort of
talking about just go to a user group
and go to the pub events that's a good
way to network and get visibility and
perhaps find your new job but you can
sort of gradually go up through the
ranks of the user group and this really
is a sort based purely upon how much
effort you want to put in there's no
real politics in there and so you can be
an organizer or you can be a speaker so
I started speaking at user groups until
someone kicked me on stage at an actual
conference then I started talking about
conferences so it's a way to sort of
progress up that chain if that's what
interests you in the most difficult
thing as far as I'm concerned is you
could write a book so I've seen series
of people who have written books and I
go oh that's very impressive should get
that person in for interview they must
know what they're talking about but it
sounds like an awful lot of work and
finding a good finding a good company to
work for really and not so much a
necessarily good role okay so one thing
I learnt very not very early on
throughout the course of my career is
that not all companies are created equal
jobs are very different and companies
are very different so I've been
effectively a Java developer
I don't know what that was like 10
different companies and being a Java
developer at there's 10 different
companies was 10 completely different
roles and they felt totally different to
working because a large organization is
not the same as a small organization a
start-up is not the same as a
consultancy these companies they have
different values they have different
ways of working and you will fit in more
or less depending on what you want from
your career so a good way to figure out
whether you want to join any of those
companies is to obviously you can look
at job websites and recruitment agents
which I've always got my jobs through
recruitment agents which is just seems
ridiculous but that's the way it works
find out who your friends are working
for or go to use groups find out who
those guys are working for what whether
they like their job or not a really
great way to figure out whether you want
to work for them and conference is the
people who speak and the sponsors are
great places to potentially go and work
and stop your heroes like speakers and
find out you know where they're working
and haven't even done CVS and time is up
this is ridiculous I should do I just do
this really quickly can I do this really
quickly yes okay
a most important thing for the CV to
remember is the person who reads your CV
will take less than 30 seconds to read
your CV it's not fair it's really unkind
but that's the way it is it's someone
like me I did this Lmax it's someone
like me who has less than ten minutes to
read 20 CVS and is doing it in the
middle of doing coding and so you just
know they don't have time to pass your
CV so make sure your CV stands out make
sure all of the right information is on
the front page and and do not put on the
front page all the technologies that
you've learnt because I really don't
care you know I expect you to be able to
learn technologies but what I want to
know is who are you and will you fit in
with my team will you be good for this
company so make sure the CV tells the
story of who you are not what you learnt
it's not the same thing some more
specific things there and I actually
wrote a blog post about this so you can
always go and look at the blog post
right my time is up I don't even have
time for questions right
any questions yes oh yeah have a number
in your mind salary negotiation I'm
going to try and do in a more general
way for both people who are staying but
it's slightly different but people who
are staying and people who are trying to
get a new job and when you're when
you're trying to get a new job have a
number in your mind try and get them to
go first because if you're if you're
undervaluing yourself and you sell
yourself short they'll quite happily pay
that salary in fact they might even pay
slightly less than that salary to make
it look like they weren't quite happy to
undervalue you if you can get them to go
first and then you can go higher the
first one first number mentioned is the
pinning point for the negotiation so if
you go first
everything's going to go around your
number so they go first you could put
your number wherever you want so that it
ends up here so ideally get them to go
for us it's very very difficult but you
need to get them to go first and come up
with some evidence as to why you're
worth that so do your homework find out
what other jobs are offering this is
true special if you try and get pay rise
find out what other other jobs are
offering and I don't mean there's one
job out there which offers a hundred
thousand euros for what you do I mean
you know there's a whole range of jobs
out there which look like something that
you could do and do your homework come
up with that evidence explain why you're
worth that because you've got X many
years experience or because you've done
that you've got that two main knowledge
or just because you know they liked you
and you I said one time I'll negotiate
for my salary I told them what I wanted
and the CEO said why should I pay you
that and I said because I'm worth it and
they paid me it it was amazing and so
just come up with some evidence as to
why you want it if you're getting a pay
rise you need to be even more specific
about that evidence so it might be
something like I've actually mentored
someone to do this it might be something
like um could be something like my my
mum is sick and I actually need more
money to support her it could be
something like going through a expensive
divorce and I actually need X money X
much more money to support my kids and
these are all valid things that happen
they're all quite sad things but if you
need a pay rise because you need
money come up with a number of how how
much more money you need and why is you
need that much more money there'd be
less likely to say I'm going to pay you
more money because you want more money
and that you could be you could want
more money because you're worth more
because you're undervalued to begin with
you come up with the evidence of saying
I could go and work for any one of these
companies and try not to if you're
trying to go for a pay rise try not
to say if you don't pay it to me I will
quit because they will say go on then
just quit they don't really like the in
blackmailed no one likes being
blackmailed but you can say I really a
really liked working here but I could
really use the pay rise and you know
I've been approached by this other
company they've offered me a job and
it's worth this much money and I don't
necessarily want to move but if you pay
me more money
I will stay because I want to stay here
you can do that as well but you need you
need leverage you need them you need to
give evidence as to why you're worth the
amount of money that you're asking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
