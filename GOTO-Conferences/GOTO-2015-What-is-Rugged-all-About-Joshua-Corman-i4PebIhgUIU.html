thing all about here's my obligatory
this is two ways you can tweet me so I
just added this because there was a lot
of debate in the last 24 hours over what
the heck is this rugged thing and how's
it different than security and I love
the way you phrase it in a nuanced way
was it there's no unbreakable code
there's no secure code and when you make
it a binary thing it's it's take it or
leave it it's really hard to do it good
enough there's no finish line but I
think the point is you want to be able
to get stung a thousand times and still
be ok you want to get bit by a cobra and
still you know take a quick nap and
recover so but I think the reason i love
the intersection of rugged which we
started many many years back with the
rugged software manifesto and DevOps is
its honey badger that cares right so
honey badger don't care honey badger
cares and i love the empathy at the
heart of DevOps and i believe that's the
permission and the opportunity the
window that we need for security to
finally get to be a valuable contributor
to things so i don't think anyone should
care about security for Security's sake
in some ways it's like oxygen it's
invisible nobody knows it's there until
it's not there so I'd like to start a
lot of the talks lately talking out
motivations right everyone is motivated
differently and I think one of the
historical failures of security by the
way I'm going to talk really fast
especially with my tech delay but it's
okay because in the DevOps world you
better get used to it but you know I'm
motivated differently than other people
are but what I've noticed in my you know
career is that any strategy that depends
upon a change in human nature is going
to fail so you can't try to make someone
care about what you care about you have
to understand what they care about and
we're all motivated differently the
hacker culture is going through massive
upheaval right now because some do it
for glory some do it for for money some
do it for making the world a safer place
some do it for activism and we're not
all getting along so I think instead of
changing people's values we should
understand and embrace them so for me I
want to make the world a safer place
that's what gets me up in the morning
and I take it very very seriously so
you've all seen this you know cliche
it's a really profound statement from
andreessen he needs something very very
different it has a long time hacker
culture security guy who is deeply
concerned about saving lives and I'm not
kidding about that I can't see this as
software's eating the world I see this
software is infecting the world right
we're putting software and connectivity
on to everything look in our luck right
the Internet of Things is the Internet
of packable things it's the internet
broken things I get a TEDx called
swimming with sharks because we are
getting in the water with apex predators
and we're not ready for that so I don't
want to be a negative message because if
software was purely bad we would never
do it right there's every cost and a
benefit and a risk and reward and I had
to repair my deck my patio at my house
and all the wood was rotted I had to buy
new nails and the nails were galvanized
you don't anyone know why you galvanized
nails took us to stop it from rusting
but did you know that I had to go back
to the store to buy more because the act
of making them galvanized makes them
brittle so there's a trade-off when you
want tensile strength you don't use them
when you want weatherproofing you do use
them and I want us to look at software a
couple years from now as we want all the
benefits from software and connectivity
without unacceptable risk right so we
already place trust upon that we want to
make it more worthy of said trust now
one way I look at this is if you look at
last year i think it's undeniable that
it's been open season on open source and
many of you are affected either
personally and professionally by the bug
known as heartbleed and it had a pretty
logo aside from shattering a long-held
false belief that with all by balls many
many eyeballs all bugs are shallow
there's clearly an open source problem
and it's not so much that the code was
is all of a sudden vulnerable it's that
attackers have taken notice and while
this one got a logo they're actually 41
unique vulnerabilities disclosed in the
openssl crypto project last year alone i
stopped counting this year but there's
actually a really bad one about two
months ago as well so when there's a
little bit of blood in the water sharks
circle you see this often with project
after project of the project now that we
have massive dependence on these shared
pieces of value and open source is
awesome right there's no going back we
can't put a toothpaste back in the tube
it's that you know why do bank robbers
rob banks so that's what the money is
and why would I attack open source is
because everyone is deeply dependent
upon it and there's lots and lots of
bugs one thing's I like to point out
though is that many of these bugs
affected industrial control systems
which are nuclear facilities in water
treatment plants and things that can
really cause damage now that's not the
scary part I think our dependence is
there the scarier part is that their
unpatch about about fifty percent of the
original day one bugs got fixed within
about a month and over near half later
the last fifty percent still have not
been patched or fixed so what we have is
increased dependence on open source
that's vulnerable and attackable without
the commensurate defense ability or
patching or lifecycle to handle and
respond to failure and this isn't just
there the in my research on the Internet
of Things we've now confirmed the
presence of exploitable openssl in
medical devices that can kill you in
industrial control systems in
automobiles and in our homes shellshock
just made it worse right for a lot of
you guys especially if you saw the
research about how many of the
dockerfile containers had remotely
exploitable vulnerabilities in them one
of the reasons is something like Bosch
is going to be baked into every single
LS so if you've got a particular
container or a particular OS or
particular am I before a certain version
if you don't have a baked in automated
security check for the Bosch bug you
know you're basically being born prone
now one way I like to put this to folks
as I was talking a bunch of people in
the government it was about a bunch of
UK people and US Department of Homeland
Security people and we had a workshop on
the fact that we really don't all get to
that later but it came to me that
remember the haitian earthquake that
killed 230,000 people it was a seven
point 0 richter scale earthquake had
huge amounts of humanitarian relief and
it got a lot of news for weeks and weeks
and weeks and most of the world
responded in a humanitarian way what got
a whole lot less coverage is just about
a month and a half later there was a
much stronger earthquake 8.8 richter
scale and chill a one of the reasons you
didn't hear about is almost nobody died
there were three less decimal points on
the death toll it was 279 people
and of all the people who research why
did this happen why would a much
stronger earthquake have three less
digits of death toll the primary
contributor amongst many was building
codes it wasn't the presence of
earthquakes it wasn't the magnitude
earthquakes it was insufficient building
codes so really bad earthquake in chile
cracked and cracked the foundation a
really bad earthquake in haiti flattened
buildings and killed lots of people so
we were talking about this and i thought
this is a perfect metaphor for digital
infrastructure and software we don't
have building codes for a building code
and we're certainly not using
high-quality building materials so it's
not going to be the presence of
attackers or even the magnitude of
attackers but are we ready to have
resilient defensible rugged
infrastructure so this is something I
don't expect you to read but many years
back in response to the agile manifesto
we were at a party at RSA and I noticed
there's an entire new application
security industry popping up it was
almost completely redone it to the rest
of the security industry and we pulled
out the rugged saw the agile manifesto
and there wasn't the mention of
adversary there wasn't the mention of
attacker there wasn't a mention of any
of these things and it wasn't to make
fun of agile I said you know why did
agile take off and then they said well
it makes people's lives easier right and
they had a really simple affirmative
value that they could apply everybody
with hands on keyboards wanted to be
agile so we talked about it for many
martinis we only have coming up with
rugged and we wrote the rugged software
manifesto night it's not that long I
encourage you to read it we really meant
this less as a methodology and more like
a Hippocratic oath just like doctors
take of the awesome responsibility that
comes with writing digital
infrastructure now look up at the
ceiling guys we're going to do a little
exercise not one of you SAT here in
perpetual fear that this building was
going to crush you all right it's made
of steel and concrete and we're able to
depend upon it it's invisible to us when
you drive over a bridge to get home
you're not going to worry if that's
going to collapse we're able to depend
upon it and the simple idea here was
that we're becoming as dependent on
software as we are in digital
infrastructure and it needs to be
designed with that in mind that
earthquakes exists and you need to be
able to handle them so it's aware of the
environmental conditions within which we
find our software now my favorite line
as a security guy is I recognize my code
will be
by talented and persistent adversaries
we threaten our physical economic and
national security now my development
friends they have a different favorite
line they like this one I recognize when
Colby used ways I cannot anticipate in
ways it was not designed for longer than
ever into okay now this is a partial
truth and it had a lot of early adoption
in the security community is OS found
this was a much more business friendly
way to talk about security there's
another huge reason why we should do
this though security is a negative why
would we talk about a negative it's a
cost it's an inhibitor it's friction so
even just the tonality of calling
something you know rugged resilient
defensible survivable longevity
maintainable it's all the 80s that we
want within quality so we have a more
affirmative way to talk to our
stakeholders now this has actually
gotten worse since we first wrote it
though because oh okay I since then
while that truth was very profound it's
actually become more prophetic than we
thought and we actually started an
entirely new group with a different
group of folks called I in the cavalry
and the basic recognition is the cavalry
isn't coming on matters affecting Public
Safety and human life and connected
technologies so we have entire projects
on automotive cyber safety we wrote a 5
star automotive cyber safety framework
we're working with various medical
device manufacturers and regulators to
make sure medical devices don't kill you
and that spirit is carrying forward so
when I talk to you I'm not simply
talking about the app you're going to
write for an Android on iOS the software
that you're writing in this room's
culture is going to be the ones that can
rise to the challenge where packets meet
flesh and blood where bits and bytes can
affect life and limb so I take this very
seriously now in the business context
Jean Kim and I recognize this a while
back I know you guys all know and let
him but before you even knew about him
he was an image or a tripwire security
tool and he had written amazing
mind-blowing studies on visible ops to
look about what what high-performing IT
and 93 organizations were doing so when
he came to be with DevOps I said guys
this is the end of security as we know
it the twist though as I said with maybe
that's a good thing and this is how most
this is
a photo from that day oops so we were
trying to put our heads together how can
we take the security community who
thinks this is terrifying reckless and
irresponsible and tell them it's not
necessarily bad and this might actually
be the moment we've been waiting for for
30 years the likes of which we will not
see again for another 30 years we don't
we'll Devon ops embrace us with open
arms and give us a loving hug so this is
how most people see security in DevOps
we've been working on it right I gotta
give a hat tip to Pete who showed us
this most mind-blowing he won the
internet like a month I think so take
your picture and I actually can't stand
this slide other than the fact that is
hilarious because this is a really
negative attitude from security people
and evolutionary fork in the road
security people who have this attitude
or going to fail they're going to die
out and some of the talks we have
assembled for you today and Friday are
going to show the more modern adaptive
evolutionary strategies that people are
using to kick some serious ass right so
you this could be your job for security
people if you embrace DevOps this way
we'd like to suggest another way now one
of the reasons that security people hate
it I want to give up on this clicker is
the cycle time squeeze right so when we
went waterfall and then we went to agile
redid the design and test cycles really
iteratively in short cycle times now
that DevOps is basically agile for
everybody it's been really problematic
for security technologies so if it takes
four days to submit a static analysis of
your code and you're deploying every
four hours that's not going to work and
a lot of the security teams are taking
their traditional test cycles or
different traditional approaches that
are very much at the end of the life
cycle and they're trying to force fit
them into these cycle times which is
never ever going to scale and I'm
actually happy at shattering doing the
wrong way because it forces us to think
about shifting left and doing a better
way so it is terrifying for them but
just as a point of why we shouldn't hold
on to the past when I was an analyst for
the 451 group I totaled up there are 160
security product categories I put them
in the five buckets and I the height of
the buck of the squares how much money
we spend relative
on things like antivirus and firewalls
the thing we spend the least money on by
far is application security the thing
most attacked by adversaries is
application security so I want to say
that one more time we spend the least
money on the most attacked thing I don't
think money is a proxy for awesomeness
but it's actually even worse than that
because when I was talking all my app
sec friends most of that money is spent
on the ten percent or less of the code
that we write we really don't write code
anymore guys when you assemble it from
third party and open source right those
the Lego blocks and the starting points
the bricks the code we write is the
mortar in the glue putting it together
so we were spending the least amount of
money and we were spending it very
poorly on ten percent or less of the
code that we are actually writing
ourselves instead of focusing on the
heart bleeds Michelle shocks that are
the overwhelming majority of our attack
surface so the good news is this might
be an opportunity or we can keep doing
the same thing over and over expecting
different results so we try to prime
them this little chunk here is the five
things I say that we have tremendous
common ground with the DevOps culture
value set and movement this is areas the
security team is confined to hug it out
and actually drive value number one we
like to instrument everything right now
when i was at akamai was director
security intelligence we would
instrument things like fan speed and cpu
temperature on our servers and a five
percent difference in fan speed could be
treated as an indicator compromised from
an extra process running and we would
scorch that server that rack of servers
or even that region because we could
orchestrate and deploy from bare metal
so easily that I could treat that
slightly suspicious anomaly as a
security event so instrumentation and
random telemetry is kind of awesome and
a DevOps people just have no problem
collecting and measuring everything
number two and you're going to hear
about this a little bit from from James
wicket but the be mean to your code on
mantra right the transformation of the
chaos monkey in the simian army and
chaos Kong and gorilla and all the
different dana and conformity monkeys
but spelled slightly differently james
help netflix initially but right
gauntlet which is a barrage of automated
security tests that you can do pre
deploy in unit test the twitter guys
made a break man so this culture and
attitude that we want to be tested we
want to get in a fight we want to be
able to see how we can handle failure
fail early fill off if it hurts do it a
lot those kinds of attitudes are
incredibly useful injection points for
security people complexity is enemy of
everything we all hate complexity so
some sort of drive and desire to
eliminate elective complexity optional
complexity avoidable complexity help
stability availability maintainability
and security and then one of the things
that kills me is a one of your other
speakers this afternoon David Xu he and
I keep doing things to modernize and be
tip of spear for what's the single best
way we can extend and advance our really
good security program and ninety percent
of the advice we want to give is
predicated on the idea that they know
what they have they know when it changes
and they have no unplanned changes so
it's visible apps 101 from Jean Kim's
original work if you don't know those
three things ninety percent of the
advice you want to give you is useless
so as a foundational notion not a change
management database because we we heard
already from Adrienne that those never
work but the idea of having some single
version of the truth things like chef
puppet you know become change management
and then the empathy is the heart of
everything so when someone says josh is
DevOps a culture is it a process is it a
technology tool chain and I say yes of
course but the greatest of these is the
empathy I think I think its heart it's
the empathy and it doesn't come
naturally to geeks and security people
but it man is it transformative in fact
I would say the killer app for the
cadbury being so successful working with
governments in auto industry is not been
our technical prowess it's been the
heart of an ambassador and translator
who says how can I help you first and
then once we've earned that permission
delivered value then we have permission
to be asked in return so I think the
empathy really really helps now if we
kick it up a notch I really think this
is the year that things have tipped and
one of the reasons I believe so besides
the fact that we're here and folks like
Adrian are pulling us in its that John
Willis types and Damon Edwards types and
jazz humble types they're finally saying
you know what we really can't go faster
or be better something slowing us down
we kind of hit the upper echelon here
maybe we could look at something else so
this year we gave a we ran a one-day
track at RSA the largest security
conference in the world it was free we
had 700 people come in and we said you
know let's pull in jazz and some of the
others to see if we can take these
chemicals put them together and see what
kind of chemical reactions happen and
the chemical reactions were amazing
right not only did we have common ground
we started coming up with not only
product ideas or you know toolchain
ideas but maybe entire you know
companies could be born out of just a
few of the interactions that we had so
genes initially saying okay let's pull
in jazz and then he's like what the heck
did I get myself into which is killing
my tiny but now back to that in recent
point though so I don't think this room
necessarily cares about security as much
as i do and weak stuff every night you
know saying what do i do about this
thing in cars but i think the way that
the Ducote was getting it is that
security will certainly never drive
business value but maybe software and IT
could and DevOps is where this is
starting to happen but the notion here
when you talk to CEOs and boards why
they're interested in fact we did this
Pacific Crest thing with a bunch of
investors and me and whether a lot of
questions about DevOps now why would a
bunch of investors who aren't technology
people care so much about it it's good
it's driving transformative business
value and I think one of the reasons is
it's really the last frontier of
innovation and differentiation so what
that means is you in this room you
probably care about all these different
words and then some but really at the
heart of it all it's about going faster
right in theory the problem is it's not
about just raw innovation and how many
lines of code can you produce is about
net innovation like how much value Union
produce and the things that is the
difference between the two are quality
security
things like that so I've been trying to
say let's build on jeans you know love a
technical debt right technically people
drop technical debt right we know it's
messy you know compounds over time we
know that we can have technical debt
bankruptcy perhaps we talked about that
with a friend of mine this morning so
this level of complexity is made in
central the largest open source
repository in the world it's Java code
and I'm the custodian of this my company
is and it's a mess is it's Turtles on
top of turtles on top of turtles all the
way down the transitive dependencies are
this is an actual graphical
representation of it and most of the
world's open sources is built from this
so my idea is even though we want to go
faster and faster faster at some point
we crack were crushed under the weight
of that complexity and I wondered if
there was some way that this rugged
tribe as a killer app as a first
offering could drive actual business
value instead of just make security less
painful and the answer was hell yes and
i'm going to show you wow i want to give
up with my clicker so you can't do a
DevOps talk especially if you know John
Willis without a Deming quote right I
think it's a lot of universe but I'm
actually independently a huge fan of the
Deming stuff but I left onto a different
part of it then the inspiration for lean
I mean most of you guys know this but he
tried to go to Detroit and transformed
and revolutionized the US auto industry
and they ignored him so he went to post
World War to Japan and said if you
follow my lead within five years I will
heal your economy a textiles company
Toyota followed his lead and in five
years of the day they saw the tipping
point and some of those transformative
ideas have made their way in the Leaning
they made they were agile that made
their way to DevOps but I think we
haven't really had a full embrace of
Deming and i hope to nudge you over the
edge today so back to those things that
developers care about are the different
people care about different things you
know for me it's about making the world
a safer place for developers I want to
be on time on budget with acceptable
risk and the last one's kind of
negotiable right it's really i want to
be on time on budget so let's speak in
those terms because if you're a
developer heartbleed was not a security
event it was unplanned unscheduled work
with context switching which were
psychically painful it may be late for
my sprint
which might have made hours late for our
roadmap commitments to our customers
that might have cost us time to market
and light it cost us massive deals with
big financial services institutions so
it wasn't a security thing it was
unplanned work and for an ops person it
wasn't a security thing either it was a
break fix it was a service interruption
it hurt my bonus because I didn't get my
mean time to repair stats in the conform
thing it took too long to identify
across six thousand applications which
ones might have had that version of SSL
so I can continue to be a shrill
hysterical security person pointing out
this is a security risk or I can show
how really good hygiene in our software
supply chain could maybe dramatically
reduce unplanned on schedule work your
break fixes and faster time to recover
so we've seen this a few different ways
today but there's the water fail era
which is where i started in software
then agile nothing's more agile than
goats so i tried to like make a little
model here the three things you care
about being on time on budget except the
risk agile made us really really fast at
the dev tests but we made shelf we're
really really quickly right so in a lot
of cases it was just sitting with ops
for very very long time so when the
DevOps pandora was let out of the box
now we had something like continuous
delivery DevOps was agile for more the
organization right it's not a
transformative thing per se it's a
logical extension of the promise of
agile and now we were on time and more
efficient and what I'm trying to suggest
is now we're at the crossroads where we
can give a fuller embrace of deming we
can embrace some of the supply chain
principles from Deming and perhaps we
can add in software supply chain rigor
to be even faster even more efficient
but massive gains on quality
maintainability and attack surface and
it's not something we're robbing Peter
to pay Paul and it's not a fiction this
is working so one of my financial
services relationships he's tried this
for one calendar year he had a
30-percent boost in productivity across
two thousand developers this is board
level attention name another security
project that wasn't dad like a failure
that got board level attention for
driving value now he didn't pitch it as
a security thing he pitched it as a
hygiene
that t he referred to some of the supply
chain intelligence as the consumer
reports of software subs software
projects open source projects and they
would have a list of invest in these
projects divest in these projects it was
that simple one year of saying these are
projects we like they have good hygiene
these are projects we don't like they're
redundant or have poor hygiene thirty
percent boost in year one so if you're
an enterprise architect the dev lead and
you want to somehow start crushing your
bonuses and stats this is an easy way to
do it so let's put this in a non
security context here's the Toyota Prius
vs. Chevy Volt okay the analysis from
the Toyota supply chain books at the
time said it was 61 percent cheaper than
the bolts they sold 13 times as many
that year and then they only built about
half as much of their cars chevy did so
they built less of their own car so that
sounds good for profits right but the
part that should blow your mind is they
only had 125 suppliers versus 800 for
the chevy so think about the baggage of
maintaining that many suppliers but
here's the even better part they made
ten times better use of each of those
suppliers so with fewer suppliers they
built lesser their car now could this be
that last untapped value point for our
software delivery shops you know
healthcare gov you know besides all of
its IT failures it had 11 different
logging frameworks in one project 11
different logging frameworks I don't
know why they can just go for one of
every single logging framework but but
think about that so in a fuller embrace
of deming I'm not going to say if we use
fewer better suppliers we use the
highest quality supply from those
suppliers and we track which parts go
where how could that translate into the
heartbleed scenario right now maybe you
have to use that project but do you have
to use a really old version of it or can
you keep current on the freshest of
ingredients right one thing we like to
say is open source age is not like fine
wine but like milk right it spoils
really quickly especially when you get
that blood in the water effect where the
presence in revelation of one in a
project tends to lead to significant
gold rush to find more in
or more vulnerabilities so typically
you're going to patch a lot after the
patching the initial one and the
tracking which ones are where there's a
very there's an on-the-record quote from
the Department of Homeland Security I
guarantee you the UK government had the
same problem it took six and a half
weeks to determine which of the
different parts of the federal IT had
heartbleed in it six and a half weeks
just to find not to remediate just to
find now it takes about six hours for
the really serious attacks to start
manifesting once bugs note so six net
weeks just to identify now that same guy
that I say got thirty percent boost in
productivity took him six minutes
because he had a bill of materials of
all the open source projects using every
single thing in his application
portfolio six and half weeks for
meantime their identifiers mediate six
and a half minutes so we have some
choices to make despite my IT fail and
trying to get back on time so you know
as that custodian I just want to show
you how big of an opportunity we have to
do better software supply chain hygiene
we had 17 billion unique downloads from
maven central last year it's just
growing from I think it was a 13 year
before right and there's no going back
open source is here to stay the
difference is from attackers perspective
they used to look for a single flaw in
your bank website that you wrote in your
custom code and when they were done
attacking you the campaign was over but
why attack you when if I tax something
like apache struts i get every bank
every bank right that was my watershed
moment i was still the director of
security intelligence at Akamai and most
of my customers went down or got an FBI
letter and we had to get pulled into
special calls because this was actively
being exploited it was a flaw and apache
struts to having it anywhere in your
classpath regardless of how it was used
made you vulnerable so before hartley
this really blew my mind because I
didn't really realize how pervasive
open-source had gum especially in
government and financial services it
used to be they were very reluctant and
highly regulated industries to use that
much open source but then when I saw the
largest open source consumer in the
world is Morgan Stanley it's not it's
not just for you know startups and and
unicorns like Netflix anyone so i looked
and just to prove that gold rush thing i
looked at the the history of the stress
project and not only was that bug there
for seven to eleven years layton without
met those many eyeballs finding it what
I noticed is that the frequency of bugs
found in last few years and the severity
bugs found you could do this for pretty
much any project in the nest database
the SI VES or the unique vulnerabilities
are climbing in frequency and severity
for nearly every open source project and
the tracks pretty well the popularity
now the one that really hurts me in this
is affecting UK government as well his
bouncy castle is a crypto library so
it's written by security people with
really high security rigor they take
their security very seriously it's used
in security use cases and David's going
to talk a bit about crypto later but
this is this had a very serious remote
code execution flawed seven years ago
they fixed it right away seven years ago
and despite it being fixed for seven
years I still see about 4,000
organizations downloading the broken one
every day it's in very popular social
media sites it's in very big banks
websites it's an intelligence community
infrastructure it's it's a pretty
serious problem that's entirely
avoidable so when I hear about Chinese
kit and killing a pt's or advanced
persistent threats I can't be bothered
we're not even fixing things that have
been had a fix available for seven years
in high security intelligence community
use cases so we really have to do better
I consider this a public health issue in
the interest of time I'm going to share
skip some of these stats but we also
survey how good is a supply chain
hygiene for most open source consumers
globally we do it once a year
seventy-five percent don't even have a
plan let alone executing it so one other
thing we with open s cells is not just
you consuming third party open source
risk it's your supply chain of
commercial vendors so this was a mapping
of Cisco and IBM and HP and everybody
without picking on anyone in particular
one to see response times to the openssl
flaw and basically the horizontal is how
long it took and the vertical is how
many products they simultaneously fixed
you'll notice the upper into the right
one is 120 products fixed 110 days later
so IBM in the size of the circle is
but basically like 100 this is a
phenomenal response time this is
probably as good as I've ever seen but
they were fixing a hundred and twenty
products a hundred and ten days after
heartbleed came out when most
exploitation was in a few hours so the
response times is of this with
phenomenal but what I saw was that very
same struts thing that took down most
the bank customers I knew IBM websphere
didn't fix it for over a calendar year
in fact while we were at RSA the largest
security conference of the year a
security appliance shift that day a year
in two months after heartbleed with
heartbleed in it these are security
companies so one of the things that
became clear to me is because this is
turtle stacked on Turtles it's not just
your own consumption a third-party open
source software supply chain hygiene
it's can we put that pressure on our
commercial vendors to also take good
care of the supply chain in fact it goes
one step further which is Dan gears an
idol of mine and he and I looked in my
data together and we wrote a report on
how's the project integrity of the open
source projects themselves so when you
pick something like struts it's not a
single project it pulls in tons of
dependencies as well so we had two
questions to ask when an open source
project has a direct dependency with a
vulnerability in it number one how often
do they fix them because they don't all
fix all of them and it's pretty good
actually terrible and two more
importantly how quickly they fix them
what's the m10 mttr mean time to mediate
and the answer was across the entire
population of Java projects only
forty-one percent of security defects
get fixed ever less than half so if
you're depending on our open source
project it's it's at least half of it
suitable our abilities are probably
never going to get fixed now some of
them have excellent hygiene some of them
have terrible hygiene and the meantime
remediate was over a calendar year was
390 days if you look at just the really
severe ones the CBS s tends 10 out of 10
it was slightly better 224 days now I
want to remind you heart leaves of five
so this is essentially terrible now if I
could start to publish if I did it right
now I'd be murdered but if we were to
start to publish which logging
frameworks fix all their bugs within 90
days in which which blog and frameworks
none of their bugs would that have an
impact on which logging framework see
shows I mean clearly functionality
matters and clearly API stability
matters but if you knew the hygiene and
they're both free would you maybe act
differently and I'm banking on yes
there's several layers here of picking
better suppliers picking the freshest of
ingredients from those suppliers and
tracking where they go we believe that
translates into tremendous benefits so
here's a terrible visualization of a
tool I'm having a friend right this
weekend but imagine if you pick these
different projects how many versions of
each of those projects do you have in
production one of the bank's we know
he's using 81 versions of spring there's
only 85 I think a friend a the blessing
whereas Google tries to strive to have
one and only one version of library in
production they end up with two but
that's pretty good two verses 81 to
think about the support ability to
maintain ability to help desk calls
developer portability from project to
project and as I said earlier you might
be using six or seven logging frameworks
in the same app let alone across project
and then what are we did the first ever
state of the software supply chain
report we find that the average
application has 106 projects in it and
twenty-five percent of them have a
critical or high known vulnerability in
it so figure about a quarter of them are
going to be bad and as you actually
splode it most repos we see have 7,000
projects in them times maybe 12 i think
is the average number of versions each
of those in the repos so there's clearly
opportunity for dropping down some of
that technical debt security debt
potential risk simply by choosing fewer
suppliers and if you don't have any way
to prune out suppliers because your
legacy code you could at least try to
focus on maybe fewer versions of those
and the games you get from that could be
significant now last thing I'll say is
in the US and the UK and the insurance
industry there's a harmonization on this
idea of software supply chain hygiene so
this is a bill introduced in the u.s.
called the cyber supply chain
transparency and remediation at it
basically says three things if you want
to sell it and by the way the financial
service
is I sack the FSI stack is requiring
almost the same thing they're going to
reveal it in October it basically says
anything sold must provide a bill of
materials the third party and open
source components used in it with their
version numbers so just a list of
ingredients number to that list should
not have known security vulnerabilities
without a justification you just got to
write it down so your customer knows the
risk that they're taking on and number
three because future vulnerabilities are
inevitable your goods must be patchable
because half of the affected systems and
your various governments were not
patchable and the half that weren't
patchable were the ones that scare the
bejesus out of me like industrial
control systems vehicles medical
equipment now take that against the
bouncy castle the next person that tries
to sell something to the government is
going to say oh wait there's a CBS s of
10 there's a flaw in this library is
there an available fix the answer is yes
there is and spin around for seven years
and it's really well tested and its API
compatible and will start to drain the
swamp so the goods you're consuming now
you can do this today with your own
procurement but I think this is the
untapped thing that makes you faster
makes you have fewer break fixes faster
meantime recover what do you care about
security or not your business will care
about the benefits of supply chain
hydrogen so the two little words to
focus on and I'll come no clothes no one
vulnerabilities right so we don't have
to go after this zero day espionage
advanced sophisticated attacks if you
need some proof point the last breach
report from horizons the data scientist
friend of mine put this one thing in
there a lot of people skipped last year
ninety-eight percent of the successful
attacks not theoretical one successful
attacks tracted just ten known
vulnerabilities no zero days no
sophisticated attacks ten known
vulnerabilities see bees but it's worse
because of those ten eight of them have
had a patch available for more than ten
years so I would like to suggest one of
the ways to take all the awesome sauce
from DevOps and make it rugged DevOps
would be some really low hanging fruit
stolen from Deming on making sure we
tackle and start paying down somewhat
technical debt and known vulnerabilities
right fewer better spires better supply
from high quality suppliers and
traceability of where they went
will lead to less on plan on schedule
work faster mutant recover and like I
said one of my experimenting friends did
a 30-percent boost and developer
productivity in the first year alone so
throughout the afternoon we've assembled
some rugged speakers for various
different aspects you'll hear from each
of them but one of them found out the
hard way Shannon from it to it by the
way it's an evolutionary necessity to
start thinking in terms of rugged DevOps
and operationalize and security the old
way wasn't working and as a victim of
many of the very serious high-profile
attacks you'll see some of that then
we're going to have a member of the UK
government who is doing agile and DevOps
and the government explained how
difficult it is to do traditional
security and why rug is very attractive
way to maybe modernize the approach then
we're gonna have James wicket one of the
authors of gauntlet but one of the most
rugged developers I've ever met who is
going to show how to do pre deploy
embrace those on the rugged principles
with the gauntlet tool and how to be
mean to your code on Friday you're going
to hear it compete rate is Galbraith
who's going to show post deploy
operative eternal security enhancements
that rugged can help drive and then to
close out today we have David at you
who's going to be talking about since
you're often responsible I think Nick
likes to put it the operational pain can
neither be created nor destroyed it can
only be passed to someone else I amended
that to say you can create operational
pain he David's going to show how since
a lot of the burden of doing security
false and now the developers and a
software-defined everything kind of
environment he's going to show rugged
building materials and some of the basic
principles that you're inheriting now
that you're doing so much orchestrated
automated deployment of infrastructure
there are several other awesome talks on
Friday as well about rugged including
Chris Swan and some others but I want to
end with I don't know what motivates you
but I hope you are now motivated and
thank you very time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
