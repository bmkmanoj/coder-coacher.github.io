with New Relic great those of you aren't
basically it's a start off as what
lucerne e which is turns out an anagram
of New Relic started the company as a
cloud-based pcl adversely not my cisco
email address but that's okay s ly deco
started this as a SAS offering for
performance monitoring and it's kind of
grown into it to more than that as well
but so will we use it for is we have a
java app that we're running that you
know that is so this is our dashboard
java app we're running that that
basically does it's a collaboration
application so you have a office
document sidebar and off we jam a
sidebar into office that shows all the
kind of revision history around the file
and stuff like that so kind of files and
collaboration and people is the domain
so here you see a picture of what our
apps between for last 30 minutes
something weird happened a little while
ago probably it's javis is probably GC
or something right the the bluish area
is CPU the greenish area is total
request time so this is measuring on the
server side not on the client side but
once it once the request hits our server
this is measuring how long the request
takes the process and kind of what's
going on inside of it we have a some
jvms running that then talked to react
on the backend so green is chatting with
react and blue is is number crunching
and you can see we have so they have
this app deck score which is some sort
of a composite of of throughput and
error checking and latency that they
kind of you know assign an application a
given score you want to be higher you
can see here it blipped downwards right
over here when when that spike that
probably GC or whatever happened and
then this actually isn't that
interesting the picture because i work
at cisco we're based in the US so let's
look at 24 hours and you can see a lot
more interesting data here there's been
humph in the middle right because this
is this is you know when the workday
starts eight a.m. on in in San Francisco
and if we look back for the last seven
days you can see this actually happens
every day or at least five days a week
so last you know Wednesday Thursday
Friday Monday Tuesday and then if we
look back you know three months ago
takes a little longer to pull back more
data you can see oh my god that was
horrible right I don't even see anything
I hear that the whole so that was a
problem that we didn't work on that and
we're happier with where we are now so
what did we do to figure out what was
going on with that well we can drill in
and I'll just go back to more recent
history to talk about long useful we can
drill in to grab some trend pull up a
transaction trace and a thread profiler
this is a different keyboard so
transaction traces let us kind of dig
through and find interesting understand
what's happening in a given a given
transaction if that's going on I can see
here we've got five different reacts
servers in our cluster you can see
breakdowns of conversations that are
happening with each of them we just
round robin tell them so that means that
all of our most of our transaction
operation time was was communicating
with react we're pulling back a lot of
data in this case and if i dig in here
you can see as you go through all these
different requests that are happening
you know to react the timings of them
etc etc some interesting about some
stuff about the class names we're using
them and then if you're using a
relational database you also get sequel
traces here as well which is really cool
the the react integration isn't isn't
you know kind of as tight as the sequel
integration for kind of obvious reasons
but so we get a lot of it really
site here this lets you see what's going
on that's slow we also can then dive in
and actually look at profile snapshots
so I'm going to pull up one that's kind
of older and so what you can do is turn
on profiling so this is from the thread
profile over here you can go and start a
profiling session for anywhere from two
minutes to ten minutes which is really
cool this is a great feature whenever
you have a bad option so turning on
normally when running with New Relic
there's really no overhead at least in
the JVM only have experienced the JVM
stuff but obviously if your turn on the
profile or any given vm you're going to
start seeing some slow down so this way
it's time boxed so I can turn on a
profile or it's automatically shut off I
can't forget to turn it off which is
super useful if you've ever been you
know dealing with production systems and
profiling of them so this is a profile I
took a while back you can see here the
the kind of the the top down time based
view of what's taking time and stuff
like that which actually isn't so
intricately it can be interesting but
let me switch over to what I think is
even more interesting which is the CPU
burnside of things where I can see that
get classloader is taking up a lot of
time here and so that's curious right so
let's see why I'm actually to pull up
this one is this one interesting yeah
this was I think that let's see if
there's a better optimization it more
interesting one in here
so if a different thread here and
there's this one in particular that was
an interesting optimization okay this is
a good one it's fill in the stack trace
is taking of eighteen percent of our CPU
burn why is that well it's coming
because of parse exception which is
coming out of date utility parse in
Apache HTTP client now that's weird why
would date you tell us up our state be
doing that well reacts doing a get last
modification date and it turns out
what's going on with this is the the the
there's a bug in in fhe HTTP client that
is costing us eighteen percent of our
CPU time when you parse a date an HTTP
header day there's three possible
formats for HTTP dates and there's one
which is the preferred one and then
there are two other ones react uses the
preferred one HTTP client tries all
three starting with not the preferred
one starting with one of the other ones
so every time HTTP client goes out there
to parse a header with a date it's
trying the wrong one on top of that it
does it uses a date format parse call
which throws an exception on failure
there are two ways to parse a date one
way throws an exception on failure for
the lazy programmers among us the other
one returns null if it fails to parse so
this eighteen percent cost is happening
because on the one hand the the whoever
you know you know kind of did the the
HIV client code that use the wrong
ordering for which date format to try
first and secondly because they whoever
wrote that code also just sort of an
exception and fills in the stack trace
every time so we we've hatched this two
ways one is we fixed the HTTP client
code and took about I don't know half an
hour and another one was we changed
react in the interim because we weren't
sure whether react would take our patch
whether batch o or the Apache HP client
code base would take our patch first so
the thing which is in in react we
changed their invocation there's also an
invocation unless you specify exactly
which HTTP header
you know dateformat ordering you want to
use so we made both those changes and
you know in about you know an hour and a
half worth of of digging through this
data pulling down sources looking at
what's going on in those two projects
and patching stuff we saved eighteen
percent of our CPU time so that's the
sort of stuff that we that we do you
know thread profiling we can do that you
know you do that down to the wire stuff
where normally you do that in a lab
whatever you can do this which by
turning on a little profiling flag in a
running system that same system is is
what we use for our alerting so letting
us know if our thresholds are if our
this app deck score goes below a certain
threshold or if our throughput goes
below certain threshold we get notified
we also have operations teams within
Cisco do it but you know it's just
easier to do this because we don't have
to deal with some random up operations
center within Cisco so this is it
basically all those sorts of things
error handling and whatnot gets pulled
back up to to our console here and we
can see all that kind of application
dashboard stuff all in one spot even at
the level of server cpu load and memory
utilization disk utilizations we get we
get alerts if one of our disks is
running low on space because of your log
files filling up for whatever so really
easy solution to deploy and from the
whole Deb Deb to production lifecycle
very valuable so I can't recommend it
enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
