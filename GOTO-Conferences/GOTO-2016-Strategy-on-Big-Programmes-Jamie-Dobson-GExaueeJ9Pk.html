be in a stockroom so as Thomas said my
name's Jamie Dobson this is what I want
to talk about strategy the pathway
through paradox so strategy as a word is
sort of despised in general it's quite
disliked in the world of technology and
I think it's because people in tech a
sort of allergic to and
strategy itself is often a bit
bullshitting so I'd like to reclaim this
web because it's actually got a lot of
important and interesting uses and what
tends to happen with the word strategy
is people's social media strategy is
often just about tweeting more that's
not really a strategy people talk about
containerization strategies but when you
prod a little bit deeper you see that
all they really need to do is maybe one
day use docker that's also not a
strategy and so yeah insignificant
things get overblown and really
important things really interesting
things like containerization get sort of
strap with containerization it's almost
always a strategic change because the
company is implemented it almost
certainly don't have the capabilities
containerisation transcends
organizational boundaries and like all
changes adaptive changes positive
changes you're left with winners are
losers so the central paradox of
strategy is that organizations might be
better off after the change but certain
individuals might be worse off and this
is the same thing paradox that our
leadership teams have to have to cope
with so the three things I'd like to
talk about today or I'd like to address
the damn well the first one is I'd like
to define strategy I'd like to define it
in a way that's a little bit
enlightening and maybe educational so we
can start to use strategic thinking as
part of our work the second thing which
is very important is I'd like to talk
about the impediments to strategy what
stop strategy emerging in your
organization's and the third thing I'd
like to do is talk about how we can
overcome those in
okay so as with all good stories we
don't go forward in time but we go back
in time in this case the ancient Greece
this is Odysseus on a ship with his crew
do you all know the story of Odysseus he
was fighting the Battle of Troy I think
and then he went he was going home and
he angered the gods Poseidon I think
specifically and he was blown off course
and thus began a ten-year journey to
make make his way back home and there
were sequence of different adventures
and one of the adventures was this sort
of moment with the sirens so the sirens
were these beautiful enchantresses they
sang beautifully but they sang so
beautifully in fact that people would
steer towards them and then end up
ship-wrecking themselves on the shore
now Odysseus wanted to listen to the
music this was his goal right but there
was a clear challenge laid out in front
of him that if you go and follow this to
it's a natural conclusion you're going
to crash and you're going to die his
solution to this was twofold the first
thing he did was they got some sort of
cloth and wax and he put it in the ears
of his crew and then he got them to tie
him to the mast so he couldn't move and
he said under no circumstances you know
once you untie me from this must and
then they sail past the sirens he got to
listen to the music and everybody sort
of lived happily ever after you have to
think he's some sort of awesome leader
right how did he convince his crew to do
that what was in it for them yeah
absolutely nothing but you start to see
the roots of strategy in this story so
the first thing is that strategy is
built into a lot larger narrative so you
never win strategy is much more like a
soap opera than it is a romantic novel
so if you think of a book with a
beginning middle of an end that's not
strategy when you think about strategy
think Game of Thrones you're sort of
resolve something one week but next week
you're back in the again and so
we've got coalition's we've got an
understanding of the present moment
which is not a situational awareness
you've got the ability to work with
other people and self-supporting actions
this is very very important concept in
strategy
if you put wax in your ears but then you
go to fight the Minotaur these actions
don't support each other now this might
sound strange but you do see for example
operations departments do an extremely
good work development teams doing the
same thing but those actions can
possibly oppose each other so the
actions have to be supporting now we're
still not quite there yet because
there's another element of strategy that
is also very important do any of you
know this famous Norwegian company so
the final element of strategy if you go
to do an MBA and you get to do michael
Porter's five forces analysis you might
think you can analyze ikea and you might
come up with something like this the
locations of the stores are outside of
the cities so the rents a bit cheaper
the customer segment is young upwardly
mobile families who are a little bit
cash they're short they don't mind being
part of the creative process because the
assemble their own furniture but this
analysis as Adrian mentioned yesterday
will only tell you the results of the
strategy so this is not strategic
analysis because it gives us no
indication as to how ikea put that
together to understand that you've got
to go back in time and and start to see
that there were lots of distributors and
manufacturers who refused to work with
ikea right because there was so cost
competitive what they ended up doing was
outsourcing manufacturing to poland
where there was a group of furniture
makers who would work with ikea and this
gave birth to the flat packing furniture
as we know it today the flat packing was
a good example of a prosumer ism you
know what a prosumer is somebody who
produces and consumes their own goods so
we talked about YouTube has been pro
shuming you you create content but also
consume it so ikea smart because the
people involved actually end the
manufacturing process the manufacturing
process doesn't actually finish until
you get to your house fast forward a few
years from the flat packet innovation
and you get to a change in the v80 laws
in sweden nobody here remembers that do
they know so i think in the 1970s the
v80 lols changed and swedish people like
english people don't like spending
they don't have to so I can imagine
there was a bit of a powwow in houses
across Sweden let's spend our savings
let's get some furniture before the VA T
goes up at the time ikea was a
mail-order company they could not serve
as the demand so they said look hey we
can't give you all this venture right
now could you mind driving to the the
depot and you can pick it up yourself
and since you all drive volvo station
wagons you know we should have no
problem moving this stuff around okay
fine so far so good I think the ikea
management team panicked because like oh
my god these people are driving from all
of the sweden they'll be hungry what
should we give them let's give them me
mala chips and so in a moment of an eye
the idea of the the warehouse becoming
the shop the meatball and chips and the
prosumer is I'm starting to take shape
so as well as the situational awareness
and the goal setting and the challenges
that we saw with this in the story of
Odysseus you start to see that strategy
is a process to and this is really
important and it's a combination this is
Mintzberg 1983 strategy is a combination
of deliberate for your intentions you
know what you know about the marketplace
what you know about yourself and
strategy is always much more about
asking the question what's going on now
as opposed to where do we want to be
it's these intentions that form your
deliberate strategy and yet through the
patterning of time and sort of things
that are happening around you emergent
strategy start to rise up it's the
emergent strategies when they meet the
deliberate strategies that gives us
realized strategy this is the thing that
really you know we think wow this was
awesome three very important points for
this so on the one hand you have to have
some sort of intelligence some sort of
competition to come up with these ideas
on the other hand on the next next
moment with emergent strategies you need
to maintain an open mind that things
change if you don't do that you will
never see I mean imagine for example the
guys at ikea is saying well man why do
we have to feed them right so they
change an adversity into an opportunity
the third thing you need is good
judgment this is a characteristic of all
strategies
the wisdom to know what to reject in the
case of non real life strategies and the
wisdom to know what to bring in in terms
of emergent strategies so it's an
ongoing cognitive process unfortunately
people think because strategy is
emergent that it will emerge naturally
but actually that's not true there's
loads of ways to kill strategy bad
management misjudgment and basically you
can come to a situation where what you
intended becomes exactly what you get
and yet it's never quite fulfilling it's
never quite right this leads to what we
call failed strategies so what are these
impediments so the three things so we
work a lot with with programmable
infrastructure containerisation at all
different levels and organizations and
on our travels in the last couple of
years we started to see that these three
things sort of the key impediments to
emergent strategies was at your phone
young man on my phone yeah okay we see
that the air this or the disease three
impediments to strategy leadership
infrastructure finance and they're bad
enough on their own but they actually
conspire to sort of form an even worse
situation so the problem for the
strategic leader in terms of leadership
is this idea that people get hooked on
believes people believe something a
certain way of working and they don't
like to change so often organizations
you know consist of planners people want
to think and do stuff in order and you
have people who are sort of interested
in emerging properties so these are the
agile Easter's the people like the
stand-ups and the retrospectives and
they don't do much thinking they just
get started and they learn as they go
along and you're ideologically these two
camps are very different and as the
quotation says what people tend to do
when confronted with an idea that sort
of pushes back against their believes
they will ignore it for as long as
possible and then they will dismiss it
so after sin you know I'm la la la la la
I'm not listening I'm not listening then
they'd say well
that's so it's bad enough that
you have beliefs in management teams but
when you're introducing new technology
you also have a different set of beliefs
in the people so we believe in virtual
machines or we believe in using puppet
for and spinning machines up so the
leader the leadership teams have to
somehow navigate these conflicting
belief systems and the problem really
comes down to this so f scott fitzgerald
said something like the test of a
first-class mind is the ability to hold
two competing ideas in your head and
maintain the ability to function so what
the key for emergency is to understand
that action and thought planning and
emergence have to coexist in order for
that to work and that begins with the
coexistence in the minds of people now
since that we've done all possess fares
class man's that's almost impossible we
need to sort of surface this and make
this a central part of our work so
that's leadership the second the second
thing is infrastructure so strategies
partially to do with look at outwards if
you work in a company that invoicing
system doesn't work that's overcome with
bureaucracy where you manually patch all
your different systems it's extremely
difficult to lead strategic changes to
do something that's you know transcends
organizational boundaries and that's
because you might have a load of
first-rate minds and you might have
brilliant leadership but if they get
sucked into infrastructure you will
never ever know and the story I like to
tell about this is that of the monkeys
from MIT does anybody know this story it
might have heard a version with bananas
yet so I don't know this is a true
experiment there's a part of me that
really hopes it's not true because it's
a bit sadistic but they took a few
monkeys in a cage with a trap door at
the top where they can escape to freedom
but they they electrify the trap door so
that when the monkey touches it you know
it gets an electric shock
so the monkey in the cage and one of
them climbs touches the trapdoor charges
himself and you know screams and falls
back to the bottom of the cage so then
the next monkey tries it in the next
monkey transit and they're all they all
learned very quickly that this trap door
doesn't work you're going to get hurt
then the experimenters put a different
monkey in right the monkey climbs up the
ladder and the three that the three
original monkeys they grabbed him and
they stopped him and they speaking
Mongol it monkey language I don't know
what they say then that means right
don't touch the trap door you're going
to get electrocuted anyway so they bring
in a new monkey in a new monkey but they
slowly rotate out the existing monkeys
and after a while the cage is full of
monkeys that have never been
electrocuted who don't go to the
trapdoor it gets worse for the monkeys
because the experiment is ten the
electricity off and they still don't
believe that's culture that's how
culture gets communicated across there
from peer-to-peer and intergenerational
e through the ages the problem with
infrastructure is if you have a culture
of fixing of patching often people take
pride in that especially in the finance
industry we keep the bank running they
say if you have a culture of fixing
you'll never have a culture of you know
sort of value creation because it's all
you've known right so not only would
infrastructure stop your leaders doing
their job but you create a culture where
people think changing stuff isn't what
we need to do and as a adrian pointed
out yesterday in his keynote very very
hard to change your culture once it's
embedded so the third problem is to do
with finance and finance doesn't kill
strategy because we don't like spending
money it's how we spend money and when
we spend money so we've probably all
been in situations where we know we need
to create a continuous to live rebuild
at the beginning of the project but
somewhere in your mind you think are is
it really worth putting for engineers on
that for two weeks that's like 50000
euros and and the reason we think like
that is because we always discount the
future so we we know that activities we
do now have got future value but we
discount them do we really need the
build do we really need to do the
marketing because of this peculiar quirk
have been a human being we tend to avoid
doing things now the 50000 euros you
could have spent to fix the bill then
and you chose not to do sort of leaked
right and the problem is six weeks into
the projects like well I know we should
have fixed it then but were six weeks in
now so this is you have this continuous
discounting right and over the period of
the project you spend much more than the
original 50,000 so what what does
finance got to do with strategy the way
you choose to spend your spending
patterns has got something to do with
how you generate knowledge so when you
create a build and change it into a lot
of script you're codifying your
knowledge and capture it and it incurred
and then you're moving on once the value
is in your in your organization you
start to rinse returns from it straight
away but if you're not willing to make
that investment you can never wins the
value our so there are some peculiar
patterns around finance that impede
strategic changes but it's the interplay
between these three things that are the
most important thing and poor spending
habits leads to poor infrastructure poor
teams and organizations that are falling
down poor infrastructure becomes a sort
of dark center that drags in all your
leadership talent so the top team does
the team of the managers the managers
does the team of the value-add in
workers and the value adding workers are
just sort of holding the together
in organizations like this it's almost
impossible to do anything of sort of
substantial value or change so how long
have I got left please anyone hello
Thomas 20 minutes just check it because
there's there's no clock here and so how
do we get through these paradoxes so the
first thing I'd like to share well is
this idea of how do we balance
responsibility and duty so the principle
that we teach to some of our customers
those who are listen to us and the
principles that we will contain the
solutions on is the donut principle you
will notice that this is not a European
donor it's anna mary
come on it has a hole in the middle
instead of jump and it's the hole in the
middle where we where we think about
what our job description is what our out
duties but it's the outer rim of the
doughnut that serves as a reminder that
we are working and we are doing stuff
that is greater than our duties and the
father of two young children I'm at my
best as a dad when my daughter is in
balance when my central duties are there
you know provide for the kids cuddle
women stuff you know play but there's
lots of space for spontaneity for joy to
sort of do what I like on a day-to-day
basis so when it comes to creating space
for emergent strategies we have to
create space around ourselves around our
workers and around our managers when I'm
talking to managers I try to set this up
your core duties are to engage in
conversation to look for emergent
strategies but also to think about where
we're going to keep yourself going to
keep your team's going the rest of the
space is where you can be yourself where
your autonomy exists this starts to go
really wrong when you get a donor that
looks like that so this is a donor
that's too full right there's not enough
space for spontaneity and there's much
too much the dutiful activities just
simply too full as a child I was raised
Roman Catholic and we went to church on
Sundays I went to a Catholic school had
Catholic parents rules lots of them
dictated in our whole childhood myself
my brothers and all the people at school
we expressed ourselves we became
autonomous by breaking rules either
passively smoking behind the bike sheds
or you know aggressively fighting in the
in the playground I didn't see this
pattern of behavior again for about 15
years until I started consulting for
large organizations right yeah where you
see passive aggression constantly so
it's bad enough that people are
ideologically wedded to planning or
emergence but they express this their
autonomy by blocking each other
it's frustrating when you see it yet and
your first impulse is to you know blame
the person this will call that victim
blaming why don't you know what a what a
tosser and but it's not true it's a
systemic effect so passive aggression is
a side effect of donuts that become too
full I met an architect once software
architects not a real one and he said to
me developers are so stupid right so
this is what I do I give them no space i
create the framework sankarea the
templates the java classes that's how
old I am the the the Java classes are
all abstract and they're all strategies
or policies and all the developers
allowed to do is extend the abstract
class and / add the abstract methods
I've even got a code checker he said so
I know if they've added stuff that
shouldn't be added this is an example of
donuts that are too full I said to this
guy how's that working out for you
dickhead and the the concept of a
dickhead is really important in
strategic thinking because what is a
dickhead in this context a dickhead is
somebody who tries to control something
that isn't theirs to control right and
that's it you have to understand you
have to negotiate across the whole
organization what are your duties and
what is your space now the opposite of
the full donor is the donut that where
your duties are too small and in this
situation chaos reigns so this is where
we dedicate ourselves too much to
emergence and we don't think enough
right I remember when I first started
doing test-driven development it was
something I was really interested in but
I never understood why people further on
in their careers than I insisted on
exploring the design space the problems
i already knew how to solve so i found
that to be a complete waste of time and
i think looking back i was probably
right so what we're talking about really
is the donor is a conceptual conceptual
way of relating duty to responsibility
there's no magic involved here all you
need is a white board and a pen and a
conversation
and it's about making us think about you
know flexibility and commitment what is
it we want to achieve this week so I
think most people are container
solutions I've got an extremely good
idea of what they're expected to do with
lots of space where they can express
themselves okay finding financial
balance this is an interesting one so
lots of the time a lot of time people
are afraid to spend and the refrain to
spend because they discount future
activities and they're not sure they can
rinse value out of there at the
activities that they're doing what I try
to encourage people to do is to try
stuff anyway if you can build things in
pieces components blogs pieces of
research but if it doesn't work out the
book it the book it is a really
important tool what you do is you take
this thing that didn't work and you took
it in the book it oh right and
the book it is an important
concept because it frees people from
worrying about what they're doing today
now on the one hand you think well the
book it sounds like a pretty expensive
where to give people autonomy if there's
another side to the book it there's only
a matter of time before you find
yourself back in it you know looking at
stuff that you did last year six months
ago there's a cup daugherty security
book and 2 t-shirts there could be some
fastly who's medium medium no mediums
extra large story extra light but ok so
the book it is very important
because it sort of own cripples us it on
Styx's and it's a nice nice reminder
that the stuff you do today does have
future value and just because you don't
see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist so
this is a way to get us on stock the
other way to get unstuck is fat by
trying to find balancing stoicism so
Marcus Aurelius is my favorite
philosopher many many excellent
quotations in his book of meditations
but the one that's most important to
sort of strategy remember that
strategies about actions is this one the
impediment to action becomes the action
what stands in the way becomes the way
when we sadly container solutions it was
very obvious everything was broken you
know all of our infrastructure all of
our invoicing because we're a start-up
all we did is work through every single
problem one at a time so no then there
was the month of admin December the
month of the message January pushing the
message out februari Brandi we
sequentially work through everything
that we're network we're struggling with
all of our obstacles and it doesn't seem
like much one month at a time but when
you do continuous improvement over 12
and 18 month period they compound to
sort of fantastic results and aurelius
just like the book it helps us to get
moving and that's because strategy is
not about thinking it's about action and
that's what we often fail to grasp okay
finding balance to yourself on our
travels through different organizations
we started to see archetypes different
types of strategists in different types
of companies this is the ultimate
strategist so we saw that strategy
itself was about goals challenges risks
situational awareness but that doesn't
tell us anything about what the
strategist needs to do or what makes up
a good strategist there's a few
components empathy you need to
understand you need to understand the
people you claiming to represent right
so that's why we have empathy we saw
empathy with the monkeys right this top
each of the climbing up the ladder
because they don't want to get hurt
there has to be situational analysis and
awareness of what's going on right your
current reality typically you need
imagination because strategy is about
understanding the current state and
trying to dream up a future state human
beings are unique in this that we can
reason about the future you need a voice
because you need to speak to people work
with your coalition and you need a
vision for what the next day it might be
now I did this
this to a team of executives and I said
who who were who recognizes this in
themselves and a couple of hands went up
and I was like okay make a quick nur of
those people and self-awareness is also
part of being a good strategist not many
people can do all of this a much more
common archetype is this the Fanta cyst
and it took me a while to put this
together so my first observation was wow
there's a lot of Fanta cysts where they
have a big voice and in the hierarchy
your voyage gets bigger because you know
people listen to your great imaginations
often a vision where are we going to
become them that there how many times
I've heard this we're going to become
the netflix of the Netherlands and I'm
like that's funny because you know they
stream videos and you're a bank okay
okay but that's fine that's good idea
and and they saw Adrienne's talk and we
want that our strategies to do micro
services and I say you might have seen
Adrienne's talk but were you actually
listening because he said it's the way
of thinking that's core microservice is
a side effect a result just like the
meatballs from Ikea it took me about two
years to understand why the fantasista
exists where Kane in a large
organization is difficult right and when
we're having a bad day your mind moves
to the future whether it's the near
future or god I can't wait for a pint
tonight or the distant future I can't
wait till I retire so you start to see
that fantasies always come along with
dysfunctional organizations so I start
to think of the Fanta sisters are sort
of an escapist this was a very common
archetype we saw does anybody relate to
this yeah one hand they're brave man the
angry engineer is good the angry
engineer understands the people that he
or she is working with and actually
probably does represent them they've
also often got a very good grasp of
reality although there is a tiny bit of
reality that they don't get which is the
reality that people don't like to be
shouted at and yet right and your
coalition has to be
inclusive you can it can be a coalition
of Engineers our operations engineers
without any management right management
is power so if you want to complain all
the time gray if you want to instigate
change you need to form coalition's it
turns out that there is a little bit of
hope in these archetypes basically it's
because if you take the fantasies and do
a emerge with the angry engineer you do
get to something that looks like that
there's a reason companies have CEOs and
CTOs there was a reason Winston
Churchill work with Clement Attlee right
so the actual forming of the coalition
starts with self awareness that's why
when I asked those executives who's a
strategist and three of them said yeah
I'm that and thinking there's no way I'm
stood here if you're any good at
strategy now you would have called me so
so they've so self-awareness is the very
first thing so that's an ability to look
inside that's a sort of situational
awareness for yourself knowing what you
good at knowing what you're bad at so
then you start to build a small team
around yourself and from that small team
comes a broader coalition okay this
brings me neatly to my conclusion and
fingers crossed a few questions after
that what is the strategies thing so the
strategy is really an outside man a man
of four and a man of action and I truly
believe that we get strategy wrong
because for some reason we think it's
only about thinking we think it's about
Michael Potter's Five Force analysis we
think it's something to do with business
schools it's got nothing to do with with
business schools but nothing to do with
NB is it's got much more to do with the
adventurousness of Greek heroes that's
what strategy is about and actually you
can be a great strategist without even
hearing the word so really it's about
finding this balance between thinking
and action and looking outwards looking
outwards to your teams looking outwards
to the market you're in you cannot look
outward when your infrastructures
falling apart it's impossible to do
strategy in an organization that's
falling down right if your
organization's falling down that is your
obstacle that's the next thing you have
to
right so we don't need to dream about
microservices when you when you take
your three weeks so they were due to do
a release that's putting the cart before
the horse that's fantasy what is it
really about then so strategy done ray
is about new states and old states and
when you going from an alternate to a
new state you have to learn something
you have to master new tools new
technologies so it's partially but
implicitly to do with mastery it's also
to do with autonomy when you get your
donuts right when you leave space for
emergence you create space for people to
be themselves and their energies get
driven to value adding duties and not
aggression or passive aggression and
through the deliberate strategies and
the intentions we have purpose so modern
psychologists are now telling us what
Marcus Aurelius could have told us
thousands of years ago that these three
things compound to extremely these
things compound to create extremely
motivated teams and it's through this
space and through this thinking we get
creativity and engagement and excellence
