of a company called trade shift and I'm
going to do a talk that is called
everything floats and I was part of a
group of three people who founded a
trade shift in 2010 and I've been the
CTO of trade shifts oh I've had
responsibility for for growing
engineering for our technical platform
but since 2016 early general this year
my main focus has been on China and and
how we scale our platform across the
different regions how we make sure that
that our network we are connecting
companies in a network that they are
part of the same network across all
countries across all regions we are
operating in and I'm showing a picture
of 5,000 year old invoice because the
invoices is part of where to achieve
came from before founding trade shift
myself and my other two co-founders we
worked with the large scale invoicing in
networks basically moving first the
public Danish sector from from paper to
electronic invoicing and then repeating
the same blueprint that we came up with
in a European context and just to talk
briefly about to achieve so you have
some kind of context trade ship sprang
out of that experience that that it
seems like transaction costs are going
away for for businesses everything you
could do in close proprietary networks
with electronic invoicing before you can
now do in the open Internet using open
standards in a secure and reliable way
and we also have some experience with
cloud that made us decide that you know
there's a big opportunity to connect
companies everywhere in the world and
enable them to do their processes
digitally between the companies so
that's essentially what traits of this
trade shift is a is a platform that has
that ability to connect companies all
over the world today we have
50 fortune 500 companies on the platform
as well as their entire supply chain so
so we hope will pass a 1 million mark
this year in companies that are on the
network and transacting in some way and
on top of this platform we started with
the invoicing but we've expanded to many
other areas like procurement and
financial services and payments and many
other things but it's also an ad
platform meaning we are we are growing
an ecosystem of third-party companies
that are building network powered
applications on top of this business to
business network so so that's the short
version and we like to do you I for for
business applications that that is
actually usable by by humans and the
employees that are in the organizations
and not designed specifically for the
accounting department so that's very
briefly we started in 2010 we've grown
to 350 plus employees we moved our
headquarter from the garage we started
up to San Francisco we've offices all
around the world and I was in China for
the first time in 2013 and helped start
that up over there yeah that's pretty
much it so I wanted to call this talk or
I got inspired by by finding out there
something called a Chinese a magical
mirror and that's an amazing thing it's
they've been found many places in China
the oldest one more than a thousand year
old and they are small polished bronze
mirrors and and they have the property
that when you look at them you you see
your own reflection but in certain kind
of lights they appear to the common
translucent so you can actually see the
back side of the mirror and the
particularly striking effect is when you
put light on these mirrors and project
them on the wall you can actually see
the back side of the mirror so I thought
it was a fitting analogy because since I
I went to China first time early this
year a lot of the stuff we've been doing
in trade shift around
cloud and business to business networks
and dealing with financial transactions
that kind of acquired a whole new
meaning in the context of China where
the cloud is very different where the
financial markets are very different
where technology is different and where
the business mentality the ways of
thinking are also very different at
least to me having worked primarily in
the European and US context so I think
to me it was a nice analogy to to kind
of looking at what we are doing and
reflecting that in the light of what
I've experienced in China so so I wanted
to share some of that so I mentioned
2013 I went to suit you and and I hired
the first of four engineers there and a
lot of strange things that has happened
since 2013 we've been trying to find the
right partners in China you cannot
really do business without having a
50-50 Chinese and and in foreign
ownership so we've been trying to find
the right partner but we did that and
and got to grow the office by now we are
roughly 80 85 people in the suture
office and should you is a small city
outside of Shanghai of 10 million people
also and what was exciting about China
was really that electronic invoicing has
not been legal but we knew that there
were pilots on the way in in China
already since 2012 13 kind of paving the
way for for these kind of electronic
transactions to become a leader in China
and for us it was really interesting
because it might mean we could expand
our business to business network also
into into China into Asia and in fact we
found a partner that that is one of the
the two monopoly so part of it jus
awfully on on electronic invoicing in
China and formed a partnership with
these guys and and may first this this
year we went live with the first
solution that can actually issue
electronic invoices for the first time
in China so so we are super excited
about that I'm also just back three
weeks ago from a ching
22 chunking which is a city in the
middle of China again small city of 10
12 million people where we close our
second joint venture and this joint
venture is really about financial
services but also on top of our existing
platform and network so so let me dive a
little bit into that and and try to
explain what I talk about when when when
I when I say everything floats so I want
to talk about the fluidity or liquidity
of various things reflected in what I've
seen in China so first is liquidity of
software so the first thing that that
happened when when our team arrived in
in China there was yes we wanted to
start by doing invoicing and we were
exposed to to these kind of machines so
this is a state-certified invoice
printer is the only kind of device you
can actually print invoices on you have
to get paper that you pick up at local
government stations that is pretty
issued for your invoice and every time
you print an invoice and that's the
amazing part is actually communicated
directly to the to the tax authorities
in China so a central system called the
golden tax system so in fact before you
can issue an invoice it is already
registered with the tax authorities and
and and when you receive it on the
receiving side you kind of have to to
verify that that you received a real
invoice by checking the same system
these kind of printers were the only
kind of devices that could handle that
kind of communication but but that is
starting to change now if if you look at
a cloud in China and we're a hundred
percent cloud company everything we're
doing is based in in the Amazon Cloud
and and we have users in 200 company to
200 countries so this is something it's
a software and service model you can
only do in the cloud essentially and and
talkin cloud and in China you kind of
get two different answers if you ask
what it is if you look at consumers or
private people and there are some very
large social networks
two of them is we chat I have reached
out on my phone it's essential if you
want to communicate or connect with
people in China and it sits in roughly
800 million user population next biggest
one or the biggest one is Tencent QQ
with with 900 million and the list kind
of continues there are 10 15 major
social networks in China that are all
growing very fast but if you ask
business about cloud you know the
perception is more that it's a
collection of a million droplets of tiny
water molecules cloud has not really had
the adoption in the business fear that
we are seeing in Europe and us and I
kind of got lazy and when you enter into
discussions with with large companies in
Europe and China about you know moving
some of their data to the cloud it's
actually a fairly trivial conversation
and and I got lazy because before 2010
also that conversation was actually not
so trivial in Europe and us you really
had to convince companies that it was
safe and secure and trustworthy and all
these kind of things but but in China it
seems like for the business side the
cloud adoption is maybe six seven years
behind what we're seeing in Europe and
us so so you need to become really good
at having those kind of conversations
you know why why put your money on cloud
why do you think it will become the
dominating paradigm you know why why is
the trust worth you why is it safe and
maybe it isn't maybe it isn't as
trustworthy in China we are not quite
sure yet what what the emerging models
are but the cloud market and that's for
sure that that is growing in China so
it's exploded in the private sphere for
consumers everyone is on social networks
everyone has mobile phones you know you
have all the same expectations to
software as you have in the rest of the
world but you can see there's a growth
so if you look at the right hand in 2014
it reached 7 billion projected I could
update this light but it was projected
at 10 billion in 2015 and to grow to 160
billion in by 2020 so so projected a
rough toppling every year which is
actually a much faster growth
then we are seeing currently in Europe
and us so so I believe things can change
very fast in China the other thing that
I think is driving it is is maybe again
from the consumer side that you know the
last time you had to download an app
that you had to pay for you know it's
maybe not so common depending maybe if
you are using Android or or iOS but the
cost of software is is really going
towards zero and and companies are
starting to make money on many other
things they are basically trying to
distribute value putting the users of
the apps in contact with some other
services or knowledge or information
that someone can benefit from so
essentially I would say you know these
are all example of companies the
European and Chinese counterparts that
really don't own any asset they make
that money by by connecting people and
and i think that's that's one of the
mechanisms driving basically the the
cost of software towards zero and it's
happening in in the business world as
well and that that is the sphere that
I'm moving around in it is just
happening much slower at a completely
different pace but you can see a few
trends that indicated if you look at for
example how the change of organization
the this I to spend of organizations is
changing it used to be that you had to
centralize the IT department they made
all the strategic decisions about the
platforms to invest in and and that was
basically the the bottleneck you had to
go through if on a department level you
wanted to to have an a new piece of
software and and I think those were the
days of investing in larger p systems
like is hippie in Oracle but but spend
is quickly moving away from the center
of organizations into departments and
clearly software as the services is is
maybe the major trend that has enabled
that you know software is basically so
cheap and accessible now that anyone can
almost use a you know department credit
card to make an acquisition of a
software that nobody in the organization
really knows about on until it has
happened another one is you know some of
the the largest players in this space
has really paved the way for for let's
say the next generation of business
software service sales force as maybe
the first and largest example has proven
that crm they are the dominating crm
provider for for corporations today and
and an online accounting system like
Intuit QuickBooks boast 425 million
business accounts and Gardner predicts
that by 2016 so very soon fifty percent
of the CRM will will in fact be in the
cloud and you can see some of the
movement in in traditional business
networks like the EDI networks that used
to connect suppliers and buyers and
logistics providers that also hear the
the cost of transactions is going
towards zero so so these guys also soon
need to find other stuff to make money
on but yet if you look at the the
digital supply chains which is what
interests me it's still many billions
pieces of paper being moved over here
and in fact the adoption of digital
integrations between company is
extremely low although we've had 30
years of efforts and on that so in the
consumer world a lot has happened in the
business to business world it seems as a
huge opportunity here and I think to me
China has kind of a emphasized this
opportunity the next thing I want to
talk about is liquidity of innovation so
so I I really believe that that
companies will will move more more
digital in terms of what happens between
companies so so when I talk about
liquidity of innovation I want to talk
about some of the forces I believe we
will drive this trend one of the the
first things I heard in China was was a
kind of prejudice about a certain
generation of Chinese so in China you
know they had the the one child per
family the policy for a number of years
and I think it's called the little
Emperor syndrome so the warning our
guard was basically don't hire anyone of
that generation you know
they are super spoiled they had all the
attention of their parents and you know
they make crazy demands and they don't
want to be controlled by anyone and you
know avoid these guys and I think some
of the characteristics I heard about
them I also hear about you know the
Millennial Generation here in Europe or
us so people tend to say they are they
feel entitled you know they are very
impatient they want to do stuff
immediately they have short attention
spans they are very autonomous they
don't like to be led by other people and
they are less classically strategic
long-term thinking but I read a recent
report on on kind of how the
organization changes and how leadership
style perhaps need to change in response
to to the the new generations and some
of the other characteristics about these
guys when they get into a leading
position is that they tend to set very
difficult goals and sometimes more
abstract goals I think the whole ear
agrees movement is a good example that
suddenly you need to talk about that the
goal of your organization that is to
produce learning and and not you know
goods values of things that you deliver
to end-users and they also often are
highly ambitious and tend to work very
hard for for when they when they said
some some goals so that seems to be
quite a positive trait and if I take a
look at one of the things which is maybe
less classically strategic thinking I
can definitely recognize that in China
so the CEO of converse in in China home
field law he he recently published a
book and and there he made makes a
parallel which to Lewis Carroll story
from you know Alice in Wonderland or
through the looking-glass about the Red
Queen and and the Red Queen there's a
scene in the book where where the Red
Queen challenges Alice to run downhill
and even though Alice runs as fastest
yes
you can she's not going anywhere and the
Red Queen is just storming so she makes
us some kind of remark that you know I
have to run the fast as I can even just
to stay in the same place and someone
picked it up and made made it a term of
I think it would loosen their biology
and say you know that's that some
species even to keep their place in in
the ecosystem you know they have to
evolve very rapidly and i think that's
that's really really true when you when
you see it in china that's so much
change happening it's unbelievable the
level of change you have seen over the
past 50 years if you look at the growth
is of course also an indicator of you
know there's a lot of innovation going
on and a lot of growth which means a lot
of things is changing we just need to
take a drive from from Shanghai Shanghai
to suit you to see you know blocks of
skyscrapers just jumping up for the
whole one hour drive between those two
cities it is really you can really see
and feel the change that is going on and
I think it's fair to say that that in a
society and economy that is changing
that fast that that some of the
strategic kind of long-term planning
analysis you know dependency on solid
financial institution dependency on
solid rules and agreements between
companies you know that kind of logic
just doesn't work so so I can understand
and appreciate actually when I'm dealing
with with my team over there that that
that people sometimes get really
irritated you know when when we come
from Treasury of or we have you know
thought everything out we know what's
going to happen in the next ten years in
business software and Europe and they're
just like you know we need to do
now we need to work deliver stuff on
premise we need to integrate to these
Hardware printers you know they actually
much more agile and I think it comes
from being in a in an environment where
things change really really fast so I
think we often talk about disruption in
kind of Silicon Valley context but I
think you can see the kind of disruption
happening really on a hypo scale almost
in China and that affects how how people
think about agility actually
so if you look at organizations and how
they work with iti think there's a lot
of traditional thinking that has shaped
the IT landscape of existing
organization it's a tool to primarily
cut costs make the organization more
efficient and do that repeatedly year
after year I think it's changing very
rapidly but I think that is the logic
behind implementations of ERP systems
like Oracle and essay p they are best
practice systems and and you buy them
with a set of templates for basically
all the processes that you have in place
in your company but oops but that's just
not a logic that that seems to hold up
very well today so if you look at the
the fortune 500 companies more than
fifty percent of these have disappeared
over the last few years so if you looked
at the list which has been made for for
many many years in 1955 if you if you
were in the the fortune 500 segment you
could expect to be there for an average
of 75 years in 2016 this has changed to
2 15 years and and and I think it's part
of the technological pressure that that
is certainly suddenly being exerted on
these companies so what is heating the
world I see your new headline in my
inbox every day it used to be software
then it's a javascript is eating the
world and robots I eating the world and
artificial intelligence and whatnot I
think the original paper was by marc
andreessen that wrote software is eating
the world and it's basically a metaphor
to say that all the major companies in
the world they actually transforming
into software companies they need to be
really really good at IIT to keep up
with the game and move into a mode where
they they have to deliver digital goods
speaking of Millennials I know this guy
is not a millennial but maybe he
accepted some of the same traits when
when people talk a little bit negatively
about the Millennials like he's very
autonomous you know nobody tells him
 what to do and I think part of the
mindset that that has driven this guy to
to work with the open source community
and make the contributions to
and then to get amongst other thing is
this style of working so I like this
quote the big thing about distributed
source control is that it makes the
politics around who can make changes go
away you can avoid that just by giving
everyone their own source repository and
I think the reason I like this is
because i think it exemplifies what is
happening inside of a lot of
organizations today you know you have
this generation of young people going
into the organization and they want to
make their own decision and then you
have a technology evolution that
actually allows people to make a lot of
those decisions I think trade shift is
is one of those companies that could
probably only have been started in in in
the way that we started you know after
the year 2000 maybe even 2010 because we
could start without owning anything you
know we literally started in a garage so
we only have the laptops we had and then
we have the software as a service that
we use to start the company in the
beginning we even worked with people
across four continents to to build a
first version of trade ship without
having any money and I think that's
fundamentally a network based approach
where where you know it cannot work in a
hierarchical approach where you need to
set the structure and you need to get a
lot of resources and then you can ask
some people to execute and and out of
what what he has been involved in of
course came a linux and get and that's
pretty much powering everything you know
that is driving the software revolution
today so all the operating systems of
the cloud of the mobile phones of
Internet of Things and I think forget to
me it's a big metaphor of of how
collaboration is also changing so back
to the backs of the large enterprises so
so the value chain is is pretty well
understood and well described you know
you have some inbound logistics you have
some operations you produce some stuff
you have to deliver stuff to your
customers you have marketing and sales
you can shape the demand and these kind
of things and and and that whole
paradigm has been you know fueling the
idea that you just have to optimize that
that machine and then you need stability
on the procurement side on the
infrastructure side on the HR side
to just slowly optimize that moment but
what we are seeing today is that you
know social marketing is changing
completely the demand patterns we are
seeing that that consumers ask for more
more variety and change and it on the
other hand puts a huge pressure on the
supply chain we also seeing that
regulation is changing fast so for
example in terms of sustainability the
requirements that are put on companies
now really also helps to narrow in the
fields which are the suppliers I can use
also they tend to source more and more
internationally so that increases the
risks in the supply chain and and we
were talking with the customer that that
basically had to move one factory to
another country which they managed to do
in three months but it took them six
months to change there ASAP installation
to support the new processes the new
suppliers and all these kind of things
so I think increasingly it will be so
that that companies cannot afford to
have a supply chain and an IT footprint
that does not allow them to change very
rapidly because changes is accelerating
so when we are talking to customers we
really see that you know to the left
hand that the supply chain is very often
crossed focused so you've been building
up your whole procurement organization
around the single goal that you want to
negotiate as hard as possible contracts
with your suppliers so you can kind of
keep the cost down but especially during
the financial crisis we saw that that
virus had driven down the the profit
margins of the supplier so badly that
when the financial crisis hit a lot of
these companies just went out of
business and and it hit the buyers hard
as well because suddenly their whole
supply chain could be disrupted if just
one or two important suppliers went out
of business and we are seeing the same
kind of things in terms of living up to
the different regulations on on
sustainability and and work ethics which
are increasingly getting global that
it's harder and harder for bias to
actually find and an audit suppliers
that can deliver the right level of
goods
so so we are seeing that the companies
are changing the the chief procurement
role to be a guy who actually thinks
strategically and invests in the supply
chain not to squeeze costs out of it but
to be able to manage to change faster
how can we change our company faster and
how we spend money and the whole
logistics I'd that that's just a key
factor in that so so my questions really
how does that rhyme with the fact that
you know 99 percent of all companies say
they still exchange information and
collaborate paper only which brings me
to liquidity of data so short story I
was at a conference in in Seattle in
2004 I think microsoft conference and I
decided to take a few days and go hike
so I found the nearest spot that seemed
to have some Hills it is called issaquah
is a few miles out of the Seattle and I
started tracking up some random Hill and
it was actually pretty boring you could
only see you know three meters ahead
because i was walking inside of wood and
also it wasn't very tall and soon it
started to rain so I couldn't see
anything pretty boring I came on the top
of the hill and suddenly there was this
diagram that looked interesting an old
military installation and it turned out
to be one of the nike missile bases and
lo and behold it seemed I actually
stumbled upon the beginnings of the
internet that was very exciting so
basically the first version of ARPANET
they built in order to connect the
missile stations for for example for
coordinating greater so they could
detect incoming missiles and and they
started here but they then started to
scale that across the u.s. and I've
never heard about this place and you
know you almost kind of find it on the
internet but you could literally you
know Walker across the lines of the
wires in the ground to Kalama kilometers
from from one radar base stations of the
next so it's a thought that was really
exciting and you know you got the
ARPANET you got the first notes two
nodes by 69 and the internet just took
off
what I think is interesting is that
during the growth of the Internet you
know it has been different things that
has driven the different phases of
growth in the beginning it was the
military use cases so coordinating
defense systems and then it was at
university networks then it got
commercialized then you got the first
browser in 93 and things just shot
through the roof but I think what is
really defining this phase of the growth
that is obviously cloud mobile and these
kind of devices I will already mention
the Chinese social networks but it's
fair to say it's way above two billion
users now accessing the internet through
mobile devices and cloud and and my
point about this this really is is it's
linked to the the whole question about
the cost of software that is all these
social technology bank models you know
they are in reality distribution
networks this is how they make their
money they do not make money on software
they make money on distribute
information or apps or knowledge about
people and opportunity or opportunity
and money within those networks but
they're building the networks and the
relationships that this is how they can
make money and so when I'm thinking
about the digital supply chain how to
get an indication of how to devalue
networks the value distribution working
these well it's mostly paper according
to the best estimates it's two to eight
percent of the total volume of invoices
is going digital the rest is paper some
estimate that it accounts for like ten
percent of all the trees cut down in the
world day and others invoices that's
pretty boring and it's driven by the 0.5
of all organizations so so 99 points
something of all the small and medium
sized businesses in the world they are
not part of digital supply chain there's
no digital collaboration in any sense of
the world so so the world of egi which
is centered around close proprietary
networks has has not made a difference
in the last 30 years
and when you think about when you
contrast you know the social apps are
just showed before with what is going on
inside organizations I think it shows
all the difference so what characterized
the the social networks we are part of
is that they are collaborative you can
easily reach out to people connect to
people chat with people share all kinds
of weird stuff with people they are very
interconnected so it's not just you and
a few other guys but it's it's typically
you know annoyingly so maybe both your
colleagues and your family in one big
part of connections its cloud-based you
can access it anywhere any device it's
informal identities you no need to go
through a lot of validation should be
part of one of those networks but if you
look at the the digital supply chains
it's exactly the opposite right so it's
highly transactional you almost never
transmit any information except when you
prepare an invoice for the last few
months or an order or a catalogue or
something like this you file away in one
big burst and you only do it with maybe
top 5% select suppliers in your supply
chain if they're not you know those then
then you can live with paper or phone
calls or unstructured information it's
partly connected so so typically a
little bit more well connected within
let's say the oil industry or the
aviation industry but but not really
across industries and and also actually
rarely across country boundaries it's
on-premise so your earpiece system holds
all the core data and in fact you've
decided in a way that all the important
data flow kind of all terminate in the
ERP system where then again gets very
complicated to get data out you have to
create a report get approval for an
integration and then call the ASAP team
and get someone to work with it and
there's a very high barrier to
participate you do a lot of know you of
customer type of validations on
suppliers and so on before they can be
accepted into these kind of networks so
in a way I think it's not strange that
that we have not seen any adoption in
reality in the past 30 years of teachers
of supply chains in the world it's
simply the wrong model that is running
in businesses today
so what to do I think you need to tear
down this side of you need to tear down
the software silos that are your P
system accounting systems workflow
systems order systems you name it they
are all silos today in the enterprise
and especially between companies there's
no interconnection how to do that going
back to the kind of growth of the number
of nodes in the internet turn back the
clock a few years before social networks
John both had one of the inventors of
XML in i think it was 1999 he wrote an
article where he wrote about the
adoption of browsers versus you know how
easy it was for two machines to connect
so a user interface is nice because it
allows humans are very smart so they can
all use it very easily but when you then
get down to the business side of things
you have to pay money or Pig goods or
anything then it's just unstructured
information and systems are basically
not communicating so 99 together with
the temporary he wrote an article that
became quite influential where he he
wrote about you know the next level of
the XML project so XML as he sold was a
way of defining away from moving
structured information between business
systems without and talking about the
semantics of this data without talking
about how it is displayed so really key
cobbling it from the whole htmls thing
so i think his vision was a little bit
it's like HTML but for for business
systems not enough for browsers and he
actually went on to to another
initiative that was called universal
business language i think it was called
something else in the early days but
that was basically an attempt to say you
know let's create an open standard based
on all the business-to-business message
standards that exist today but our
proprietary or limited to certain
verticals and let's create an open
standard for that so so he started that
work so
from xml and 96 then eb XML which was
the first incarnation of that and then
you BL in 2010 and if you look at for
example in the Danish public sector when
you send an invoice it's basically based
on on the ubl standard and today you
will encompasses more than sixty five
transaction types and two thousand
business information items it's it's now
an iso standard and it's it's not tied
to any specific geography or industry
and that's actually the first time in
the history that we've had a standard
like that that that could help
facilitate the information exchange
between systems and I think to me the
kind of the fact that the invoices of
ancient is is a little bit a testimonial
to the stability of some of the core
business processes that we will still be
exchanging things that resemble invoices
for simple orders for many years total
so I think it's good to have a strong
semantic standard and in fact if you
look at at some of his original vision
behind xml and and you will it's
actually you could almost say a social
network kind of of mission it's about
taking all the small companies in the
world and let them collaborate on
delivering things to big buyers in the
world and let everyone have an equal
share because it's not possible today
because of the digital divide between
small and large companies you know
nobody is basically connected in digital
supply chains so you cannot participate
in that kind of business or you couldn't
but but maybe technology can drive this
change so back to you know why am I
talking about this I was talking about
breaking down the silos the data silos
of the large corporations and I think
this is kind of one of the the tools in
the boxes to achieve that if I look at
China this is an official chinese of
paper invoice and you could say that you
know China is very far from adopting
electronic trait when everything is
still done by paper
but I think they have done things
actually very cleverly but just taking a
different route than what we are seeing
with you be able for example you know
they've actually made one specific
layout that has to be used across all of
China it's specified down to the
submillimetre on the layout and and you
have to use a specific fund and then
it's issued by these printers that I
actually connected up to two already a
cloud namely the golden text system the
central tax system and and it's it's
kind of optimized for scanning and
converging to a structured you know
semantically valid electronic format so
in a way I think China is very close to
be able to switch to to digital trade on
to another thing that that is floating
so trust and relationships trade is a
social and you know it's not just
happening our computers but if you're
trading for large amounts that people
get together and talk quite a bit before
you introduce and maybe I think it gets
very visible in China they have the
concept of washi which is a kind of a
word that that implies the importance of
relationships in in when you're doing
business in China and some of the
attributes to it is it's about trust
it's about mutual accountability it's
about dependability respect mutual
obligation and one example I think every
time you're doing business or talking
with prospects in China you meet around
the table you have a good dinner you
drink Baiju which is a fifty-five
percent a strong alcohol that you can in
China you get married and you talk about
business and it is actually very social
another example is last time I met with
some business prospects I was introduced
by one party then met with the business
prospects after the dinner I had to take
half half an hour tour in a golf car
around a hotel resort where it was
suggested to me that maybe next time I
come to Chongqing I stay at this his
good friends
hotel and I will definitely do that and
I think it's part of the the Chinese
kind of building of networks and
relationships before you really commit
to business and commit to each other and
I think it makes sense in in in business
climate where the S a high degree of
corruption where it's a very large
company a very large country and
regulation give us a lot in the country
and it's hard to know exactly who you're
dealing with also the institutions are
not as strong as sucede some some places
in the West so you need really to build
up trust and and one of the things I I
heard several times talking to business
prospects in China that is about El Baba
I don't know if you know them but
they're the kind of first sight that
that that that took your chinese
producers put them out there on the
internet and allowed Western bias to
connect directly with them so if you go
to alibaba.com today you can find
millions of items you know cheap items
Chinese produced and salsa directly from
from from the chinese producers and
there are very very big business when
they made the IPO a few years ago it was
the biggest IPO in the history and they
immediately got the same valuation as as
amazon so it's big big business but i
found out that a lot of chinese a kind
of expressed very reserved opinions
about them like you know they are not
good for chinese business they are
destroying the guanxi way of doing
business and and the point I at least I
got out of it that is that they're
basically you using the cost of things
as the basic denominator of everything
you know so it's it's just a cross
driving mechanism the only thing you can
really evaluate soft on that is what is
the price of it so it creates a whole
different competitive atmosphere then
then the more relationship base to the
kind of trade and and I think it's very
obvious when you see the side it's not a
network like guanxi is a network-based
way of doing business but alibaba
clearly is not it's more like a phone
book you can list the vendors but that's
pretty much it and I think that's very
different actually from the social
network models where you
see how do I know I speak to my sister
on Facebook it's not because anyone
verify her identity or anything it's
because of the pictures that other it's
because of the things she says it's
because of her friends it's because of
all the facts and the actions that
happen in the real world I think guanxi
is a little bit like that you prove
yourself through your actions through
you know your approach to to
collaboration all these kind of things
and and Alibaba seems to erode this this
idea so I at least I'm guessing that
that's why I've heard many unfavorable
opinions on alibaba although it's a kind
of Chinese success story and they also
had their problems this is a picture
from 2011 where suddenly they lost
several billion dollars of value and and
the event that led to that was nicknamed
Ali Baba and the 2300 thieves and that's
basically Alabama had this kind of
centralized validation scheme where they
validated that suppliers so they made
silver suppliers and gold suppliers so
you know conceivably I should be able to
trust a silver or gold supplier because
they have been through some bedding but
again corruption is some more more
widespread in China and this was an
internal corruption case that involve
2,300 internal employees in alibaba that
that were part of the whole vetting
process so in fact it turned out the
centralized wedding could not be trusted
and it was was a huge scandal little
they lost a lot of value but they have
build up since again and if you think
about it the you know we're used to in
Europe and us that we can rely on the
centralized trust you know we trust what
our bank says if we are in doubt about a
company we look them up in the European
business registry or the Danish based
business registry even better in Denmark
we have digital certificates so it's
it's highly centralized trust based
system but but if you look at the the
transparency international index of kind
of corruption levels in different
countries I took a small count and it
turns out that at least in 2014 more
than five
people were living in countries that
were as corrupt or more corrupt than
Tunisia so in a way the whole model of
centralized trust doesn't seem a very
scalable model in in this world if you
really want to think internationally and
and it is a big challenge and one of the
challenges which which you know several
World Bank studies list as the top
challenges of small businesses is access
to finance its late payments when you
solve the financial crisis in Europe a
lot of small companies went out of
business they couldn't get access to
finance if you look at the outstanding
amount of money between large car buyers
and their suppliers at any day it is it
is more than nine trillion dollars that
is money owed by bias to supplies so
it's not an uneven playing field it's
actually really hard on the 99 percent
of businesses the small businesses
because basically large companies are
using them as as cash cows and it makes
sense because banks and institutional
players they only finance roughly
fifteen percent of the financing need
and that number is dropping quickly and
then supplied him financing which is
financing based on the actual trade
documents that goes on is somewhat less
and what why I'm talking about this is
because of trust because essentially it
is because banks cannot evaluate the
risk in lending money to small companies
they don't have the information so
alternative lending is booming in China
actually the biggest player in the world
is credited East the biggest crowd
lending platform in the world and it
grew four hundred percent in China so
people are seeking other sources and
banks and it's exactly the same
development you're seeing in the rest of
the world but in China is hyper-charged
and if you look at what is going on the
digital supply chain that's part of why
why intuitive we are so interested in
that is that maybe you send in purchase
order then you ship your goods you send
a receipt back from the buy side that
you got it you send an invoice maybe an
acknowledgement is sent back from the
pile and this can happen very very fast
so even before you get your money you
have proof finds that a buyer will
actually pay you you know the credit
rating of the buyer you know how the
buyer is connected into the rest of the
network so suddenly you have a network
based model of trust and that's much
more valuable than a telephone book
based model of trust and that can be
used to drive some of the financing
decision and basically I believe unlock
some of the nine trillion dollars that
are held up between buyers and suppliers
in Europe we are very interested in the
invoice because we have a very well
regulated market and rules around that
in China it's a little bit more the ship
notice and maybe the orders and a little
bit of everything and then it's the
social graph so it's a relationship with
the logistics provider with your buyer
with your other buyers with your other
suppliers it's your transaction history
all that can play into how to trust and
and for trade ship this is one of the
models that we are going to try with
with our JV and in charging and we have
a big interest also from the Chinese
financial players so yeah I'm very
excited about that transactions are also
dissolving I think as you can see you
know you're not just interested in the
invoice if you want to lower the risk of
finance but you wanted once actually
more interested in the collaboration
around it has my invoice been approved
which is more of a collaborative
statement and maybe you're more
interested in knowing about the the
social graph or the business graph
around your company which is also not
really transactional and since 2013 we
have been doing supply chain financing
in a pilot mode but but but we believe
this model can work and can actually in
general change how how small companies
get access to finance and in the big
picture I think if it can take off it
can actually help bridge some of the
digital device that we see in the world
I don't think it's it's just about money
but but a few other trends like
transactions are taking back seats so as
soon as you you you don't charge people
for stupid transactions you
can charge people for value and I think
that's the software as a service model
you can now start distributing business
software to small companies everywhere
in the world that before handy only a
few percent of the most advanced
companies in the world could afford it I
think that will allow them to
participate in digital supply chains and
when they can do that you know not banks
but anyone who wants to participate can
have access to that level of information
what is going on in the supply chain and
I think that can you know you may be
tired of the world is rough but I think
it can fundamentally disrupt how
financing works because banks don't have
access to any of that kind of
information today but you need a
software revolution to to actually drive
that change through and that's not a
bank speciality by by any means so to
finish up everything is floating maybe
not everything I'm not but a few things
stability of large company companies are
decreasing due to disruptive risks
technology risks logistics risks demand
risks the distinction between the inside
and the outside of companies is blurring
we are seeing company suddenly investing
in the supply chain as if it was part of
the inner side of the company and
investing in the suppliers we are seeing
that transaction based networks are
disappearing or they still exist but
they have to find some other ways of
making money we see that the here keys
are starting to dissolve that that the
value models are much more build around
value models so social network
technology i think is going to play a
very big role in that also for business
and then i think we are also seeing
maybe the style of the dissolution of
centralized to trust the mechanisms
because i don't think in the world at
large it's a scalable mechanism but the
network based models are in fact much
more scalable and then I think finally
that that the b2b networks may actually
be some of the drivers and dissolving
these teachers will divide
you see between small companies large
companies developing economies mature
economies and so on and so forth and I
think that that those were the points
thanks for listening I don't know if
there's any time for question or so we
have at least one question in the app
and if folks want to add more feel free
to do so I also would encourage you to
rate the session so we can get some good
feedback and then we pop the question I
think it was asked a little bit early in
the presentation but how do you build
the dev teams around the world are they
virtual do you colo Kate the devs you
know Danes moving to China hmm yeah good
question so I think when we first moved
from opening to San Francisco we decided
that we want to create the offices equal
so in the sense they should be able to
do everything you know you can do about
building software selling software
marketing software so we build teams
that are in principle autonomous they
have PMS they have back endless fun
dinners every office has you know
involved in sales or delivery they have
management and these kind of things and
that's also how we we've built the the
Chinese offices so its local PMS its
local engineering leads they are hiring
their own teams all of that but we've
invested quite a bit in actually sending
not enough but we've invested some in
actually sending people co-locating
people for some time and also bringing
Chinese engineers into especially the
Copa new office frequently so and then
I'm spending a lot of time in China
together with with my other co-founder
and and a third guy I Heinrich who's
who's heading out the product management
but the goal is really to have the
offices be autonomous for the Chongqing
to adventure we are going to experiment
with with another setup which is you
know basically the same an autonomous
office but we also want to create a
small acceleration team
Inc opening four man team that can help
accelerate that too frequent travels to
to Chungking and and be a kind of
knowledge sharing network agent based in
the opening office that has a champion
agenda as a main agenda but are based
very close to to wear a lot of the core
knowledge about the platform is and help
basically transfer that to China so I
don't know if that answered the question
thanks everyone yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
