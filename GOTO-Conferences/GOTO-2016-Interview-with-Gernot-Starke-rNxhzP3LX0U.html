goes with it with gamma Chaka gallons
who are you and what are you doing for
today hello spent thanks for having me
here it go to I am an interview fellow
I'm working as a consultant for software
architecture consultant and coach of
companies have any problems with their
architecture of the systems I sometimes
come at a thing ok today and go to you
spoke about systematic improvement of
software so I wonder what this
unsystematic improvement also there what
is an systematic improvement I've seen
unsystematic improvement in teams when
there is a wild mixture of everybody
doing work here there and they all hope
they are doing something productive and
positive but in the end no real
improvement can be seen completely
something yes it's a client we have one
of our mutual clients did gave people
get the developers about ten fifty
percent of time for refectory but
without planning this and they achieved
very high quality in certain parts of
their architecture but didn't solve any
real problems or the performance
problems run tackled and that was very
unsystematic everybody did a local scope
optimization without having the overall
big picture in mind my experience it
happens
that people just grabbed some sonar
warnings and fix them exactly they
actually thinking about exactly that
they they often grab the warnings they
find most interesting and not those that
have the most positive effect on the
system okay so now the question is what
is systemic improvement what should I go
how should I improve my system I read
about the term value-based improvement
so we all should think about the value
we create when we when we modify or
transform or improve the system so if we
if we managed to identify some positive
business impact for any modification
then that's a positive thing then we
should do that so systematic improvement
is improvement based around the notion
of value of business value of lowering
costs or improving productivity in such
things okay that sounds like something
easy to send management's compared to
this classes to be our system is
terrible this is right that's exactly
right that's my motivation why I want to
do that because the managers are the
guys who have the money and they they
need to allow us developers to spend the
money in the positive way so I need to
convince the managers in their language
their business terminology so if I
convince somebody hey you can save
thousand you owe per week when when I
can perform this improvement that's a
good argument if I tell the manager hey
I can reduce the coupling they won't
understand what I mean and they won't
give it any any positive meaning how do
you estimate the value or the cost of an
improvement i estimate the cost of the
problem
of the issue so for example is something
is running running slow or something is
breaking down from time to time I try to
estimate the cost of this problem so
what business are you losing what
develop how much developer time are you
wasting if this problem persists and
only then I think about any measure and
the improvement getting rid of this
problem and I am a friend of having at
least two improvement options for every
problem because there is no one to one
relationship between problem and
improvement it's an M to any
relationship you have always a second or
a third option what can we do so
probably what is do nothing yes what's
the cost is higher this is a thing I try
to teach development teams ignore the
low code quality in this or that
specific module because you're never
touching it again or it's very rarely
it's very rarely modified so it's
actually of no business used to to do
clean coat and improvements on this
thing yeah actually imagining it always
you want to improve it but yes do it in
your spare time we don't know we can't
if you want but better leave it alone
making all the problem and fix the real
ones do we need some kind of measurement
for our success if the improvement is
really working out yes we do so the
business guys call that KPI so we need
some performance indicators if an
improvement is really working out a
positive way we expect that's why i love
iterative improvement because in
iterations i can always look back and
discuss with the team did it work out we
don't need need need these metrics in a
very very exact way so rough estimation
are we getting better it's often enough
okay so because it's giving an indicator
if the improvement
going to the right direction munication
or walmart something like that is easy
this is basically fine is better to have
nothing okay and and I have great
experience I had great experiences in
explicitly asking developers about the
effect of an approved so if they are
asked did it work out and did you spend
less time fixing bugs this week they can
give you an estimate and that's very
often working on few years ago we
founded this architecture improvement
methods open source project that's
basically a huge collection of parents
and best practices around this
improvement transition modernization
domain okay thank you very much for the
