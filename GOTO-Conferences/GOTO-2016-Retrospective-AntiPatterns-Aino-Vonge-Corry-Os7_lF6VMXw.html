today I'm here to talk about
retrospectives but since it's it's nice
to hear about other people's successes
but it's even better to hear about their
failures so that's why I'm going to talk
about antipatterns
so I'm not going to tell you how you
should do the retrospectives I'm going
to give you some entry patterns that you
will see out there when you're
facilitating retrospectives so first I'd
like to know who I'm talking to
so please raise your hand if you've
written a book about retrospectives
please raise your hand if you have
facilitated retrospectives please raise
your hand if you have been into a
retrospective and now for the brave ones
raise your hand if you don't know what a
retrospective is Wow
yeah let's give them a hand so funnily
enough the reason that I got interested
in retrospectives was because I was at a
talk by Linda rising and she asked that
question I said I don't know anything
about retrospective so I'm just coming
to listen to you because I always like
listening to you and because I was brave
enough to say that out loud she gave me
a book a book by a known curse about
project retrospectives and I think Linda
mentioned that book earlier today but a
little bit more about me I put speakers
on stage so I invite speakers to
conferences similar to this conference I
messed with the heads of students I'm
teaching at the University of Aarhus in
computer science and I'm now also
teaching how to teach computer science
to the teachers at computer science and
that's why my company is called MIT a
developer and then I'm making developers
communicate and that's why I'm here
today because I like to try to make
developers communicate about the things
that went well and the things that went
less well so that's me and what you will
get out of this talk is a bunch of anti
patterns for retrospectives
and I hope that what you'll get out of
that is that you'll be aware that now
I'm entering into this entry pattern so
I should do something differently than
what I'm doing right now and then
there'll be a surprise because I really
hate listening to people for 15 minutes
I find it really boring except if it's
Linda so what I've done is that I've put
in two breaks where I'm talking about
something completely different and if
you're not interested in what I'm
talking about you can choose that time
to look at your phone or think about
what you'll have for dinner or something
like that it's perfectly fine just do
something else than thinking about
retrospectives okay so the the answer
panels are not going to talk about are
named after the problem that they are
prime directive ignorance the Wheel of
Fortune best buy postponement let's get
it over with in the soup and
do-it-yourself retrospectives and then
they'll be two extra patterns so that's
what I'm going to go through and then
I'll remind you in the end what I said
because it's late in the evening so
it'll be difficult to stay awake for the
whole for the whole told luckily it's
very bright up here and I can't really
see you so I can't see if you're
sleeping it's quite all right but what
is an anti-pattern actually how many of
you know what an anti-pattern is okay so
most of you know what it is my example
here is the blob anti-pattern and i
don't know how many of you know the old
science fiction movie The Blob but it's
about a blob that falls down from the
sky and it's a it's actually a black
blob but I didn't have black color so
we'll just be red in this story it's a
black blob and then it's it's oozing
around the earth and whenever it meets
something it just sort of it becomes
part of the flop so the trees and the
people all become part of the blob and
the blob is the name of an architectural
anti-pattern which is about whenever you
have a new functionality you put that
into your primary class of your system
and you just keep putting things into
this class and the problem is that if
you have a big class with all the
functionality it's really difficult to
main
taine and it's really difficult for
other people to understand what's
actually happening because you have a
mess with the responsibilities so in the
anti-patterns what you get is you get
the the context as you do in patterns
and then you get the description of the
anti-pattern solution which is the thing
that you will do without thinking about
it without being aware of the answer
pattern and then you'll get the
consequences but then the extra thing in
the anti pattern is that you actually
get a refactored solution to the problem
so it will show you what the problem is
and then it'll say so this is the way to
get a rate get away from this problem
and for for the blob the the thing that
you do is that you take this big huge
blob and then you divide it into
different classes with their own
responsibilities so this is what we now
call macro services so that's actually
using the blob pattern is micro services
so that's so that's anti patterns for
you and that's what I'm going to talk
about with respect to retrospectives but
I'm going to start with a little story
so there was a little Danish company
called Titanic which made reliable
navigation software for ships but it
started having a really bad reputation
things went wrong and they didn't really
know what to do about it
it was like a big ship corporation and
then some of their leaders said hey
we'll make it
agile we'll start using scrum that's the
solution to everything so that's what
we'll do so one of the teams consisted
of the six people you can see up here
Nikki Susan Peter Robert Sarah and Jim
and they sent all of them to a scrum
master course and then Sarah was the one
who became the scrum master because she
was interested in it and now since she
was the scrum master at the strong core
she was told that she was to facilitate
the retrospectives so they started
squirming they worked with their
software and after the first two weeks
she was supposed to facilitate her first
retrospective and now because she she
was a very good girl she had been
reading up about retrospectives and one
of the things she had been reading was
was the
by Nam Cerf and Nam Cerf has this prime
directive which says regardless of what
we discover we must understand and truly
believe that everyone did the best job
he or she could
given what was known at the time his or
her skills and abilities the resources
available and the situation at hand but
she knew that wouldn't go well with the
developers of that company because they
couldn't really truly understand and
believe that people weren't just idiots
who messed things up all the time
so she knew she couldn't do that so she
decided not to think about this plan
director and she just started
facilitating the retrospective and the
thing that should have been a blameless
retrospective where you're supposed to
look at the whole system instead of
finding scapegoats turned into a session
which was a blame full retrospective and
they were talking about the reason why
this bill failed was because of Peter
because he really made a stupid mistake
and Susan didn't even read the
requirements written in that story and
that's why it was problematic so people
were trying to blame people instead of
finding the fault in the system and
trying to fix the system and this is
something that often happens with
retrospectives is that people do not
want to show the developers this prime
directive because they think it's
ridiculous and stupid and there's a lot
of debate on exactly that prime
directive on the internet if you are
interested in seeing all the different
viewpoints on it because people cannot
simply and truly believe that people
always doing the best so that's why I
have a my first pattern as the prime
directive ignorance and I think it's
very important to think about the prime
directive I'm not saying that you should
always read it aloud but I'm saying that
you in some way maybe in the language
that they use she'll make people know
that that is mindset you want them to
take to the retrospective that we're not
trying to find somebody to blame but
they were trying to find faults in the
system that we together
can fix but the problem is that if
people don't believe in the prime
directive
they won't use it and if they won't use
it it fails so it's the same as the Yoda
vision that other people talk about
there is so much about in scrum that
Yoda has the intelligence of saying well
you have to actually do it to make it
work you have to believe in it so the
description of the answer patterns I
have are formed on the same way that the
answer patterns for software is formed
at first you have a problem the problem
is it feels awkward to follow the
directive because you can't really make
people believe that this is true and the
energy pattern solution is just to
forget about it don't think about the
prime directive cut it it's ridiculous
anyway and the consequence is is that
people bring all the negative
expectations and assumptions to the
meeting and people are being scapegoated
for the things that they've done instead
of trying to figure out how could they
make this work better the anecdotal
evidence which means how do you know
that you're in this as a pattern is that
people don't really listen to each other
they're just hearing what they want to
hear and little by little people start
becoming afraid of going to
retrospectives and then they will stop
going and then if if a big amount of the
of the team is not coming to
retrospectives it's not the team solving
the problems anymore
so the refactor solution is to bring
this prime directive into the
retrospectives in some way or the other
you have to figure out on your own what
works best for your team but try to find
that blameless culture and to introduce
that to the people so that was the first
anti-pattern and it's very important to
bring this how many of you actually
bringing this to retrospectives already
a few hands right five 10% maybe so it's
something to consider definitely it
helps so a few more weeks go by and she
comes to the next retrospective to
facilitate and she has heard that what
you do is
that you asked the developers to put up
post-its on a poster saying what should
we start doing what should we stop doing
what should we do more of what you would
do less of I believe that a lot of
people are facilitating retrospectives
like that and one of the things that
came up was that they should do more
pair programming so right one of their
goals for this retrospective is we
should do more pair programming and they
wrote down maybe three hours twice a
week everybody should do pair
programming but the problem is that at
the next retrospective the same problem
will come up they're not doing the pair
programming even though they decided to
do the pair programming and that's why
I've called this the wheel of fortune
because if you're just directly focusing
on the problems and then going through
the solutions then there are some things
that you miss because if they had spent
some time looking at why do we not make
pair programming maybe they would have
understand the maybe they would have
understood that Peter and Jim are very
introverted people and they hate pair
programming they cannot work in that way
so even though you decide as a team that
we should have more pair programming it
will not work because they will try to
try to avoid it in all the ways that
they can so the wheel of fortune is the
name I've given the ANSI peasant because
I think it's like spinning one of these
wheels because sometimes when you just
jump in to start with stop with you're
lucky and you are solving the actual
problem but other times you're just
solving a symptom of a much bigger
problem
so the refactored solution of this
anti-pattern is to try to actually look
at the courses behind these problems
that people see so instead of just when
they say we need more retrospectives or
we need more pair programming instead of
just doing that try to look at why do
not why do we not have pair programming
or a wired assist test fail or why is
our communication with this other team
so bad
try to dealt down into the courses
actually follow the five phases of the
retrospective so first you set the stage
everybody is in a circle and yes I
expect people to be in a circle and yes
sometimes they hate it but I really
think that having people in a circle
where everybody can see each other and
nobody is at the end of the table and
preferably they are in a circle with no
furniture in between them and everybody
gets to say something it's a really
important start of a retrospective
setting this stage because if you allow
people to be silent already from the
beginning then it's much easier for them
to stay silent during the meeting so
getting that connectedness together
nastain have to hold hands they can do
that that's what I say to them you don't
have to touch each other it's okay by me
so but just to make them understand that
they're together as a team and then you
gather data and one of my preferred ways
of doing that is just to have a timeline
showing what happened since the last
retrospective the good things the bad
things are things that still puzzles me
and then the thing that is really really
important and really really different
difficult is to is to look at this map
of data and try to generate the insights
try to find the causes behind these
things try to dig the go find the
stories behind these why did this happen
you can use the five why's where you're
digging into the causes behind things or
or you can use the fishbone where you
look at different aspects of courses
behind this problem but it is a very
important stage and a stage that people
often often overlook and it is really
really difficult sometimes for me to get
the developers to stop looking at the
solutions right away it's as if even
when they are formulating the problem
they're giving me the solution they are
saying this this bill failed and we have
to get this new technology and we have
to get people on a course to learn to
use this and that'll be the solution to
this so no we have to try to to keep the
options open
which is really really hard we have to
try to start a conversation which opens
up suggestions for courses behind these
things before we start closing it with
solutions but I find that one of the
hardest things there's no easy solutions
to this and then the next thing is
decide what to do and then of course
again closing the retrospective is
important to say now we've been through
these things we've looked at this data
we decided to focus on these problems we
went through the courses we decided to
brainstorm on solutions and we voted for
solutions and now we've ridden them down
as long-term or short-term goals and
that I have found is important because
sometimes when I forget to do that
people say why did we make that decision
I'm sure it was I know who made that
decision because she was definitely one
at the board all the time and she likes
to talk but it's very important that the
team knows that they made the decision
and that they took all the steps to come
to this decision to do these things to
have these actions and that's why I
think it's very important to summarize
what actually happened that this
retrospective and it is it is good for a
retrospective facilitator to be
invisible and just be part of the wall
and let the team do their work but it
can be very difficult especially if you
like me really like to be on stage and
talk all the time but it's something
that can be learned I'm sure now this is
the point where it's beginning to be
dreadful to listen to me so now I'm
going to something completely different
so there are two people on this team
Sarah and Robert and they're interested
in each other you can see that from that
picture it's very typical for women to
touch their hair if they interested in
the man they're talking to or if they
have lies but in this in this case we we
try to focus on her being interested in
him and he is definitely interested in
her but he is not really good with women
he doesn't know
how to talk to women he's never had a
girlfriend he's never dated so what does
he do he asks somebody else on the team
he asks for help which is also a very
good pattern in itself
so he asks Jim what do I do and Jim says
can read this yourself
so dim says there is nice book you can
read and Robert says no that can't be
true I never heard of a book like that
you can't have a book like that yes
there is a book like that
actually and one of the patterns in that
book is called the decorated visitor
honeypot how many of you know that
decorated misses a honeypot yeah those
of you who heard me speak before know
that so there is a problem you want to
connect to and create conversational
state with women but you want them to do
all the work
sounds familiar I think it does the
forces are there has to be women in your
realm you can't apply this pattern
unless they're actually women around
because then it doesn't work if it is
women you want to attract of course it
could be anything human women notice
their surroundings much more than men I
guess you have noticed that as well they
noticed when there's new paint they
notice when when you've got a saying on
your t-shirt they notice well there's
chocolate around them and women are
skilled at obtaining excuses to starting
seemingly innocent conversations with
men they're interested in which you
should be aware of because if they start
talking about something insignificant it
could be the start of something very
significant and you should jump to that
chance be polite about it of course the
solution is to establish an appealing
environment and indirectly initiate the
connections which are then initiated by
others so as always with patterns the
abstract solution is really abstract and
you have to look into the implementation
hints to see how can I actually do this
because most of you will probably like
to make that feeling environment but you
don't really know how to do it so here
are some tricks so the first thing that
you should do is that you should expose
interests you should show them what
you're interested in
it could be singing in a choir it could
be riding a motorbike
it could be climbing Mount Everest or
something like that just find pictures
of yourself doing that or posters of
when you have
acquire it could also be the kid see
puppy angle that you bring pictures of
kittens or puppies or you bring actual
kittens or puppies to work which can
have some other problems but bringing a
kitten to work is really a woman magnet
it works wonders and and also babies
babies work very well as well as I've
seen when my husband bring our children
to the to the public pool
he's like surrounded by young women
immediately which is why he never gets
to do that anymore and you can decorate
yourself that is probably something that
some engineers forget that it's not a
bad idea to decorate yourself and when I
say decorate you don't need to wear
makeup and stuff like that you could do
that but again it depends who you want
to attract but something that is
interesting is for instance to have a
t-shirt with a beautiful picture or
something in finish because then the
women have an excuse to come up and ask
you what does that mean
or where's that beautiful picture from
and then they have initiated the
discussion and then you can talk about
that
chocolate chocolate is good expensive
chocolate is even better if it's got
clear to repaper it's really good there
are some benefits and drawbacks benefit
is of course that the women walk by will
do the work for you they will initiate
discussions but the drawback is that it
can be costly because expensive
chocolate tends to be expensive yeah so
but it really works and another problem
is you may oversell yourself so you
could have faked the picture where
you're climbing Mount Everest but if it
then turns out that she is actually an
avid climber
you might die so it there's really some
things to be aware of here it's it's not
just fun and games
a related pattern is the unexpected
resource God where you always walk
around with a backpack with things that
women might need an umbrella of course
with your telephone number in it so they
can bring it back headache pills
chocolate things like that and this as I
have to say it also works for men who
are married already so starting a
conversation with
wife is actually not a bad idea from
time to time I think well maybe not for
everybody but for some people it'll be
good to talk to your wife from time to
time so it's not it's also for you even
if you are married and all these
patterns are from a book which is called
the dating design pattern book that you
can buy and it's a this book that you
probably know the Gang of Four design
peddlers is actually a quick cover-up
for this dating design pattern book you
can read the story about that on the
internet but let's go on with our story
so susan is still the scrum master and
now between week four and six she is
she's still waiting for the next
retrospective things start popping up
like built continues to break Peter
continues to work from home I'm not
saying it's necessarily bad to work from
home but it can be a smell it can mean
that there's something that he doesn't
like in the workplace so sometimes it's
a good idea to talk to people if they're
changing habits like that but the
problem was that since this team knew
that there was a retrospective they
would just save up all their problems
for that retrospective so they wouldn't
just solve the problems when they met
them they would wait until the
retrospective and that's why I call this
pattern the death by postponement and
the problem is is actually real I've
seen it many times that people say well
we can we don't have to talk about this
right now we can wait for the
retrospective and the problem is that of
course the solution is delayed because
it has to wait for the retrospective but
it also impacts the retrospective
because one of the beautiful things that
happens at retrospectives is that new
things come up because people share
experiences or they find the causes
behind the solution or perhaps behind
the problems and and if you save all the
things that are obvious let everybody
knows about already then you don't have
time enough to dig for the goal to find
the new things that should pop up
so the refactor solution is
to raise the problem when it occurs of
course it seems very obvious and again
an abstract solution is not always good
enough so what could we do to implement
this abstract solution one thing that
Linda once told me about was a real-time
timeline and how many of you heard Linda
talking about that earlier today yeah so
I don't have to go into much detail
about that but that's actually a really
good way of taking advantage of people
knowing what is happening from a
day-to-day basis so now if you make
people have a real-time timeline in the
project room or in the team room or
maybe online if they're distributed team
then you can win your when there's a
cluster of red nodes you might be able
to take care of it at exactly that time
instead of waiting for the retrospective
so a real-time timeline is something
that I often suggest to people even if
they don't seem to have this problem but
simply so that people also can have a
place to to put their frustrations up
but also sometimes when I come to
retrospective people have forgotten what
happened two or three weeks ago and then
the only things that they put up on the
timeline are the things that happened
within the last three or four days so
it's also a good way of starting the
retrospective with some days I already
gathered as long as you give them time
to gather more data but the weeks pass
and we start hearing different things
from the team we do not really get
anything out of the retrospective time
for coding is much more important we're
wasting time on these retrospectives
they always blame me for this and that
the retrospective and I'm sure we could
do this retrospective in half the time
I mean we're spending so much time just
discussing things that we don't really
change anyway because we choose to
change something else so it's just a
waste of time and when you hear this
when you hear these things from people
in the team you're in the antipattern
that's called let's get it over with
and the problem with the let's get it
over with situation is that it
deteriorates the retrospectives because
they say well we can do it quickly or we
can do it in half the time maybe just
cut ten minutes maybe just cut fifteen
minutes and slowly but surely the
retrospectives will vanish because if
you cut down a retrospective to say 45
minutes a half an hour you don't have
time to go through all the phases you
don't have time to listen to everybody
and then they will not get as much out
of it and then they will be a waste of
time and then they will stop spending
time on the retrospectives so it's very
important to be aware of this ng pattern
let's get it over with when people start
saying let's shorten this down let's
make this shorter because we don't
really need that time it can be a step
in the wrong direction and one thing you
could do to to restart the
retrospectives is to get somebody else
to facilitate the retrospectives so that
you can see what's happening to the
people if you're the scrum master or the
one who is often facilitating look at
somebody else facilitating the team
trying to find some new activities on
the internet or buy a book but even more
important ask questions try to figure
out why they think that the
retrospectives are a waste of time but
also trying to figure out which problems
that they have norm cuz once said to me
I asked him how do I sell retrospectives
and he said you don't you don't
celebrate respectives nobody wants to
buy a retrospective really but they want
to have a solution to their problems so
instead ask them questions about how
they're doing what the problems are and
then you can say well let's try this it
happens to be a retrospective but who
cares about the name try to figure out
why it's not happening and why they
might need some help but I was Robert
doing just one more dating pattern I
promise you but I just really like them
so the surprise statefulness I am taking
this because the problem is that Robert
really
attracted her to his cubicle but now he
doesn't really know how to continue the
conversation with her she will come into
his cubicle ask questions he'll smile
he'll answer and nothing else happens so
surprise statefulness is you want to
convince the target female that you're a
package of extremely desirable resources
which is what men need to do because to
women all men seem alike and you need to
stick out to show that you have the good
genes well just taking it biologically
so you have to show that you are special
and the way that you can show that you
are special is to listen to her and
remember what she has said making her
private dates are persistent and you
know for how long you need to remember
what she said three weeks three weeks is
enough to make an impression it would be
nice if they could remember it forever
I agree but just three weeks it's
actually enough to stick out from the
other crowd so use optimistic
persistence to implement explicit
storage and retrieval of her private
attributes but again this is an abstract
solution let's look at the
implementation details so there are two
obvious strategies it's like the
standard text retrieval strategy where
you just ask her for instance if she
said oh I bought a little puppy and you
ask her how is the puppy doing and then
you have the object instantiation
strategy which is if you told you about
a band that she's reached that she
really likes you can buy her a CD or you
can say to her do you know that they're
playing in the park next month and then
find some tickets so you can use those
different strategies it takes
considerable investment up front do you
know why it takes considerable
investment up front
because you have to listen to what she's
saying to everything she's saying and
that's why I have this related pattern
interested listener where you implement
the the interface look as though you are
listening which is really important when
you're listening to a woman you have to
try actually to look as if you're
listening is important part of it
you could have 30 reads which is not
very good and those who reads is not
it's got nothing to do with dirty but
it's simply the database term that if
she told you she had this little puppy
and she later told you the puppy is dead
don't ask about the puppy so you don't
just read from from the from the earlier
part of the database look at the
timestamps and also and also look at
look at the IDS if one woman tells you
one thing and another woman and you'll
ask another woman about it it's a really
bad idea I'm I have my second marriage
and sometimes my husband says that must
be your first husband you're talking
about and that's oh it's not very good
but if you if you can do all these
things you get a corresponding high
return because no other man will be able
to provide these resources so three
weeks just listen and remember for three
weeks not bad let's go back to our story
week 8:00 to 10:00 the bus will never
allow it the team says about things we
always discuss the testing framework
nothing ever happens we can why can't
the retrospectives not help us we have
all these retrospectives who spent time
it changes nothing we never get anything
changed and these things you hear if
people keep discussing the same things
over and over again it's like Groundhog
Day we're always having these things
we're always discussing these things and
that is when you find yourself in the
soup so in the soup means that you are
working on things that the team cannot
change the important thing about
retrospectives it's that it's a team
thing we should discuss things that the
team can actually do take actions with
and do things that
if we are always discussing how the
other team should work or what our bus
should say or where the company should
be placed it's obvious that these things
keep popping up
so trying to look at the problems that
you talk about and see well where do
they actually belong do they belong into
the circle where we can do something
about it or do they belong to the soup
where we cannot really do anything about
it because the problem is that if you
keep having these things popping up and
you keep hearing people saying it's
worthless to have these retrospectives
then they'll stop having the
retrospectives because it is worthless
to have retrospective where you talk
about what other people should do it
doesn't really change anything here's an
example what I sometimes do when we have
looked at the different data it could be
on a timeline or something else I asked
them to say well I have these three
circles there's some things you could do
something about there's some things you
can influence and then you have the soup
where should these problems go and then
we can focus on working on the things
where you can do and we can look at if
there are some things in the influence
we can actually do maybe send an email
to somebody and the things in the soup
maybe you just have to accept that this
is how it is or change your job and then
sometimes when you are delving into the
causes behind these things when you're
going to the generate insights sometimes
magic happens and it turns out that the
things you thought you were only able to
influence you can actually do something
about and the things that you thought
were in the soup you might be able to
influence so instead of just thinking
about them on the level that they are
when you just described them if you
generate the inside and see the courses
then maybe you're actually able to do
something different so for instance if
you think that the communication with
the testers is bad one thing you could
do maybe is to move closer to the
testers and that leaves this problem in
the doing circle instead of in the
influence and also if you want to change
the location of the company that might
not be something you could do but maybe
you could come up with
reasons for a local hub so maybe you can
actually influence it or at least you
can say well now we try these are the
reasons why a local hub would be great
because we don't have to travel so far
and so long and we would be more close
together so I think it's very
interesting a to divide these things in
what you can do what you can maybe just
influence and what is in the soup very
important to look at that but also
interesting to look at how when you're
generating insights the thing can move
around they might not be what they seem
so the week passes and now people are
saying the retrospectives are so boring
really not high energy we should have a
better facilitator and actually
sometimes susan says to herself well
maybe i would like to actually be a
facilitated in a retrospective maybe i
could get something out of them as well
instead of just focusing on being the
facilitator and when you hear this
you're often in what I call the
do-it-yourself retrospectives and the
do-it-yourself retrospectives is the
situation you find yourself in when it's
always a scrum master who facilitates a
retrospective it's nice and it's well
known and it's what people say a scrum
master should do but it holds different
potential problems so what could happen
at a retrospective where it's the same
person facilitating is that you always
do the same things the person has one
way of facilitating and maybe some
activities that he or she likes to use
and they're never changed because it is
his or her tool set but another thing
that I think is even more potentially
dangerous is that if the scrum master is
always the facilitator then the scrum
master is not really part of the
retrospective and that means that he or
she is not part of the team and they'll
part in finding the problems and even
more important figuring out what the
action should be and if you're wearing
two heads to a wretch
expect if you can't do both things at
the same time either you are a
facilitator who thinks about the time
thinks about the different agendas looks
at people looks at their body language
trying to figure out who needs to talk
who needs to shut up should we have a
break Q we move to another thing is this
activity dead have they discussed this
too much there's so many things to think
about when you're a facilitator so you
don't have time to reflect about what
happened on the other hand and this I've
tried person is if you're facilitating
your own team it can be very hard not to
join a discussion about something and
once you do that once you really join
the discussion about this you forget
about the time you forget about the
things that you should do a facilitator
so it's not very good to always have the
same facilitator so the solution is to
take turns in facilitating the
retrospectives or maybe even use an
outsider as a facilitator at the company
I used to work for try fog in Denmark we
had a rotation scheme for facilitating
our teams so we simply had a Google
spreadsheet where people signed up with
their team saying I would like to have a
retrospective in this week in this
weekend this week and then the people
who would like to facilitate would say I
can do this and this and this and then
others maybe can do this and of course
there are some teams who likes better to
be facilitated by somebody more than
some other people and that is something
you can take into account also when
you're making these schemes who wants to
facilitate this group and who wants to
be facilitated by this facilitator but I
can really recommend it but also of
course taking in an external facilitator
and sometimes called in as an external
facilitator in companies whether they
used to facilitate each other and then
they asked me to come and facilitate
just to see if we they could learn
something new and maybe do something
different and then the people who are
normally facilitating can step back and
actually take part in that retrospective
so these were the six retrospective
anti-patterns prime directive ignorance
the wheel of fortune death by
postponement let's get it over with in
the soup and do-it-yourself
retrospectives so the reason why I
wanted to share this
with you is that I really believe that
one of the good things about NC patterns
is the awareness about NC patterns as
with the block ng pattern once you see
that everybody puts the functionality in
the same class you are aware that you're
now entering a blob you have a name for
it you could say hey Fred aren't we
entering the blob right now Fred it's
just a great name to say it together
with blob so then you're aware of these
things and the same thing with these
retrospective NC patterns oh I think
we're getting into do-it-yourself
retrospectives now should we try to rote
make a rotation of the facilitation or
are we being a little ignorant about the
prime directive right now so I want you
to have awareness and then I I added the
dating patterns just for just for fun
but what happened to rubber and Sarah
I'm sure you're all thinking about this
right now you need to have the ending of
the story and the ending of the story
was that Sarah had told Robert that she
was singing in a choir and he showed
that he had listened and remembered her
data by actually showing up what her
choir sang and she saw him in the
audience and well they went out for a
drink and now they're happily married
and have five children so that's what
happened to Robert and Sarah and what
happened to Susan at the little seam
well as Susan started to rotate the
facilitation with the others so that she
could take part in it herself they found
a way to remember each other about the
prime directive in a fun way for each
start of it like having examples of
things that people could say that were
really nasty they like that that way the
different ways of doing this so she
became a more skilled facilitator and
she started to enjoy it a lot more and
some people think in patterns some
people don't
I actually concludes my discussion yeah
but that time for extra subjects and I
brought some if you don't have any
questions yep
okay what's it gonna be questions or
should she talked for we have a question
is there any advantage of having a
facilitator in the team you mentioned
that like the disadvantage personally
yeah so now it's a good question
facilitating a retrospective is a lot
about trust it's very important that
people trust to facilitate or not to
talk about what asset at the
retrospective to other people and it's
very important that everybody feels
secure and safe in that environment and
of course I need to trust the
facilitator a lot to be able to talk
about the things that are difficult and
that I would think is is the advantage
of having the facilitator be part of the
team unless of course that person is
somebody they don't trust but that would
be the only thing I thought ah thank you
I was just thinking and do you think
it's better to have regular
retrospectives even if no one can come
up with something new I should say
almost or something that we can't change
her yeah or should I be on aneed
brazzers yeah so that's that's a very
good question do we really need
retrospectives on a regular basis if
nothing new comes up and if we don't
find anything to to improve that is that
is a question I get all the time
actually
and also from some teams I think we a
really good team everything is going
well we don't really need to talk about
these things and it would be great if
that was the case and actually on
another note if we could stop having
retrospectives and people could just
talk to each other every day that'd be
great with me thanks but I think that in
most cases setting time to reflect on
what happened and to have an open
discussion about it actually make things
come out from under the carpet that they
wouldn't have thought about and yes you
can have some retrospectives where you
think nothing much got out of this but
then you could start doing different
things you could start saying well we
have we need to have a more narrow theme
of this retrospective then it's not just
about our performance or the process
maybe we should have retrospective
seemed about our communication within
our team we could have a positive
retrospective when we just look at all
the positive things that's a thing that
we often forget and I often forget to
mention is that one of the good things
about retrospective is to focus on the
things that went well and enforced those
things that go well why did this go so
well let's dive into the cautions behind
this and another thing also is
especially for Danes that giving each
other compliments all the time can be
read that's also a dating pattern that I
hadn't mentioned but giving compliments
is actually a good thing
acknowledging people for the work that
they do is a good thing and that is
something you could do in a
retrospective as well but if you think
that they go stale and you don't get
anything out of it go online and look
for different kinds of retrospectives
you could have a future spective talking
about the future instead so what are our
hopes and concerns
about this project that we're starting
right now we could have a six thinking
hats retrospectives where we wear funny
colored hats and now we're only talking
about hopes now we only talk about bad
things I think it's always a good idea
this your answer is yes but I would say
that will not because I do
retrospectives all the time with my kids
my husband my family myself everybody
who gets close to me will have a
retrospective afterwards any more
questions there's one down there I know
I'm between you and beer so I I'm aware
of that fact
hi sometimes doing retrospectives there
are a lot of things to talk about and
since we are on a limited time schedule
we really can't spend all day that so we
prioritize the things we talk about but
that leaves us with a lot of stuff that
fall between the chairs and then the
next retrospective the same thing how do
you tackle that mm-hmm thank you for the
question it's also a very interesting
question so I've got three different
parts of announcer for that first part
of that answer is it's always a problem
when I say right we're focusing on these
three things
I'm going to throw the rest away people
will be crying and screaming and I say I
want the post-it notes please let me
take notes no we'll throw it away
because I genuinely believe that it's
important to talk about what's important
to you right now and if it's still
important in two weeks it will pop up so
that's one answer I also acknowledge in
your question that's sometimes there are
the things that come up but they are
never chosen and there's a sort of a
legacy problem in the Democratic way
that we that we vote in the
retrospective which is that if we have
for instance just one tester one UX
expert then that vote doesn't count much
towards the other six that are only
interested in the built and what I do in
those circumstances is I sometimes I if
if I notice that that it's a recurring
problem it's hard to see just from one
retrospective but I first
as a recurring problem I say well you
have three votes for this kind of
problems and you have one vote for this
kind of problems to make sure that we
actually focus on that part of the
problem as well but of course you have
to be aware of what it is
did that answer your question sort of
yes if you just meet me at the meet the
speakers and follow up on it and I think
that time is run out hasn't it the
conference is over ladies and gentlemen
let's meet the speakers and PA out there
have fun please remember to vote oh yeah
please remember to vote yeah yeah thank
you I know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
