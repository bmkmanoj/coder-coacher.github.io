thanks a lot for coming we are requested
to give this talks in English and yeah
why are we here this is kick not is
sponsored by go to conferences and we
think go to and Gary for this but the
first talk is about how no sequel fits
in a polyglot persistence world so I
assume that you are already or know what
new sequel is so this is no introduction
if you just a few experiences from my
point of view but before we start and
I'm hope I'm loud enough so if anything
is unclear in the volume when feel free
to tell me so I'll ask just one
important dates we want to like to
mention of course in a few weeks in two
weeks we have one and a half weeks we
have we go to May and Copenhagen go two
and cue con to their interesting
international conferences I only can
recommend 30 first of May is martin
fowler and mr. sandal are presenting the
newest no in no sequel book i will just
come to that in a few seconds and then
12 jun we have a second event like this
hopefully if i can reserve this room
again so write it down again 12 jun gig
night number two here on agile and i
hope this might be also interesting for
you not with me but i'm sure with
interesting edgewise speakers and then
in october of course there's go to an oz
and if you can come meet us and talk to
us again ok let's start i wanted to give
a little introduction what happened in
no sequel what's interesting perhaps
what's funny and then a little overview
and issues written down in the abstract
yeah no secret is of course a success
story and you know why i just read about
the latest developer skills and we have
number seven head tube and the number
two we have MongoDB so we beat iOS and I
think it's a great achievement to beat
apple and iOS so everything is
increasing you don't need the charts but
if you want take it take a shot and you
can get of course the slides of course
if you want many interesting books will
come out of this book's is already out
from shutter and Parvati the first no
sequel book in english from wheelie
publishers we have soon several
databases in several weeks weeks I think
it's not out we'll take a few months
more and as I just mentioned Martin
Fowler is no dealing with no sequel and
if Martin Fowler is writing about her
secret must be serious stuff of course
but I think mr. Sandler cheese doing the
real work and if you want to see him and
if you want it and if you want to meet
him then come to Hamburg and I'll talk
to him and enjoy his talk so many
interesting applications that came out
we have reddish 2.6 as almost I think a
week away i think the Redis cluster will
come head up 1.0 Cassandra 1.1 MongoDB
in a super interesting version with mms
react 1.1 of course interesting stuff
and to me most interesting is we have
more than a thousand hosting services
and no sequel and and I come to this at
the end of this talk no sequel is
getting a platform as a service standard
and this is very important what I think
so we are acting if you're using your
secret databases or if you're developing
with those no syncopated databases
you're acting in a 14 billion dollar
market this is what the latest research
says up to 2,000 18 18 so scalability is
everywhere and I think we're sure we
have another interesting talks on this
one funny thing I don't want to miss to
mention is last summer orica gave a lot
of talks and one talk was by Thomas
Cooley on he said no to no sequel so
what did he say last summer he was
saying in a white paper called the bank
the no sequel hype no sequel as a hype
of course and we'll see what you are
saying is no sequel is something like an
ice cream store with new flavors popping
out every month but don't get too
attractive these flavors may not be
around for too long so what is this is
full of course what the big guys have to
say Oracle we want to say are eager
don't stick to no sequel it's all the
flavor and it will vanish soon so what
happened a few months later a few months
later we saw Oracle integrating head
loop and Claudia so call no sequel stuff
into their big data appliance and
releasing the Oracle no sequel database
which is a little bourke ad be reloaded
but at Edison interesting product so
they totally went the other direction
and if you're watching the industry you
see that hybrid solutions are popping
out everywhere Microsoft is integrating
it into the server windows azure are all
integrating Hadoop sybase greenplum and
all the others they are jumping on the
train to two interesting things that
happen in the no sequel market I want to
mention because I think they will blow
away a lot of products or at least share
still a lot of market shares the first
is of course the launch of Amazon
DynamoDB if you have not taken a look on
it please do so formerly I think you
know at the i vs you know they had
simple DB but i think with the launch of
amazon DynamoDB simple simply be use
will decline and what this is they as
you know they had papers published in
2005 seven but now they're released
their infrastructure you can use it as a
database as a service solution and it's
very interesting why because it's real
strong databases
solution I made the interesting things
yellow so perhaps try to read them fast
it's based on SSDs so what I try to do
is make random excess very very fast and
minimize the latency as we will see in
the next slide no maintenance window
which is also interesting for me for all
the others who know AWS know that there
are sometimes maintenance window
synchronous availability zone
replication possible backup and restore
unto es 3 with one click and 40 million
requests per month free so you can start
right java ruby and all the other code
against it for free and if you have
every business running of course they
want to earn money with you but what
they tried this was for me interesting
to minimize the latency because this is
the problem the same as for example
database calm from salesforce also has
if the database servers are not at the
same location is your normal server then
you might have a network problem so what
you must do is minimize the natan see
and the numbers they have these are some
statistics which have been done is quite
good so far an interesting monetizing
model which is a little based on the
right sort of course much more expensive
because we're writing on SSDs and as you
know rights are more costly on SSDs then
reads and yeah a lot of more stuff I
want to dig very much into it you can
easily try it out on Amazon AWS just
click through it and then create your
data or create your model fire in about
five to six seven five five to ten
languages against it you have a rest api
and yeah you can develop using eclipse
as you know surely if you develop a
services and everything is fine except a
few obstacles like a data limit you
don't have if you use other solutions
like Cassandra or reoccur a little
typing problems might be and the API is
not so good and we need some D's else I
think for a wonderful interaction with
this service yesterday I saw that a new
book came out it's free to buy on Amazon
you can read it on kinder and in the web
so might be interesting for you just
came out yesterday the second
interesting thing is SI p Hannah of
course and I'm often asked about more
information of ASAP hana but i always
have to say i don't have much
information about it because SI p is not
releasing much information but at least
we have an expert here in the second row
so if you have more questions about this
ask him it's an in-memory database for
analytics and I hope they offer more
information it talks something like SQL
and mdx perches on all up language and
then a lot of optimizations and it's
also saving so to disk and storing on
columns so the general architecture
doing everything in line and then
starring to disk with snapshots and
logging is quite different to what
rather sore MongoDB is doing but of
course it's for analytics and based on
column on a columnar DBS so a little
differences here and yeah did I forget
something yeah of course distributed it
she had nothing architecture and yeah I
mentioned almost everything so this is
quite important stuff I think which
happened in 2012 and let's move on I'm
asking often asked for people who are
not so deeply into no sequel about the
whys of no SQL give me a checklist what
to look when to use phone no SQL and I
wrote it down for you 10 points we can
pass them quickly and then
move on to me of course why i like i
love no secret is because no sakura
specialization and my strong
recommendation to you is to look at the
new sequel tapes com here's about 20-30
videos in there real interesting videos
where you can learn a lot about the
architecture perhaps here on any grass
with dynamo and rear architecture and
consisting hashing architecture this is
basic stuff you need to know and you
want to see when dealing with no signal
so yeah the interesting thing is what to
look for and the two years ago we had
vana focus here from amazon and he was
talking about what they did three four
five seven years ago and they were
seventy percent busy with scaling ver
staff and thirty percent busy with doing
their business and of course this is the
wrong way it should be the other way
around seventy percent business and
thirty percent scaling so what they did
is and this is the first recommendation
out of 50 recommendations i have for you
later is look at your data what is your
data requiring requiring and what do you
need what is your query for example so
we looked at their data and they saw
seventy percent is only key value XS
perhaps it's a bit high for amazon if
you're another business the ratio might
be might be different but if you have
seventy percent he value excess like
amazon has and twenty percent singer
table and only ten percent of joint
stuff then the big oracle or relation to
hammer might not be the right solution
well so what you see here is that you
need several solutions you need
something like polyglot positions you
need a solution for this and your leader
for solution for this let's call it
complicated stuff at the end so what
happened we had the big data explosion
and
any no secret no secret solutions popped
up as DynamoDB here and all the models
you already know gravity base will be
here to stay Microsoft is even playing
it with a releasing and graph database
key value document and big tables
columnar table salsa and so on so the
80's 90's everything was simple we need
to save space we need that's where we
need a relational model we have a hammer
everything into one database and we
scale up not scale out so everything was
fine so first reason of course your
personal check list is we have big data
terabyte petabytes simple scale out
needed and often people tell me our big
data this is all this is all hype
ninety-nine percent of the companies
they don't have big data but this is not
my experience I'm often do income
consultancy in western Germany about
data databases and at least half of the
companies they're telling me we're
interacting with the user we need to
check the lock data as we need to make
all up and predictions on the lock data
we need to do machine learning and those
we need to know what the next step of
the user is and we have to do with such
huge data amounts so that big data is
real easy there so don't get confused if
someone tells you a big data is just a
hyper it's not a hype it's already there
and with the sensors in the next years
it'll be there when the next is massive
right performance or right right
availability so if you look like funny
companies like Google for example here
in Berlin we're under the top 10 in
facebook for facebook games and they
need massive right performance right
availability and they also have a look
on putting a specific data into a new
sequence or notions of course we need
sub-second responses we all are used to
it when we acting in the web creating
filters or something like that we want
to have subjective responses fast you
value access and we come to this later
you've see a million companies here
which need fast p value excess and i
show you some examples later in detail
while number five is a flexible schema
flexible data types if you talk to the
industry you hear more and more that
alter table and shut down for three
hours so a maintenance window is not
possible we can't do it so there must be
a workaround we must be able to handle
flexible schema and perhaps pushing some
problems to a higher level but if you
have good strategies in schema design
and schema handling then you can solve
all the problems I'm sure of data easier
maintainability administration
operations for example hyuga again one
game or one game in the early stage is
just to Redis instances with two
replicas and that's it so they have we
have some clever tricks and some
specific requirements for their games
they're doing in facebook and of course
no single point of failure up 24-7 just
relates to the earlier point these are
numbers what happens if google amazon
and you are yahoo are out for one minute
but these are the numbers from 2008 so
I'm sure you can put a 0 here at the end
to to get a feeling for what the loss is
if these companies if their service is
not working for one hour parameters of
use of course so something like auto
scaling production scaling from the
start rest interfaces easy installations
ati's and of course monitoring and we
come to operational issues in few slides
and the last one point I'm attend for me
is changing cap needs I hope you all
know the cap theorem it's well known but
it's a little more difficult but this is
another talk many customers tell me at
the beginning of the discussions that
customers tell me of course we need acid
and we have the most terrible queries in
the world so and if you then
discuss with them and analyze you you
you often see that that they had a
relational database they're hammering
something in of course and if they
hammered something in and everything is
normalized of course then they need
sophisticated Curtis but it doesn't have
to be so if you can reinvent your
persistence layer you're in a good
position and possibly can split areas
between this and of course you have to
think of your consistency models because
there are 10 20 30 consistency models
out there you have to keep in mind when
looking at your data so we have over
twenty two databases at least a 140
databases on my web page no secret
database dot org which is the most
popular list of no secure databases in
the world and what we are doing at what
we often recommend is the following what
you should do and what we should do is
value these solutions look whether what
are the advantages their disadvantages
they're typically use cases the typical
access patterns and then draw something
like some spider drear diagrams from it
so make an evaluation of these databases
this evaluation is about half a year and
old a field but it might be still a
little village to look what you need
here on the right-hand side and what
could be the best no sequel database on
on this side here this last is elastic
search and then you get a little further
but this is not the ultimate step so
what you do is my recommendation and I
hope you haven't seen this slide still
is I worked a lot and this is a little
my research on these these are up to 50
criterias you have to have a look on
when deciding for the right database so
please read it fast I'm sure you can
have a look at it first you should
analyze your data we had this before
when looking at the Amazon case what is
your data
crying for shouting for which data
storage model you need what types had
specific issues what kind of acid versus
base or a mixture mixture do you need of
I'm sure you all know acid basis base
all your cap decisions what are your
typical requirement so yeah I already
talked about this everyone is telling ya
we need SFO asset of course but yes we
added a cache layer and the replication
layer a few months ago because we needed
to be faster and so the thing about true
acid is becoming a little sloppy and
things have to be read as cast that is
the performance dimension analyzes so
latency request behavior if you want to
scare up scan out current requirements
as I say what I've see in the industry
is they are hammering everything into
relational databases I've seen even even
graph data hammered into a normalized
model and then they're wondering why
they need such sophisticated queries and
why this will not perform the
architecture the data access patterns
are very very important point and a lot
of non functional requirements of course
if I go into a company mostly the first
thing what they're telling me is here we
have an Oracle contract for the next
three years so yeah we should use it
let's think about it later this is water
here in consulting all other things as
company restrictions there are always
people telling you to databases three
different databases no it's not possible
so we have a big bunch of trade-offs in
this area this is here for the old
relational word renormalized acid CA vs
AP in the cap theorem scale up scale out
or link alike queries SQL or some kind
of limited gravities but the discussion
has to go much much deeper and I do this
with the customers for example what is
better should you use a consistent
hashing architecture or use a shower
in architecture because bows can have
its pros and cons it's really hard to
find out what is better here some say
consistent hashing is always better but
I don't believe this perhaps in most
cases but not always so some words on
operations and no sequel a few years ago
we had some problems with operations
because the tools were not good and the
older slides are always showed the case
I don't know if you know the foursquare
case perhaps you know the Foursquare
service I haven't tried it out on your
mobile phone it's like cool locations &amp;amp;
tinis can take those locations and
Twitter about it hey this is cool to eat
cool to dance I don't know very
impressive service and what they did is
they took some easy to note and if
you're using in memory operations and
not monitoring good enough then someday
things will crash somewhere so no secret
had a problem there because the
monitoring and all the things you need
to keep things and productions were not
available the way you like it this is
all an example for mongodb because I
started here with problems and the
failures of MongoDB but nowadays it's
gone better because the industry jumped
of it you have LMX you simply can
register and get monitoring statistics
out of the clouds for free there are a
lot of services by other vendors like
chef and puppet and monitoring as a
server as their server densities offer
so that thousand services where you can
really ensure that things will work
properly but you can go on and I often
had some discussions I had one time a
discussion with any grass because he
says operational customs everything so
what react for example is saying of
course that you need a consistent
hashing architecture because everything
is distributed equally you have a
replication instances here and you will
have no problems with this kind of
or less problems then when using
different architectures like used in
MongoDB or reddit but the next step
where I predict where it will go to will
be not only here using those api's those
monitoring at the server's the next step
will be the No ops will be that you are
using all this in the cloud if it fits
your model meaning if you have a look at
the platform as a service models today
for example Cloud Foundry openshift
cloud here will COO I'm sure you you're
all familiar with these
platform-as-a-service cool then you see
this is your stack and you simply drop
these services in you have a free amount
try amount of dealing with it and then
yeah you have your system up and running
and it scares automatically I don't know
if it fits your need but this is the way
it goes no operations so my
recommendation to you is of course check
hybrid solutions as I said when looking
in the industry what they're doing is
they're starting with relational
databases without thinking about the
data models about the query needs a tip
about the data access patterns and about
all the stuff and they then they see at
first are we getting too slow then we're
adding memcache later and running again
on all these problems these companies
usually have so two examples what you
see in the industry are these mixed
polyglot solutions for example this is
Instagram you are no Instagram was hot
and you in the media what they're using
is for one part of their data postgresql
SQL the s3 services for the above data
of course for the images and then
they're using Raiders because you can
read this
yeah because it fits it has quick key
value look up it's a memory is
persistent and so you segment your data
and yeah this is one solution Instagram
you have many other solutions Pinterest
is very very popular I don't know if you
have seen it and they are using these
polyglot architectures using about two
to three databases and each data gets
its best fit in a database so but to
conclude a little the world is a little
more complicated unfortunately and I
don't know if you have seen this picture
before from the 54 451 group it shows
the state of the database word now and
as you can see here this is a new secret
area with key value staff big tables
document databases graph databases we
have the old relational world here with
ya you know these names this is the
analytic part my sequels here then the
rear operational not analytic part here
and then a complete new area is coming
out new sequel I will also talk on this
get into the steep on go to Copenhagen
you sequel a lot of databases where they
said okay it's true the relational world
has a scaling problem let's do something
about it right new databases is I don't
know what they be data's calm and nuodb
all this stuff and this is really
interesting hot stuff if you need essing
net sequel and farrell the relational
model and a lot of more databases but
this is the complex state of the world
and it will explode more and more
nothing will vanish like in programming
languages where we are still dealing
with photon and COBOL so this this will
explode and explode so conclusion though
there's no one perfect solutions check
out hybrid and polyglot solutions
sure we will hear more about polyglot
solutions and new sequel is the new way
to go this is my rock recommendation
okay yeah to conclude I want to announce
again these two conferences they go to
conference has fantastic speakers here
like Andy grosse pte tested our crest
from from sweden who really wrote a cool
database rich Hickey you know perhaps
the closer creator many other saboteurs
and filippo the Redis author and this is
no sequel metas it's in Colonia in two
weeks we have discount codes for all
these conferences so if you want to have
a discount codes to visit these
conferences so torturous and we give you
these discount codes okay after these
free talks we would like to invite you
to have a free beer in I don't know it's
the sugarhill it's right across taking
up ok classes so only two minutes away
from here you're invited I would be
happy if you talk to us and having a
little fun in the evening so thanks for
listening contact me and have a nice
evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
