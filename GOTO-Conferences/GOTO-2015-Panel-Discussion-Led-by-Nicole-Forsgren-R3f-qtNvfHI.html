speakers one question for everyone
quickly what's the biggest challenge
you've seen in implementing lean it's it
am I on come on hello yep just get the
volume right and so you know right the
last two weeks I've just spent traveling
around the world talking to financial
institutions one in Africa one in
Ireland one in the UK and first thing is
the ego everyone's like where a bank but
we're highly regulated regulated but
we're a real company you know Aunt Em it
dis is true and like it's absolutely
true and and the challenge I say to them
is ok we can sit here and complain about
how difficult it is to do something
let's just do that or we can sit here
and raise all the objections that you
can think of as to why we can't do
something or we can pick one thing
something very small and focus on trying
to have an impact on that and finding
out if we can move the needle if we can
actually achieve some success and let's
run an experiment at that level and get
some momentum and get moving and that
normally makes them go they check their
behavior they stop saying it but we're
so different it's too tough they stop
raising objections and they flip to
think about what is something small they
could do so I'd really recommend that
would be a tactic to try ok
yeah yeah yeahs you go all right hello
um i would think that there's a couple
one is leadership interest in doing it
and not really understanding what lean
really is but i would like to talk for
just a few seconds about the other one
which is that a lot of people view lean
as this process design strategy and
while it is that and you have to do that
in order to get to the end it really is
about a people development strategy and
it's really about getting everyone that
is doing the work to be recognized as
the experts in the work and helping
design improvements and that type of
thing and I think Toyota has been pretty
quick to say you know we don't build
automobiles we build people and we're
really just understanding the degree to
which people development is important
and teaching problem-solving acumen
across the organization is that's a core
of lean so a lot of people think is just
about process design and that's like
this much of lean okay this one yeah so
are you know Netflix is pretty lean in
terms of how we operate right every
microservice team pushes when they want
to they develop you don't really know
that they've changed something you just
happen to pick up their jar when you
build so I think I'm actually seeing the
inverse of it a little bit which is the
teams tend to be Saudi couple then the
tasks tend to be small enough that
there's such local ownership then when
it comes time to actually do projects
that have to span many teams that muscle
isn't flex much anymore so I think once
people step all the way into lean
they're going to find that as they're
leaning in no pun intended they're
they're going to find that running a
large project that actually requires a
lot of coordination can be very
challenging and sometimes that hits us
do you know if there are any big
challenges what they just do it yeah
well particularly have the hs2 thing but
I've been talking to other companies
that are going through this kind of
challenges and this there's there's this
this bunch of drivers for this but if
you think about a lot of time they call
it the digital transformation that sort
of that sort of a shorthand buzzword
that the the sort of CIO will will
generally have heard of because that's
kind of how they talk about at that
level and one of the things that's
driving this is you know maybe per
customer the amount of information per
customer that you're
assessing you know tip check everyone
has some kind of customers maybe goes
off by an order of thousands so as
having just a little bit of information
that you base your business off and you
work against the big averages you build
products that are very averaged across
where you think your customers are now
you have lots of very specific
information about that particular
customer you've got a mobile app so
you've got interactions with particular
people so it's not just knee remote I
own a bank branch and people come in and
take money out every now and again
they're interacting with you at a much
different level that's driving a lot of
the sort of well how do we deal with
this and how do and then they look out
at the companies that have figured out
how to deal with these high volumes of
interactions which are the large-scale
web companies and then they're trying to
copy that so this is the driver of
top-down you see the executives quite
often get we need to do all of these
things and lean as part of it agile as
part of it DevOps cloud there are these
rural pieces of that of their response
to doing that and then when you get down
to the the bottom level quite off the
engineers overall quieting your gung-ho
to go and try this stuff and then
somewhere in the middle there's this
middle management right that there are
that they own a process or they own
something or there or they kind of get a
bit set in their ways and what I often
see is that's the challenge is is
bringing that middle tier of management
and it practices because they're worried
about their going to be reorganized and
will I still have a job and all that
kind of stuff but the individual
engineers usually get it and the high
level management quite over increasingly
getting it and are trying to push it
down I think what's happening generally
is they're picking a team if you look at
the like the Nordstrom example from
DevOps Enterprise summit is a good one
they had one team that went and just
went very deep to go deep with a team
you figure it out then you do it with
another team you keep doing these teams
one at the time the original Netflix
transition to cloud look that that is
that as well we took one team at a time
and we kind of got them over the hump to
figure out what was this new thing they
were playing with okay so now we'll go
to some of the audience questions for
Barry is it a contradiction to be big
while also having a lot of smaller ideas
and big as in a big company oh ok ok so
i can think of an example at Google is
that a big company
okay and if I go to Google Labs and look
at the kind of things that they're doing
in there are the kind of things that
they launched about how they fight find
these next big things like think gmail
is another good example of that right
the end and probably Labs is the
equivalent of maybe their alpha phase
right because stuff is happening that we
don't even know about they're
experimenting in their horizon three
that we just don't know about it's only
when they start to get some confidence
and they'll start to show that out right
so it's one thing to be a big company
yes always keep thinking big but as we
said and even Dan kicked off the whole
agile pieces in the 90s we were thinking
big and doing big projects and we know
where that goes like you know I think
that conversation needs to be put down I
think all the fantastic work and kyle's
done to show that these things don't
work you know so we need to apply a
different strategy you need to think big
you need to learn fast you know you need
to start today think of those small
little things you can do to test and
experiment with customers what's going
to work make your business successful
tomorrow and it's the problem right this
most execs are sill and teams are
trapped in think big build big big big
big big big big money you know everyone
loves on my budget my budget's 100
million how much is yours like this is
the planning process right this is what
happens in annual budgeting cycles I go
in I won 100 million Karen's like he's
going to say 100 so I'd better say 120
nicole's like well I'm going to go 150
and then we'll all make it open while
you a dance and whoever's got the best
presentation and the deck and whatever
it is and like this is lunacy it's
absolute lunacy you know take a dollar
go test some stuff out you know and
unlike these are the things that matter
right and we need to get into this
mindset and I see only way you're going
to achieve high performance and you're
going to stay relevant and stay alive
thank you okay for Karen if I asked my
boss he'd say that everything we do ads
customer value how do we actually
determine what does add customer value
good question um
so there's a couple different ways one
is talking to customers and asking it's
a long art that isn't always done and so
asking customers if you can get direct
access to them is one way another way is
to wear their shoes you just learn how
to walk in other people's shoes and and
you know take take your developer hat
off and put your customer hat on and and
imagine being that person so imagination
can carry you a bit as well the other
thing is is that there's always a
financial kind of a game we play when
we're mapping where we say if the
customer knew the incremental cost of
this activity would they be willing to
pay the incremental cost of it or would
they rather have it taken out and so
that's another way that you can kind of
you know think through whether or not
the customer is likely going to value
something is by putting a monetary value
on it even though it's it's kind of a
fake game but it is a way that you're
able to get clearer on customer value I
hope that in whoever asked that if we
can always talk a little more drink
break and lunch in things like that
stoom okay Coburn yeah is there any
difference between so-called Bluegreen
deployment and Netflix is red black not
familiar with blue green I'm just mr.
red black totally different colors there
are different colors that's not really
the only difference so someone might
have does anybody have this joy skills
just just yeah it's just two colors okay
Kenny to kellis doesn't matter okay I am
kind of questioned for a dream as a
venture capitalist now how do you use
agile lean and rugged concepts but
particularly lean because we know it's
the best and the best track here do you
use these concepts as you evaluate
potential investment opportunities
nothing so what do you use when you
evaluate potential investment
opportunities it's take notes kids think
about that and there's a process it goes
through but it's it's a fairly
lightweight process and it kind of
depends on the size of the deal so I
guess you could say it's sort of
it's not a one-size-fits-all all right
so if somebody is doing a good seed deal
for for a few hundred thousand dollars
then there's a much less oversight much
less the whole company doesn't have to
be involved there's an accelerated
process the simple peut you make it
lightweight small that's two small beds
right but there's lots of small bets and
you're sort of averaging across those
small bets but we wear a there are lots
of different kinds of VC firms right the
battery is a full spectrum firm so we do
100 k 2 100 million if we're putting a
hundred million into something as a huge
amount of diligent okay there's a lot of
people looking at it for a long time to
decide it's usually a pre-ipo around or
something like a very late stage round
so we do do those and we yeah we will go
and talk to everybody we will find
customers that use this technology and
talk to them about how much you
expecting to spend over the next few
years on it try and validate all the
assumptions and the business model
that's an enormous under research goes
into so it tries to try to make that
scale with the size of the deal that
there were into I guess that's thank you
okay more questions for Barry what's the
biggest challenge you see in breaking
through barriers the old way of thinking
what's the best trick or a trick you've
been able to suggest that people use
like your mindset is is a big challenge
right but I think this is where i talk a
huge amount about helping people go
through an experience to break their
model a great example is we were working
with a very large telecommunications
company in Australia and we were doing
this sort of customer journey mapping
talking to people to understand what
some of the challenges people were
facing with about trying to get a phone
just try to get a phone setup and we're
presenting this back to the leadership
team and they're just like nope no
that's not that's not the way the
process works nope I designed it works
liked it you know that's wrong so the
task we set them was this we all gave
them all credit cards we put them in a
room for 30 minutes and we told them to
go and buy a phone
so they learned pretty quickly they
experienced their mental model changed
because they had an experience of what
it was like so that's the thing I often
try to do as a trick is create an
experience where people can go and see
an experience what it's like for
customer another party and make that
happen do we need that magician from
last night yeah that's it just just to
tie that back to some experience at
Netflix at some point at one point there
was like free netflix accounts for
employees make sure they took it away so
we're going to give you some dollars
every year which you're supposed to use
to buy some netflix we want everyone at
nephews to go through the customer
signup process with a real credit card
and go through the billing process and
actually live it for real and then
you're free to just not even have a
netflix account Mary care but but then
that so that was one side and the other
one is that every staff meeting at the
beginning you go around the room and say
so what have you watched on TV recently
alright and there will be no 10 minutes
are now along this meeting would be
people talking about content and it runs
its its problem is the company exists to
provide this content so it gets you
oriented around the fact that the value
is you know the enjoyment of content and
people would just talk about what they'd
watched and what they thought Elise it's
not all just on Netflix but stuff they'd
found anywhere and people be swapping
ideas about things to watch so making
you know the product of the company and
this is technically still at the cloud
this is the cloud platform team talking
about which what you know the latest
show that they're watching right so
bringing you your your sort of mindset
to what is the actual value that you're
providing is important so we have doctor
who right we have follow-on for Coburn
what is red black what is red black so
it's just the term we use when we're
going to roll on a new version of the
code and then we'll gently roll traffic
over to the new version of the code in
the auto scaling group and if there's a
problem we'll roll back so which one's
red which one's black I always get this
wrong that's the ultimate touch I think
they just alternate I mean people don't
actually mean after you do it once so
you know once every day you don't really
have a revenue that's just modeled
cycled I knew it could be one into right
so we don't use that's why you don't use
it that much as a
we just do push so I'm going to give you
another one are you tied to AWS or would
it be easy for you guys to move to azure
google compute we have a button no we're
pretty invested in amazon today they're
an excellent partner for us because we
got in early we leverage a lot of their
services right so we use ec2 SQ SSNs SES
you know s 3 RDS EMR there's a lot of
services that i think the other vendors
don't necessarily provide at the stage
that we think amazon still sufficiently
ahead of the game and we have some
relationship or we can help drive
through our platform and open source we
can drive better adoption and get the
features we want to some degree so in
the near term there's no plans to really
look at other cloud vendors but you know
if amazon overnight went out of business
or something we'd probably have to pivot
pretty quickly and figure out how to get
that to run somewhere else but we're
hoping that's not going to happen okay I
think it's also a matter of scale of the
scale netflix is at i don't think any of
the other clouds could actually take it
even quite a long time ago i was talking
to somebody from rackspace inc and we
run our ex mrs. like is how many
machines are they yeah we can't do them
because i thought so you get into that
you can't fit my i call it like you come
you want to be a small fish in a big
pond for to get the statistical
averaging to work so that you can scale
and it does look elastic if the ponds
big enough it looks like as big as the
ocean right if you're a small fish but
if you're a shark in a paddling pool
head sticking out one end you know it's
not good right so you can you have to be
there have been times at netflix where
we were very much dominant users of a
feature and every time we twitch that
feature broke right so that those tried
to stop using those features or
encourage lots of other people to use
those features by doing open source
tools so that was one of the reasons for
having the open-source platforms to get
more people using auto scaling or
whatever feature that we thought we were
up we were like one of the dominant
users of so i think that there is a
problem in that netflix is just small
enough to fit on AWS and AWS is sort of
make sure it's big enough to run netflix
and you know and then if netflix AWS has
to keep growing fast
for the netflix to continue to stay to
still fit inside that platform okay
question for Karen how does value stream
mapping relate to agile we're agile
significantly limits the degree of
upfront clarifying of what the customer
needs in order to get irate work faster
yeah so there's clarification and then
there's clarification so when you're
going through small iterations you still
have to be crystal clear about what
you're doing for that small iteration so
what when I talk about lack of clarity
it's when the clarity that people need
to do the work no matter how big or
small it is just not there and you have
to work to get that clarity to get to
the next level now it may be very well
designed that you're only going to get
to that next level and then you're going
to figure out where you go from there as
in rapid iteration um but you still have
to be clear when you start that cycle or
people will waste time and get
frustrated give anything else you want
to say about clarity no no but and like
in terms of value stream mapping it's a
fantastic to like yeah we use it a lot
when we're helping people build
continuous livery pipelines hey you know
and and it's a great way to sort of
follow the follow the work right through
the whole organization but understanding
who you are getting your current
condition but don't forget you need to
also set a target condition that you're
trying to work towards and focus on the
target condition and experiments to get
to it not just do a map and then chase
down all the waste on stuff because
that's yeah you just don't do it that
way to out of the audience two hits does
a value here actually creates a value
stream for what they're building a few
of you just a few of you so it's
something you think you're going to go
back and try and figure out is that just
look okay people kind of seen the seeing
the value of value stream mapping a bit
recursive here well well so there's the
value stream itself is one thing that
the Wadley map is got this extra thing
which you should take all the things in
your value stream and you try to figure
out where they are where they're evolved
to are they an agile thing that needs to
be created from scratch is it a sort of
a lean best in class but i'll probably
buy it as a SAS product or I'll download
one of the many open-source projects
that does that but
have to build it myself and on the right
hand side you've got the things that are
just commoditize where you can buy this
exactly the same thing from 10 different
vendors right now it's new you can buy a
Pentium chip in a box from 10 different
vendors you don't have to go and sort of
custom build your own chip architectures
right so there's those things where it's
really commoditized so understanding
wearing your value chain different
things appear is important and they
varies a lot by industry you know people
usually draw power in the bottom right
corner with your Tesla it's on the left
side right they invented a new power
plug for superchargers you know there's
a whole bunch of really interesting new
stuff happening in empower delivery but
only if you're doing electric cars right
if you're just plugging machines in in a
data center that's not very not a
particularly interesting area so this is
actually an interesting follow-on
question it came under karen but i think
all of us can maybe kind of address this
people are willing to pay for quality
software in the mobile space the
opposite seems to be true why do you
think so sorry um in the mobile space
the answer seems to be true yeah in
mobile yeah people don't seem to be
willing to pay for software they just
want a free download on their phone why
do you think this is so from a customer
perspective from a customer perspective
no one wants to like I'm not gonna I
rarely pay for anything that I can get
on my phone I want all of my phone
software to be free I pay for no ads
that's interesting yeah okay and yeah so
carriages said I'll pay for no ads pay
for new it I will sometimes pay for no
ass yeah it's it's interesting but it's
for my point of view I probably would
take that as a product manager type
approach like what what's the benefits
of a freemium model like LLC what's up
you have to pay a dollar right so they
did that to get some money to test if
people would use it or not and you know
I constantly get asked this question
when people are trying to develop their
business models about how they will
generate the revenue from it and that's
that's probably one of the most profound
questions like as a customer you that's
what you probably see right do I have to
pay a dollar is it free how am I going
to generate
revenue if I'm a marketing company for
instance like Google and Facebook who
are just a marketing company you know
they are going to extract value from you
as a customer in a different way they
are going to take all your data and use
it to leverage in for businesses to sell
to you and so you know from a customer
perspective there's a whole other side
to this to say would I pay for security
of my data would i pay for anonymity of
what I do and what I do on the internet
so it's a very complex thing from a
customer side but when I talk to
businesses they're the kind of questions
I ask them what's their revenue model
how do they plan to grow where did they
see success for this as a product as
they go but from a customer ID ask you
that question and if you're just like I
want something free to play with okay
but you're also paying a cost at some
level whether you're aware of it or not
so maybe just be a bit more deliberate
when you think about that suppose as a
customer that's what I do and and it's
important right these these things are
important they're the issues of our age
your anonymity how you care about your
own information who gets that
information and how its leveraged for
you if you want to give your stuff
marketing companies that's your choice
fine for free um you know I think
another consideration is even free apps
if they're crappy free apps people don't
want to use them and so there's still
quality determinants even in the free
space and so it's just really a matter
of getting to understand your customer
and deciding which business you want to
be in which which market do you want to
go after I mean there are very
thoughtful decisions to be made in the
business strategically on you know we're
not going to have low-cost software
where does not we're going to we're
going to go into the upper echelon space
and and then there's the opposite and
then there's everything in between and
so I think that there's in each in a
level that you're at whatever the cost
is there's still a quality component
that you have to be focused on and
that's that's where that quality
differentiation comes in
Tim I guess that's a function of the
playground right i mean when you think
about if mobile devices hadn't evolved
we would have the same game going on
your laptop and you would want just as
many free apps but I mean how many apps
are there in the App Store now like
500,000 or something yeah it's
ridiculous yeah or awesome yeah it's
kind of like the pic paywalled websites
is sort of the desktop version of that
yes tonight there's I think you just
talk forever about business models for
companies right that's one of the one of
the big topics and when we're trying to
figure out startup site so there's a
couple of things to just think about if
you're selling into the enterprise IT
space in particular which is where I
focus a lot of my time you've got to
decide early on whether you're going to
be selling to the CIO in the op site
which means you end up doing a few large
deals and you tend to about higher
enterprise sales type people and and you
know you can make good business there
and you generally get cash positive
fairly early but you end up with a
relatively limited market because you
end up in up to 14 1000 and then you
start having trouble finding more
customers the other way is to go to the
developer viral approach where you
basically say I'm not going to charge
anything for this it's going to be free
for developers and i'm just going to
flood the developer space until every
developer has this and then the cios
will end up buying support or something
or something you'll monetize it in some
way later on when it's very hard to do
both of those who have to kind of pick
one and for that you typically need your
money need more money because you make
let you make your revenue less later you
make your revenue later in the process
but because you've got such a bigger
market of an adoption you tend to make
more later so it's a sort of a sharper
hockey stick right it's flat for a long
time but if you win you win bigger then
if you do something that's selling to
enterprise we're both a viable but
you've got to be clear what you're doing
on which one you're trying to do very
good okay I don't see any other
questions coming in so I think we're
good thank you very much to all of our
speakers it's lunchtime
