to have an extend man from Kelowna and
Eric has been working without Lange and
it's VM for a long time he got his PhD
on with work on airline compilation then
he went and worked with Scala for a
while but he returned to his roots a few
years ago
he's been the CTO at Kelowna for several
years and now he's the chief scientist
and I believe he's writing a book on the
topic he's going to tell us all about so
Eric okay yes so topic is the airline
virtual machine and I don't work for
Oracle's I don't have this fancy
disclaimer but you know the talks that I
like the most are the ones where people
have opinions and they probably wrong
but at least they're engaged and and say
their opinion and that's that's always
very fun or they show you lots of code
and we managed to get it just right
so you can follow all the code except
that new thing that he shows you and you
get AHA that was great and unfortunately
I'm not an opinionated man and I'm going
to talk about the virtual machine and
not show you that much code so probably
today's most boring talk so there are
some other talks right now where you can
learn how to use your keyboard shortcuts
and so on that's great you should know
how to use them but knowing how to use
your keyboard shortcut is not going to
make you the most productive programmer
what really matters for you to become
successful or productive is how you
think when I was seventeen I am 23
States I'm from Sweden
I'm from somewhere North in Sweden
haparanda it's close to the Arctic
Circle
and I went as an exchange student to the
California for one year I could speak
English before I went there but when I
started speaking English every day
in every situation after a while I
started thinking in English and I
suddenly realized that I had become
stupid not because you're stupid because
you're thinking English but because my
vocabulary was limited and my grasp of
the language was so limited so I could
only think limited thought it was
terrible but after I had started
thinking in English I could couldn't
stop so I I was stupid for a year in the
States but it was fun anyway that's I
guess the way you should should be but I
learned lesson from that and that is the
language that you're using affects how
you think and this goes for programming
languages also so imagine that you meet
some MBA guys that have this brilliant
idea and you decide to form a startup
we're going to build a web service
fantastic so you build a web service and
you start getting some traffic getting
profit so this is the traffic at
different dates and then suddenly this
happens it's Christmas and your traffic
doubles in a very short time so this is
a really exciting time for a new startup
to meet its first Christmas and then
next year it doubles again and next year
it doubles again and now it's starting
to get ridiculous
really ridiculous and after a while
you're pretty happy that your services
are still up and running after this so
this was two years ago last year the
graph went up the same way and this year
we're expecting this happen again so
this is what success looks like this is
actual transaction statistics from
clarinha and we were pretty happy you
remember that little bump there that was
when the traffic doubled for the first
time it looked really scary so in my
abstract and and young also said that we
had exponential drugs and this is the
business hand-wavy exponential growth
this is of course only polynomial but
let's call it exponential growth yeah so
in the beginning happy days when this
happens ate Spain so if you want to
build a scalable web service and you
want to do it in a language which help
you scale and that's of course a like
surprise
so what Alan gives you is fault tolerant
maintainable and scalable and I'm not
going to bash other languages here the
previous speaker did that pretty well
but there's things in other languages
that makes them less fault tolerant
maintainable and scalable so why is a
line fault tolerance well this was
basically what the designers of Erlang
wanted from the beginning this was back
in the 80s at Ericsson when Ericsson
suddenly realized that
80% of their budgets for new system was
not hardware as they used to think but
actually software and then you have to
build reliable hardware but how would
they build reliable software so they
decided to investigate this and tried to
find out ways to build reliable software
and the computer science lab at Ericsson
came up with a line that was designed to
build fault tolerant software by having
the right concurrency model and doing
error and exception handling the right
way and providing libraries for the
really hard stuff and I'm going to talk
about all these things in detail along
is also maintainable so one reason for
this is it's dynamically typed we're
going to see that dynamically type might
not be something that you think about
making a language maintainable but it
also enables a lot of things in the
virtual machine that makes it
maintainable and you have symbolic and
transparent data structures so all the
data in your system you can look at at
any time and see exactly what they look
like in a symbolic way and there's an
interactive shell and adding is scalable
so this is the thing that's most hyped
about our line these days and that's
also because of the right concurrency
model and good libraries for the hard
stuff and the thing that most people
that comes to airline hate about airline
is that it has weird and very stupid
strings it just lists but if you're
doing a web service you can actually
concatenate a lot of stuff and push them
out really really quickly with these
weird airline strings a word from our
sponsor before going in a detail
I thought you needed to be woken up
because now we're going to dive into the
internals of Airlines so just a brief
break there and then you get to see some
airline code also there's no catch so
Elling is dynamically and strongly typed
oh did you notice I put it on a keyboard
the a-line typing on a keyboard that's
the yoke of the presentation sorry
yeah so by having a dynamically typed
language we get a lot of benefits one
thing is that we can do hot code loading
so wireless system is running we can
actually load new code into the system
you can do this in in many languages but
if you have static typing there's some
problems so if you suddenly realize that
the types you had were wrong
and you need to upgrade your new version
you cannot really do that because you
cannot load a new version of some code
which have a different view of the types
in the system than other parts of the
code it also makes it possible to to
have the heaps and stacks moveable since
everything is nicely tagged so this will
make it possible to have really small
stacks for each process and we'll come
back to that a little bit more and for
from a maintenance view you get very
transparent data so you can log into the
system and look at any piece of memory
and from that piece of memory you can
actually see what data structures are in
the memory and of course you can do
garbage collection and you can do it
with a copying
so you get nice locality of things so
this is the Erlang type lattice there
you have something called a term that's
any anything in Erlang is a term it can
be a number and number is either an
integer or a float and type why's there
is only the distinction between integers
and floats in the implementation there's
actually two types of integers also
there's immediate integers that fits in
one word of the machine and big integers
which has to be boxed and put on the
heap but airline has just an ocean of
numbers where you can have numbers of
any size basically don't have to worry
about wrapping or word boundaries or
anything like this and you have floats
now you have atoms that's symbolic names
that you can use very practical to tag
your code with atoms instead of just
numbers and references are a specific
term that you can create once to get a
unique reference and no one else should
be able to trade that one a reference
that will compare equal to that
reference so you can tag messages with
these references know that they came
from you originally and things like that
there's closures it's called fun in
Erlang we have much more fun in Erlang
than in other languages because we don't
have closures we have funds there's
ports that basically processes but that
are connected to some I input/output
channel
there's peds which is the process
identifier that you're handled to
another process in our line you have
tuples
where you can have an array of terms and
lists of course consisting of either
needle or cones and then there's Tommy
called binary which is just a big piece
of byte memory so you have a file for
example you load it as a binary and you
get all the bytes in the file in memory
and you can pass it around and examine
it all these terms are also comparable
so you can ask the system whether the
interior one is less than the atom foo
or less than the empty list and so on so
the values on the left are less than the
values on the right except for integers
and floats that have some really special
comparison semantics but we all know
that we shouldn't compare integers or
floats anyway so but a good thing is
that there is a way to compare all the
terms so you can use any term as a key
and put it in a dictionary or something
like that
so now we're diving a bit deeper into
the virtual machine so if you have a
string in a line as I said earlier
strings are just lists so a string takes
a lot of memory in a line especially if
you run on 64-bit machine but a string
like string hello
yes consists of carries a pointer to
memory so this is memory addresses here
we were very happy about some very low
memory addresses for this example so a
memory address and then the tag that
says that this is a list and that's just
that the lowest bit is a 1 so I can go
to this P place in memory at any time
and I will see that this is a list and I
can follow the pointer to add the Sun
and 28 and I will know that there's a
console here with a car and cutter or
head or tail of this list so on the
address on line 28 there's the character
H stored which is the ASCII value for
that character shifted left and then tag
this as its small in which is four ones
and then in the console there's another
list tag and the address to the next
console
so this is just one process memory the
heap and this is how a list would end up
and then we have the Neil's tag which is
all ones except the third bit so that's
what we need to know about types and
representation of them before we go to
the right concurrency model so the right
concurrency model gives you the ability
to have lightweight processes and they
all talk to message-passing there's no
shared state between them and this means
that we can also have a garbage
collector that isn't stopped the world
and they are connected through monitors
and signals so a process from the
virtual machines point of view is just a
bit of memory so basically it's the
process control block which is a
predefined structure with all the
information about the process whether
it's running where it keeps its deep
heap and stack and other interesting
facts about the process and then it has
a mailbox and when it's empty it doesn't
take any space except for some space in
the PCB which is already accounted for
there and then there's a stack where the
program execution for this process is
done so each process has its own stack
and then there's a heap where the
process keeps its own data
and the stacking he starts at 233 words
or maybe 232 words so a normal process
when you start up it's very very small
it's under 300 words of memory and the
trick here is of course that these
stacks can grow and shrink as necessary
so in many programming languages you
would need to create a stack of a page
size or something like that and you
would have perhaps one stack per for the
whole machine or something like that but
the Erlang medium we use one stack per
process and we can reallocate them you
know what everything on the stack is and
we can move it around and and change the
pointers as needed and then the
concurrency model is done by the virtual
machine applying actually cooperative
multitasking on the side of the virtual
machines view of it so for a process or
a programmer you have pre-emptive
multitasking so you run your process and
it could at any point yield and let some
other process run if you're running on a
single core machine then that multi
tasking is done by yielding and letting
other process run this is of course also
true in a multi-core machines where you
have more processes than you have
schedulers but on the virtual machine
side it's actually done with
collaborative yielding so
at certain points the virtual machine
will check whether the process has used
up all its reductions so what the
reduction is is a bit hand wavy but
usually it's a function call so every
function call is uses up one reduction
when it comes to built-ins in the
language it's a little bit more unclear
but basically a process cannot execute
without using reductions so one reason
for this is because there's no loops in
airline there's no loop construct the
only way to make a loop in airline is by
using a tail recursion so then you will
actually do a function call so at each
function call you will you do use one
reduction and sooner or later the
process run out of reductions and then
at places where the virtual machine
knows the full state of the process and
it has run out of reductions it will
block that process and scheduling a new
process to run so in reality it's not
just for pieces of memory but for one
thing the stack in heap is allocated
together as one piece of memory so they
grow towards each other and this saves
one pointer in the beam emulator for one
thing because you don't need to keep
track of where the heap ends and where
the stack ends when those two pointers
top of heap and top of stack meet then
you know that you run out of space and
there's also an all deep because there's
a generational garbage collector so data
that survives for a couple of garbage
collections will move to the old heap
and
that tip will not be garbage collected
until there's a new major collection
there's also something called a process
director in dictionary which we try to
not talk about in the airline world so I
will not do that there are actually two
in boxes in the virtual machine and this
is so that you can send messages to a
process even though it's running on
another scheduler and we'll look at the
details for that so imagine that you
have these two processes process 1 and
process 2 and process one wants to call
this amazing function say hello which
takes this string hello that we know now
how it looks on the heap it's a lot of
data on the heap and it senses to some
other process which is processed to so
on the heap we have the word hello we
have some other process here process too
that's sitting wait and listen loop here
so we execute this statement and then
the virtual machine will treat something
called an EM buff and then it will copy
the whole term to this M buff and this
is still within process ones memory and
process ones execution so this process
can run and do whatever it want
during this coping time
and then at the end of this send the
emulator grabs a quick look of this
inbox and just moves the pointer from
this inbox to this M buff and now it
suddenly belongs to this process memory
so in this process we do receive and we
wait for the message 42 this message
will not show up but we have this
timeout closer that after one second we
will return okay anyway and continue
executing so what happens when when we
execute this receive loop is that we
move this message to the scene mailbox
so this is now part of things that has
to be garbage collected
if this process wants to be a garbage
collection so this inbox is not looked
at during garbage collection and any new
messages coming in can come in even
though the other process is doing
garbage collection because this process
has not seen them in any way yet so we
can get a quick look to to add something
in this inbox move this memory over and
then we move it to the seen inbox and
then we come to the next receive clause
and now we move it from the seen inbox
this message hello matches anything so
we move it to the heap
so that was how message-passing in
airline works and for the programmer you
don't have any shared memory at all and
for the virtual machine of course you
have to be able to get to the mailbox of
the process but it's minimized the time
that you actually need to take a look of
the other mailbox and that mailbox is
kept apart from the mailbox you have to
consider when you do garbage collection
so the other great thing about air lying
is that we have error handling and
exception Don right done right and
there's something called monitors and
signals so with these signals you can
build a supervision tree so what OTP
library gives you is also a generic
supervisor so you can start up the
supervisor that monitors to chart
supervisors that monitors children and
if a child dies then a signal will go to
the supervisor which can restart it so
let's do a small demo of that so here is
a running along system with the
supervision structure of empty system
when it started so there's a kernel
supervisor keeping track of a number of
other supervisors that used in the
system
and now I have their own keyboard
written a small program that starts a
supervisor and then it starts a child on
the read supervisor that just counts so
we started a supervisor with the peed 55
so now it shows up on the kernel safe
supervisor this supervisor 55 and the
child 56 and now I can actually just go
in and kill this child and then you see
that it dies but it's restarted so it
start counting from zero again I can
even kill the supervisor and then it
restarts the supervisor and the child
and it keeps on counting of course when
it dies it looses its date but it could
save it stayed in some database or
whatever it needs to if it needs to keep
state persistent but yes because there's
a bug or anything happening to this
process doesn't mean that the whole
system goes down or that my code stops
executing it just comes right right back
up
and of course Alan has ordinary or sort
of ordinary try-catch so you can write
code to get the file so you send in a
file name try to open it and if you get
an okay you get a handle and here I
don't really want to handle the case
that the file doesn't exist
so yes ignore that case that error will
then be propagated upwards to some other
place where hopefully you serve up
supply the file name then you can know
what you could do with it if it doesn't
exist and then I try to read from the
file handle and I get the file and
return it or I get can't catch an error
and a file and return an empty list in
that case and then I do
close the file handler with an after
clause and this is executed whether I go
this way with an okay or the error this
is always executed but the return value
is still the return value of the case
that matched so the return value of this
author course is always thrown away but
this way you can write safe handlers and
only care about the errors that you want
to take care of and the other ones are
passed up in the chain and if there's no
catch anywhere in the process stack the
process will die and a signal will be
sent to your supervisor instant
so one other good feature with Elling is
the interactive shell so we saw now that
they're sexually repels even for Java
that's a nice thing but I like assess
this for a long time and coupled with
transparent data types data structures
it's really easy to go into shell and
look at the state of the system and when
you're building your program the shell
is fantastic so you write some code go
to your shell test it directly in the
shell see if it works or not the test
and write cycle is very very short just
write one line of code go to your shell
test it or even write some code in the
shell to test it and so on very nice but
it has one unfortunate drawback that is
that there's almost no test-driven
development in airline the way that it
should be well maybe this you do write
your tests but you throw them away all
the time so you write all your tests in
a shell test your code every little
character you write you test it in the
shell it works fine and then you write
it your next test and so on till you get
it working but when you're done it's
only in the shell and you don't get
these nice tests that you can use later
so that bugs me a lot but that's the way
it is with the shell but we have short
demo of the shell so here are some
things that you can do for example get
the heap size of all the processes in
the system so you get all processes in a
system in the
P and then we have a list comprehension
here so for each P each process we do
process even for asked for the heap size
and then we fold over it with a function
that takes the value that we get from
process info and we add this the
accumulated value and start with zero so
if I ask to processes I get all the pins
in the system so if I do
got an American keyboard on a Swedish
woman it's always exciting
so if I do process info and all
processes I can see that I get tuples
with heap size and the size and then I
can keep on building my little things
for examining things in the system or I
can just call the built in that will
give me the names of the processes or
what they running and how many messages
that you have in the queue and their
sizes and so on so this shell is amazing
when you do maintenance on running
system that are behaving badly
and Eric's on spend a lot of time
building their OTP libraries and these
gives you the hard stuff so they have
Jen server which is a way of building a
server that takes care of the things
that you need in a server also like
maintenance and the ability to do hot
code upgrade while the system is running
you have the supervisor and supervisor
that you can build these supervision
trees and have all the settings for if
you want them to kill all the siblings
or restart all the siblings or just
resort one child and so on when a
process dies and then there's a finite
state machine and it makes it easy to
write if any state machine in the same
way so everyone can read what that needs
state machine does handles messages to
if in each state machine and so on and
this makes it possible if not easy to
build fault-tolerance scalable systems
yes and then we have the word string so
strings are just lists of integers but
there's this thing that's called an i/o
list which is actually a nested list of
strings and integers and this means that
you can in this list you can put
binaries or strings or lists of strings
and that means that you can't can
concatenate two strings in constant time
you just put them in a list in a console
and then you have concatenated two
strings so if you're serving up HTML and
you're grabbing data from different
places to put into your page
you can just quickly build this whole
structure and then send it to an i/o
port so if you can't do air like if your
cat don't love you or whatever
it's almost well maybe but one thing you
can do of course is to model your
programs as services basically that's
what you do in a line with all your
little components you model them as
services that are independent and that
has an API which is based on message
passing and that's when you build your
components as services then you get some
of that non-shared memory from your
design so you can use message passing
and our shared State for example in
Scala you have a whole set of things you
can pass around as messages that are
immutable and if you stick to that part
of Scala you can install I get almost a
line like behavior of things so you
don't share any state you just copy
immutable structures or you can go the
akka way with scroll has done and
actually implement OTP and whatever in
your favorite language so at the airline
workshop in Boston or actually it was a
day commercial uses of functional
programming in Boston last week there
was some guys that had done this in
scheme so they built OTP on top of
scheme in order to control medical
equipment fascinating stuff yes wonder
why they didn't use airline but anyway
they they got airline in scheme so
that's good but you might lose the
fantastic syntax of airline of course
and probably lose some of the multi-core
advantage and if you do like in Scala
there's the problem that suddenly you
realize that you need some library
that's in Java
you bring in a mutable library and
suddenly there's mutation and state
behind your back and you're in a bad
place
you might also lose the transparent
types and the fantastic shell and
possibly hold code upgrade at least at a
granular level that you can get in in
airline but as I said in the beginning
the most important aspect of airline
isn't this fancy virtual machine and
what every test to run your program in a
scalable way it's that when you start
programming a line you start thinking in
a completely new way you start thinking
on currently with processes and how to
model your system as small services and
you get a completely different design of
your program when you think airline than
if you think in any other language so
another word from our sponsor done hi my
name is Vasu I'm CEO of Dona
I know people like me and recruiters all
over the world are constantly bugging
you stalking you trying to get you to
join their company that's why instead
I'm gonna give you the top ten list why
you should not join Connor we are not a
ping pong playing startup anymore we're
actually a growing company where people
like anything's done and there's more
than 900 of us we don't work with
anything sexy such as music we work with
boring over complicated stuff like
payments moving other people's money
back and forth talking about money this
is not going to be the super exciting
place where you're kind of wondering
what's gonna happen to this company
tomorrow you craftable
we've been profitable since day one you
will not be the best we have people
invented Internet
we even have Israeli security officers
even worse where people write books
about compilations and stuff like that I
can't even pronounce if you want to
build the coolest smoothness payment app
that nobody uses this is not the place
to be it's not around the corner
unless you live beyond the wall don't
even think about bringing your partner
sweet people have been voted the best
looking people in the world
you won't understand a thing what
anybody's saying we all sound like the
Swedish Chef we're a socialist country
that means like you don't need to pay
for anything and worse I get to sit in
office where everyone else is we have
six weeks of vacation and months of paid
paternity leave it's awful for anybody
who loves to work so to sum it all up
you're more than welcome to join Ghana
if you're finally working at a
fast-growing
profitable company with brilliant
biscuits that look awesome so you kind
of find with six weeks of vacation
I guess that's out of the question
but thank you for listening
yeah that was all I had
unless you want to know more gory
details I have some extra slides but
thank you so we have a number of
questions for you let me see
so you talked a lot about the right
concurrency model is it always the right
one or have you come across situations
where you'd really like a different
concurrency model no I I don't think
I've come to seen places where the model
hasn't been right of course the usage of
it have not always been right but for
the things that we have been building
that the model has fitted perfectly if
you build computer games and need to do
quick graphic and so on a line is
probably not language for you but for
what we're doing it's perfect so a line
has lots of message passing lots of
processes but what about locality and
cache lines doesn't that mess all that
up yes it does
it it's not as important as you think in
most cases but when you really need that
it's it's a bit complicated in a line to
get it right that's true but you have to
really think about your program to get
it to to use less memory and then it's
it's not so fun anymore but in most
cases the the machine does a very good
job by having the the model with the
process you will have model your program
in such a way that it it scales so if
you have many cores
our many machines we will distribute
your your job on on many of these course
and and one process will run on one core
and will work pretty well with having
all its memory on that core also okay so
airline is also used in real-time
applications what kind of guarantees
does the airline VM give for timing none
well it guarantees that timeouts will
not occur before the time that the
timeout says that it will occur and this
works okay in real-time settings well I
wouldn't put it in breaks in a in a car
but it depends on what kind of real-time
requirements you have okay and we have
another question which is where did
Ericsson user long airline was of course
designed at Ericsson and maybe we can
take that both as we're dead Ericsson
news airline in the early days and where
it does Ericsson use that land today I
never worked at Ericsson so I can't
really speak for them on that but Wolff
sitting here that's been named the first
commercial airline user twice during
this conference he knows about this so
they build the HD 301 which was the
first eight ATM switch from Ericsson and
which British Telecom bought and run for
ten years and then they said that they
had nine nines of uptime on this system
so that was a successful use of airline
early on and nowadays Eric's on use it a
lot in testing and I use some quick
check tool or whatever that for almost
all their projects even though those
projects are not in airline themselves
but the quick check tool works well for
testing API some protocols and so on
okay well we have a few more minutes and
I've asked the questions that have been
posted here so other questions for Eric
well in that case oh oh that's one so I
don't know if you can hear that up the
back but the summary was that Ericsson
nowadays are not just using airline for
new testing but for some very serious
projects and they're happy to inform us
all that they are using airline for some
serious projects but not what they are
okay any last question okay well then
let's thank Eric for a fascinating talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
