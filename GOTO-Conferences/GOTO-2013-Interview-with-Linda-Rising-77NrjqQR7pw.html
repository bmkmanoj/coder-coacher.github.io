2013 and it's the first conference that
we have in Chicago and we're very happy
to have you speaking thank you just so
the audience all of them were very happy
to meet you talk thank you it was not
the first time I've given the talk but
it's the second time for that version so
it's a little bit of an experiment so
when you say experiment you think was
really an experiment like you talked
about in your talk with its scientific
experiment yes it was because I actually
every talk I give is an experiment
because in the beginning I have a
hypothesis I have something that I
believe about the top and it's strange
that you can't know that until you get
it in front of an audience and
afterwards I must immediately react to
what happened if so I made a lot of
changes after that talk and that's
pretty much the way all talks are that
process never ends and I keep learning
even if I doing essentially a talk many
times I keep changing it based on when i
hear from
so a what yes it was
I enjoyed it thank you one of the things
I I really do it was hearing about you
talked about incentives house not really
how the brain works and my question is
about that intrinsic motivation you
talked about intrinsic motivation as
opposed to extrinsic motivation I
suppose and I teach teachers how to
teach and we talked on meta meta teacher
many Betances you had a better teacher
yet and and we talked about motivational
because that's a that's a huge problem
of universes like we're could get paid
to go to university contrary to other
countries but that's another discussion
that's the problem that they have is
that the students are not very motivated
to do anything I will talk about
intrinsic motivation where you can put
some students you can put them in a
cardboard box and you can take them out
five years later they learn all the
curriculum yes unless you feel that you
sit down with them hold hands with them
and they don't know yes well maybe
should we define extra say because in
the beginning when people talked about
incentives what they meant was some kind
of reward a carrot or some kind of
punishment a stick that comes from
someone else and they apply it depending
upon the context that they want you to
do something they reward you for that
behavior
don't they punish you for that behavior
and for a long time psychologists and
others who study human behavior believe
that was it that that and your
biological needs were what determine
what you did and it wasn't until 1949
with that experiment I talked about with
the rhesus money is where Harlow
discovered that the monkeys were solving
puzzles not because they got raisins or
because they were sprayed with water if
they didn't want them solve it but
simply on their own because they loved
it they thought was they got joy from it
and so the idea of intrinsic motivation
was born nobody paid any attention to it
for almost 20 years they weren't willing
to admit that that could be as strong as
and maybe a more powerful motivator than
all of the carrots and sticks that
people have been using for a long time
so the question really is we know about
carrots and sticks and we know their
limitations and we know that many times
it's counterintuitive that you can turn
off an interest with an incentive for
the carrot the data is pretty clear
so what is it that you do to create
entrancing motivation and my answer is
bad they had to see it they model it so
I wondered for a long time why my
daughter doesn't like to read she really
does never enjoyed reading and I thought
I spent so much time reading to her as a
child and she sees me reading why didn't
she picked that up yet so now she spends
a lot of time driving for her job and
she loves listening to books to
audiobooks and as I thought about it I
realized that's what I modeled for her
was listening no because you read it up
because I read aloud to her for years
and years and years and we will so do
that as a family that that's what I was
sort of encouraging her to do not
reading from a book to pick it up and
look at the text but to listen to
somebody read too because she loves it I
didn't tell her to do
and I'm so surprised at the variety of
books she reads and how much she's
always got a look in her car she never
starts out on a trip without a stat of
audio book she's got him on her phone
now so it's not really a separate time
she carries along but she loves it and I
thought I was modeling yeah reading
aloud to her so instead of telling how
the nutrition he just thinks we all do
yeah you had given her the feeling that
it was nice to listen to being written
up so the model the modeling there's a
study that I talk about all the time now
because I just had my 71st birthday oh
my god i'm going to make leg up and what
the study showed is that people who
don't believe that old people are
worthwhile i believe old people are
incompetent that they really just need
to be in a home and they certainly
couldn't do anything worthwhile those
people are more likely to behave that
way themselves when they get older and
to show signs of age
earlier some heart trouble strokes so
they live out the occasion and what
keeps people from having those
expectations is our model then you just
sit and so at the end of most of my
talks now I tell everyone about this
experiment and I tell them that I should
roll because here's what 71 is like 71
travels around the world 71 and
exercises those for a long bike ride
enjoys lund has a lot of interest and
gets to hang out with cool people that's
what old ages so if they can let me be
their model for that then they will be
like that when they are said it will
affect their friends so that's what we
need are more rope I tie that to women
and in the same way that I can be your
model I didn't I got a PhD in computer
science I'm just really an average
person I'm not a genius if I can do it
you can do it if I can do well in the
work environment you can do
in the working environment and that's
what we need to bring out the passion
the joy for anything is to see it
modeled in someone who really has it so
if teachers love to learn if teachers
love math or science or their subject
they will teach that along with the
subject is so unfortunately a lot of
teachers don't want that's I think than
what they are teach that that is true
and so that's why I teach yes they teach
the lack of joy for that subject and
that may be a stronger less than
learning calculus or chemistry if the
teacher has lost maybe they thought that
initially and now it's gone
they've lost that's there going to be a
killer for teaching it is it is and it's
difficult for teachers themselves to
maintain that yes and I think the best
thing they can do is have support so
they mean models as well they need to go
to workshops where they can be inspired
I mean we've all done that we've gone to
workshops like this amazing conference
and you go to a conference and you're
there for a couple of days and you come
away and you're energized because you
can remember unfortunately when it comes
to teaching that you know SD that's not
adhesive Dunlop yes something that you
do want to get all bases you go to
academic conferences you have peer
reviews on your research you do not have
any peer reviews on your teaching you
can always do something yes can always
do something and it so it would begin
with a local group rush route it would
be grassroots step by step and you can
get together with someone else who's may
be feeling the same way and I mean this
material on the land there are
inspirational books you could have on a
study group where you read an
inspirational book together and you
could tell each other stories about the
good times oh yeah
now when I was in love with my subject
and I had a wonderful experience
teaching my students and and then
they'll know forgetting good samples of
how to teach this particular so yeah way
that it's asking for you and the
students but yes yeah I just I guess I
focus on the positive so we always
remember the bad things so we get so
discouraged and we taking all the things
are really men and so there has to be
some point and turn around and you can
hardly do that on your own it's very
difficult but somehow in a move you can
bootstrap each other and there's nothing
that we like more than to help someone
else it's really easy to see others
probably so it can be a little therapist
and with the idea that we're going to be
positive we're going to focus on your
times and you'll go to another year and
we're going to help each other yet
bootstrap ourselves and we're going to
recapture and I think actually that you
will devote not to introduce change you
know if it's really helpful lets you can
certainly use it for that because it's
small step yes and and also the the book
at the end of the talk today that I ran
out of time
I got to cover talks about the power of
small wings that what makes us happy in
our work is not that we discovered the
cure for cancer it's that we are working
on something we care about and we're
able to make some small progress that if
we just feel at the end of the day they
did you slip the dogs the rescue dogs
they didn't have to find 20 people just
one person at the end of the day and now
we're just like those rescue dogs we
need to have just a little
different today I made a difference I
say one acuity and I think that ties
back to how to how to help the students
create intrinsic motivation if you can
give them these small steps more
feelings of success as a subject I say I
said could go absolutely and that purse
at fits in with another talk that I give
a lot now about agile mind yet that
there's a whole movement now in
education about realizing that it's not
that you have talent and you don't it's
about we all have what we were born with
but we can also all improve yes my
husband and I live in a retirement
community now and we started the quarter
group we have about a dozen people who
are in their 60s 70s earnings and some
of them have never played an instrument
in their lives don't read music because
they haven't told their whole lives oh
you don't have any musical town your
sister yeah but you don't have it so you
don't get to play the instrument you
can't sing nobody would want to hear you
saying yes and they've been told bad for
season and that's a protein that year
come true and after a while they
believed is so now they're finding I may
not go to Carnegie Hall but I can't play
and I can enjoy getting together with a
dozen other people and we can go to
nursing home and we can play christmas
songs and make people happy by parties
and for them that's the world why do
they have to wait so long it's been that
they reached yeah absolutely
alternatives much work absolutely
absolutely so about those two things fit
together I think the modeling of the joy
and the realization all get better if we
just undetermined and we work hard in
and then we practice we can
and learning the joy and accepting even
happy about the little snake schools
small steps and in fact that's what that
is called the progress principal and
they studied software developers and
that's what they saw it didn't have to
be some major breakthrough it was just a
small thing in the same way small
setbacks so if managers don't remove
obstacles different people throw things
in their way and if day after day they
feel like I'm not getting I'm stuck this
is just awful if they go home like that
every day it's actually much worse it's
two to three times worse than if they
had that small little step progress the
negative experiences that take
Celesteville yes there was a keynote
speaker at the antral conference not
last year but the year before who's
actually measure that and if someone the
negative effects are so much more
powerful even though they smell so we
need a pay attention most of it
I think it's interesting to hear
presentations of these developing
conferences because you're the things
that you're talking about it's so much
different than used languages on
what spurred your curiosity about how
late work I think it's probably because
I used to be a very technical person I
have a PhD in computer science but i
also have a master's in mathematics and
i started on a PhD in my hands began as
a chemist adventures in this room and I
was never interested in psychology I had
to take one course to graduate along the
Rio somewhere I took an AA meeting and
one Mary Lynn Maness and I started
riding girls change and we tried to
document what it was that we did
introduce patterns that's what was out
in the beginning what we saw is that it
wasn't about all the technical the
rational the logical things at all it
was about other things and in trying to
understand why why did it work that way
and why was it so powerful
why can't you just give a rational
argument for why patterns are good and
say all right let's do it why doesn't
that work it is frustrating it is it is
frustrating so in looking at what worked
and also having people coach me because
we had a lot of good reviewers who said
well you should read this you should
look at that and seeing that people had
experiments that showed yes those
patents work because your brain as these
funny quirks and here's how you really
listen to things and here's my new
interpret things so that was 20 years
and stop since I know this we are the
most fascinating things on the black
indeed Andy and I guess the other thing
my husband says is that the whole field
of psychology sociology they are all
becoming more technical they can be
lovely they can invite technical stuff
they are in there and they can measure
you can put someone in an MRI machine or
you can use an EEG and you can see you
can see that when they look at a can of
coca-cola certain parts of their brain
line so the people who sell coca-cola
which I think that's interesting because
you come from something which is metric
if you can make sure it's my sure yes
that's right so and then you go into
something which is more you could say
fluffy but it's becoming less becoming
that's solely coming unless you're so
you coming yes in fact if you look at
the progress that's been made my
cognitive science the science that
studies the brain and compare that to
the progress in software development
their money they really do
they're really making doing real
research not just saying that I did this
and it went very well by my decision and
therefore you should do it yes indeed
well I had all money for marketing
unless you should lose my focus so what
keeps you going why do you come to these
weird talks do you think that you're
able to find anything useful are you
changing and you become different
because I have become different I think
that my father suffered from a severe
brain damage so he is good and all of us
it was very sad was also somewhat
interesting to see how a brain-damaged
effects the brain and I started being a
smaller size yes and I thought that was
really interesting to see how but that
was meant for my physical physiological
annual I was in different parts of the
brain and how it works and then I became
interested in parallel that in the
background for how my teaching word I
used to have a theory of practice
teaching and you won't worked and what
didn't work but I didn't know why and I
started studying the research about
learning teaching and and then when I
came to one of your presentations about
how the brain works and report what
makes us say
that we do and then
I have been to find it interesting both
on the level I had with my father's
brain but also in the liver the students
I thought they all tied neatly together
it's a wonderful book all my stroke of
insight yeah it's about a neuropsych yes
who had a stroke and she documented well
it has anything to her as it was
happening this all I can feel I must be
unless be on my left divides oh now I'm
losing feeling of a young side and she
was so objective as scientific about the
things that were happening to her men in
her struggles to recover and now that's
what she talks about all the time is
that experienced than what she really
learned from going with your matters so
certainly when we go through those
things for others who are close to us go
through mistakes it's a little bit
it becomes it becomes so we'll very
visual how the brain is for us buddy for
our feelings as well gtn and how much
the skill sit in the sinners for the
tenants didn't really matter if the
brain doesn't help you if you don't okay
great yes there's so many interesting
case studies if you get caught up in
that of amazing people who have had
problems there was even a movie called
momentum yeah has made about some net
damage to the hippocampus if you have a
damaged hippocampus you can learn it can
remember what happened before the
incident the accident that illness can't
lay down any
was amazing movie was run backwards sort
of gave me the feeling about how the
world is and what a tragic experience
had been through but you really feel it
yeah the movie was so well done and it
really makes you feel brave and how that
might be the worst possible
imagine when it comes in grains and
think sometimes I elephants think that
must be the worst possible I think so
actually then I meet something new and
that must be the worst possible thing
that could happen because what what I'm
terrified of course is Alzheimer's as
people get older the statistics are not
good almost everyone who's of 90 or them
has some sign of it but what's
encouraging is that there aren't things
you can do and as long as you're out
there and if you have purpose I talked
about that today purpose is strong
component when they ask people to look
back on their lives those who felt a
sense of purpose correlates pretty
strongly with those who do not and also
pops so a sense of purpose being
involved being active wrestling with
complex problems doing all kinds of
things that gives you a sort of an army
of resistance against a whole host and
that would be true at any age I worry
sometimes about some of the software
developers I talk to or board they feel
like they do the same things
they say you're opening yourself up to
get into a bad place it's up to you just
like you have to exercise your body you
have to keep your brain in shape as well
so there's a unless of even for young
kids tiedemann for kids I absolutely
keep going I also needs sleep is oh yeah
we also need sleep it's way though so
there's an hour long time to see Liz
talked about that today yes six hours so
what we know is the global average hours
per night is decreases and so it's not
just a problem in Western Europe for the
yes everyone doesn't appreciate that
that's what learning takes place if you
don't see you
if you don't sleep your hippocampus
shrinks if you don't sleep then after a
while things are really bad for your
body so it's not just elective it's not
just up in a short ways and going to be
sleepy I can make up for it yes I can
make up for it no easily don't we can I
can see it and we don't and in fact that
making up is worse it's sort of like a
diet I can lose ya house today and then
tomorrow you gain 20 so that up and down
kind of behavior is not good for our
physical health or our mental health
needing to have regular hours and we are
still the people who walked around the
sub-band tens of thousands of years ago
we have not really so when we get to
things that are the way we were we don't
do it and sleep used to sleep Tennyson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
