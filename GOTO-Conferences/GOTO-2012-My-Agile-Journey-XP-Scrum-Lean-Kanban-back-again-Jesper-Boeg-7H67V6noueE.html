here today claiming to know anything
about this is that I've spent the best
part of the last six and a half years
working exclusively with different
models for agile and lean product
development I've done that as a
mentoring coach I've done that as a
scrum master product owner and pretty
much in any role in any type of
organization you can you can think of so
at least I have some experience now and
let's see if that has brought anything
good with it good I come from a company
called try Fork but I won't cover the
entire slide here but I want what I
think is important is that try fog is
still mainly a software house meaning
that 80% of the employees of traffic
still spent the daily life building
actual software writing actual code so
our interest in agile and lean product
development comes from our need to do
that ourselves to provide value for our
own customers and as you probably know
we also arrange the go-to conference
series here in all who's our leading
conference but also in Copenhagen Prague
and Amsterdam we also do the Q con
conferences in corporate collaboration
with info Q and the biggest ones are in
London and San Francisco but then our
launched all over the world good
so reflecting on the past six and a half
years this is what it turns out has
having the number a number of times I
think I know it all I found out that
damn reality seems to be different at
mine than my mental model I tried to
adjust the model I try to apply the new
model with some success I think I know
it all again but sometimes it just turns
out that theme reality changed again or
I face a new organization a new
situation where things just didn't work
according to my mental model so I've had
a number of shifts during the last six
and a half years and some of those
shifts I will share with you today my
experience in software started back in
2001 or a or here in 2002 where it's
been studying for about a year and a
half and we got into diving into some of
the books behind what it takes to do
professional software development how
many of you have read the Somerville
book okay that has got to be one of the
most incredibly boring books I have read
in my entire life that is just filled
with things that make you say damn I
mean I remember they sold the computer
science education by you get to create
the world if this is what it takes to
create the world I'm not sure I want to
be part of it so that was the first
learning opportunity does it really take
this mus this much pain and effort to do
software do we really need to do all
this do we need to fill out Kokomo
models for estimation and just to get
software out the door and provide value
for our user I was thinking more in
terms of customer collaboration actually
good so in 2003 and we had course called
extreme programming and arguably the
teacher had very very little experience
with doing this in practice but he made
us read this book and that actually
sounded pretty good expiry action you
get the unsigned
you get to work together as a team you
get to pay program all that was very
very nice and it was much better fit for
my mental model what surprised me though
was what is with that religious attitude
it seemed that Ken Beck would actually
send you to hell if you are not doing
pair programming TDD user stories
refactoring system metaphors on-site
customers and so on and it seemed like a
very very fragile house of cats because
this argument would be all these are
very fragile independently but if you
use them all at the same time and do it
very very strict you will be successful
and I'm sure that whenever a project
wasn't successful using XP in this early
days he would be able to point to at
least two or three factors where they
weren't being strict the XP so it seemed
like it it had some religious aspects it
seemed that it was too easy to
afterwards evaluate that this was not a
success just because you didn't follow
the Praxis individually in 2004 I got my
first
job a student job arguably and my first
reaction was I can't believe they're
paying me to write software it was like
being paid to play with Lego all day
it was oops
sorry I'll just go back Oh wrong button
sorry it was sa p how many of you have
tried programming in the about
programming language that's not a very
fantastic language is it but you get to
do some things really really fast and
since this was just my first job I was
just impressed that people were actually
paying me to do this I don't know if any
of you have had the similar experience
but to me it was really like playing
with Lego all day I didn't pay too much
attention to what happened to my work
afterwards and this was a big big big
organization and they had a value stream
looking something like this
this is something I studied after I
finished my job there for the work I was
doing there we probably had an average
lead time of something like 33 and a
half months this software I built that
it didn't even get near production while
I was still working there wait time
doing that period was probably around
thirty one month so there's a long long
feedback loop there and to this day I
haven't got proof that any of the things
I built there when when came any close
to being used at with real users access
to the system using the actual features
I built I did contact and it was
confirmed that it actually made it
through production one and a half years
after I left the company but whether
people actually used it I have no idea
then in 2006 I got my degree and I
started working at try fog meaning yes
I've worked for try at try fraud for the
past six and a half years and they made
me read the scrum book one of the first
scrum book by Ken sway brand Mike Beadle
and they also made I think that was on
my very first day I was put on a
certified scrum master course
led by Jeff Sutherland and I thought
this makes a lot of sense you've taken
away some of the more religious stuff of
the XP you're still able to actually use
XP practices in your teams if you find
that it suits your context but it's more
of a management framework and it's not
so focused on the engineering practices
which arguably will shift from context
to context so I worked at try Fork we
use scrum that went very well
hey I very quickly transitioned into the
role as scrum master and I started
studying scrum in a bit more detail and
among others I read the books by by Mike
own on actually how to do is more value
driven part of building software using
scrum and applying some the user storage
techniques and techniques for a
scheduling summation and planning and
all was very good and fine I even got to
take a script a scrum product owner
course by Roman Pickler to get the more
business focus on what it actually takes
to build value to your customers and in
2007 I also did my first class how many
of you here have had the benefit of a
teaching experience not being taught but
actually teaching yourself
good I hope that like me you will find
that that I that is something that
indeed sharpen sure your mind and makes
you study things in a bit more detail
and be a bit more clear plus you
actually learn a lot from your students
I've tried to calculate I've probably
taught classes for between 1200 and
1,700 people during the past six and a
half years and they think they're there
to learn but they don't know that I'm
there to learn as well so whenever you
teach somebody they will ask a question
you will have discussion and you get to
put on in a lot of details and you get a
look and and you get to apply a lot of
context where had you just experienced
that one or two projects you just
wouldn't have so if the rest of you
haven't had this experience ever get the
chance to teach grab it it might seem
hard first it might require some
preparations but it's definitely
worthwhile
for the individual team I worked on we
got to the point where we would be
releasing software to production every
three weeks at this point in time this
was great
remember this was back in time it's not
now we're people of releasing 50 times
the days of production using lean
startup methods which gesture will share
with us later but still at this point in
time releasing software every three
weeks to a production environment and
doing it on a regular basis and which
stable quality software that was good we
thought we were fantastic at this point
our value stream compared to the example
earlier had changed a lot so we would
have a lead time of probably between 5
and 14 weeks great time of a three to
seven this is just things waiting on the
actual backlog to get implemented as the
decision has been made and the value
adding time is much much smaller so in
general we're getting feedback loops and
made an order of magnitude faster than
in like in my previous job which should
also prove very very beneficial in terms
of build quality and stuff like that in
2008 I was off to save the world
I've had experienced from a couple of
in-house projects and I now thought I
had the knowledge and the skills to go
out and help others do things better in
their own situation yeah I also got to
fill out the form pay the 100 bucks and
become a certified scrum professional
and that is actually at this point in
time that was all you had to do use a
good seven hours
fill in the form get it out the door pay
your bill and and then you're good to go
but still it's something in the mud at
this point in time it was something the
market demanded and it's something that
that were actually put value on as you
say explained a bit earlier we all know
now that there's a limit as to how much
you can learn on a CSM course in two
days and that's definitely also a limit
as to how much evaluation you can do by
filling out a simple form good
and I had very very good success doing
this and I thought man I'm good at this
not only am i affecting one or two teams
and I'm currently working on in my daily
life I am also out there helping real
companies do things better so it was a
very very gratifying experience and I
would typically be saying something like
this you know what what you have to do
is be a bit better sprint planning I can
get you some tools and tricks to make it
go a bit smoother and a bit faster and I
can make sure that you're a bit happier
about going into a sprint planning
session afterwards I'll talk a bit with
you about the backlog mister product
owner and I'm sure that we can work out
a better way of you delivering value and
making sure that you start the right
stuff and you keep the lower properties
further down your list also I would like
you to use these simple techniques for
retrospectives and in general people
were very very happy with this advice it
was simple
I pretty much had to go out there I had
my small checklist in my head I knew the
scrum practices the scrum ceremonies I
had the experience to know where things
often went wrong this was not a very
very complicated well so again I thought
man I'm good and don't worry I won't go
on like this for much longer because now
suddenly an ugly thing starts to happen
first of all I had some friends working
with lean in other context and software
and they said you do you know you know
even though you're doing product
development which is not manufacturing
there's a lot of good ideas in this and
you need to pay attention to this
because it's got a lot of it's got a lot
of it's got a lot to do with the fast
feedback loops it's got a lot to do with
trying to optimize for effectiveness not
efficiency and all that so I start of
you reading some of the older basic lean
manufacturing stuff and I also went
through the poppin dick book and about
how to to use this in in the IT space
and while we got to discuss this they
kept telling me
it seems like you focus a awful lot on
batch optimization in scrum and how like
no no no you know what you've got it all
wrong
you know those waterfall guys they are
the ones being suboptimal
there's the ones focusing on backup to
my session in scrum you know what we're
focusing on flow and I had the weirdest
dream and this isn't an actual G dream
suddenly I was there arguing with Homer
Simpson himself a bad well a scrum was
batch optimization or not I know what I
couldn't convince him I couldn't
convince Homer that scrum in some sense
did not rely on batch optimization
trying to plan a bachelor fork getting
it through your system as fast as
possible and then start the next chunk
it just like Homer wouldn't accept my
argument that that was just the minimum
size batch we could work on and either
and also he wouldn't accept that some of
the challenges I started to face didn't
have anything to do with this particular
fact because the surface at this point
was already starting to crack hey you
would see me saying something like this
but I told you we haven't got the right
product owner we haven't got a real
scrum for cross-functional team
we're not even following basic EDL
practices you are all wrong like what
you're doing is simply wrong and if you
just change this I know you can be in a
better place and nothing happened like
just because I was hammering them and
just because I was saying I told you so
a lot of times things didn't magically
change from one aspect to the other I
would have pio teams saying something
like we're behind how can we keep the
development team busy how could we make
sure that they continuously have got
something to do because that's what
important right it's not to deliver
functionality it's not to deliver value
it's just to keep the development team
busy and they would start things just to
start things they would just look at
their backlog okay what can we start
right now instead of what should we
start and I told him that was wrong but
still they didn't follow my advice
and teams would be focusing on stuff
like let's do the heck they expect 220
story points from us let's get going
hurry up our goal is to reach 220 story
points and I would tell them your goal
is not to reach to a 220 story point it
is to deliver value and again they would
not listen to me not sharing pair
programming quality not if it affects
our sprint commitment and at this point
in time I was working with some of the
best developers in the country with
years of agile experience and still this
is how they would behave why were they
doing this I would tell them please do
not do this and still they would do this
batch optimization at least that was
what I thought it at this point as
you'll see my mental model is going to
change a few times and we would have
product owners saying them Yeah right
like I've got time to involve in juicers
they would have to do with me as a
feedback you because you know what if
I'm going to involve end users I know
exactly what's going to happen they're
going to give me feedback and you know
what happens when they give me feedback
I get even further behind incremental
you're saying is that that's must be the
same that's just another word for agile
development it just turns out it isn't
and there was the issue of
organizational change some of the
organizations I met had been through
numerous change initiatives and their
idea was that if they could just prove
this wrong in six months they would be
back to business as usual and as some of
you will probably realize if you set out
to prove that something is wrong in six
months you have an almost hundred
percent guaranteed success because if
you do not take part of the change
initiative this very very little chance
of it ever becoming a success and we
would have management stating something
like yes I know we're behind schedule
that is why I have just hired three new
developments and I want everybody to
work overtime and they would be hugely
surprised even though I had told them so
that when they added 200 extra dollars
extra hours they would get 400 hours
further behind and but again why didn't
they listen split deadlines it is
approaching let's just get something out
the door the goal of us doing Sprint's
is just to get something out the door
again I would tell them no the goal of
the Sprint is to deliver value to your
customers is to test our business
hypothesis but still they would just be
hunting down those story points and I
would be running around saying no no no
come on you're all wrong why are you
doing this to me
you're ruining my success success factor
it's unfair and felt much like this of
course I had some interim successes if
you work with enough teams you're going
to have some successes it's almost hard
nuts but for the most cases in this
period of my life it wasn't a great
success I didn't change I crossed a lot
of frustration no doubt and my level of
i-told-you-so was all the way up there
and whenever things failed I could just
tell them yeah but I know you know what
I told you you would fail
basically it fell
like my religion was crashing down on me
I don't know how many of you have had
that experience of something that was
supposed to be a perfect mental model
just didn't fit reality anymore and that
you face the fact that you had to
drastically change how many of you owe
almost half so I'm not alone in this and
then fortunately this guy's name David
Anderson and Henrique neiberg and they
would say something like you know what
yes / it's not you alone there are
different ways out there if you just
focus on pulling to capacity
forget about sprint planning let's patch
up to my ization you just have to manage
flow look at the flow of work don't look
at the individual principles and
practices look about look at the the
axial value and you know what agile is
adaptable once you focus on practices it
becomes cargo cult or just instead
focuses on is what can you improve in
your current situation
try to just visualize your flow try to
have sustainable pace don't just copy
the mechanics your checklist of how to
do scrum throw it out the window
or at least juice it in the specific
context where it's applicable and not
just everywhere as a general tool there
are no silver bullets I was like yeah
this is exactly what I need this will
solve all my problems
guys this is how it's going to work from
now on you're no longer an individual
development team what we have here is a
system and we have to optimize the whole
and if that means moving some somebody
from a development team to the business
processes or vice versa
that is just how we'll do it we'll look
at the flow of work
we'll pull to capacity will drop the
sprint planning sessions where you all
look very very bored just going into the
meeting and now we'll focus on
just-in-time analysis and pulling work
in as capacity becomes available
damn I'm good again finally I'm having
success we're improving things that's
changing people are actually starting to
follow my advice again I'm a good coach
and people were saying thank you thank
you yes / this is much better than scrum
fortunately love a couple of the teams I
had the pleasure to work would have been
doing scrum for a while and they were
looking for new inspiration as I it was
so we were in this together and they
were saying yes this is this is actually
going to improve the way we work this is
going to be more lean we're going to
focusing to focus on limiting our work
in progress and make you feel that
there's flow through a value chain that
we get feedback loops as soon as
possible
and would be moving feedback groups even
further up the value stream to make sure
that things were not just evaluated at
the end of a sprint but important
valuate evaluated continuously doing the
work and I was like yeah I'll show you
all your scrum phonetics out there
there's a lot better ways of doing this
and scrum is like so 2006 and now we
have another way of looking at things
we're much more lean that we're
adaptable we're going to be focusing on
flow and that's much better and that's
not an actual picture of me but when I
was around 16 or 17 years old that was
my haircut I couldn't find a picture I
guess my mom just didn't like the
haircut enough to actually take pictures
with me that was much wow it looked like
and this was much how I felt right now
rebelling against the Society of scrum
they're better optimization they're
better optimizing they're focusing on
the mechanics and not the principles
pound they're not even understanding
what agile and lean development is all
about they're just following a simple
checklist and my presentations would
have tideless like scrum is not agile I
actually did a presentation named scrum
have you I got any idea how big a crowd
that turns out when you call things like
that it's incredible I actually
considered naming this presentations and
totally different name just to draw more
people here since
but if you write something like scrum is
not a deal a lot of people is going to
turn up of course introduction to Kanban
I'll have a presentation named Kanban
crossing the line pushing the limit or
rediscovering the idea vation because
that's really what I felt like
rediscovering what agile is truly about
hey
in 2010 I read these two books how many
of you have read these books or just one
of them okay not that many maybe I
should have done an introduction to
Kanban instead or introduction to lean
for those of you who haven't read
especially this one do yourself a favor
and read it as I'll be stating in a few
slides it is just the agile Bible but
radisson didn't know that but but it is
and David wrote a book called simply
just Kanban and Ken manages the book can
bend this point was an expression of a
lot of the thinking David Anderson had
been doing around the Kanban concept so
we all had now also not just only the
Kanban word but also a shared view of
what can been truly is and reading
David's book my initial reaction was
something like excellent there's a few
things that falls into place
this is very very valuable and but why
is he talking about Kanban as an
evolutionary change method and what is
up with operations reviews you of course
also state the the five principles which
also helped me align my term my thinking
about Kanban in a bit better way I'm not
going to go through the Kanban
principles as this is not an
introduction to Kanban but all in all
this seems to fit my mental model except
there's a few few outliers which I would
just pretty much ignore at this point
and so I would say something I couldn't
like I had to be faithful to what had
been done in the nose community around
Kanban so I couldn't state exactly okay
so I just want you to work like this
instead of how you work previously so I
had gotten the the change management
aspect of Kanban so I would initially
say something like okay so
that what you do now that's one of the
core values in Kanban do not change
anything initially but if I could just
get you to change these five things
initially out very very much appreciated
because I know that would get you to a
better place turns out that was that was
terrible advice but anyway nobody caught
on to it so for a while that still went
pretty good and I would start giving
presentations like again scrum is not
religion and adaptive adapted version of
the previous one
super optimized a July using Kanban and
lean Kanban version two results cannot
be ignored I had finally got some good
results doing this so the rule was all
good and fine and and I would tries to
actually apply this a to scrum teams and
what changed here during to the nine is
that instead of starting with actually
visualizing the typical Kanban board
where you would simply just pull one
thing in as you were able to take one
thing out of the system we would
initially change nothing about the scrum
process so now we're starting with the
real evolutionary change method and so I
can man board would look something like
this where things were you see this is a
typical scrum process in here you would
make things ready for sprint planning
you would plan your sprint and you see
the whip limits up there they are
applied to the sprint as a whole so we
pull items in for a sprint as a whole
and then we would continue to improve
this system over time and if that
sometimes meant dropping the sprint we
would do that and in other typical
situations we would actually keep the
sprint and we do some of the other
aspects of Kanban the optimizing the
holder looking at the entire system it
turns out that doing this without
changing the scrum process is a
fantastic way of optimizing your
distributed teams because this way you
get the whole value chain in there and
you get people from Malaysia actually
paying attention to what happens in the
business area and you get them actually
suddenly having discussions with the
business way earlier than they would
have had previously because it
not at the sprint planning meeting they
see things the first time you get to
apply policies like before you can pull
things in to sprint planning it has to
be evaluated but not just people from
Denmark but people from India and
Malaysia or whoever you're working with
and that just makes a huge difference
when they start calling the product
owner or the end-users directly instead
of having the team in Denmark function
as in kind of a hub where every kind of
communication has to go through so this
was pretty good yeah and I had to
acknowledge at this point that scrum and
Kanban are working quite well together
and that maybe Kanban is truly an
evolutionary change method that there
are no practices in there there are no
nothing telling you what to do there are
only principles for looking at your
system evaluating the system and seeing
where can you do things differently
where can you optimize flow where can
you make where can you improve
collaboratively good and then I read
John Ryan's book and this was my
reaction have I found the agile Bible is
this actually what it's all been about
from the very beginning and I just
hadn't realized it realized it it's very
very dense that book mind you it is 300
pages and I spoke to Don about this why
did you make it 300 pages oh yeah my
editor said that if I made it 600 people
pages nobody would buy it but it's
incredibly dense done yeah I kind of
took 12 years have worked and packed it
into 300 pages so it's incredibly dense
and it's not even targeted in the agile
space so Don didn't know at this point
that he was writing it for us but that's
what he's done so you have to read this
book and somebody just forget forgot to
tell him that he is in fact the agile
Jesus he is here explaining to us the
foundations of agile and why all this
works under the surface beyond just
doing just blindly doing test-driven
development or having sprint planning
meetings why are we doing this what does
it mean to be lean what does it mean to
manage optimize for flow
and effectiveness over efficiency what
why are we trying to eliminate
variability in software where when
variability is our only asset and that
we cannot eliminate variability without
also eliminating value so stuff like
that is something that will be
mind-blowing to to most of the people
that the read his books and it's much
more based on actual facts and economics
framework works that you would see in
another lean product development book so
I'm a huge fan of done no doubt about it
in 2011 I also started getting involved
in the Kanban community I went to the
Kanban leadership retreat in Iceland and
I even got to use the stand approved
Kanban trainer by David J Henderson
wasn't that nice starting to look a bit
like scrum with me so for me that was a
good thing I'm not a big social media
person it turns out I've tried children
as you see I've got my turret tag down
there but as you also notice I've got
more followers than I've got tweets I
think so that's a sign that I'm not the
blogger and Twitter I hope to be it
might change in the future it could be I
don't think it's very likely to happen
so for me meeting up with people
face-to-face is the way I expand my
horizon and I had a busy summer how many
of you have read my book not a whole lot
you should do that it's downloadable for
free at in fuku so you just go to that
side try priming Kanban and you get to
download it for free I think twelve
thousand have done that so that was
surprisingly a lot of people that that
found it useful and so I've wrote the
the priming kenmin book I thought that
would be my contribution to the crack
grander Adya the grander Kanban
community since it turns out that
blogging and trading was not my main
area of expertise and then finally it
happened there's just not there's not a
single or two or a few teams that I
think there was a lot of
team suddenly wanting me to help them
implement Kanban and my initial reaction
was yes sir we are so going to do this
and these are just some of the examples
of the many many Kanban systems I have
helped people design and as you will see
it is very very different and as you'll
see somebody tended to misunderstand the
concept a few times so you see this is
actually the queue it wasn't enough
space on the board so they just so they
just argued that it was better to just
have a small rope underneath the board
where they could hold their expanding
number of fights and so they didn't work
on we had to have a talk about that when
we when we did the iteration of the
other but what is also surprising when
you do this is that because there is no
judgment because there is no this is how
you should do things now and forever
because it's not a silver bullet
attitude it turns out that whatever
systems people come up with is
incredibly different like there are so
many examples and you learn so much from
helping teams do it and next time you
get to present these ideas as if they
were your own so you get a lot clever
because you learn from all the very very
clever people people out there so this
was very very good in 2012 something
very weird started to happen yeah
suddenly there were no people contacting
me for a Kanban a coaching assignments I
had no idea why but that's how it how it
went okay but on the other hand it was
very very much focused on scrum again
and I guess you can expect me to be a
bit confused as I've been able to put my
Kanban hat on and my scrum hat on when I
did actual training so during a two-day
scrum course I could keep my scrum hat
on for two days and I could faithfully
present what scrum was about the more
revolutionary approach to to change
management but actually going out there
coaching and doing real scrum
implementation initially I found it
pretty hot because I'd been so used to
Kanban mindset evolutionary change way
of approaching things and suddenly I had
to deal with organization-wide scrum
transitions we're not getting the full
benefit of scrum can you help restart
our scrum initiative and to be honest
the first ones who contacted me would
get answer yeah I think you're better
off with Kanban because that's really my
that's my hammer right now and I pretty
much want to hammer on everything that's
nearby including all people wanting to
do scrum and instead of focusing on
scrum you should really just use the
principle but it turns out that when
people are approaching you and they want
to buy something from you they expect
you to actually provide that service and
not to try to sell them something very
very very different and then I got a bit
schizophrenic and sometimes I would be
standing there and I wasn't really sure
if I was speaking to them about scrum
Kanban lean organizational change or
whether we were just participating in a
sprint planning session so if it was
confusing for them there's nothing
compared to how confused I was for a
short period of time and then something
very very weird happened it turned out
they were quite successful so we applied
scrum and we did it in a revolutionary
way we focused a lot on the mechanics we
introduced sprint planning meetings we
changed roles we changed processes we
restarted teams and they were quite
successful they didn't at all fall into
the trap of no this is an organizational
change initiatives I'm going to resist
it from now on and until it pushes back
and we're back to doing things as we
always did so it was working quite well
so again my mental model I'd now thought
okay so what we have been doing with
agile is basically just wrong instead we
need to do evolutionary change
initiative
as an organization is much like a
software project you cannot predict the
reactions of people you cannot plan your
way to success we need to do a dual
implementations in an or ads our way but
suddenly I was having a lot of success
doing the exact opposite so the mental
model shifted again and the question is
also how much evolutionary change can
you do in a situation where you're
starting things from scratch
somebody will add you very very little
and if you read some of the Kanban books
and Kanban blocks you will also learn
that Kanban is supposed to be applied on
top of an existing process so when there
is no existing process you probably
better off doing things where you get to
learn the mechanics and also it turns
out that again context is very very much
key so if you've got a team of young or
just very change ready people you might
be able to get off by doing
revolutionary change and you might get
to success a lot faster than had you
applied an evolutionary change method
like Kanban how many of you know the
Draper's model of skill acquisition can
anybody remember what it says as some as
one of the very very first steps where
do you start from in any when when I
crying any new skill yeah and what
characterizes a beginner yeah they need
they need basic rules and practices and
one day once they become an advanced
beginner they will start to challenge
those practices and they will learn that
putting your hand into the fire is a bad
thing but if there is nothing to start
with that might actually be the very
very best way of approaching an agile
transition and that just tells us again
that it's got much more ado to do with
how you approach change than the model
behind it and whether to do it in a more
revolutionary way or whether to do it
evolutionary depends a lot on the
organization and the people you're
working with and there is no just one
size fits all and that that counts for
agile change change initiatives as well
so this is how I currently perceive
scrum and Kanban and we could draw XP on
there as well it's not that there is no
initialization phase when you start a
Kanban change initiative there is and I
have experienced teams where just
visualizing your work proves impossible
because they were doing pretty much
everything except following whatever
guidelines had been stuck out by
leadership so if you've got a team of
people that are working against all the
policies in the organization don't count
on them to think okay the best idea we
could ever do is just put them out of
all for everybody to see and it's not
that they're bad people they're doing
this because they think that's the best
thing to do for the organization but it
takes change but we get there a lot
faster so if this represents Basecamp
so you have to get up here before you
really start to inspect and adapt then
what I've found is that the scrum
Basecamp is a lot higher up the mountain
and as some of you have probably
experienced some teams and organizations
they never get there I've been out on
consulting gigs where they've been doing
scrum for three or four years and
they're still not at Basecamp and all
they strive for is getting up to that
Basecamp
so you're not even paying attention to
their context they're still trying to
fit their own organization into the
scrum boxes and if you've been trying to
do that for three or four years and
failed may be used to start to look at
doing other things because chances are
if you never get to Basecamp you're just
going to be stuck doing scrum endlessly
and it's not going to provide you a
whole lot of value maybe you should
start to pay attention to understanding
the principles behind scrum
instead a but for some you will get
there very very quickly and you'll be
much higher up the mountain when you
start to inspect and adapt and for some
that's a really really very valuable
thing to do and I've also experienced
situations where we've had people that
were way too change ready to start with
an evolutionary change initiative so for
them to have to climb to Basecamp there
when they know they could get up there
absolutely at least as as fast that's
just not the way they want to do things
I had some problems coming up with the
right way of expressing how I currently
feel about these different relationships
and my current mental model and but
fortunately there are people out there
that a lot more clever than I am and I
read on liske X blog the following
statement Kanban works in a larger set
of contexts and scrum does even though
for a subset scrum might achieve results
faster there's still more similar than
they are different and I still like XP
too and I think that's a very very
beautiful statement because it captures
pretty much the essence scrum and Kanban
are not that different
they're both adaptable frameworks for
process optimization but for some you
reach your goal of process optimization
a lot faster by choosing either one way
or the other a but the ground principles
are still very very much the same and we
could probably all benefit from looking
at the XP practices as well how many of
you are doing refactoring on a
continuous basis a lot of you how many
of you are working with test-driven
development
not as much as you would expect
how many have an unsired customer okay
more than I would expect yeah so a lot
of teams found it beneficial to look in
the XP toolbox my problem with XP is
still that as a framework I'm not sure
it works that well it's simply too hard
to to implement right now I'm exploring
exploring new grounds so these are the
latest books I've read and you'll see a
presentation on the Lean Startup
movement up there so I'll save that for
later running lean is very closely
relate so that this book by agrees
presents the overall principles and the
other by as Rory gets into more some of
the more implementation details of
actually how to do this stuff in in
practice a trio Takata is a book about
how to yota approaches continuous
improvement and the funny thing about
reading that book is that that will
state that retrospectives are very very
ineffective retrospective is a hopeless
ineffective way of approaching
continuous improvement and so they
present some radically different ways of
doing it and argues that what people
have been trying to copy is the Kaizen
event that they've seen people do at
Toyota but what they haven't been able
to copy is the process behind that
Kaizen event and that the Kaizen event
is just the mechanic and not the actual
principle and what we're doing right now
with retrospectives would be the
argument from these guys I'm not sure I
follow them all the way is that having a
retrospective you're pretty much just
asking people to look at a situation and
fire with whatever problems or solution
they think would be necessary to make
the situation betta not with the
necessary metrics put in place to
actually evaluate whether it's true not
with the attitude where you get this as
a part of your actual culture but more
of a religious mindset where you aren't
really able to prove that you're getting
anywhere near in the right direction so
if you get the chance to try to read
that it's pretty quick quick readers as
well and provide some very very
interesting studies into how to do so
which is continuous improvement and of
course Jess Humber will also talk a bit
about continued delivery which I also
find very interesting no matter what
method you're using because be having
releasable software all the time a
provides a lot of value in terms of
keeping feedback loop type quality high
and being able to reduce transaction
cost and deliver fast in any type of
situation in 2012 I've also become a
part of the ilk Au accredited Kanban
training program it is not a
certification as I think Yuta mistakenly
introduced it as a bit earlier this is
in fact only a an accredited program
meaning that the program itself and the
trainer is of course accredited quality
but you do not get a role or a title
from participating you get do get a
certificate of completion but the reason
why is that LK you have stated that we
will only certify things that have an
actual evaluation of acquired skills and
we cannot do that in a two-day course
okay so my conclusion from the last six
and a half years and continues change of
metal model mental models is that scrum
is an excellent way of introducing agile
principles but be careful in thinking
that it's a silver booted bullet that
applies to all situations it might be
sold to you as a management framework
but there are a lot of practices and
mechanics in there as well so be careful
with that and be careful getting stuck
and disregarding organizational
resistance I've had the experience
coming into an organization where the
CEO told me whatever you do do not
mention agile and scrum because they'll
chase you out of there in a minute
because they've had and that had nothing
to do with scrum but that had to do with
how scrum had been previously tried to
be implemented so they had not at all
onda scrum implementation process for
them that had just been a series of
mechanics that didn't fit their
situation and they were very very much
against anyone trying to do that again
to me right now
Kanban is about global optimization
and how to deal allegedly with
introducing agile and lean concept in
most contexts whether you want to use
scrum or flexible scheduling pulling to
capacity pulling one item in as you
finish another is a detail that in most
situations can be deferred to later and
use whatever you're doing right now that
is not well you pull an item at the time
or you have sprint planning meetings is
arguably in most situations not the
things that's going to make a whole lot
of different terms of you becoming
success XP practices like test-driven
development refactoring user stories
unlike customers are all very useful and
they should be part of your toolbox in
your organization it doesn't mean that
they'll fit all types of teams
all types of people and it also means
that you have to be very very patient in
implementing this on one in one
organization it took more than five
months to have people doing continues
pair programming on a daily basis and
that was through a lot of stories on him
selling a lot of coaching and it doesn't
happen overnight you have to get very
very used to the way that way of working
you start people out by having them pair
program seven hours a day I can
guarantee you that they won't be of any
value after one o'clock anyway because
it's so stressful in the beginning so do
it in the ideal way and lean product
development to me represents some
powerful principles that help us
understand the underlying economics of
agile delivery but it needs a catalyst
to be implemented how many of you have
read the public books if you have any of
you found them to be directly applicable
to your context or situation with Chris
you're shaking your head why not yeah
I think one place she states that
test-driven development is very very
good if you want to deliver quality
software and it's very close to the lean
concept of poka-yoke a mistake proofing
you're like yeah okay that's good to
know
so it's a lean technique it maps into
the lean framework okay it doesn't
really provide you with a framework of
catalyzing introduction of these ideas
so in general thank you download this
book and then I've actually got a new
book called real-life scrum coming up
shortly
the text is written it's been through
proofreading it's about to go into
design and then I need a few people to
finish their four words for me but it
should also be available through the
info queue site or some other side
pretty soon so search for real-life
scrum and my name in a in a month or two
and it's it should be available and
since we are allowed to go ten minutes
over we've got ten minutes for for
questioning
so please just ask away because I have
to keep you here for another ten minutes
the question was what does it actually
take to get to the scrum Basecamp
what what kind of mechanics do you have
two principles to have to apply before
you add base camp and can start to
inspect and adapt and my answer would be
that first of all it depends a lot on
the individual organization some people
will state that when you have a fixed
sprint velocity when you're able to do
sprint planning in a day or or less when
you have a product owner a scrum master
and a self-organizing team that are able
to fully decide how they will implement
solutions then you're at the scrum
Basecamp some will also apply the fact
that you have to have visual sprint burn
downs that you have to have an agile
release plan so there can be a lot of
detail according to the the individual
context I can't remember what sales for
Salesforce provided what I think is the
best definition of the scrum Basecamp
but you'll have to look that up there's
a number of articles written on they did
them a very very revolutionary change
into scrum and they actually defined a
very very nice set of principles you had
to apply before you could be before you
could start to to inspect them that I
can remember them off my head but it's a
it's pretty tight and not too detailed
in long definition of how to but okay
other questions I have to keep you here
for another five minutes the question is
if it seems that most of the the
occasions where scrum failed or you
experienced scrum failing is because
there was a an underlying model of fix
cope fixed price and and fixed deadline
underneath it and that was actually what
put the pressure so much and the team
said they couldn't follow scrum well
they couldn't be agile and my answer
would be that in a few of the situations
that were definitely the context but
definitely not all of them I saw it as
much as the team's own pressure by
themselves to fulfill their sprint
commitment to get something out there to
meet the expectations of young of the
surrounding organization even though the
surrounding organization was pretty
flexible and that had they just provide
than data that would have shown them
that that okay we have a different
velocity now or we need to work on this
before we can refactor this type this is
part of the system to to make it
sustainable in the long run they would
definitely had the permission to do that
but still they would just change chasing
story points and they were becoming
story points machines even though there
was no pressure from the outside
organization to to turn them into that
so definitely in some situations but but
by far not all of them are the
difference in applying scrum or Kanban
in different cultures and I would say it
has a lot more to do with the people
than the the the culture in terms of
being of specific part of the world and
I read an article once stating that
there is a better chance of you having
something in common
with an engine computer scientist than
your HR person within your same company
that across the world IT people seem to
share a culture that is much more
similar than the person sitting next to
you in the canteen in at your workplace
and I think that's very true I think
it's more to do with the actual people
you've got there one of the funniest
experience I had was three guys and they
were above 55 years old all of them and
I came in to them and we're going to
implement a Kanban system work a change
model and you just expect that there to
be resistance and they were like this is
fantastic
how quickly can we do all of this and I
would they had some repetitive work
going on I would say all you have to
keep that in out logos on some all
scheduling system because that really
doesn't function well and a Kanban
system board and they're like nope
that's not really like this board
concept we want it all on the board so
like to sign their own scheduling system
as part of their Kanban board and put an
amazing a lot of energy into that and
when I met them again they were still
just like the most positive guys I've
ever met
so sometimes you you can be surprised
but I've also definitely met the
situation where I came in
and it took a whole two day of training
and coaching just to convince people
that this was
only a changed initiative and they owned
themselves where they had gone through
so many changes that just the word
change and just the word change model
and that they would be affected by any
kind of change
what attached to so much pain and
suffering they just didn't want to do it
I think the good story about that is
that I did some statistical analysis on
the very difficult situations I went
into and even in the most difficult of
context we managed to applying Kanban a
to have an positive outcome of in 80% of
the cases where I'm guessing that with a
lot of other more managed changed
initiatives it would have been as low as
10 or 20%
