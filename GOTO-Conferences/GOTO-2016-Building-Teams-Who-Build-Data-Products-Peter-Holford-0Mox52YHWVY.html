innovation team at worldpay and I'm just
here to talk today about building teams
you build data products so I gather
you've just been those have been
upstairs have been treated to a world
class runs through some incredible
examples of what you can do with data
science so that sounds like it was
pretty exceptional and from this side
when you go to when companies actually
go to commercialize their data a lot of
I love what they need to think about is
to is building products and the product
angles this talk is just about the need
for the product roles and input in
commercializing data sets so don't
distinction
so who knows who we are as well plays
anybody who doesn't know who we are who
doesn't know here we are okay so roughly
equal in the room and so we are a very
large payment acquirer so we pick up the
transactions from from the chip and pin
terminals from online and then we
process those through why the payment
schemes you would see as the leg on your
cards and through to the issuing banks
and then back and say your payment has
been accepted or sometimes not so that's
what we do we were originally part of
RBS and then were bought out and made
independent in 2010 and then we floated
last October and went roughly in the
middle of the 3100 so we are pretty
international as you'd expect from the
name so in over 140 countries and we do
almost half a trillion pounds worth of
have spend each year goes through our to
our platforms so one of the biggest
acquirers in the world so as you can
imagine we we also have a lot of data
flowing through every day or every
second of every day and so we need to
look at how we can make ourselves better
as a company and also how we can provide
value-added services and just little
note is under this is a software
engineering conference and so just want
to let you know in advance full
disclosure if you like slides that look
like this then you might be a bit
disappointed by this presentation
because it's most about the activities
the product side and human side so if
take a walk you very welcome but if you
want to take a walk and then come back
when it's in tech later fine but just
want to make sure people are cool that
was an awesome talk by the way I really
enjoyed it silhouette data
commercialization was kind of a hot
topic so people are talking about it for
a long time big numbers banded around so
this is a strategy and so what was
originally PwC and so report from them
saying that it's going to be worth 175
billion dollars back in 2013 I haven't
seen a report that said whether it was
worth 175 billion dollars in 2013 but I
think generally accepted that this is an
area that it's growing and company
looking at their data assets that they
have saying how can we drive additional
value out of these both to our existing
customers and also through new revenue
streams and new business models so what
that means is sometimes that that send
into consulting analytics bespoke
approaches but often those you're doing
it best look at it from more of a
product ankle may look at the product
that they can build from that so it's
worth a moment is excuse me to talk
about what we mean by data products so
when I took about a day to product the
obvious bits that it's going to capture
data going to run logic i'm just going
to deliver some output it also needs to
be scaled and repeatable and not manual
so this is something that actually you
know it works it can be this straight
through processing it's it you can buy
it and you can use it you don't have to
set it up in a big way it another
project is not a one-off engagement
ideally so I think of it has been
configurable as well so not just a black
box or something you can actually add
the user or the customer of it you
actually have some input into how it
works and then I also consider it to be
non-transactional so i guess what i mean
by that is I wouldn't consider digital
banking to be a data product because
it's largely a representation of the
transactions that are occurring when you
when you go online so I wouldn't
consider that to be a data product but
some of the other products you see that
help you track your spends so those are
but me when the when the actual action
that results from the data happens
elsewhere then that make some more data
product my personal favorite example
will be tipped it this is a is the kind
of a new take on how exercise works so i
know i am one of those people who
doesn't go to the gym i joined i have a
goal and then I don't go because it's
just too big a deal and I have lots of
other things to do and then Fitbit has
been for me something that I've actually
really taken to because it takes all of
those big decisions and sets them into
micro decisions have I walked enough
steps today have I done enough what can
I do in the next hour so to me that that
is them that's something that I've sound
very very usable who here has a Fitbit
or comparable products you fund the same
so to me it's been pretty powerful so
bullets really is its data capture so
thing on your wrist is capturing data
that kind of it already existed in the
form of your actions but it didn't
actually exist as it wasn't captured
many forms as data capture and then its
data presentation that's that's all and
there's a ton of logic to constitute
what what is actually a step what is a
heartbeat from the signals is picking up
but ultimately this is about capturing
data and then presenting it back to you
in a form that allows you to take the
decisions about what you can do any gel
same with City metha so 50 mapper is
kind of i'm going to use this a lot i
don't use it in French but my
screenshots that I try to take more nods
good sir Google help me up with these
ones so 60 mapper is basically picking
up where I am from my device and it's
picking up where I want to go from me or
from its memory of where I like to go
and then asking me is this where you
want to go and then it's given me once
it's worked that out it gives me some
options I can choose those options I can
configure those options and then once
I've selected one that even tracks where
I'm going and gives me route guidance or
so what I've been taking my oldest son
to the school we can you for an early
morning club and we've been on the bus
it's even tracks how many stops and
tells you when you need to get off which
is pretty good for someone like me who
missed the stops all the time so I find
that very powerful and then there's nest
so anybody have a nest in their house or
a hive or an equivalent so starting
pretty soon those minis fitbit's that
it's broken steel in the room I'm not
allowed to buy one yet because it's not
deemed quite um quite essential enough
in the health so i'm a bit gutted about
that but anyway so am so NIST is the
same source data capture state of
presentation that allows you to make
decisions that I should turn this thing
off this thing on I should cut my cut my
data usage back and it's also collection
so you've got here you know do you want
to go on this this particular journey or
advice and decisions you can make which
of course when it goes wrong can lead
something like this
and my view is generally if it gets to
something like this you've probably gone
a little bit wrong especially by the way
if you didn't even know they were doing
this and then it's been how on earth did
they know that moment so that brings
into the whole territory of creepy
versus done right and then another
another data product that's worthy of
mention is Kimber so it sadly pretty to
me that seems pretty defining in terms
of technology and what it does so you've
got customer preference gatherings I
swipe right that's white left it learns
what I do and don't like and then of
course that's at an individual level
learning and back to our thing about
data products of course the the
transactions happen in a different
domain to the app but probably best
leaving that point and of course there's
some of the best-known brands as well so
these are all ultimately data products
and I've included amazon even though it
sells stuff because they were quite
defining in terms of the the
recommendations the people who bought
there's also bought the stuff we all
know an experience so to me that would i
would consider the beta product if we
think about then companies that have
created a data product out of their data
assets so you think of one that maybe
took that and created a whole new
product revenue stream and actually even
created a whole new company out of that
it sounds like something quite up to
date and new to have happened that she
is one example that's one of my
favorites that happened in nineteen
seventy they created a data products
back in nineteen seventy to help them
with a particular problem which is for
great universal wanting to understand
the risk they were taking by giving
people credit for mail order goods so
effectively pay later activity to send
people things and then you you receive
payment subsequent if you want to
understand a bit more about the profile
in nineteen eighty its offered as a
service to third parties for anyone can
then use this service for their own
business and then in 2006 that got spun
out and floated as an independent
company into the 5100 any takers anyone
wanna
it's experience so means that when we
talk about data commercialization and
that kind of activity this is one of the
best examples and there's a company that
solves a problem problem with data it
had and built providers service to
others and then it became a company that
I think hadn't checked today or reach me
but I think is that she even bigger and
certainly had been at times bigger and
more valuable than the original company
which is now August so what are the key
steps in that so again this is quite big
blocks but a lot of status of other
companies when they approach building
data teams they focus a lot on the data
and analytics and then the the better
teams and the better practitioners are
really really embedded into the customer
needed or so if that's an internal
problem or that somebody else's problem
that I think I consult with my data
they're kind of focused on that as well
and this whole thing works really well
what is often under considered is then
the usage or the applications how do I
actually embed that into somebody else's
world how do i drive a decision for them
how do i how do I put it in the hands
what will they do with it so that I
didn't just give them a chart and a list
of things and they have to go and start
some projects in the room side and
cigarette hell on earth to act on my
advice but how do I actually embed it or
integrated with them so it comes down to
the roles in the data teams so said a
lot of companies when they approach this
they think about very different roles
and to be clear all of these roles as if
you don't have these people you don't
have a data team so in no way should
anybody think I hey I can just feel that
would put up do you need all this stuff
so the data scientist as you've just
seen the kind of stuff you can do
essential you've got the the engineers
getting it into order you've got the
governance you've got the qualities all
of that making sure it's all the lineage
compliance and and also analyst when you
don't have data scientist but your your
platforms are a bit more old school and
need a lot more analysts as well but
typically the product role is not
formally or overtly considered when
building out those teams
so taking our previous approach what
that can result in is something that is
a narrower focus so it really focuses on
having established a concrete
government's how do we turn that into an
abstract problem as quickly as we can
and then how do we use that to drive an
abstract solution which of course at
some point has to become a concrete
solution so that's that sort of it's as
much narrower focus to me the products
role within that focuses here so it's
helping define from the need and way
back from the the needs the important
stuff about you know how some what's
almost genuine problem is versus what we
think validating that through and
helping and really bridging so bridging
that into what what the data and the
others need is there abstracted from
their data set was my goal was my
challenge I'm solving and then
ultimately into from my solutions into a
concrete solution so the stuff you've
heard upstairs catching a serial killer
as a concrete solution to my prediction
of where they might be but that could be
you know 32 with going back to experian
the you know do you do you accept or
decline what is the score what you know
and a lot of those things are automated
so to me that product role is its do
thing so it's a mindset mr. skill set so
the mindset essentially and I won't just
read out everything that's here but the
month it really is about the ability to
take and hold the concrete problem and
go back to that when needed throughout
the journey of the know all the data and
all the analysis all the logic all the
testing everything else and then being
able to focus on how it needs to be
integrated and embedded at the end so to
me that is that is the the steering it's
a kind of partnering and bridging role
is keeping that concrete problem and
that concrete solution in mind that you
go through the entire entire journey of
your data science but also the skill
sets so I've set a bridging role but it
also involves capability in business
model design so you know there's a whole
whole new business model needed often
with this and and then you need to be
pretty up on design on experience on how
people are actually going to be able to
use your output
but that is not in any way to suggest
that they shouldn't be highly data
literate or tech literate and and that
something doesn't important thing there
should be very analytical technical
people this is not a fluffy roll at the
side this is very much an embedded into
the rigors of how you drive this stuff
so what are the factors involved in in
that the importance of a proper over
time so think as we go more towards
machine learning an AI to me that is
that makes the real world problem i'm
pointing it and how I how I deliver that
even more important because I otherwise
I have a black box that's gone unsolved
the wrong problem so the difference
between a car that knows the best way to
get to where I want to get to versus the
car that had its own opinions about
where it should go from where I should
go there's a whole other world of
difference so it's a pretty obvious
example but that's a know that as these
things right it becomes more important
similarly with the you know with
everything being connected so as as we
get two more you know things connected
things things talking to each other then
actually a lot of a lot of products will
become more automated and that requires
a lot more scalability as whole levels
of challenge to consider there and then
there's a lot of companies that are now
taking their big data platforms and
they're going from very much at the side
of the business as a proof of concept
into a to the heart of their business so
as they as they may as they look for the
value out of those investments then
they're looking more for the revenues
that come with proper product design
then the non-negotiable bit so we talked
about the ethics and should you ever
experienced something like that Google
moment but there is also the old so as
an estimate at the cartoons that there
is the the regulation and the
legislation so parking ethics reputation
all that stuff and experiences also the
non-negotiable bit of what you can even
do where you can reside the data how you
can handle it what you can store the
permission so that stuff is
that that is not reducing and then I
think you're going to experience the
convergence of digital and data teams as
well so more this stuff becomes how I
experience it how I embed it just is
then we talk about the the more
transactional products a lot of those
are going to be starting to leverage a
lot more of the data a lot more the
connective activity going on just look
at a few people that I think just have
been doing as well so I think there's a
general one which is the connected car
there's no single body is doing this
this is a lot of people as a bigger
there's kind of a theme emerging but we
think about those this this this is a
lot of data products being put into what
is ultimately they met very passive and
manual device up to now so so there's
everything from there gathering the
driving data to influence your insurance
premium based on how you actually drive
as well as what's happened in the event
of an incident through to where you are
at the car in a connected city to to
them a lot of stuff around you know what
you like to listen to and all that stuff
so there's a lot of everything that is
going into the connected car has a lot
more product activity into it that then
is driving a lot of the a lot of the
data science and the data gathering was
needed I'm getting a bit more into
business models so then there's this is
quite old services been around for a
long time but this is a rolls-royce with
jet engines so um you want to buy a jet
engine of rolls-royce actually what
they'll do is they'll rent you the
dollars per hour used so you're they're
charging for up time and for usage
rather than selling you this massive
heavy thing that you screw onto the wing
of your plane if you're an airline then
everything as it's in the air and on the
ground is monitored constantly in Derby
so they know I know the usage but
they're also tracking what's going on
with the engine they're tracking the
condition so if there's a fault wood ear
a fault with the engine then the ground
crews at the airport where the plane is
arriving are ready they know which
problem they're going to fix they don't
have to waste time investigating they
know the components they can be
completely ready riddle
and then the other thing is so say
there's a bird strike you know you're on
the radio I've hit a goose when I land
can you check me out please because it
didn't sound nice it sounded a bit ugly
those again have to have to check
everything enough to make sure the
planes okay well now they don't so there
are examples where they've turned the
plane around with normal time because
they've been able to alert the ground
crews that despite the bird strike there
was actually no damage to the jet engine
so that has become a massive time saving
costs save for airlines passengers
ground crews so rum said that it's been
very powerful so when you look at you go
back to the results of this as he
they're making more money out of renting
the engines than they were out of
selling them and that's to the same
people so how does it make sense to be
renting an engine and for an airline be
paying more in rent and I would be in
buying there's a cash flow efficiency
which is a factor but but actually if
you consider what they've done is
they've they've looked at a lot of the
consequential costs in an impact in the
business of downtime in the jet engine
and they've brought some of that benefit
in so they can charge more because they
save you money overall as an airline if
you don't have to pay all of the staff
we compensate all your passengers pay
the exorbitant landing please I'm sure
I've not like things were originally but
I'm sure they're not cheap for staying
longer at the airport all that stuff if
you've saved those costs then you're
probably going to pay more to your
engine supplier who's been able to save
you that time and help you turn around
more efficiently so I'm wasting
Diagnostics all gone so what they've
been able to do with this business model
is they've looked at what it's actually
worth rather than necessarily what its
cost and they've been able to charge
more overall to the service and they
were for the product so to me that's
pretty powerful then all of these are in
the public convenience as a good please
look into more so then skype it's good
what's guys doing is pretty amazing as
well so um who hears the sky customer so
they know a lot about you from your
usage of all the boxes and the apps and
everything else I know what you've seen
they know what you'd like to watch them
at what you plan to watch they know
whether or not an advert was shown or
not showing they know if you skipped it
so what they were able to do with that
behavioral data as they're able to then
do media evaluation so what was the true
audience so going from a small panel of
surveyed people or people who have
agreed to have a box in their home into
a massive panel of empirical history of
adverts that was shown or not shown
including to whom with the demographics
and the viewing preferences of those
people not just that but what they've
started to do is they've gone beyond
that so with ad smart they're now in the
beginning of a shift towards selling
audiences instead of time slots so if
you want to you if you use ad smart you
don't have to say I want to have a slot
during Breaking Bad and that kind of
correlates the sort of audience I want
to capture and I know there's some
leakage to others what I can actually
buy from you is the audience of the
people by demographic and by lifestyle
factors that I want the advert shown to
and it will go to those people and it
will not go to other people and you can
do it during any program so any program
during their own channels but that's a
big shift and that's a much greater
level of efficiency and this platform is
available for SME to use as well this is
not just for bid players when you go
look on the site SME can use it it
actually democratizes these of them TV
advertising a lot more and then actually
love this guy so hearing him talk um
grimmer he thinking of the shoe he's a
dekko he thinking of the shoe as a
platform if the shoe can be a platform
anything to me a platform right here
that says this is going for me no think
of it it's not just a passive product
that i've sold to someone and i hope
that by their next shoe from me or and i
probably i don't even repair the shoe
someone else repairs the shoe if it
needs repairing but i hope to sell them
the next shoe so he's gone beyond
thinking I'm going to enable it and
gather some data and make it a smart
product he's even gone beyond I'm going
to then connect that and make it a smart
connected he's thinking of that other
platforms that had a way abstract from
the shoe in
the thing you do with the shoe and how
do I give you much more around that of
which the shoe is incidental so I don't
think that echo are renting people shoes
and then taking them off and renting to
other people afterwards I've not heard
that that's happening and I'm not sure I
would want to be part of that either and
so I think they're still selling the
shoes but what that does is that opens
up many more value adding subscription
revenues and that things that are
helping the user of the products not
just and ultimately people are willing
to pay more and consumer for that so as
a quick whistle stop tour through I
think a lot of when people when
companies are thinking of
commercializing data some of the things
they need to think about and why I think
the product role is important in that so
I think that's actually become more
important over the next few years so the
reason is building new business models
as we've seen is really important to
that so so if I'm thinking of
commercializing my data do I need a
whole new business or do I need a new
activity and how do I do that and what's
the value I can actually drive from that
rather than just charging for the output
the ability to focus on how I make that
scalable and repeatable so this is a
very much underappreciated and my
observations from all the companies I've
come into contact with it is frequently
underappreciated activity in in in
commercializing the data and then I
think there is especially as you move
towards machine learning and AI there is
the right balance of of low friction
with not being a black box and the
ability to configure so if I think about
it talk about Fitbit you buy a Fitbit
you take it out of the box you do two
taps on an app you plug it on your wrist
and you walk and it works and then you
can but you can configure it endlessly
so you can change the threshold on which
it buzzes on your on your wrist each day
to from 10,000 steps to 20,000 or 1,000
or you can even change what it buzzes on
so does it care more about calories does
it care more about minutes of minutes
and cardiac zone so you can configure it
endlessly but you don't have to this is
not a big setup job you don't buy it and
then embarked upon a long manual reading
exercise of the sort that we used to do
me bought electronic devices so I guess
the thing is to go and find the most
data savvy product people in the
company's you're in around about and
started partner with those in stock
being together that thinking so that was
them that was my my my little talk on
that but there's a few more things I
just wanted to run through about us so
it being a software engineering
conference wanted to talk about just a
little bit briefly about things to check
out so go check out our online dot
worldpay com so this is a payment api's
is very developer focus and the feedback
I've had it is very developer friendly
it's something we also use internally
for our own innovations as well so we
have a lot of experience in using that
and then we talked about the Internet of
Things and so we've got Connor sitting
here with one of the folks leading this
we're thinking ahead on connected
devices into actually what's the role of
payments within those so that's going to
become something that's really really
important as this takes off a lot more
so socially how do you do payments with
in terms of Internet of Things so three
weeks ago today there's a bunch of
people appeared in New Zealand house and
we we set challenges and it was actually
really well attended and so people got
they got lots of Lego they got a lot of
raspberry prize they'd brought their
genius and their skills and then they
set to work on creating stuff and this
at one point was the highest trending
hashtag in London am i right and it beat
the West Ham game so maybe Russell Brand
wasn't there that day but uh there was a
as a pretty big achievement the team's
really proud of and and as an idea that
the winner so I don't know if you won on
his lego building skills but then but
the the winner was a guy who created the
whole way of doing payments for my
renewable energy sources that I put my
cellular panel my wind tunnel on my
house so that I can understand the load
balancing generation and usage and
and actually think about programmatic
payments to and from so so some really
cool stuff that was actually working and
created up there and then one final
point so you probably walked past it on
the way in but please visit our stand if
you haven't already and if you haven't
already then enter the prize draw to
hopefully win a drone and Hardy was
trying to get the bottle of wine so
speak to hardy and she promises not to
drone on so anyway that was everything
that I had to talk about I've tried to
speed it up to catch time back so that
people don't lose their break thank you
very much for coming and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
