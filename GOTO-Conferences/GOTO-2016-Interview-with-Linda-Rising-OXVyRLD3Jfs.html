here with Linda rising what are you
currently working on i'm here at the go
to berlin conference and I gave the
morning keynote this morning and it has
to do with an area that I think it is
important which is how we make decisions
and in particular this talk folks
focused on how we make decisions about
who we trust why is trust so important
or why is the keynote about trust so
important for tech people well one of
the things that we know is that we
constantly judge other people as soon as
we meet somebody when we here for
instance that they're from the United
States we wonder since there was an
election recently we wonder did they
vote for that candidate or the other
candidate so that as soon as we find out
that information we can classify them
and put them in a box and put a label on
it so we all do that all the time and
what we know is that that label for that
person gets in the way of our
interaction with that person and in
particular on a technical team if we
think for instance that someone is not
smart or not able to do the job we don't
have any respect for their abilities
that they will know that they will sense
that and that in a way we make them less
capable we make them stupid now if
everybody does that and if everybody is
doing that all the time it's going to
have a major impact on what that team
can produce if we all believe we're
wonderful and if we all believe we're
the most intelligent team ever then
we're going to strive to meet that
expectations I mean stereotyping just
means that you're making your own
judgment about another person it can be
a negative stare
type or a positive stereotype and as to
what you can do about it the answer is
nothing because we do it that's one of
our hardwired tendencies we can be aware
that we do it and question those
stereotypes if you evaluated somebody's
performance to say I don't think they
are a good member of the team you might
question that how do I make that
decision how did I reach the conclusion
that this person is not capable of doing
his job or her job so questioning your
evaluation standing back and trying to
be as objective as possible is one way
of trying to get past it but it there
isn't anything you can do about a
cognitive bias so one of the strongest
for instance is the confirmation bias
and that plays a part in stereotyping
and the confirmation bias prevents us
from even seeing any information that
would go against the decision that we've
already made the confirmation bias is
one of our strongest and it keeps us
from wavering once we made a decision
then usually we only can see here read
appreciate be open information that
confirms what we already believe okay
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
