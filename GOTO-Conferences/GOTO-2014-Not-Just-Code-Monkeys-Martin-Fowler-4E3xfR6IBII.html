tell you what I'm gonna talk to you about
but here I wanna kind of go in a 
little bit of a journey with you
that's not gonna necessarily.... 
I don't wanna tell you where we are going
so as a result there's no clear title, 
but the journey begins
with one of my big frustrations with 
agile software development
I mean, the agile revolution 
has had a big impact
and it's been remarkable and 
very gratifying to see the impact it's had
But there have been frustrations
And there's one particularly 
big frustation that gets at me
Now, one of the benefits of agile
it's in the days before agile thinking
we had this notion that if you wanted to
build software you have to come up with
everything you wanted done
put it together in some great document
and sling it over and build software.
And we know how well that worked.
and it's very good but the agile world
next splitted things up
breaks things down into independent
little units of capability
often called stories and then build
those stories one at the time
and by building the stories one at the
time
we get a lot of benefits: we're able to get
feedback as to where we all going,
we're able to see our progress
and in particular we're able to steer,
we're able to change direction as we learn
and that's of course a vital part of what
this whole thing is about
but there's still a problem here
and the problem is that arrow there.
The notion that the stories
are given from some kind of Business
Analyst kind of role
handing then to developers to code up
but the development team ends up being a
passive recipient of stories
and I come across this great deal 
in different places
both in Thoughtworks and outside
where developers basically see
themselves as we're an engine
to turn some stories, maybe some rough
tests, into actual code.
We build whatever we're told to build, we
don't really get involved
in thinking about what it's will to
the building.
And this is very much against the 
idea that was at the heart of
pretty much all of the agile founders.
If you get a bunch of people from 
Snowbird together and you say
What do you think, that, you know,
that developers should be just building
what they were told to build?
They will be horrified!
And... when we were coming up 
with names to agile...
hmm... Kent suggested
because at the time we didn't have 
the term agile software.
We needed to come up with 
what word we use.
We ended up picking agile, but one 
of the suggestions that Kent came up with,
was the word conversational, because he
thought that the essence
of this approach was these conversations 
between the development team
and the business people about all aspects
of software development
including what should be built.
And the idea here
is that developers and analysts
should collaborate together to decide
what stories should be built,
instead of the analyst
feeding stuff, or the business, feeding
stuff to developers, it should be just
too, I think.
And a little example of this.
I think illustrates it quite nicely.
There's a story
and this isn't gonna story from Amazon
where one of the developers thought that
would be a really good idea
to, when people are working in the
shopping cart,
to put 'you might like to buy so and so'.
You know, by analyzing what they've bought
By analyzing all the data that they have,
some suggested items that you might wanna add.
And the businessperson involved 
said 'no, no, we don't do that because...
...we don't want to distract people while
they're shopping in shopping carts, right?
Because, you know, what is the most 
important thing for Americans? Shopping,
exactly, so you know,
'focus on the shopping cart!'
Now, this being Amazon, the developer said
&quot;no i think he's wrong&quot; and so he actually
built a version of the shopping cart
with the suggested things in there
and ran A/B tests.
And was able to prove, 
by looking at the numbers,
that it increased revenue. 
And being Amazon, that you know,
businesspeople said &quot;well, yeah, we can't 
argue with the numbers&quot;, so they
carried on doing that. And now is 
that notion of collaboration.
As software developers
we are familiar with the software world
and what software can do
which means we can come up with ideas.
There's no rule that says all the stories 
need to be developed by the business.
It's true I think that they should
prioritize them
And they should have the final sign 
what gets built in what order
but the ideas that you come up with,
are often based on collaboration.
I remember a story of,
an early ThoughtWorks project,
where we're doing some stuff with the database
and they did a little demo early on in the
process, and that was just showing
all we've got this information in the database. 
And they were showing the customer
and the customer looks at the data and said:
&quot;Hang on, if you've got this data there,
could you answer these questions for me?&quot;
And they had a conversation and
the developer was thinking SQL queries,
and the business person was
thinking business process
and they figured out: 
yes they could do this.
And he said, well I've never asked this,
but actually if we could build this,
which seems to be trivial,
that actually justifies the entire 
cost of the project right there.
I never even thought of coming up 
with that requirement
only in the conversation did it come
together.
And so, conversational stories,
the idea that we should work together
and collaborate to come up with what we build
is a fundamental part I think of what
agile ought to be about.
And that's, of course, the whole notion of
things like monitoring and AB tests.
We begin to explore what should be built
by actually watching what people do.
That's, I think, 
a really big step forwards.
But in order to do that, 
it's important that developers
get a better knowledge of 
what the domain is about.
Because that knowledge is vital 
to be able to do this.
And this is one of the areas 
where, I think,
we've been a bit disappointing 
as a community.
In that we haven't put enough effort
into trying to know about the 
domain we work with.
I remember talking to a friend of mine who
was a project lead on a team doing some
really interesting scientific work
around genetic modeling
and he was very disappointed that most
of the programmers on this team weren't
interested in finding out more 
about the genetics.
They weren't interested in the science,
they just wanted to be told what was built.
To be really effective as a software developer,
I think you need to understand that domain,
get to find out how it clicks 
and how it works,
become knowledgeable in that domain,
and then,
you can really influence what would be
the most useful software to build in that domain.
You'll never gonna know as much
as the expert in that domain.
When I worked in health care,
you know,
no one's gonna ask me to become a doctor
just because I've done some 
computer work in the area
but that knowledge I did have 
was very valuable
in collaborating over 
what to do in terms of the software.
And in fact, when people 
come to me for career advice
and they say, &quot;should I learn
Scala or JavaScript or Clojure...&quot;
I say well it's less important 
about learning about languages,
they come and go...
Learn the domain that you are working in.
and they are not really that different
when it comes down to it.
That is a very useful skill,
and even if you end up moving to some
completely different domain later on,
the knowledge of how to learn domains
and how to work with them
is gonna be something that's 
gonna be really valuable for you.
And as well as knowledge,
I think that also brings in another thing,
which is responsibility within that domain.
And here, I wanna bring up a topic
that you might have heard of.
something called &quot;Dark Patterns&quot;.
&quot;Dark Patterns&quot; is a website that
it's really about help people 
use the user interface.
encourage users to do things that are 
actually not in their best interest
Simple example of this:
imagine again with shopping cart, we are
buying some electronics items, you know
a new camera or whatever.
And the people who run the web site
say, &quot;oh, he's bought a new camera&quot;
Well, I know what I'll do, I'm gonna 
put insurance for that new camera
and I'll put it into the shopping cart,
automatically.
The user didn't ask for it,
They weren't offered a popup
that says &quot;do you want insurance?&quot;
So user says: &quot;why would I buy insurance
on something I can afford to replace?&quot;
&quot;This is just a money spinner for the
retailer, isn't it? No.&quot;
No? What instead they do? 
Just pop it in a shopping cart anyway.
Now of course I might notice that 
shocking item in the shopping cart
and remove it, that's perfectly okay,
they make that possible.
But they've put a thing in the shopping cart
without asking me deliberately.
Now that is manipulating 
a user to doing something
that's not probably in 
their best interest.
Similar thing is, if you
have something where,
&quot;hey, sign up for free!&quot;
And then I have this recurring
30 dollar-a-month billing thing
and they make it really really 
hard for you to cancel.
You know, you got this form and that form
and you know, half of the time 
you hit the button
submit button for the cancellation,
you get a 500 error...
I mean, that is often bad, and 
sometimes is done deliberately.
Those things are dark patterns, 
and I think, we as programmers,
have got to make explicit 
the active rejecting this.
We need to be advocates for our users.
And my point here is:
If you write code for that dark pattern,
if you wrote the code that slips the 
insurance into the shopping cart
without the user asking for it.
You are every bit as responsible
as the person who asked you to do it.
We are responsible for 
the software we write,
both good and bad 
of what goes in there.
Now I'm not necessarily saying,
you know,
if somebody asks you 
to do something like that
you should automatically quit your job,
otherwise you're a bad person.
You know, I know everybody has to
balance a lot of things in their lives
and all the rest of it,
but you are responsible for the 
decision to write that code
and you have to balance that
responsibility across everything else.
Too many developers take the 
point of view which is...
...it doesn't matter what I code,
I just follow orders.
I just code what I'm asked to do.
I don't think that is good enough.
I think it is important that we, 
as developers, say
what we do is something that 
we're responsible for.
We have to take that responsibility on.
So, dark patterns surfing 
an obvious case of where
we have to think about 
ourselves differently, and say:
we need to be advocates for our users.
But I think even goes further than that.
I mean, so far I've talked about a
relatively small world
of users and analysts, 
some programmers...
developing software, 
coming up with things...
But, of course, 
that software and our users
are making an impact upon the world.
And we're also, 
in part degree at least,
responsible for that impact.
We have to say what impact is our software
having on the world around us.
And that can affect, again,
what we choose and where 
we choose to work.
In my younger days I spent 
a bunch of time working in healthcare
and I had the chance and did some
consulting work in the City of London,
in the financial industry.
And I was quite keen to do that, because 
financial industry is quite interesting.
You know, this weird 
financial products
intellectually interesting thing to work at.
But having worked there for a while,
I realized I didn't wanna work 
in that kind of place.
Because I didn't really feel that what 
they were doing was giving value to the world.
You could tell it from the way 
they treated their customers.
As far as they're concerned 
that customers were
a little bit more than just people 
to be taken advantage of, you know,
what thing we sell them in order 
to get some commission for us.
There's never any thinking in their heads
as to easy actually gonna be good for
them.
Very different when I worked 
in the health care area
where the doctors and nurses I talked to
were very much concerned of what was 
in the patient's best interests all the time.
So that led to a reaction 
from me that said:
&quot;No, I don't think I want 
to spend my talent...
...supporting an industry and activities I
don't think it's beneficial in the world.&quot;
Now we're in a privileged position
in software development.
Now we have comfortable...
We can fairly easily get
comfortable jobs
You know, without any danger involved.
We're not going down mines or 
packing meat or anything like that.
We're not likely to be,
do physical harm to ourselves.
If it might be a little bit of our side.
Which is actually not 
something to trivialize but...
...it's a hell lot better 
than chopping your arm off.
Well, I mean, that's what happens in
a lot of meat-packing areas,
particularly in the States.
You know, we get well paid 
for what we do.
And I think we have a certain degree of
responsibilities, say:
Where are we gonna apply our talents?
Because, in the end, we are 
responsible for using our talents
to, hopefully, make the world 
somewhat of a better place.
Now I'm not necessarily saying 
everybody should stop what they're doing
and go build hospitals in India 
or something of that kind.
But we should say:
&quot;Is what we are doing useful?&quot;
I got barely on this talk once,
and somebody came up to 
me afterwards and said:
&quot;you know, it's very tackling what you're saying,
but, you know...
.. I'm not doing sort of any 
particularly socially useful work...
...I just build, right, printer software.&quot;
Before I could even answer,
the guy behind them said:
&quot;yes, but printer software is useful.
I just had to buy a house...
...it was really useful for me to be able to print 
out all the forms for that house, on my printer...
... that saved me a lot of trouble, 
it made the whole process a lot easier.&quot;
You know, something as
humble as printer software,
is valuable stuff, right?
It's an useful thing that 
makes people's lives better.
On the other hand, if you're 
writing a software that says
&quot;I'm gonna say that we've run out of ink
when we've still got a quarter ink left.&quot;
That's a dark pattern by the way,
then that would be about fake.
But the point is you have to 
say, you don't have to be...
...contributing to a charitable 
cause or something like that...
... to be making the world a better place.
But I think it is important for everybody 
just to reflect on, you know,
how is the software I'm writing 
having an effect on the world?
Is it good or is it not?
And we all make individual decisions
about what things we would support,
and what things we shouldn't.
But what is common across all of us,
is we have the responsibility,
We fought, we take the responsibility
for the choices that we make,
overall in our careers.
Well, the last area that 
I want to talk, to say,
bring up this responsibility thing, is...
... the very big picture.
What impact is all of our software,
and our programming and our profession
having upon the world, in aggregate.
And there are two areas where 
I'm really concerned about this
and where I think we, as a profession,
need to work much much harder 
to improve things.
The first of these is 
the alienating atmosphere
that exists and pushes many people away
both from our profession 
and from using software.
The most obvious example 
of this is the fact that,
all you gotta do is look around 
this room and say to yourself:
&quot;Hmm, there aren't many women here rather.&quot;
That is not a good sign.
I mean, we, when I got 
into the software industry,
one of the things that appealed to me
about the software industry
was the notion that it was 
a meritocratic world, right?
It didn't matter the fact that
I come from a working class family
in an industrial area of Britain, 
you know, and I wasn't, you know,
I had a fairly good 
education, but, you know,
wasn't brought up with 
the refinements that
you know, somebody 
more up-class would have.
What matter is: 
&quot;can I produce good code?&quot;
You know, that meritocratic 
quality is a nice thing
and it will be a good thing to see 
it more broadly in the world
and less emphasis on inherited 
wealth and class and status
and more emphasis on what 
kind of good work you can do.
But any statement that 
the software industry
is a meritocracy, 
is rather undermined
when fifty percent of the population is
so severely underrepresented.
On top of that, that means that
there's a lot of really good talent
that we're not getting into our profession,
which is a terrible waste
both for our profession, and especially, 
for the people who, otherwise
would have a good, would have been 
able to take part in what we do.
And it's particularly compounded 
by the fact that a lot of the people
that are pushed away from our 
industry, are people in groups
that have suffered hundreds 
of years of discrimination.
And that's true for women,
it's true for Afroamericans 
in United States
It's true for a lot of lower 
cast people in India...
It varies depending on where 
you are in the world,
as to what groups tend 
to be pushed away,
but it's common.
And we have to fight against that.
I mean, you can't not look at what 
goes on in the web at the moment
without seeing many cases of 
where groups are pushed away
and alienated, 
and we have to fight against it.
And it's something we all are 
responsible for doing.
The fact that we ourselves, individually,
might not be acting like jerks,
doesn't mean that we can 
just ignore the problem.
This is phrased by an Australian general
made famous through a Youtube video, says:
&quot;The behavior you walk past 
is the behavior you accept.&quot;
And I think that is very true.
If we allow people to be folks on the Internet,
and push away various groups,
we're, in the end, complicit.
So we have to figure out how to stop that.
And that's not just within the professional world.
That actions also in our software.
One of the big problems that people face
is harassment, for instance on Twitter.
And it troubles me, that the engineers
and the data scientists at Twitter
haven't found ways to try 
and reduce that harassment.
I mean, we can come up with all sorts
of clever ways of targeting advertising
Why can't we use at least 
some of that brain power...
...to figure out ways of 
preventing online harassment?
We should do that.
That's my first issue
We need to do something about the
alienating atmosphere around in our industry
The second issue is privacy on the Internet
and the fact that we need to act
to ensure that we have a free Internet
where we people can collaborate
without fear of persecution by governments,
or tax by criminal groups, etc. etc.
I'm not gonna say much more about that now,
because is a whole talk that I'm 
gonna give with Eric later on
in the &quot;Defending the free Internet&quot; section
and please come along to that if
you want to hear us
going a lot more detail about why
privacy is important
all of us whether we think we have
nothing to hide or not
and what we can do about to fix it.
So, let's come back to this question:
What's the title of this presentation?
How do I sum all this up?
Well, basically all I've been saying
in this last 20 minutes
it's... we won't, we don't think
that we as developers should be just
code monkeys bashing out code.
We should be a profession,
just as doctors are a profession
or lawyers are a profession
and we should look for that kind of status
in what we do and we should also 
take on the responsibilities
that that status implies.
That means we must engage with the world,
reject this stereotype of software developers
being people who live in basements
and they just fed pizza under 
the door every so often, and say:
&quot;No, we can engage with the world,
we can help steer the world 
in a better direction.&quot;
I mean, our software does that anyway,
but often does it without the developers
playing an active role in that.
I think the developers 
should play an active role in that
we all bright people, 
we are well educated,
hopefully have a sensible view 
of the way the world should be
and potentially can act as leaders
as to help the world can be run better.
But in order to do that,
we need to take the responsibility 
to step up and do that.
And my request to you all,
is to think about ways 
in which you can do that.
Small or large, individual or combined with others.
But taking that responsibility
and acting as leaders in the world.
Thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
