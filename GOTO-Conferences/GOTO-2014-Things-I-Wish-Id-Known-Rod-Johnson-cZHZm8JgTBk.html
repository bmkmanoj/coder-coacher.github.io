some ways this talk is possibly a little
strange because this is talk is about
things that I didn't know and you know
there's probably a convention in
conferences that people who are up on
stage at least pretend to know things I
think one of the takeaways from this
talk is that the process of being an
entrepreneur and running a business or
even evolving your career as an
individual contributor is a process of
getting by without knowing a lot and
being strategic about how you can accept
the fact that there is going to be a lot
of learning that you're going to have to
do continually so essentially this is a
talk about my personal journey because
it's taken me in a very unexpected
through a very unexpected set of steps I
started out as a music academic I had
studied mathematics and computer science
it's in the university but I found
myself with the scholarship to do a PhD
in 19th century French piano music and
teaching at this Sydney Conservatorium
of music I then went into being a Java
developer gradually got promoted to at
least having a chance to undo the work
of other people's incompetence and
decided that there was so much
incompetence around j2ee at that point
in time that I actually needed to write
a book about how possibly things could
be done better that of course led to
spring and getting involved in open
source and that led to being a
co-founder of interphase 21 as it was
then which of course became spring sauce
spring sauce of course was acquired by
VMware in 2009 I stuck around for a
couple of years as an executive at
VMware being an executive at a ten
thousand person company was an
interesting experience that I'm not
likely to repeat and now I find myself
essentially back working with startups
so there were some familiar
that I heard in the track listings for
example neo technology on the board of
neo technology in fact I'm chairman also
on the board of elasticsearch typesafe
and a couple of other companies so the
interesting thing to me about this
journey is that there is no way on earth
that I could have predicted it I mean I
came from a semi-rural community on the
edge of Sydney Australia I knew less
than zero about the history of the
software industry and you had a program
and I obviously was familiar with some
of the major software products out there
but I knew nothing about how this
industry worked it's been a fascinating
journey personally in terms of some very
memorable hires and some even more
possibly memorable lows so I remember
for example being particularly happy
that spring won in 2010 was the first
time I think that the conference had
exceeded a thousand people and that
frankly was a pretty big buzz I do
remember having this strange experience
where I realized that every single
person staying in the hotel was actually
there for the spring conference so I
mean it had its downsides because there
was a certain lack of privacy I couldn't
even get in the elevator without people
looking at me and thinking about whether
they wanted to talk to me or actually
talking to me but it still was a pretty
exciting and rewarding feeling to think
that we actually created something that
had an impact on a lot of people and
also that a lot of people were excited
about it I think it was about the same
conference where I really first
reflected on the fact that my
co-founders of the company had really
become pretty close friends and you know
there was definitely something about
being on this journey that was very
satisfying I think and I'm sure this is
true of anyone who's created a
successful open source
project there's a lot of satisfaction in
kind of changing the world making
something a little bit different I think
in our case it's hard to remember that
things like dependency injection and
POJO programming were controversial and
radical and even considered crazy ten
years ago you know regardless of whether
or not people use spring which obviously
an awful lot of people do we did win the
battle of ideas in enterprise Java and
that that was that was pretty exciting
and of course we built a successful
business I think the for me the primary
reward of that success was not financial
it was in the fact that it had benefited
quite a lot of people so I mean I
actually do we perfectly honest feel
more satisfaction about the fact that I
think you know our team did well out of
it collectively than I do about you know
me personally and I mean another thing
that I think is important about the
financial side of it is it's a
validation there is an important
difference between people using your
software and people being willing to pay
for something and it's really nice to
actually achieve both of them on the
negative side of the ledger there were
some incredibly intense lows probably
the worst for me personally was
struggling to pay our employees in the
UK in 2006 obviously the founders like
Jurgen Colin and myself went for
extended periods of time without being
paid I think Jurgen had the record
something like five months without being
paid I didn't go quite so long because I
actually had a mortgage so I needed
money a little more frequently than that
but related to that was the realization
I had that partly this was my fault and
there were things mistakes that I'd made
that really you know we're contributing
to the
company being in a very shaky situation
so that was very very sobering so I did
a lot of self-examination thought I made
the right person to be CEO and seriously
considered stepping down and eventually
lifted my game and I think what from
that but it was it was a pretty pretty
stressful period another point that I
think was definitely the lowest low was
when the financial crisis hit having to
lay off people this one was quite
different because it was not at all our
fault I don't think there's anything
that we've done that contributed to
having to make those difficult decisions
but I mean really nothing nothing feels
worse than lying in bed with the flu as
I happen to have at the time because it
was in winter going through a list of
people and knowing that you know
probably 10 to 15 percent are going to
have to be let go on the one hand you
know that's the right thing right it's
if you have the ability to give secure
jobs to 105 people or go out of business
with 125 people at one level it's an
easy decision
but it still is about the worst thing
you can possibly do in your professional
career I mean I've fired plenty of
people in my career I'm not overly
sentimental about it I feel almost
nothing in firing someone who is not
very competent or doesn't work but when
you get to people who are good people
and you know it just feels absolutely
terrible so that wasn't a whole lot of
fun fortunately we turned the ship
around pretty quickly and I think we we
handled it in a fairly good way so you
know we went to extraordinary lengths to
try to make this at least as fair as
possible that it was still deeply deeply
horrible the other thing that was both
good and bad but had a lot of bad in it
was the fact that you do work your butt
off constantly so
was constant travel I really did not
have any hobbies outside work my wife
still complains that there are at least
three years where I literally never
talked about anything's at work and I
think she's correct
I really had pretty much no interest in
anything except work in my children I
think I did make an effort to do things
with the children but besides that
forget it no television hardly ever
going out with friends no hobbies all
gone and that obviously was also true
for my co-founders so my goals for this
talk that you know a bit more about what
it means to do a start-up and if you
choose to do it you make your own
mistakes rather than repeat the mistakes
I made there's a great quote from this
chap Bobby Fisher who of course was a
great chess player about 40 450 years
ago
Bobby Fischer was not renowned for his
tact so there was one tournament where
he'd just beaten someone fairly easily
and after the game they were playing
over the moves again which chess players
pretty much always do in tournaments and
the opponent was saying if you know if I
hadn't made that mistake it could have
been very different and Bobby Fischer
looked at him and said buddy if you
hadn't made that mistake you'd have made
another mistake and it's not the most
tactful thing to say but it is true so
yeah one of the important takeaways
right here is if anywhere in this room
does a startup you're gonna make loads
of mistakes just trying to make it more
interesting than repeating some of the
mistakes that you know I or other people
have made so really it's not about my
journey it's about your journey there is
an interesting cult of the entrepreneur
which i think is rather overwhelmingly
strong at the moment and to be honest
I'm a little bit
cynical about it there are angels there
are incubators there are articles on how
absolutely awesome it is to be an
entrepreneur you can't get on Twitter
without being drowned in this kind of
stuff a lot of it's true it is an
awesome experience but I think one thing
to bear in mind is that it is actually
usually a sign of a bubble when people
get that excited about both Silicon
Valley in the process of being an
entrepreneur in Silicon Valley the truth
is a little more complex being an
entrepreneur is probably one of the
greatest experiences you can have in
your life but success is highly visible
and failure is often invisible so what
we say is very scared we say people who
very often don't even talk that openly
about the things that sucked in their
own journey at least I'm willing to do
that but you know people who failed
often just disappear so you know we
don't hear about those stories so often
there's also a assumption I think that
entrepreneurs are necessarily more
worthy than other people you know I
think there have been many great
contributions to civilization by people
like Albert Einstein who were not at all
entrepreneurial so again I think this is
one of the Silicon Valley bubble things
so the assumption is that unless you're
an entrepreneur doing a start-up on
something there's no way you can create
anything of value in reality it's a
unique and rather painful lifestyle
choice and it has very high cost
financial cost you are not going to
maintain your lifestyle period you're
probably doing it wrong if you're
maintaining your lifestyle because
either you'll be self-funding at first
or you'll have small amounts of angel
funding or you're paying yourself too
much and I think that's a good idea
because that hurts the entire business
even after you get to venture funding
you are not going to earn what you would
earn as a good technologist if you do is
something wrong with your approach
so you were going to have a reduced
quality of life you are going to need to
prepare to abandon all your hobbies go
into therapy with your girlfriend
boyfriend wife or kids and probability
is not your friend the likelihood of
failure is very very high and you do I
have to ask the question how would you
cope with that it's not necessarily
disastrous you might look back on it and
think you know what it was really worth
doing
we tried I'm proud we tried was a great
experience but I think you have to
accept that it's partly it's partly luck
Jay Paul Getty who at the time was the
richest man in the world write down his
formula for success and it was rise
early work hard and strike oil there is
a considerable element of luck in all
this okay so at this point maybe I
haven't scared you off maybe you're
still interested in doing a start-up at
some point well here I have some
concrete advice be methodical you might
have an exciting idea it's important to
pursue that exciting idea in a boring
and relatively predictable way you
really want to innovate in technology in
a startup you don't necessarily want to
innovate on the business side you may
want to innovate on the business side
but you also very likely want to make
sure that you go through a structured
process that may sometimes seem very
boring when you're excited about your
technology firstly you should identify
your problem you should figure out who
you are going to join forces with the
tackle this problem but you're not going
to do it on your own
need to set up a company structure
create and maintain a plan and choose a
funding strategy let's walk through this
these steps in a little more detail step
one is the problem
investors invest in problems more than
solutions let's imagine that a team goes
into an investor and the team has some
great technology but it's not clear
exactly what problem that solves that's
a big problem in itself that's a
different kind of problem that's the
kind of problem you don't want to have
let's imagine it's a good team they've
identified a problem for a lot of
customers and their solution may not yet
be quite right highly likely they'll be
able to work with the solution and get
it to the point where it effectively
solves the customers problems so one of
the biggest dangers is falling in love
with your technology and forgetting that
it's only going to make you money if it
solves problems one of the this is
probably the most important part of the
whole thing because this is where a lot
of people go wrong and there's a few
common traps people fall in love with
their idea and they start writing code I
love writing code in fact like I think
like many of us I love writing code so
much that it Adil's my brain I literally
get carried away I want to solve those
technical problems I want to make it
work and it's very hard for me to step
back and think am I actually doing the
right thing so be careful of jumping
into a purely technology focus until
you've really validated that you have
the right problem how do you validate
well firstly be as skeptical as you can
possibly be yourself and secondly talk
to people I think it's usually an
enormous mistake for people to keep
their ideas to themselves that chances
are that you're not going to patent your
idea and if you do want to patent your
idea you're evil anyway so they're
really if you for example think that oh
if I tell people about my idea they're
gonna copy it that tells you something
about your idea
your idea is so trivial that someone
else can come along and copy it
that's quite revealing
so in general seek all the input you can
and don't hide from it so one of the
problems that I've seen people exhibit
is they kind of close up if anyone says
anything critical they kind of think oh
he doesn't get it she doesn't get it and
that's not a good way to be that again
tells you something another kind of
business definition smell if you'd like
he's being unable to come up with an
elevator pitch someone asks you what is
your company going to do and it's like
you know that is not good if you can't
distill it down it tells you something
another useful check with respect to
validation that is actually quite
obvious but I personally didn't kind of
explicitly realize and I learned it from
Paul Moritz who at the time was CEO of
the EM web is make sure that you're on
the right side of history so for example
if you are betting forget example
against the continued success of Amazon
Web Services your thesis is better be
really good because it seems to have a
lot of momentum if you're bidding for
example against open source you better
have a really good explanation for why
that's going to work so you know look
and analyze whether or not you are
aligned with major historical forces
that are likely to contribute to your
success and have a thesis so don't think
well we're gonna build this and people
are gonna buy it why are they going to
buy it because it simplifies something
because it makes them more productive
how does it fit with their needs so this
is where you skip a gear you've done all
your questioning so you stop questioning
and you really start executing like
crazy
this man was a very fine example of this
he had an unbelievable Drive which
people describe in terms of phrases like
messianic sense of purpose and reality
distortion field so I think you have to
start off by willing being willing to
question everything and being quite
unsure of whether what you're doing is a
good idea then you do it 150 percent
until you start doing something else so
at this point essentially you're going
into battle and you don't go into battle
unsure of yourself you might review your
tactics and your strategy every so often
but you don't do it in a half-hearted
fashion this I think is a fascinating
balancing act for startup founders on
the one hand they need to have a mint
certainty they need to be focused like
hell they need to believe that anything
is possible but on the other side they
have to be willing to question anything
and to listen to input that is very
challenging for them so essentially
executed a hundred and fifty percent of
whatever you've decided to do until you
stop doing it be willing to stop doing
it when you think about what it is that
you want to do I mentioned the idea of a
thesis or you know some reason that this
is likely to be successful there's
another important reason to tie into
some kind of historical trend or big
picture and that is what for one of a
better phrase I refer to as the moral
dimension I don't believe that people
are primarily motivated by money even in
startups people can be motivated by
money but it's kind of limited right
there is a limit to how good money is
ever going to make you feel it's never
going to give you a sense of purpose
it's never going to give you a sense of
satisfaction that you know I did some
little
thing that was good in the world so I
think it's very important when you have
a bad day in a startup to be motivated
by things other than money to know you
know there is a reason that we're doing
this it's not just to make money we're
doing it for example to in our case it's
spring sauce it was reducing complexity
freeing the world to the greatest
possible extent of websphere which was
obviously a massive moral good
increasing competition in the market
empowering end-users so you know the
latter two bullets for example you can
see how uber many other companies are
aligned with those kind of forces it's
very important it helps your team pull
together and it helps people feel that
this is a worthy cause this is something
they can feel happy and proud about the
inverse of this of course is that you
shouldn't do anything that makes you
feel at all uneasy if not only if you're
doing something that you don't feel
particularly proud of well you shouldn't
have been doing in the first place but
bear in mind that's probably going to
get worse over time if you have a
conscience that at the very least is
just not going to be very satisfying
I mentioned the point that you know you
will have bad days and sometimes it's
important to be able to motivate
yourself on such bad days I'll give you
here a free piece of motivation you can
draw on if you're doing a start-up
you're probably trying to disrupt
something and compete with some large
companies occasionally you'll get scared
and think oh my god they could throw you
know any amount of money at this they
could throw any amount of people at this
absolutely true don't feel at all bad
about it never under never overestimate
the ability of large companies to
execute because so often their apparent
strength see their weaknesses for
example they can
throw any number of people at it they
will be guaranteed to throw people at it
it's somewhere in that mix will be
people who are purely bureaucrats and
have no interest in doing anything
except preventing their colleagues
achieving anything this is true of every
large company I've observed closely that
I mean possibly the collage company of
which it is most true traditionally was
Microsoft where essentially they used to
devote much of their time to competing
with other groups internally rather than
competing in the marketplace I think
it's possible that the Microsoft culture
is changing now but historically I mean
if you talk to people who were there
over the last 15 or 20 years it's it's
just stunning the level of rivalry and
nastiness between groups so you know
this is a great thing for entrepreneurs
just think that yes they will try but
there are many reasons that they will
probably mess up one of which is of
course the fact that they have conflicts
between different strategic goals
I mean Christensen's whole notion of
disruption that I think is very true ok
so next step build your core team first
thing you need to do to build your team
is understand yourself you need
predominantly to understand what you
suck at because if you just hire people
who will like you and are included the
same things as you're good at your
company is not acquiring any new
competence that's very very bad so you
know this where I said that in a 506 I
missed a lot of things up one of the
principal things I learnt from that is
ok I need to get that expertise that I
lack I need to get people like that
in-house and I need to learn as much as
I possibly can from them as well as
empower them to do what they need to do
so you really need
build a complementary team around you
and you need to periodically re-evaluate
how your task has changed how people are
performing and what new skills you might
need to bring in the mix this is another
interesting balancing act because in the
same way that entrepreneurs need to be
balanced between certainty and willing
to certainty and willingness to reassess
they need to be balanced between ego and
humility it is frankly not normal to
think that you and your colleagues can
change the world or you know completely
disrupt some space that requires a great
degree of essentially ego but it needs
to be combined with self-awareness or
the result will be disaster
so you know you need to be very
confident about what you're good at if
you are not more confident than the
average person you are not the right
person to be pursuing an entrepreneurial
path but you need to look at what you
don't know and what you suck at and you
need to make that a key element of
building out your team you also need to
look at the alignment within your team
so for example do you share the same
passion do the same things motivate you
do you share the same aspiration for the
company use one person what a little
lifestyle business does someone else
want an IPO that isn't going to work do
you share the same commitment to work
does someone want to work 9:00 to 5:00
and have every second Friday off while
other people want to work 100 hour weeks
these are the important things that you
need to get clear and get alignment
around you also need to get alignment
around a meaningful culture the behavior
and character of founders is the most
important thing that contributes to
corporate culture if you consider for
example the fact that Oracle is a
relatively aggressive company in terms
of you know for example the way it sell
the way it approaches competitors lauric
oracle has been headed by Larry Ellison
Larry is an aggressive kind of guy it's
even when you get to a company of that
size the fundamental driving
personalities kind of model and show up
all the way through similarly with
spring sauce one of the key founders was
Jurgen hurler Jurgen has a unearthly
commitment to code quality and that I
think was one of the biggest factors and
the fact that we maintained a pretty
damn good codebase it wasn't so much
that you know there were formal policies
it was that people wanted to be like
yogurt people felt excited that they
were going to be held to a very high
standard setting up company structure
this is a little bit boring perhaps but
I'll briefly mention it don't skimp on
advice don't do it on the cheap designed
for where you're going rather than where
you are now and there are many things
you can get wrong you really need to pay
for professionals around things like you
know companies set up don't optimize the
tax in a software company unless you
definitely convinced that this is a
lifestyle business and you're just going
to you know run it for cash flow
there's highly likely to be some kind of
liquidity event in your future and
whatever you've done to optimize for tax
is going to be irrelevant to the
acquirer and may make it more complex
so generally tax optimization is a bad
idea think about where to locate the
headquarters and this is a really
interesting point where the certain
kinds of business Silicon Valley has to
be seriously considered I mean one thing
looking at the startup scene in Sydney
where I now spend most of my time there
are quite a lot of entrepreneurs doing
things that I think have a pretty
Oh chance of success in Sydney you're
not going to build a social network
based in Sydney if the world needs
another one anyway but you know
something like Facebook for example is
probably not going to come out of
anywhere except Silicon Valley and there
are a number of reasons for that
there is the access to funding there's
the executive talent that's available so
you know there are certain types of
business where location is going to be
very very important create a plan this
is another one of those things that may
seem somewhat boring and you know when
people think of plan they think of God
big document bureaucracy doesn't have to
be like that it can be quite informal
and I don't I've never seen what I
regard as the ideal format but you must
have it and it must be a living document
so the same as any documentation you do
about your software you need to keep it
up to date so that people don't ignore
it I firmly believe that there's magic
in writing things down when you write
things down it's one of those processes
like trying to teach something to
someone else where you suddenly realize
hmm I'm not quite sure I fully
understand this and you can go a long
way if you don't try to teach someone
something and you don't try to write
something down you can go a long way
without noticing that you don't fully
understand something or that there are
big unanswered questions so I mean I see
this now I'm involved in quite a number
of startups and it is surprising in
early-stage startups how many haven't
adequately written things done once you
have a plan you can think about a
funding strategy this depends on the
nature of your business
and obviously the plan that you just
created so for example if you want to
run a lifestyle business that could be a
very fine thing to do but don't seek VC
funding because you're setting yourself
up for conflict visas are only
interested in hyper growth some of the
biggest mistakes that I've seen around
this a founders are too concerned with
lucien early on pretty much all founders
including ourselves it's bring sauce are
too concerned about dilution there is i
think a fairly widespread belief amongst
technical people that investors are evil
and as I said there's potential
misalignment of goals between founders
and investors dilution is generally not
a big problem dilution is less important
than the scale of what you're going to
build so dilution essentially means how
much you own of it what you're going to
build means how big the pyres people get
either rich or well-fed by eating from
big pyres rather than hogging all of a
small pie so if you fixate on what you
need to do to pursue the opportunity
fully you will ultimately find that's
you know a higher order bit than
fixating on how much you own of the
company one interesting point about
dilution and whether or not investors
are evil every successful entrepreneur I
know even if they have the ability to
self fund comes back and raises venture
money when they do a new company and I
think that tells you something about the
potential values beyond money of
investment remember you probably need
more money than you think
anyone remember Hofstadter's law from
girdle lesha buck it always takes longer
than you think especially if you can see
the Hofstadter's law this is this is
pretty similar it will always take more
money than you think especially if you
consider that you need more money than
you think so engineering estimation has
had hard we totally suck at it as an
industry it's embarrassingly bad so you
know you think that the companies you've
worked for about it it you're probably
going to be
battered it as well so imagine if you're
three-quarters out that would be bad
unless you have enough money imagine
that you've got to a revenue stage and
you have a couple of bad quarters you
want to be able to survive that fairly
comfortably
also remember unfortunately that
spending will go up when you raise money
you should control it to the extent you
can but the fact is people's behavior
will change you will find for example
that people will start sneaking through
things like Iran chairs
unless you have a really good financial
controller so the world does change a
bit and money goes out the door faster
after it's come in the door in the first
place funding options first thing to do
is educate yourself there is a wide
choice out there so there are classes of
investors such as friends and family
angel VC growth equity there are
structures such as plain equity
financing convertible notes you need to
know this stuff and you need to find
mentors that you can trust to talk
through it with also bear in mind that
investor location can be very important
European investors are different to US
investors East Coast investors in the US
and different to West Coast investors
there is a very big range and you need
to understand what you are dealing with
with respect to seeking investment it's
important to understand how the game
works people often make the mistake of
thinking that they are only going to
need to raise one round of financing
very very seldom true so the first round
of financing you raise is not going to
be the last and it's not going to get
you to an IPO or other liquidity event
what it is going to do is get you to
some other place and at that other place
hopefully it's a good place to raise
more money
so essentially you raise money in order
to raise money again
and the valuation of companies tends to
fluctuate over time because investors
aren't very rational so you really want
to raise on a promise great example of
this is launching a new product
sometimes companies when they're just
about to launch a new product get a
higher valuation then when they've
launched the new product and it's
successful because at that point people
are starting to do math and thinking
this is really good they're going to
sell in units of this and now we can
work out what the margin is on this and
what the gross is and they come up with
real numbers you never want that when
you're seeking investment you want to
sell hope you don't want to sell
anything based on real numbers this is
how the entire technology industry works
fundamentals is not where it's at I know
it sounds very cynical but there is a
lot of truth in it so you need to choose
to be valued on promise as much as
possible I mean obviously as you go on
you have to build a real business it's
not like you can get away with promise
forever but there are still always going
to be fluctuations in your valuation and
when you're selling as much hope as
possible with this little emphasis as
possible on numbers that's going to be a
great place to be you will be married to
your investors so choose wisely you
cannot ever get rid of them once so for
example if you have any conflict with an
investor going into it don't don't sign
the contract this is going to be a
problem you know people are very nice to
each other before they get married at
afterwards you kind of see there's a
fuller in frança exchange but on the
flip side the value of a good investor
can be
immense if I look for example at what
was contributed to SpringSource by Peter
Fenton and Kevin F Rosie our two lead
investors I learned so much from those
guys very smart people they see a lot
there's a lot of pattern recognition
good people to kind of strategize and
problems with so bear in mind the value
of that expertise as well because it's
far more than just money you can afford
to get a lot of things wrong so it's
quite remarkable and surprising actually
how many things you can get wrong and if
you're prepared to make a course
correction but just bear in mind that
making course corrections can be
difficult because you've got if you're
going in a different direction you've
got to persuade all the people that you
had really excited about the last
direction that they should do something
else there are a couple of classes of
mistakes that you really should avoid
and I think there principally people
mistakes and legal mistakes if you
really want to blow up your company
spectacularly combine the two so for
example get disputes amongst founders
disputes with employers you really can
mess things up much faster with people
than with respect to technology you can
rewrite technology you can't rewrite
people legal details matter this
gentleman on the right is Ronald Wayne
who sometimes referred to as the third
founder of Apple
Ronald sold 10% of his Apple stock in
the late 70s for $2,300 because he was
concerned about a legal risk he was
concerned essentially that he was
partnered in an LLC with two guys called
Steve and he thought they were both
crazy and he was worried that he would
be liable for debts they would incur
because he was right that they were both
crazy but he could have used a corporate
structure where he captured the upside
without the downside and it would have
been called a limited company so you
know a little bit more sophistication
will
- you know pay a bit more to set it up
properly as I said obviously he could
have had a very different lifestyle
today he lives in a very modest house in
Pahrump Nevada which have been - it's
not an exciting town and he sells stamps
from his home prior to spring sauce one
of our founders failed to gain
$1,000,000 in options because a legal
agreement at that company had been
screwed up if he'd been a US citizen he
would have got 1 million dollars he was
Canadian he didn't get it so these
things can really matter ok
a few lessons from SpringSource now more
specifically about our experience we got
some big things right the technology and
vision remained true and obviously
resonated with the market so we were
very clear on what our elevator pitch
was it was simplifying Enterprise Java
and we stuck with that as our strategy
evolved we also did very well on the
team dynamic side we had a very stable
team hardly anyone left particularly
from the engineering side everyone was
highly committed and you know of course
there's conflicts in within any group of
people but fundamentally people liked
and respected each other and we
functioned pretty well as a team we got
quite a lot of other details right as
well
one of possibly the most important was
maintaining product quality as I
mentioned Jurgen was a huge factor in
that Jurgen created a culture and lead
by example which caused other people to
probably write better code than they'd
ever written before and feel you know
just great about themselves as engineers
we did very well in raising money we not
only got a good valuation in each round
as I mentioned we got some fantastic
investors and that really contributed a
lot to our success and I think we did do
a good job of realizing where we sucked
and bringing in people who didn't suck
in the same ways
so for example we brought in a lot of
expertise in sales and marketing and
Finance that enabled us to do things in
the business that we could never have
done purely within the founding team
this is a very important point you need
to expand the gene pool of your company
so one of the companies I've involved in
I'm involved in now is largely composed
of exceptionally bright people who went
to MIT and they're great and fairly
early on one of the first questions I
asked was can you please hire someone
who didn't go to MIT because you really
at some point need to hire people who
have different experience different
strengths and weaknesses if you keep
hiring people who are the same as you
you are going to end up as a company
very distorted really good in some
things and really bad in others I mean
it's a it's exactly the same as you know
diversity is a general issue diversity
is a wonderful thing because if you have
people who think different you are
creating a company that's more resilient
so you know if you find yourself in a
particularly challenging situation it's
likely somebody might have the answer
but if everybody's the same kind of
person it's quite likely they won't have
the answer we made a lot of mistakes in
the early years we thought far too
little about the business
we knew our technology was great we were
really excited we wrote loads and loads
of code and we built what we were
excited about rather than what customers
would pay for I think we did a good job
in the open source community but I'm
talking here more about you know our
first attempts to build commercial
products we decided for example we got
very excited about DM server we built a
product that essentially had a tiny
niche because we were in love with the
technology and then needed to try to
convince customers that they had a
problem it's not the way to do it
remember the problem comes first if you
ever find yourself having to struggle to
convince customers that they have a
particular problem you should do
something else
because that's a really bad warning son
in the early years we didn't always have
a business plan and we didn't have
financial projections my points about
setting up company structure clearly
come from personal experience we spent I
think about two hundred thousand dollars
cleaning up the things we messed up with
respect to our company structure and one
of the reasons for that was that we were
geographically dispersed we just had no
idea how difficult it is to have
founders on multiple continents and
customers almost all over the world we
also were unfamiliar with you know
Silicon Valley conventions so we didn't
put in an option pool before Series A we
had inconsistencies and contracts we
fixed all those things but it was a
painful and wasteful process to have to
do it why did we make these mistakes
predominantly inexperienced the second
bullet is a mistake I'm not sure what I
meant there but I think the biggest
factor was that we were excited over our
technology we just got up in the morning
and thought whoa this is great we're
having such a great time writing code
that we didn't actually focus
sufficiently on the business
geographical distribution was another
massive factor and this is something
that's particularly relevant in open
source open source companies bring
together even founders from different
Cheers
that produces some really interesting
challenges also lack of a good mentor I
mean a example of the strengths and
weaknesses I mean looking back I knew
absolutely nothing about how Silicon
Valley worked I knew nothing about
building a business plan I knew very
little about management and I knew very
little about how you create and maintain
and evolve business models and you had a
right Java code and I was had some
consulting experience and could
communicate but you know the negatives
were pretty damn massive and I didn't
realize that at first how I could have
solved that
have been getting a good mentor this is
one of my favorite far side cartoons
where the cow guru is wearing the sash
and the calf is sitting at his feet and
the cow guru is saying as you travel
life's highway don't forget to stop and
eat the roses so I really needed a guru
who is going to tell me essentially what
things not to mess up partly based on
experience so you know one of the best
things you can do early on is obtain one
or more really good mentors people you
can trust
we didn't make some truly destructive
mistakes we didn't have disputes between
our founders I think we did a good job
at maintaining the trust and respect of
our user community and customers and I
think that was because we kept our core
values in mind you know we didn't sell
it and we did maintain discipline in
terms of you know letting ensuring that
the burn rate never became excessive
that you know we we ran the business in
a sound way we also were careful not to
let big customers take control of our
roadmap this is incredibly destructive
to small companies Wall Street banks are
generally the best at this what they
will say is mmm yes really like that
like how it does X if it did Y that'd be
great we'd buy it if we do it did Y so
you build Y you go back and they say mmm
that's really good you know if it did
Zen we definitely buy it if it did Z as
well as X &amp;amp; Y and this is a guy in that
I mean these people do with a degree of
premeditation and it can destroy small
companies so we didn't fall for that one
we also avoided the mistake of being
nasty people and running a nasty company
I think I maybe this belief is a bit
naive but I believe that
really matters in business it really
matters if you behave in a way that you
know people feel comfortable with you it
really matters that you're always seen
to be ethical it really matters that
you're as nice as you can reasonably be
because everything does come around and
I'm not saying that you need to be a
wimp you I mean you can compete with
other companies fiercely without being
unethical or needlessly pissing people
off so I'm certainly not advocating
being mild-mannered to the point of you
know not trying to crush all your
competitors
I'm personally obsessed from that with
that as any of my co-founders would tell
you but you can do it in a relatively
nice way let me give you a couple of
examples of this through my career the
first is one of the prominent company in
the enterprise Java space tried to
recruit me in 2004 that discussion did
not go well it was a 20 minute
discussion the first 19 minutes were
kind of unsolicited recruiting and when
I very politely said no they're followed
one minute of threats where this person
said if you keep telling lies there are
going to be consequences and it was like
a broken record so I said I don't think
I'm telling lies when he said if you
keep telling lies there will be
consequences and he looked at me I swear
a red light came into his eyes it was it
was almost scary and so eventually I
couldn't go I thought I was gonna break
out laughing so I looked down at this
guy and said what are you gonna do hit
me is not a very large individual it's
just but you know I think the central
point here is that there was absolutely
no reason that even if we competed with
that organisation there was no reason
that it needed to be personal and
afterwards I must admit the you know
every so often I would get up and my
motivation for the day was we're gonna
beat those guys so bear in mind that not
only
is it going to be a challenge in terms
of your ability to work with people
later if you piss them off but if you
piss them off your actually motivating
them to compete with you more vigorously
another rather similar example was a bit
later it was the first acquisition offer
we had in 2007 it was actually a pretty
fair offer and we considered it and we
politely declined the AVP who'd been
driving this offer was incredibly nice
about it and that was all fun but there
was a cop dev VP on the call who really
was quite angry that apparently this you
know this little company wouldn't comply
with his wishes and so he signed off on
the call saying so you want to roll the
dice and I wasn't that bothered about it
but one of my co-founders was absolutely
incensed about it and it's just not
smart you don't need to do that you
don't need to give people extra
motivation and I mean I must say that
you know I think we ended up costing
that company hundreds and hundreds of
millions in revenue and it kind of made
me feel good that we not only rolled the
dice but it didn't actually work out the
way they wanted it to work out so you
don't need to do things like that
another positive example of the right
way to do it one of the investors that
we turned down at spring sauce in favour
of benchmark I am working with now I
actually got this investor involved in
the company and he is making a fantastic
contribution and there was no ill-will I
mean I was very open with him about why
we made the decision that we did that we
felt the right thing was to move the
company's headquarters to the Bay Area
and you know I actually obviously gave
him a response he didn't want to hear
but I did it in a way that preserved a
personal relationship and not only does
that feel good
it's actually very important in the long
run so since spring sauce I've been
involved in quite a number of other
startups which has given me you know a
different perspective many of them
represented here so I think I'm out of
time now so I can't really say anything
about the more recent lessons I've
learnt but you know it's been a mixture
of learning new things and seeing over
and over again some of the importance of
those fundamentals so you know I hope
that one of the things that you would
take away from this is that discipline
is important a lot of it may sound
obvious a lot of it is obvious maybe
it's too obvious because people often
forget these simple steps
remember that doing a start-up is risky
and is not it's gonna be a crazy roller
coaster ride and may not make you happy
focus on the problem before the solution
remember just about everything's about
people not technology always maintain a
written strategy and plan I think there
are lessons here even if you're not
interested in doing a startup there is
no longer any such thing as a secure job
every one of us is an entrepreneur in
our own career so a lot of those ideas
around competitive advantage building
networks maintaining relationships
actually having a plan for where you're
coming to invest that in plot applies to
even individual employers so the ways
you can get ahead a very similar in
terms of profiting from disruption also
I think it's a very important skill for
developers to be able to assess the
prospects of startups you may find
yourself considering a job at a startup
think about some of the things I've said
do they seem to have a good plan if
they've got a good elevator pitch do
they have a funding strategy that's
coherent a lot of but is their founding
team a cohesive team are they all the
same kind of people or have they brought
in different skills those kind of
questions are very important in making
that assessment and finally one of the
really exciting things both from an
entrepreneurial real perspective and
from a personal perspective is that in
today's world an individual developer
can make an immense impact so either as
an individual or you know in a start-up
with a bunch of co-founders the impact
that you can personally make is
radically different from the impact
that's a software developer could make
25 years ago so whichever way you go
about pursuing your working career I
think this is probably the most exciting
time in history to be a developer so we
don't really have time but this is a
very quick yes or no question that came
in so do you think it's a good idea to
do a startup with a friend cause
personal relationships seems to always
make it difficult to take professional
and rational decisions mmm that's a
really really interesting question and I
mean I've seen I've seen this work and
I've seen it not work so there I think
doing a start-up with a friend makes
sense if you've done a start-up with
them before so for example with someone
you've worked with before maybe before
you were friends and you're now friends
yes I think it's safe to do another
business with him because you know how
they are under pressure I think you just
need to be completely explicit and
completely honest so for example one of
my company's media the two founders are
very close friends they've been you know
either at college together or working
together for most of the last 15 years
they hang out a lot socially they I
think have an amazingly good grasp at
what each of them is good and bad at and
they can correctly separate those
relationships I mean I think you
absolutely need to discuss it it's you
know it's something you need to be very
upfront about for example you need to be
sure the
if it doesn't work out that it isn't
going to destroy the friendship
