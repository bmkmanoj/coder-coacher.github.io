morning I appreciate you all spending
your mornings talking about such
thrilling things as management so I know
there's two words don't really usually
go next to one another but as an
engineer it was sort of interesting
going from solving code problems to
solving people problems and it was
infinitely just as interesting as the
software that I was developing so a
couple quick things
it's always helpful to get feedback you
know continuous experimentation I would
love for you all to tell me how this
talk sounds you know what am I missing
what are the holes that I need to shine
a light on so please rate the session
and let me know what you think and then
please do that favor to the other
speakers that you're going to be seeing
today and tomorrow it's really helpful
for all of us so as I mentioned my name
is Courtney hempel I'm a partner and a
technical lead at a company called
carbon 5 so we're a consulting company
we work with lots of different companies
on lots of different types of software
all different stacks and deployments and
all the good stuff kind of like you just
heard Adrienne talk about and what I
found was that over time you know I went
from being an individual contributor an
engineer writing code during the day and
doing pull requests and working with my
team and planning stories to slowly over
time you know leading those teams and
mostly leading on the engineering side
right helping to make decisions on
deployments helping to do bigger sort of
architectural decision making and then
finally I ended up it almost happened
overnight I had a direct report I all of
a sudden was dealing with a human with
problems and problems that I needed to
find solutions for and there really
wasn't a book that I could go to there
wasn't like an O'Reilly book for general
management for engineering so I was a
little bit lost and I was a little bit
flailing around so I really put together
this talk because I believe that there
are a lot of skills that we develop as
engineers and that we sort of come to
the table with as software engineers
that apply really directly to great ways
to help lead teams and to help to manage
people and then the other reason I have
this talk is that you know as a
consultant you get an opportunity to see
dozens and dozens of companies write
hundreds of individuals and teams that
sort of pass through the doors of
company and within those you always
expect you know the really brilliant
minds from Google that have tons of
funding from some VC you're like oh
that's that company they're gonna be
amazing they're gonna do great things
I'm gonna watch the my Pio in five years
but that's not always actually what
happens and what you start to realize is
the things that make great products the
things that make successful companies in
this world it's not the typical things
you would think colocation tons of money
resources you know enterprise companies
that have data at the wazoo it's
actually really great general management
that great creates teams that create
effective products and those products
that create brilliant companies in this
world so I'm gonna talk a little bit
about that situation and one of the
complications which is again there's not
great resources you know MBA doesn't
really teach you to be a great
engineering manager there aren't a lot
of resources and then on top of that
hiring as we all know is incredibly hard
right high learning great technical
people is hard hiring great managers of
technical people and leaders of
technical teams is infinitely hard and
then it's compounded by this sort of
loyalty problem so this is a
representative software sample from the
San Francisco Bay which is where one of
our main offices is and this actually
though according to studies done by
Deloitte McKinsey this is representative
of a lot of companies universally now
people just don't stick around as much
average tenures are around two to five
years and so we really have this problem
of attrition really really high
attrition at some companies and keeping
talent around long enough to develop
some of these skills and the interesting
thing is one of the statistics that came
out of these studies is that a lot of
the time the reason that these people
are leaving it's not because of lack of
salary or equity or all of these other
things that you would think are
indicators clearly that's for some
people the thing but the thing for
others is that they feel that they don't
have the necessary internal resources to
develop their leadership skills 66% of
people about two-thirds are leaving
because of those reasons and then the
other compounding problem is that we
fundamentally are working really
differently right Adrian's
this morning how the old world used to
work and now we're in this new world
right smaller teams continuous
deployment rapid evolution of software
we have Micro Services and so our
companies are looking like this and
equivalently Conway's law
our teams are changing right so we used
to work way back in the day with teams
that would be like 200 right so you
would have huge engineering teams these
were like 10 Pizza teams 20 Pizza teams
I don't know and we do we now have two
Pizza teams and we have a lot of those
teams and those teams are relatively
independent of one another even though
they're interdependent with one another
but you need managers and leaders within
each one of those teams and so really
being able to level up at the scale that
these companies are now creating teams
it's hard if you don't have the internal
great general management skills with
those teams so there's a gap clearly but
what I find is the interesting thing is
that that gap is not as hard to cross as
we might think it is right Engineers do
have amazing skills and those skills can
be translated over to helping to solve
tricky people problems as well as tricky
software problems and then the last
point I want to make and it's a big one
not everyone needs to manage right so
there is sort of this idea of a
progression of a career of a person in
the world and it's this sort of tiered
progression up to like of a boss but
that's not everyone's dream of what they
want to do with their career so knowing
that recognizing that and creating an
option opportunity for something outside
of that is really important so I'm going
to talk a little bit about my experience
sort of what I went through and I'm
gonna use this as a kicker for this
conversation what I want to do is to
give you guys some tools that came from
some really inspiring individuals and
mentors and companies that we've had an
opportunity to work with but I'll start
off talking a little bit about me and
actually asking you guys to interact a
little bit here I'm curious how many
people here are currently managers of
humans so good majority of you how many
of you are individual contributors you
work on teams maybe you lead those teams
but you don't have any direct reports
okay and then how many of you
our leading teams of teams of teams of
teams so you're sort of like managing
humans that manage humans okay so good
many of you cool so everybody's gonna
have their own story about how they
develops themselves and how they develop
their skills this is to provide some
additional components of insights and
tools that I have found personally to be
really helpful over time so I started
out as really I didn't study computer
science in college I had a friend who
was starting a company at the time it
was called all posters calm it became
art calm but I was the third person on
the team and this is where I learned
development so total baptism by fire I
was just making mistakes constantly but
I was learning really quickly from those
mistakes and over time you know aside
from just rolling up Britney Spears
posters and shipping them out to college
students I developed my engineering
skills I then went on to do some sort of
independent consulting so I got to see
other companies and what the
difficulties and you know code looked
like at other companies so I developed
my skills more broadly and then finally
I landed a carbon five and the thing
that I recognized there was that all
this time that I had spent developing my
skills when I started pair programming
when I started getting mentored by these
folks that had been in the industry far
longer and with much more education than
I had it was like a massive acceleration
of my skill set so it was my opportunity
to see what great leadership and
mentorship meant for my skill
acceleration and it's something that
clearly we kept moving forward with with
agile XP pair programming practices with
ourselves and with other companies and
then over time I started to recognize
wow I kind of liked working with bigger
teams and I liked leading these teams
and I liked working more directly with
the client and the business and then
ultimately because I started getting
interested there and developing skills
there inevitably I was given my first
direct report and the day that that
happened it was the scariest day I was
had no problem playing around and
tinkering with computers in code because
you're like you know it's always
reversible there's there's risk that is
reversible there whereas with a human
you're like oh my gosh it's like
becoming a parent you're like holy crap
I am now responsible for a human who has
complexity that is beyond the scope of
any program that I've ever operated with
so it was a baptism by fire again
because again there's no Stack Overflow
right usually I would be able to go on a
slack channel and ask somebody about
questions if I had them when it came to
the software I was working with with
management
there's no get over flow I'm sorry
there's no Stack Overflow there's no
slack and there's no book to really go
to when you're trying to solve these
problems but the great thing is that
this is what I expected to happen I
figured it's kind of like what happened
when I was developing I started out and
I was flailing a Gumby this is sort of a
rock climbing term where when someone
starts climbing they basically are like
flailing around trying to figure out how
to move the body to just get up this was
me with software so I started out pretty
much as a Gumby make failing a lot
learning a lot but then slowly becoming
stable right individual contributor I
knew how to code I knew how test-driven
development all of these great things
and then ultimately leading teams then
managing humans then I was going to be
managing teams of teams and ultimately
I'd become the boss and you know sitting
in first-class flying around the world
whatever the reality is this is what it
actually felt like it was that
everything fell down to you so how many
of you have experienced this where you
all of a sudden have so many reports
that are directly depending on you to
make decisions to help with their career
growth to help them make decisions who
here is sort of felt that feeling of the
world is kind of falling down on you
right
and it's hard also because it's lonely
down there right having a one-on-one
with someone where you just gave them
some pretty direct candid feedback about
work that they needed to improve upon
and they didn't take it so well and then
now the whole team's going out for beers
and they're like hey come along you're
not gonna go with them to go have beers
right so this can become a very lonely
place and it's infinitely harder as you
sort of go up into tears to find other
people to talk to in a closed
confidential way about these really
tricky human problems that are coming
down at you so this was something that I
struggled with definitely right you know
I'm a people person and I definitely
would like to hash things out in a
verbal way and yet when you are having
human resource problems you can't always
sort of just throw that up in the
internet and ask people for help with it
so what are the ways that I found help
I'm going to go through some of them and
a lot of them were pulled from this
recognizing that you know I did have the
develop the development of skills within
software that I could sort of look to to
find a translation into how I could
start to approach some of these problems
that I was facing when I had these
direct reports right and so it was
really just transitioning from one set
of hard problems that were within code
complex systems
you know the architecture and deployment
of those and they got ever more and more
complex to dealing with human problems
individuals teams and the dynamics of
those teams and then overall sort of the
organizational culture and one thing
here is that I'm gonna try to kind of
compare these two what I see to be sort
of the core hard skills of software
development right open-source
programming continuous integration
test-driven development
pair programming which I've talked a
little bit about already doing code
reviews and then regular refactoring
right so like seeing what's gone well
and then refactoring the things that
aren't going so well and then I'm gonna
translate these over to what are sort of
the core skills for great general
management at companies and these are
skills that I won't say I developed well
but I was capable of having some great
people you know these fantastic
individuals that were mentors and some
amazing clients with great cultures that
I could pull from to sort of learn along
the way so I'm going to share some of
those today and I'm gonna bucket these
into sort of three sort of core needs
that I see in great management at
companies and the first of which and
this is one of the hardest ones for me
which is basic communication right so we
communicate a ton as developers right
we're communicating when we're pair
programming and when we're writing
stories when we're doing iteration
planning meetings but that kind of
tactical communication right where it's
very direct the needs are immediate even
if you're doing sort of long term
planning you're still sort of having a
conversation that's contained and it's
sort of conversational it's very
different when you need to deliver a
difficult message to your direct report
or alternatively deliver a message to
the group right or deliver a message up
right you need to say our group has made
a decision about an impact
thing that we are going to do with the
software and we believe it's the right
thing to do for these reasons so these
are concise arguments that you need to
make and that clarity and precision of
that argument really speaks the world's
for whether or not you're going to get
approval to do that thing and whether or
not your direct report is going to
change their behavior and try to be
doing better and leveling up their own
skills so one person that I'm gonna call
out here who is probably one of the
least known but very successful
investors in Silicon Valley is a fellow
named Michael Dearing
so Michael Darian is kind of a phenom
he's one of those people when he sits up
on stage he just captures the
imagination of really the room that he's
in and so he has a great storied past he
worked at eBay he worked at Walt Disney
he started his own company eventually he
managed to get to Stanford where he
taught and he was credited with having
one of the most popular classes at
Stanford it was like 5% of the people
that got into Stanford oh that 5% 5% got
to go to this class and it was for
entrepreneurs and what he recognized
through that course was that there was a
lot of opportunity to teach general
management to these early-stage
entrepreneurs and so he started to both
invest in them as well as creating a
educational school that he is now
running under Harrison metal I highly
recommend this class if you have an
opportunity to take it it's called
general management one-on-one and he
really brings in a couple of these tools
that I'm gonna run through with you the
first of which comes from another
amazing individual someone who I
considered to be kind of a modern-day
hero barber Minto so has anyone ever
heard of barber mentor the pyramid
principle nobody here has ever worked at
McKinsey it's sort of like a rite of
passage at McKinsey anyhow this is a
technique that's great for developers
because it's really a framework it's a
tool that you can use it's very
actionable and it's procedural and how
to create great arguments so barber mint
is kind of amazing also because she was
part of the first women graduating class
from the Harvard Business School
she does not have an undergraduate
degree but her innate women slept across
the river from the women's campus across
the way to Harvard every day to get
their MBA at Harvard and become the
first graduating female class
so she brought to us this idea of the
pyramid principle and it's really an
amazing way to start to practice
communication both verbal and written to
allow you to get the point across to
people when there's a very confusing
argument to be made right it's kind of
the inverse of what we see in movies
right in movies you've got all of the
details are slowly filtered out to you
to keep you on the edge and suspense you
until the end of the movie but when
you're in a boardroom or when you're in
a tough meeting with people that don't
have a lot of time you want the inverse
right you want to get to the point state
what it is that you think should be the
resolution of that meeting and then
provide the supporting details and just
enough supporting details for everyone
to be able to consciously and cognate
cognitively understand them so this is
something she's got a book highly
recommend that you grab it and read it
but this is the fundamental kind of
underpinnings and it's easy to put into
practice in emails and presentations
that you do another sort of smaller
version of this that I use a lot in
emails when I've got like kind of a
tough amount of information to get
across to a team start with this
situation state it as it is everyone can
kind of come on board because it's it's
a situation that everyone understands is
in is existing and everyone can agree on
it so you got the buy-in of everyone on
what the situation is and then you move
to the complication so maybe this is the
thing that people don't actually know
maybe it's something that's a surprise
maybe it is the complication the pain
point that everyone's feeling and then
the question really falls out of that
pretty immediately and then you can
either work with the group for the
answer or again you can provide your
supporting evidence for the answer so
this helped me a ton when I started have
to construct bigger and heavier
arguments with both my team as well as
to you know either clients are kind of
like the partners that I work with
another thing is goal setting so this is
another tool that is in use quite a bit
in Silicon Valley started it Intel with
Andy Grove and then was brought into
Google by a fellow named John doar has
anyone ever heard of ok ours objectives
and key results cool so a couple of you
have anyone put this into practice at
their company's nice it's not easy right
it's super hard so this is something
that is infinitely hard it
to be really championed by pretty much
the entire leadership team and most of
the rest of the company but it's an
amazingly effective way to go sort of
beyond this whole notion of just KPIs
and it's a way to set something that
really starts at the top from almost
like a mission and a vision of the
company and where the company is going
to each and every level as it goes on
down so it's really each objective hangs
on each other objective and it's a great
way for everyone on down to the
individual to align what it is that
they're doing against the overall
company so I sort of make this akin to
like continuous integration right when
you have everyone in an organization
that is contributing in a way that is
within an in a line to where the company
needs to go it really gives that force
of direction against that acceleration
that Jessica was talking about in her
keynote and it is hard to implement this
but what you're really trying to do is
you're going very broad in the scope of
what you're trying to tackle so you're
thinking big if you are achieving a
hundred percent of your key results
which can oftentimes look like KPIs you
are actually not thinking big enough so
a lot of the reason that they say they
use this at Google is they're trying to
do a lot of really hard things and so
they want to shoot really big and if
they get 70 percent of the way there
they feel like they're tracking really
well another thing is don't have too
many of these right you're trying to be
more about the quality of them than the
quantity of them and then finally these
are frequent right this helps to keep
teams on a continual cadence this is
kind of akin to how we do continuous
deployment right you want to keep
tracking against progress and it really
helps when you have objectives and key
results that you want to see in a more
frequent cadence but that are bigger
than just sort of individual software
deployments the final thing and this is
a biggie is you're never tying this to a
bonus or a compensation and the reason
for that is it kills the culture of
taking big risks at the company so this
is something that difficult to try out
but you can I have definitely had
success in trying that within a smaller
team and it really helps with
individuals when you're having
conversations and your one-on-ones about
you know well what can I do next really
help this team and this company do
better and to make myself be better in
this career
it's great way to sort of hinge okay
well this is the objectives of our team
it aligns to these objectives of the
company and your individual objectives
and key results should be this so it's a
really helpful thing to help to kind of
architect the way in which you can work
with your direct reports so this is
another big chunk of Management and it's
culture and this is something that does
not take care of itself
it doesn't just evolve naturally you
have to pay attention to culture you
have to cultivate it you have to evolve
it you have to think about it you have
to make efforts against it and this is
something that really does have business
benefits in the end so I think a lot of
time people are like well the mission of
the company or what we do is going to
just have the culture net out it's not
true right and culture if it's toxic can
do the same thing to kill a company as a
bad product release and culture is two
great employees as great products are to
customers so keep that in mind and one
of the things that is interesting is
that there actually is a lot of data
that backs this has anyone ever heard of
Google's project Aristotle one person
okay
so this was basically two people cool
Google went and as Google does they took
a huge survey they went to executives
around the world they went to 180 of
their teams across engineering sales
marketing the whole the whole business
and they took quantitative and
qualitative data from these teams to try
to figure out what makes up great teams
that produce fantastic products and
great business results right so they
they were quantifiable and what they
said is a successful team they had
metrics against that and then they took
the metrics against these different
teams and what they found was there were
really five key components and it wasn't
things like colocation and it wasn't
things of you know the smartest people
in the team but the top most thing
there's there's other besides us but
this was in each and every one of the
teams was this notion of psychological
safety and what this really means is
that these teams were capable and given
trust to act autonomously to have shared
accountability within the team and to
have a very learning centric culture
within that team and we've been able to
see the same thing at carbon five so we
have done our own
with the hundreds of companies that
we've had an opportunity to work with
and we've recognized that it really is a
couple companies that we've seen that
have just been outstandingly performant
and it's because we see them operate
with this culture of psychological
safety so has anyone here heard of a
company called stitch fix there's
probably a lot of guys in the audience
but stitch fix is a online personal
styling service so this is one of those
box companies they send you clothing in
a box and you get to pick from you have
a personal stylist that you work with
they take a ton of data around who you
are and what your preferences are and
then they continually work with that
data as you work with your stylist and
as you choose clothing and what they are
doing is really dramatically changing
the way that clothing can be both
delivered to individuals as well as how
they can sort of assess what those
individuals are excited about and then
how do they do it they have eighty data
scientists that work to really take and
craft what fashion is and create
algorithms from that and they also have
3,500 stylists that live throughout the
country that are feeding human insights
into those machine learning algorithms
so it's a pretty complex process and
they have been wildly successful so they
have been in existence since 2011 and
within the first three years they were
profitable last fiscal year they
recorded sales of like seven hundred
thirty million dollars so they're
clearly doing well but for me what was
most impressive was yeah that's great
that you're financially doing well but
they have managed to maintain this
culture through this rapid rapid hyper
growth and what we saw with that culture
was this you know they are very much in
the micro services approach right and
actually Randy Shoop who was at you know
some of these he's been brought up a
couple times here but he is now their VP
of engineering and so they have this
micro platform so if individual teams
that act pretty autonomous autonomously
from one another and they are
interdependent so they collaborate with
one another pretty closely but it's
through sort of this API structure and
what they found is that because these
groups are capable of making decisions
rapidly and deploying code continuously
pushing to production they have been
able to deploy experiments try things on
in a very lightweight manner and if bugs
crop up
they have a 24-hour team that's on call
that grabs the bug and if they need help
they grab the team who will come in and
help them out and so what this ends up
happening is an amazing amount of
development velocity they can try
experiments out they can do it in a
lightweight fashion and then they can
move on and this is from the team layer
on up so it really has a ton of business
value and the other thing it has is a
lot of value for the employees they
stick around right because they get to
see their work built on each and every
day so they're getting to see the
results of their efforts continuously
and they don't have to sit around
waiting for someone up on high to say
yes I approve go forward so this is
something that has allowed them to be
amazingly fast quick and successful so
another component of culture is
something that is again critical as a
manager to start to understand more in
depth and this is this notion of
mentoring and I'd like to sort of
consider this because it's what I
experienced is like a 360 degree view of
mentoring there's sort of mentoring to
those that you are having as direct
reports it's also mentoring to people
outside of your company that maybe
you're thinking about hiring in the long
run helping to mentor up their skills
even as they exist outside of your
company it's also sort of peer to peer
mentoring right opening up yourself to
getting you know reception and feedback
from the peers around you many of which
are doing similar things to you and are
interacting with tricky problems like
you are and then finally sort of being a
good mentee finding those people those
individuals that can help you find the
tools and the techniques to help you
become a better and better manager so
I'm going to talk first of all about
this whole notion of kind of pairing
right so we pair program and when we
pair program we oftentimes find a better
resolution to a problem that we have we
used to have a rule at carbon 5 and we
still have it if you are stuck for more
than 15 minutes on a problem grab a pair
and we all know that right the second
you start talking it could be a rubber
duck to start it unlocks a lot of your
thinking right so the same thing
actually can happen when you're dealing
with tricky human problems or
organization problems I what does it
mean to be able to hire more people of
color at this company well why don't you
talk to your mentors in your network to
talk about what they are
within their companies and efforts that
you might be able to try right so
there's sort of three kind of versions
of pairing there's the journeyman
apprentice this is really sharing down
and one of the components of this that
is critical that a lot of people let
sort of slide is the one on one how many
people here do routine one-on-ones you
guys are awesome cool
so I don't have to tell you why it's so
important and it's not just important
for the people that are reporting to you
it's important for you right you often
lose sight when you are madly dashing
around a bunch of different teams on
what's happening on the ground
you're one-on-one as an opportunity to
you to hear directly from your report
what's happening right what kind of
difficulties are they encountering
what's happening within the team
dynamics right so that you can assess
that and continually take actions
against it right
another is sort of this driver navigator
again this is like the peer to peer
again there's no Stack Overflow and it's
really difficult to talk about sensitive
information with others I will highly
advise you to go to does anyone here
know Michael lop he's the VP of
engineering at slack
he has Ranson repos blog some of you
have clearly heard of him he has created
this leadership in slack and it's a
slack community that is fantastic and
it's basically engineering leaders you
can sign up online just google
leadership in slack and you know become
part of the community it's people around
the world I've done face to faces on
this platform where you're literally
talking to someone in Australia they're
having the same problems you are and
it's great because it's very you know
code of conduct is confidential and you
can get some great insights from people
who are also managing big teams and then
finally this apprentice journey man you
know a lot of the people that I'm
talking about in this talk were people
that I worked with on a project but I
would go and have coffee with them and I
always felt really guilty about it I was
like all these people are crazy busy
they don't have time for me but the
amazing thing was is that they were sort
of getting the same thing that I got
when I had my one-on-ones with my direct
reports right they were getting
information outside of their sphere of
knowledge that they could use in their
work right so it's really this it's a
universally advantaged situation when
you can find someone who you know their
experience in life is going to directly
both inspire and help you and what
you're doing but inversely they're also
going to be able to get information
from you that's gonna help them you know
keep up to pace with the crazy amount of
development that's happening around them
so highly recommend you know finding
people that you really have a valuable
relationship with and spending time to
develop those with coffees and lunches
and whatnot and then finally this is one
that seems like well duh
be authentic it's so hard though I mean
as you go through your work in life and
as you go through these trainings and in
these conferences it's almost like your
ability to just be a human gets like
drilled out of you so being a human
bringing your human version of yourself
to work is really critical and there's a
great story by someone I'm gonna talk
about who created a book called radical
candor has anyone heard of Kim Scott she
this is a New York Times best seller got
one person here they're heard of it
I highly recommend reading this and it's
no other reason and it's just this great
of like I just want to put this into
practice because I want to be this
person with the people that I manage and
with Who I am at work so she has a story
she's got again you know storied history
she worked at Google early on she now is
like an executive coach for Twitter and
Qualtrics and Dropbox and all these
other companies and so she's you know
created this book that really is about
how do you be authentic at work and
early on when she was at Google she had
someone who she was managing and you
know this person posed the question to
her you know how can I be the most
successful person at Google how can I
advance my career here and she just sort
of looked at this person who had come
out of like a Harvard MBA and was very
structured she's like you know what can
you just show up as a human ten years
later this guy saw her at some
conference somewhere and he was like
that was the best advice I'd ever gotten
so I think at a manager it's really
important to recognize that it's
important to be human but to also know
that your role here is to actually help
people's career and to help them be
successful not just at this company but
wherever they go in the long run and so
radical candor is again a great tool for
engineers because it has a framework
right there's a way that we can sort of
hang our thinking off of this framework
that can Scott has created and it's this
notion of being able to understand how
much you are caring personally about the
person that is reporting to you but also
challenging them getting them to be a
better and better
you know engineer ways in which they
could be
a better leader ways in which that they
could level up their skills so finding
the balance often times is really hard a
lot of the time because we've been
taught you know through the course of
our lives is you know don't say
something unless you can't it unless
it's something nice right you know these
sort of social constructs that are built
into us from an early age we have to
almost battle that in order for us to
come up with direct challenging feedback
for our reports so that we can help them
to become better because otherwise if we
just sort of her like you know this
person that keeps showing up every day
you know they're on the team they're
doing their work but it's kind of crap
and you know if you you want to say
something to them but it's hard it's
hard to deliver that message because you
know it's going to be difficult for them
to take but if you don't deliver that
message inevitably you're gonna end up
with someone that's not contributing and
someone at some point is gonna be like
we got to get rid of that guy and you
did not do your job along the way to say
hey man here's a couple things that you
could do to help the rest of the team be
better and to help yourself advance your
career so the other component of this is
that this isn't really how it leaves
your mouth Kim Scott says it's not how
it leaves your mouth is how its received
on your direct reports ear it's
important for them to sort of assess you
as well so you can actually give this
and I've done this where you give this
to people and you say hey you know I
know we've been having these one-on-ones
I've been giving you feedback I hope
some of it's been helpful I'm kind of
curious though where do you think I fall
in this spectrum with the advice that
I've been giving you often times you can
think that you're being radically candid
and in fact you're actually being
manipulative so she's got a crepe book
highly recommend checking this out and
it's a quick read another thing is
retrospectives so this is really sort of
like how you refactor your team right we
all know refactoring your codebase is
critical and it's super important we're
factoring your team is just as important
and one of the ways that we do do people
here run reflections retrospectives at
the end of the week cool I'm in good
company you guys are amazing so at the
end of the week you get to see what went
well what didn't go well what can we do
to fix that it's interesting because
when you level that scope up a little
bit to think about teams and team
dynamics you still need to run that same
sort of analysis that same sort of
candor that you bring to those
retrospectives you can actually do sort
of a super retro and one of the things
that we started running a carbon five a
while ago was this notion of a product
artboard right so we really see things
as products now right companies are
doing projects perhaps you know for
infrastructure but it should be in the
service of products or customers and
maybe those customers are developers but
inevitably there are someone on the
other end of the efforts that you are
making that is going to receive what it
is that you're doing and what you're
doing should have value it should be
unique
you should have respects for the other
team members that you're working on and
really lots of other things so we sort
of identified twelve dimensions we
actually worked with some of the team
from the Google Aristotle project on
some of this but it's an analysis that
sort of again a super retro it's kind of
scoping out to say okay team do we all
agree that we know what the unique value
is of what we are doing and if not we
need to sit down and have a talk about
that because those incremental decisions
that are made every day when you're
developing software and when you're
making these decisions about business
logic it needs to be in service of the
greater vision and then the other thing
is if you feel that the team isn't
capturing metrics that you don't know
actually how the work you're doing is
performing in the world
that's a smell right that's the smell of
a product that probably isn't getting
the analysis that it needs to so
completing the start board is very much
kind of a a continual analysis tool and
you do it over time you do it at the
beginning of the project and it really
sort of helps to have some really
difficult conversations around well if
we don't feel that we're having open
discussions we need to address that
right so it's you can fill this out it's
confidential when you fill it out but
then when you see the deltas between you
know some of the team thinks that's your
ability to have open and honest debate
and the other teams are like no I don't
think anyone's listening to me you know
that that's a something that you need to
address as a team so this is sort of a
way to help course-correct teams as
they're moving along on maybe long term
engagements so finally I want to kind of
go back to that whole notion of not
everybody needs to be a manager so how
many people here still get to code or
want to be able to code again cool so I
think it's really important to
understand that there are going to be
people that you manage within your
organism
that are not always going to want to
have to deal with the human component
right and these are hugely valuable and
it's important to consider this because
the running paradigm is that the way
that you advance your career that you
get you know more money that you get
respect and placement at a company and
that you would stay at a company is
through this progression that inevitably
involves management but it's not true
there are two really paths that we're
seeing a lot of companies start to put
into place in a fundamental way and in a
very transparent way across the
organization and one is the original
progression that we've been talking
about this notion of you you know start
out managing yourself advancing your own
career then you're helping others with
their career then you're helping to sort
of like manage against teams and the
coordination of those and then
ultimately you get this bigger sort of
50,000 foot view of the organization
right so that's one sort of scoping up
but the other scoping up is something
that's just as valuable for an
organization can run completely in
parallel and it's just as respected of a
track is that first one and I think
that's the critical component giving
distinct titles roles and
responsibilities for the people that are
really going to be mentoring on the
skill side and on the leadership side of
engineering talent within a company so
having these both be seen in a company
as options for progression of your
career will help keep great talent at
your company and also allow that talent
to do the things that they really want
to do right they become mentors that
level up people from the skill side they
also collaborate directly with you
because when someone expresses an
interest in something like you know I
want to look into security you can show
them directly to someone who can help
manage their progress within levelling
up their skills within security from
someone that's been doing it for the
past five years and they are sort of
seen to be the leadership if you will
the engineering management of that skill
or competency so it fits really nicely
in with this whole notion of electrodes
and squads and guilds and I think it's
incredibly important though to also make
sure that people within the company
understand that this is an option for
their progression and that there's
really sort of this dual path leadership
so that's pretty much the tools that
have helped out me there's lots more I
would love to hear some feedback if
anyone
has any questions I'm definitely open to
hearing if people here have sort of
tricky situations that they are willing
to talk about but thank you feel free to
get in touch I'm Courtney at carbon five
or you can reach out to me on Twitter
thank you very much we have indeed some
questions in the app so I will start
with that I need another hand sorry
there we go I think the last one
actually answered it but I will I will
read it again how to make the transition
from being a software engineer to a
leader manager it seems to be two
opposite paths that you have to chose
between so the sooner the better maybe
yeah so this is one thing that is the
good news is there are a lot of people
that choose to go into management choose
to go into team leadership and they're
curious about it right they're like well
what does that look like can I do that
and it's almost that thing and this is
sort of what happened with me I'm like
well I want to know what that's all
about that seems like a whole nother
sort of nut to crack it doesn't mean
that you're going down a path that has
no return route you absolutely can find
a return ticket back and I think that
there is sort of a critical component to
keeping sort of your outside interest
and really your ancillary work within
the company close to the code so when a
bunch of you raised your hands then
we're like yeah I still touch code I
think it is important you know I
personally like to try and dive into a
project you know once a year if I can
and be able to contribute code it keeps
your skills relevant and also allows you
to go back to being more of on the the
sort of the team side being a direct
contributor on a codebase so there there
really isn't
you're not going to totally sell
yourself and find you know that you're
drifting away from this sort of core
technology contribution that you love
when you start it out I will say though
that sometimes people get pulled in that
direction because they like it you know
they find that they're great at
mentoring others and that there's this
impact that you get when you have a team
of you know ten underneath you where you
can lead them you can help to clarify
and clear the path for them to get great
work done and
you really do get a feeling like you are
contributing in a big way and I think
that the team really starts to respect
and value the work that you're doing
so there's you'll sort of start to see
kind of the benefits on both sides but I
would say I know and have absolutely
talked with people that have been able
to go into management for a certain
portion of their career and then kind of
revert back to being able to contribute
directly into code and or advising on
code thank you
next question do you have any tips on
changing the culture bottom up instead
of top-down oh boy yeah it's tough but
here's the thing is the engineers are
every bit of value that a company has
right so your team's the actual
individuals at your company are what
your company is made of and the culture
is really the thing that keeps them
there so I think you know happily in the
media we are now seeing enough examples
of what happens when the leadership
doesn't pay attention to the culture and
they start to lose talent so I think
from the bottom up you know being a
squeaky wheel taking the initiative like
there's a lot of a lot of conversations
that can happen particularly in slack
where people are complaining like ah you
know if we just did this if we had more
continues to play development you know
we're doing these three-week release
cycles that's crazy why are we doing
this taking action to you know create
sort of a side project or a pilot
project or coming up with an initiative
and finding people to collaborate with
you you know multiple voices carries way
more than just one you know start to
build this from the ground up by doing
it by actually taking the actions
collaborating with individuals coming up
with potential solutions that you can
say hey I think if we operate in this
way if we manage in this way we are
gonna be a better company and I'm gonna
do this initiative can I get buy-in for
it and takes persistence it's definitely
not easy and it's also it takes timing
like figuring out kind of where within
the company you can do this and with
which groups and potentially at what
times is critical particularly if you're
in an enterprise companies there's like
you know cycles that you have to think
about that are financially bound but I
absolutely think that this is happening
and moreover companies respect this
as a company we get so many enterprises
that are like teach us to operate more
flexibly teach us to do experimentation
and you know run more lean if you will
so there they would be huge advocates if
they had someone internally that's like
I want to build out a team in a
different mold and I want to operate
them in a different way so I think you
can do this from the ground up but it
takes you know it takes a little bit of
risk it takes a lot of effort I would
say and you know a little bit of
strategy on how you can kind of operate
within the bigger organization okay
before we go to another more serious
question he has a question that actually
a lot of people have here in this room
what's wrong with not going out for beer
with your team yeah so yeah I pulled
that example of mostly because I totally
go out for beers with my team all the
time I mean yeah yours but I will say
that there's times where you'll
recognize that it's kind of maybe
opportune for you to step out and let
them you know just sort of be peers with
one another you can't I mean it's kind
of like saying there's no such thing as
like an authority figure we're not a
company that does that we're not a
hierarchy we're a whole lock or whatever
it is but if you know I mean if let's
say Robert De Niro to walk in that door
everyone here would start acting
differently right there are people that
just have sort of a different
countenance when they're within a group
and as a manager when you have direct
reports and you're responsible for their
reviews and their progression it's kind
of nice for you to allow the team to
have an opportunity to collaborate
without you so that's sort of what I was
saying without more than anything it
definitely doesn't mean that you
shouldn't go and have fun with your you
know the people that you're working with
and to have again that authentic
relationship with them but it's just you
know timing things all right and now I
will mix two questions together because
I think I kind of get together how do I
get feedback from my team members that
will help me to get better at managing
teams and on that point also how do you
manage introverts oh yeah good one so
the first one I'll take what has been
interesting to me and another reason why
I was like you know I'd be interesting
to have a talk on this and hear other
people's thoughts there's so much
software out there now that's doing like
three
60 feedback and you know software to
help you manager one-on-one so clearly
this is something that companies are
starting to focus their attention on so
I would say there is software to sort of
help get feedback from the team in an
anonymous fashion some of it is a little
bit cheesy to be honest it's like you
know you're doing smiley faces on a
weekly basis through these emails that
are sent to the team but it's really
nice to get a pulse of sort of how your
team is feeling you can also do you know
we do it on a lightweight fashion you
can do Google Forms and just send out
these anonymous form surveys that allow
your team to give you kind of honest
feedback and I think that's really
helpful as a manager so that you know
again to that like radical candor graph
where is my you know my reporting in my
direction really landing with these
people that matter more right like every
opportunity that you have to help give
advice and guidance to the team has
resounding effects for the company and
for the initiatives that you're leading
so making sure that that is landing well
and that it's understood and that it's
receptive or it received is really
critical so I think you know it can be
as simple as just a Google Form that you
send out make sure it's like anonymous
and that they clearly know it is but you
can also look into them at these
software's or service projects or
products that are out there oh yeah what
was the second one how do you manage
introverts oh yeah I think again this is
it can be hard because you're like well
I need to develop a rapport with someone
but I think it's really they're gonna be
introverted so finding the techniques
that really resound with them right if
they are very written in their
communication but not great at the
verbal communication then find ways that
you can sort of interact and communicate
with them and more of a written way you
know maybe they keep sort of a
objectives and key results in a log with
you right maybe they do blog post or
something like that so finding out the
ways that they can represent what it is
that they need the pain points that
they're having is sort of the first
component of that and then I'd say the
second component of that is you know
again sort of being the human
recognizing that the way that you
communicate might not be the way that
everybody else communicates and so again
trying to kind of reach outside of your
knowledge and you know your own biases
to figure out ways that you
can better communicate with this
individual and again whether that's
through you know tools whether that's
through emails whether it's through
written finding out ways that you can
communicate based on their worldview and
where they're coming from and finding
the empathy of sort of what they're
thinking as opposed to what you are
doing with everybody else all right we
have a lot of other questions in here
but I'm sorry we ran out of time thank
you very much for coming to the
questions that are awesome and take a
break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
