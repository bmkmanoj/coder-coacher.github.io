building the wrong things
writer build the right things this is I
know we've seen you've probably all seen
that Standish Group report which talks
about feature usage and the waste of it
this one was kind of interesting I
haven't seen this around very much it
was at a joint aerospace weapon system
support symposium what they found is
that the government had spent thirty
five point seven billion on software as
you can see there two percent was used
as delivered see what you gave the
client they could actually put straight
to purpose and use software used after
changes so they have to do something to
it three percent software used but
reworked or even abandoned twenty
percent
software paid for but not delivered Wow
twenty five percent then on the Left we
have a whopping software delivered but
not successfully used forty six percent
so that's telling us something it's
telling us that what we're building and
delivering even if we get it out there
isn't always the right thing so of
course a lot of you are agile Easter's
and we looked at what was going on and
we said well must be the process is
probably that evil waterfall and
actually I was looking for stock photos
and I typed an evil waterfall and that
is exactly what came back and so we
thought we're gonna come up with Silver
Bullet process because if we just fix
the process than everything would be
right and this is the picture of the
infamous process wars that have been
happening in the last decade scrum
versus Kanban is lean better or scrum
better or which agile flavor is better
so did it help one of the reasons they
have been thinking a lot about the space
is I'm writing a book on how to create
legal contracts for more agile and lean
projects and in doing so I did a lot of
research into success rates with
projects and the data behind it and it's
interesting we seem to be doing more
stuff faster but I'm really not
convinced we're building better products
in the meantime
or are we just building the wrong thing
writer I don't know if you have this
term in Scandinavia it's called lipstick
on a pig it means that you can put
lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig
so the idea being for me it doesn't
matter how fast your job teams can go if
you're heading in the wrong direction
you're going to fail you might fail
faster which is one of the promises of
agile but is still failing right so we
need to get these teams heading in the
right direction let's look at how people
currently measure progress and again
this is a fundamental piece of the legal
contracts what's in them is all about
how they measure progress and delivery
now up the top we have activity-based if
you look at typical sequential waterfall
it's very activity-based we know that
we've made progress because planning is
complete we have then completed design
development etc so those are our markers
now of course the agile Easter said well
that doesn't work that's ridiculous
because all you have after planning as a
set of documents you have nothing of
value so of course they came in with the
answers which is that we are going to
deliver working software and that means
that we're now delivering lots of bits
of code to you instead of paper and we
might track progress with things like
through port velocity how many people
are actually doing things like velocity
story point at work and who has managers
looking at your velocity numbers hmm one
big company were working with people
have to keep their velocity at least the
same or steadily increasing I'm watching
that going wow you can do more stuff
faster congratulations how useful is
that and also it means from an
innovation standpoint when I see teams
with constant velocity or velocity that
goes up and never down I don't see
people experimenting I actually think
that's a very dangerous thing no one
takes the time to learn to get better
there was a good story of Tiger Woods
the golf player and
is obviously very good the way plays
golf rest of his life maybe not but
every now and again he'll take one of
his killer shots the ones that's really
great and he'll break it down he'll
start again
he'll redo it over and over and learn
new things and his game will actually go
down before it goes up better than
before so this idea of you've got to
fail and learn sometimes even in the
agile community by looking at metrics
there are metrics things like velocity
we can stop that spirit of failing and
learning from it so which sounds better
our velocity is 46 points and we
delivered 100 new features is this the
sort of thing you often hear at work we
just delivered I love that was it a mini
once and the manager said we just
delivered 35 features on-time and
on-budget I'm sitting there thinking
yeah but did you make money where the
customers happy could you have done it
with two instead of 35 that means
nothing absolutely meaningless so listen
to this we just implemented one feature
in three days which will save us 12
million pounds over the next year which
one sounds better to management so we're
going through with our product owner
teams and really training them to re
adjust the way they talk about progress
output is not the answer so now we have
the Silver Bullet of course we all have
the silver bullet see if that's really
true but the idea is to build outcomes
over outputs what you want to be doing
is saying these are the results we need
now let's figure out how to get there
it's not about more features more
features is not the game so I think of
outcomes the other destination you want
to get to and then we have options or
that should the potential solutions
these are the ways that we can get there
so this is this target outcomes
framework that I've been developing with
Ryan Shriver over in the US and we're
putting this in place with a focus on
let's always be able to measure the
outcomes figure out the different ways
we could get there and
work out which are the best investments
to try out what's interesting with this
out comes option model is one outcome
one destination we want to get to can
have multiple ways to get there in this
other hand one option one potential
solution can affect multiple outcomes in
the company and I'll give you some
examples of outcomes in a moment another
nuance in this idea of indras net it's a
Buddhist idea but it's this idea of it's
a mirror image of the world so if you
look at a drop of water you can see the
world reflected so it's this reflective
cycle I think one of the reasons people
have trouble getting to these outcomes
models as they try to simplify them they
do try put them in a sequential a
hierarchical environment whereas it's
far more complicated because we're
dealing with systems so one change we
make in a system affects multiple pieces
of it so it's actually quite a complex
model so simple steps that will talk
through to seek an idea of how to do it
step one we're going to get a deep
understanding so remember we talked
earlier we don't want to know how or
even what actually I think why comes
first why are we doing it number two
we're going to set the goals where do we
need to get to let's make sure that's
incredibly clear everybody understands
it three come up with potential
solutions eight is Ed we could do all of
these things some are high costs some
are low cost
some might get us high value some low
value let's figure out which ones might
work knowing that of course there are
all guesses so until we start validating
and testing we don't know which ones are
really useful step four we're going to
go into our little literate of cycles of
some sort we're going to deliver
something measure the progress against
the outcomes and adapt what we're doing
a constant flow through over and over
until bored rich or famous so let's
start with deep understanding now I have
kept this talk deliberately short if you
have some questions during it feel free
to ask them
I'm going to start with some ideas
around gorilla research personally after
doing this for a long time I think
research is too important to leave to
the researchers there's a really big
difference between taking the people out
to see and understand the environment
compared to being handed a report about
what users are doing the gentleman at
the back who said you know the users the
a/b situation once you really see these
people I don't know if this product
owner got a report but it's really
different when you see someone using it
who was in my talk the other day hands
up okay there's a little bit of overlap
pologize for that now when we were
testing something Yahoo we found that we
would hand off a report saying look
these developers are sorry our customers
are having a real trouble using the
product it was a photos product when we
had Ajax had just come out so you drag
and drop things around the screen this
was so new that while the executives
everybody thought this is great we love
at the developers thought it was the
best solution the user experience people
very worried that the customers wouldn't
be able to do it they kept telling us or
telling a team writing Forte's nothing
happened finally they did a usability
lab where they called in some of the
team members and said come and watch
what's happening so calls in came a
customer we said go and put your photos
in an album you saw them then trying to
struggle they didn't know how to do it
they said they're going can't do it so
one of the developers behind the screen
watching it went oh now I understand
quickly types in a change pushes it by
the time the next person comes in for
the study that is fixed so something
about seeing it and knowing what's going
on that's really important one of the
great sort of think-tank innovation
incubator companies I do in America had
an interesting story where they went out
to look into people our children's
toothbrushes so they were hired by one
of the big toothbrush companies they
said find us a good model a good design
for children's toothbrush
so of course they go into the field and
they will take the team there and they
wins the field and watched now what's
really interesting who's got children
you're my Scandinavians do I know that
sounds weird but you prolific here with
children over here and so they went out
and then one with little children
the idea is little children have little
hands therefore they need a little
toothbrush
of course when children grab the
toothbrush they grab it like this so
they actually have no fine motor skills
so when watching that they thought oh
that's completely wrong we don't need a
little toothbrush we actually need the
offset we need a really big toothbrush
to make it easier for them to hold so
they got that through observing the
users this is something that I encourage
my teams to do everywhere a lot of you
are working on internal systems nothing
like going in and sitting beside the
real users in your company to find out
not say what do you want that's the
worst question ever as Henry Ford said
if I ask my customers what they wanted I
would have built a faster horse instead
we want to say what are you trying to do
what's the goal now let's figure out the
easiest way to make that happen
there's gorilla data research and I'm
gonna give you an example on this I'm
going to take you through a short case
study so data will be the most powerful
weapon for making product decisions when
you can gather it so one part is
observing really understanding how our
users think the other side is to really
look at the patterns of usage and see
what's going on so I only use a model
Acme comm not a real company they are an
online retailer think of them like an
Amazon they have a problem in that
customer abandonment rates are very high
so 32% of people who go in to buy a book
complete the transaction 58 percent of
them don't and never actually return so
that concerned about this as one would
be so what the marketing guys said was
we need more features
features a so win-win one company I
worked out in Silicon Valley I got so
frustrated I was told we had to take the
company public in six months so fix all
these problems you know help the company
grow and when I looked around and looked
at the problems we're having we have
multiple lists of features to pump out
the door after I thought this is crazy
this isn't the problem there was a to
study that said 60% of defects are
actually learn ability and usability
problems they're not technical issues at
all so I went up to the executive order
and I said look what we have to do is
actually make our site perform really
well it's a quality issue it's very hard
it took people something like you know
eight clicks to get into a chat room and
I say you know this is what's killing
our product and you know as I said to
them do you go to Amazon or Ebay every
week to get a new feature no you go
there because you want something you
want to buy book for our users they
wanted to get into a chat room it has to
be as easy to do as possible now in the
real world this isn't so easy we had a
really big issue at the time that the
head of sales said every page they click
on we get ad impressions so we get money
that's a lot of money we cannot remove
pages so I looked at that and said well
you know what if the user can't get
there in less than three clicks we're
gonna lose everybody anybody anyway it's
gonna be too hard so if that's the
outcome you need as a sales guy you want
more revenue for advertising correct
than like yeah okay so at the moment we
had about three different banner ads on
the page I looked at the click-through
rate not good again looking at the data
and said let's try an experiment let's
take two percent of our traffic and what
we're going to do is we're gonna make it
three clicks to get in the chat room and
instead of all these little banner ads
we're going to put one big box rich
media ad looks great it's only one it's
not distracting etc turns out that one
may double the money of the other
advertising model because the ads were
so much more compelling people clicked
on it we could sell them out
mium we had longer-term campaigns
because the big clients wanted to build
it so that's how we diffused a situation
which is really difficult if you're in
product ownership it's not an easy job
right you're constantly getting
everybody's opinions about what's
important what the solutions are and we
want to get back beyond that we only use
data to say you know we're going to
prove it to you we don't need to keep
arguing about it let's see what happens
and what the developers said this is you
know is to say at Yahoo your developers
are not you the developers want the cool
technical solution I don't know if
anyone went to that talk the other day
about quantum pearl yeah if you went it
was really funny what the web analytics
said so what we found out is actually
38% proceeded to check out shipping 19%
proceed to checkout 15% Confirmation etc
this is a funnel which is showing the
drop-off what was interesting is that a
lot of people simply wanted shipping
information right so we buried it right
within the purchase flow as soon as we
remove that and put it up front people
didn't have to start the cycle so again
we started cleaning up the data to find
out where do we have the biggest
problems how are we going to fix it
anyone who's familiar with lean and
value stream mapping think of doing a
value stream for your product it's a way
of seeing where are the biggest
bottlenecks where is the waste those are
the problems you attack first so you can
see what we're doing here we're already
starting to filter things out because
the tyranny of agile is we can build a
lot fast that's a good thing and a bad
thing it means that we can simply have
to give features it's what I call the
machine gun approach by taking so many
shots we may hit our target but it's
incredibly wasteful in the process you
can run things like surveys we can find
out that some people had a payment issue
some people were just comparison
shopping which is interesting when you
see things like comparison shopping you
think it will match any other online
price maybe we can retain these
customers after all
pages are really slow to load well
that's a huge problem so once we have an
understanding of what the issues are we
can go deeper there's some great
techniques out of Toyota the a3 thinking
you ask why five times you do value
stream mapping anything that gives you a
big systemic deep understanding of the
core problems will help you because now
I know okay we have a problem I'm going
to go for that bottom one pages are slow
to load what could be some solutions to
pages a slow to load caching yep
restructure the pages could be yep ruh
stuff that you don't use yeah all sorts
of things could be latency etc we
actually found that we had multiple
problems one solution that we wanted to
try out was the patience and page
elements one was let's try some
usability experiments one was you know
what actually the people who live in New
Zealand and Australia have the hardest
time because of the data center is based
in Europe we need a local data center
actually we might have some Network
latency issues so now we've got options
right I call them options because I
don't want to say those solutions or
that we have epics or requirements at
this point I want everybody to know or
they are are our best guess at the time
and until we try something and test it
out we won't know which ones are valid
again anyone who's caught up in this
whole Lean Startup movement will know
that at this point we want to start
validating our ideas we can do a
high-level filter and say out of all of
these ideas which ones cheap and easy
let's get some feedback things like
caching page elements pretty quick and
easy right I might do that tomorrow and
see if we get a change data center that
sounds kind of expensive but maybe I
will just go simply set up one server in
Australia divert 0.5% or something of my
traffic start getting an idea is that
one going to make a big difference or
not because at the moment again until
you have data you don't know what the
real problem is don't just start
throwing solutions of the problem too
early
and always keep an eye on what the
customers actually need that chat
application they just needed to chat
most businesses are not that difficult
Amazon you want to buy a book right
Skype you want to make a call and what I
constantly see anyone who's been abused
by bad products will understand
sometimes it feels like people are
putting everything in your way to make
your one goal difficult to obtain
so our job instead of building more
stuff to put in their way is to work out
what to remove to simplify that
experience this is the idea of remove
the in essential so that essential can
speak when you have a hundred features
on the page you don't know which one the
user wants which one's really powerful
or not so let's go on to setting the
target outcomes this is where it gets
you can get very deep into this Tom Gill
as one of the people who's been doing
this since the 60s and he talks about
quantifying outcomes so outcomes again
people from the agile community if you
think of that analogy things like scrum
web playing a team sport but the idea is
it's only when we get that ball over the
goal do we succeed so what we're doing
at the moment is setting the goal posts
with target outcomes it's a good idea to
keep them really big simple and visual
what I find with management people think
they want big complicated reports it's
the exact opposite if you put a nice
one-pager together with some beautiful
you know pretty graphics showing where
you are talk about the things they care
about how much money they're making how
much you're spending where we're heading
on a target outcome and they'll be just
happy with that so this target outcome
let's say that we had a site like our
Acme comm online retailer an Amazon when
they started it took about two weeks to
buy a book now you would have a target
outcome saying you know eventually let's
maybe they started off saying let's get
that down to a week what can we do to
bring it down to a week the entire cycle
from when you decide you on a book to
in your hand where have we got the big
gaps why does it take two weeks maybe
it's from when we send the order through
to shipping though we need to make that
a more effective process whatever we do
and we start playing up those options we
can use these progress indicators so you
can see we start at two weeks that's the
blue then everything we do we can start
showing how it's progressively getting
us to our target I think this is the big
difference between people saying we have
these KPIs these metrics we want to get
to this end state but there's nothing in
between no visibility on are you making
progress someone will say we're going to
make fifty million dollars and at the
end no one actually really checks
whether they did or not with this model
we want to be constantly looking at the
metrics every iteration to see is what
we're doing having an impact if not stop
doing it don't waste the money remember
I talked about indras net that
everything is connected so if we had a
target outcome at the top which is to
improve the speed it takes to have
someone get a book we can follow that
all the way down even in the backend
layers we might say well we know that we
get more drop off when people obviously
can't get to the site so let's measure
the quality of the system let's look at
availability and in this one we've said
you know what currently we've got 97.5
uptime if we get below 97% that's going
to be massive failure we've got to watch
we can never get done there we want to
get up to between ninety-eight
ninety-nine point eight uptime that's
what we're actually looking for we can
again measure our current progress and
see are we getting the system to the
right levels now what happens with
target outcomes which is interesting is
you can link them all the way up from
the top of the company saying we want to
make more money we want to get more
customers we want to keep customers we
have all the way down to the back-end
systems and show the causation and
impact that each one has that can affect
the other meta outcomes we're actually
running these models and a couple of
companies at the moment one in Europe
and one in the
okay and we have a net of value and it
goes through the entire company every
product decision is tied back to how
these metrics will help and how the
outcomes will get affected that's
actually personally after doing agile
for a long time I'm finding that this is
having a lot more faster impact on the
right products earlier when I said you
know we made 12 million in three days
that was a real story through looking at
the data and the first week when I got
to a company we put in a change that
saved them 12 million in the next year
this is pretty compelling any
consultants in the room yeah you can
imagine how well that sells right in
your first three days we just saved you
12 million so the goals are not only the
outcomes are not only from the technical
side the product the business but you
think about the goals for the people
again we want to be doing goal mapping
so the way that I will arrange my
outcomes the next step down to decompose
them is into the user goals so we create
journeys through the system how do we
help them obtain their goal when you can
do that that's how you start breaking
down your work and this is what you can
run your sprints or cycles depending on
the method you're using again
this model is most suited to iterative
or flow based work because we need the
fast feedback cycles we're going to
create the options these are our
potential solutions so here's an example
I wanted to improve the shopping cart
conversion here's the problem that I've
stated people abandon it the impact if
we convert 1% of our users that will
total 14 million pounds per year so
every 1% of conversion that we can
improve upon is worth a lot of money
here's some different options I've got
up there I've got things like usability
availability we've talked about things
like caching patience I've got things
like I might want to do price testing
again if you're running things like big
websites you'll set up frameworks to be
able to divert your traffic you've
probably heard about a B or multivariate
testing where you want to run multiple
versions and see which of these things
will really have an impact on our
customers do you know who is one of the
best companies at doing this in the
world that I know of who really runs on
numbers do you remember your in my talk
the other day I'll give you a hint
Amazon so Amazon if you read us some of
the stories about Jeff Bezos they have
down to a fine art that's why when you
get on Amazon you can buy a book
immediately right you click on that one
click buy and you have a book
downloading they do it through intensely
looking at the data and usage patterns
all the time thing with options is we
don't have to play them out again I like
using the word options Chris Matt's
friend of mine in London is coming out
with a graphic illustrated book soon
which is all about real options thinking
and he takes the financial thinking that
every option you want to basically keep
the option open for as long as possible
but be older are executed rapidly we
often work in very dynamic environments
Chris has worked a lot in finance things
change so fast you don't want to plan
everything upfront but you do want to
keep the options enough that you
understand hey if the market does this
we could play a if it does that I want
to play B so you create these models
back in a start-up in 2003 San Francisco
we created an options model and every
quarter we would get together and accord
it road map Tetris do you know the game
of tetris it's like your kids go in
little blocks and you have to fit weird
shaped blocks together to make a total
block of value instead of setting just
one yearly budgeting every quarter we
get together and each of those blocks
was like an option that we could play
out and we'd say which ones make us
funny which ones save us money okay
that's what we're going to do next so we
kept doing what we call rolling based
planning so the budgeting needs to also
be very fluid if you're going to use
this options model finally we deliver we
measure and we adapt we're back into a
very familiar iterative territory we
want to execute rapidly look at what's
happening and then adapt based on that
again you'll notice so far on the talk
it's a bit of a mash up right it's very
quantitative data but it's also about
getting out and understanding the users
so you need to be doing both not one
without the exclusion of the other
reason I called this gorilla testing and
Stig I put your donuts up Stig the other
day was saying my talks I hacked it
together at 2 o'clock in the morning
it's very black and white so I've got
pictures of donuts this is because I had
a lot of people saying to me we don't
have user researchers we can't afford
the budget to do this and I'm like
really it doesn't have to cost a lot I
was working with a warrant from the
police department in New Zealand and she
said the software though building was so
awful so she worked for the government
she it used to be a policeman
she said it was so unusable it was just
painful and it killed her she felt bad
writing such a palling software and she
said but you know they don't understand
the users this is back to the point
you've got to take people out to see it
so I said to her how much does it cost
for a taxi to get your team into the
police department no $20
do they like donuts the police people
yeah they actually do so buy a box of
donuts go see your friends free
afternoon take the development team so
they did they pardoned to the taxi went
and saw them and sat beside the police
people in the afternoon and they watched
and after a while they realized these
people came in after really hard day and
it's pretty stressful work they had to
do all this paperwork and enter and all
the time before they could go home
they're exhausted they going to do it
and of course the software so horrible
so immediately they said of all the
developers get inspired run back and
they start changing the system asking
the police people is this what you know
how's this working for you do you manage
to do it
getting constant feedback and that's
what it took for about $30 they did
rapid user testing so don't buy that
excuse and in fact like I said earlier
research is too expensive to leave to
the researchers have someone to design
the experiments but get your whole team
out do what you can and then prove it
don't plea it how many people have been
in those meetings when you've got very
key stakeholders arguing I think is this
know mines the most important no other
users don't want that instead of that go
and get the data again you know it's
very simple to run some simple tests you
can even mock-up these things get them
in front of a real user get some instant
feedback that way you defuse the emotion
we should not be making emotional
decisions we should be making scientific
decisions based on validated learning
okay so this is where we get into these
ABCD split testing even if you're
building hardware we can mock up a lot
of things we can get them in the hands
of people one of the teams who is doing
testing on a new cash machine little ATM
machines that was great
they had a cardboard cutout they had all
the little slots on the machine and when
someone would go and put their card and
someone was behind the card will cut out
taking the card making little sounds
putting up a piece of paper showing the
next screen someone would click it and
then they'd give them money back
right that's that's what they did they
didn't have to go and build the massive
ATM machine big thing for us to remember
because it's so easy to write things
like user stories in the agile community
it's so easy to go so fast and build
more code is that we actually want to go
for Minimum Viable not maximum possible
the game has changed
every time you think about getting a
release out there what's the smallest
amount we could possibly put in to meet
that goal the great thing with target
outcomes is that once we set them people
say hey I've got a great idea let's make
it quantum pearl gold-plated cool thing
they like great but how does that help
su buy a book
well doesn't really but it'd be so cool
right yeah we're not doing that actually
so more output does not equal more value
in fact more money to build it more time
to get it to market more defects to kill
your customers I got this one from
someone working in life-critical
pharmaceuticals she said every line of
code we write can bring a defect into
the system defects kill people so we now
have gone to this model we're building
40% less of what we used to do our risk
profile has dropped dropped dramatically
and finally more resources to kill our
planet it's kind of funny but when you
think about it the more code we're
running on servers imagine how much
power we are generating so we the agile
community are speeding up the use of
resources so if we save the features we
save the world so now I'm ready for
questions does the product owner so the
question was what do you do when you're
a distributed team your users are in
another country speaking another
language your team is they're not even
literally speaking the right same
language the product owner is the person
communicating the needs through and the
product owner speaks the language of the
users right and what kind of product if
you can tell me are you working on a
payroll system yeah now you can run if
the product owner goes on site to the
customers you can do remote viewing
again fast dirty cheap I'll take a
little webcam to describe my computer
whatever and we'll actually set it up
that we can and even have some live site
so imagine that we go over put in I
don't care what it is you know laptop
monitor a little webcam have it aimed on
the user and have that set up so that if
you've got a translation the product
owner can say right we want you to be
able to enter your time into the system
whatever it is they have to do show us
how that works
your team can actually be viewing them
do it to get the feeling what they need
to do I probably in that circumstance
we're getting the product donor to learn
a little bit about how to run some basic
user testing because again if you
understand what the outcomes are for the
customers don't ask what they want again
a very dangerous question say what's the
aim well we need to be able to do
bimonthly
whatever it is payroll we need to get
these people in the system here are the
outcomes how available what are the real
goals for the user if we can map that
out rather than the detailed
requirements it gives you a little more
flexibility to try things and again get
into a point where you can iterate and
get them to test out things you might
have to do some paper prototyping get
your product owner to go over and run it
with them again ideally I'd send some of
the developers with them on site even if
you can't speak the language fully you
can see what's going on it's a difficult
situation you know and there's that
means that if the product owner doesn't
know what they're doing or translates it
very well it's gonna be a big problem
most distributed teams in general I
always suggest doing a lot of pictures
draw things up sketch out prototypes I
found when I worked with teams in India
we'd send a specification and any kind
of picture
they'd just code off the picture they
wouldn't code off the spec so I would
suggest you start moving to a more
visual style maybe to get things really
on paper fast Eddy cheap enough that it
makes sense and brings it back so
there's a lot of materials up on things
like paper prototyping or prototyping
systems I probably do a sketch out of
that first and if that helps
right so the question was just her to
make a little quicker
it's a your building what web products
and the product owner is sort of drawing
up the how very quickly the sheets again
if you miss the earliest steps you don't
know why you're doing it so this comes
to further down when we start sketching
things up running prototyping etc and
even then remember I talked about
options there is no one right answer
therefore we'd again do multiple
versions hey if you want to get to here
which one which is the easiest flow
through again there's better prototyping
tools that let you do more flow based
work as opposed to just static pages but
this again you have to know why there's
that you running me the story of the
bricklayers which you might have heard
the three bricklayers and one bricklayer
is putting up his bricks he looks very
unhappy he's doing a bad job he puts up
the bricks it's not very even it's all
full and he's shoving them in and the
guy says what are you doing they said
I've got this crappy job I'm putting
bricks in I don't get paid much you know
it's awful all down hot sun putting up
bricks he's whacking them in he goes
there's another guy beside him and he
looks happier he's doing a better job
he's putting up more bricks doing nice
jobs I said oh what are you doing and he
said oh well I've got this job I'm an
apprentice I'm learning to be a
bricklayer so I'm learning a new craft
this is great
putting up the bricks so a little guys
standing beside him he is just smiling
he's so happy he starts putting up the
bricks a beautiful one he makes sure
it's straight another one he's very
quick but doing a beautiful beautiful
job he said what are you building they
said oh I'm building a cathedral so this
is if we just tell people go implement
this which reading them like the
bricklayer with a crappy job which is
how many developers feel if we tell them
hey we're building the cathedral why we
want to speak to God or what have you
doing there so this is the thing to both
inspire and of course you're going to
say we need it to be about this high we
need to keep it in these costs we need
to make sure that the quality levels are
here and so again if you skip the step
every developers going to feel like a
bricklayer you're going to get code
looks like those badly put together
bricks yeah so we're talking about the
product I know becoming a bottleneck
it's a big issue especially hmm so while
we have product owners in the agile
community Toyota has the chief engineer
but their job is to facilitate the team
to get them understanding what they're
building they work together
they often take the teams out to do the
user testing I met with the chief
engineer of Lexus once when I was in
Japan I was asking about his development
process and he said yeah he got into
automotive engineering because he loves
racing cars he loves fast cars when they
worked on the Lexus they went to Europe
and they all got given a Porsche and
Mercedes you know these luxury fast cars
they sort of laughed and said yes I
never once got a speeding ticket so
obviously he really tried them out and
but that's what they do they all go out
and do this you know and so I think the
idea that we have one single voice
doesn't mean one single only voice when
you've got that bottleneck happening
again I try to get people into this
target outcomes this is what we're going
to measure how are we going to validate
if we say that we think that someone
should be able to buy a book with the
next amount of time how we validating it
it's not you product owner but we're
talking about out Marge who's never used
a computer much in your life so you know
if you have the measures you've
discussed how you're going to validate
them to set up the experiments first and
then try to get it out to users it can
be really difficult and if that becomes
a blocker you know if the products not
working you do have to fix it so it's
sort of again most people try their best
they probably think they are doing the
best you need to re-educate and say hey
this is a way that lets get better
testing going let's validate it early
and often that's a great idea yeah so
the brand the question is have you
applied it to something like brand
awareness to me everything is infinitely
measurable so if we say brand awareness
how would you test that there is brand
awareness out there
can you ask people surveys is the data
reliable without thinking about it it's
hard to answer but I'd be thinking about
the experiment so you sort of start at
the end your reverse engineering your
whole process by saying if we want brand
awareness how are we going to test that
and you will be able to think of tests
if you're worried that you know if you
just ask them on the street is that
going to give you the right idea but
maybe you do things like you know if you
did guerilla style and you're just
checking to putting a new logo out maybe
you go and do some posters with this
little logo sitting on it somewhere
where people walk to work even if it's
people from your work or something else
and just say hey you know if you were
looking at it do you remember what
company this is you know you can do some
funny little experiments just to trigger
things again not perfect but maybe it
gives you more it's to me I prefer in
context testing so when you do usability
labs you get five random people off the
street whereas when you do something
like you know the multivariate testing
we can test with thousands of people
instantly in the right context
so if you really want to check branding
you've got to do it in context so be
putting it in different places trying
you know there's all sorts of things you
could do you could do little brain tests
that you throw up a little IQ test do
you remember the last memory thing of
this win a prize you know and then which
ones at the end ask the little question
by the way whose logo is this you know
there's all sorts of quiet fun things
you could do there right and then once
you set them up if that's the game how
do we test that fast dirty cheap without
spending a lot of time when doing it
that's time stick them I'll just take
one more question
one more question yeah one more iCare we
done thank you everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
