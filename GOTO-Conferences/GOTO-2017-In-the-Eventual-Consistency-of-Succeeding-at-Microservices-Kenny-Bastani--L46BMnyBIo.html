but I'm mostly on an airplane traveling
around the world getting to do cool
things like talk about spring which I
love and also writing a book called
cloud native Java to the labor of love
over the last two years with Josh long
who's also a screen developer advocate
and this book is all about building
microservices his cloud native
applications using spring boot spring
cloud and cloud foundry oh I also like
to say that I I build highly scalable
hello world app that's going to be a
theme so all right so a little bit of an
agenda we're going to talk about
monolith to micro services so tracing
the progression answering the question
of why why are we on this path and I'm
going to show you an online store
example that I put together for the book
I'm gonna walk through a demo of it
usually I have people guess how many
micro services if you want to just shout
out a number I welcome you to do that
then I'll talk about screen boot a
little bit who's using spring today just
curious that's a lot of people and then
I'll talk about event-driven
microservices some of the work that I've
done research that I've done some of the
things that I've seen with biffle's
customers and I'll show you some
patterns that are successful ok
microservice is how did we get there so
we started with the monolithic
application architecture right this is
something that we should all be familiar
with now in this deployment we have one
war artifact and we have modules in
there I have a storefront UI I have an
accounting service an inventory service
and a shipping service so we have
modularity in this deployment but the
problem as you may know is that when you
have one deployment when you're sharing
one deployment pipeline and everybody's
working off that deployment pipeline
things are gonna slow down right you're
gonna have conflicts you're gonna need
to coordinate more and so this
introduces a bunch of problems into this
kind of architecture so first of all
it's going to slow our velocity getting
the production right so if we have a
bunch of different teams who are
competing to add features in the product
that's really gonna slow things down and
also it takes too long to ramp up
engineers so it's not so simple just to
add more engineers to a project to go
faster right so if we have a million
lines of code codebase has a million
lines then these developers
to spend time ramping up on that code
before they're able to effectively
commit changes and not commit defects
into production so at some point the
code base becomes too large for any one
person to fully comprehend right and the
most productive engineers become
historians they become the storytellers
the Oracles that you go to not the
database but the people the people that
you go to in the organization to learn
the history of the codebase and they're
the most productive engineers usually
they started the application they have
all of the context necessary to
understand how to implement new features
and they're stuck telling this story
also there are two opposing forces in
this kind of development on a monolithic
application right so you have one force
which is the developers who are
responsible for making changes and then
you have other forces that are opposing
those changes right so there's these
flood of changes that are getting into
production and then you have DBAs you
have your ops team who are resisting
these changes they're fighting back
because they have other responsibilities
that aren't pretty important like
keeping production on line making sure
the database stays on line and so we
have this kind of this push and pull
between these two teams that causes a
lot of strife and we also have to
coordinate a lot more right so our
release cycles are going to get bigger
because we have to coordinate more
between our product managers between our
teams and this kind of creates this
culture of negotiating bartering on
which features get into the next release
and then our operations team is
responsible for all of the
infrastructure right they're responsible
for the runtime environment of the
applications and so we have our
developers who may want to use a new
tool or a new version of a tool and
they're gonna have to go through submit
a ticket to operations to get a virtual
machine upgraded right so our ops team's
gonna be responsible for all of our
infrastructure not just making sure the
application stays online and monitoring
it but also responsible for up creating
these virtual machines and that's a lot
of responsibility but more than anything
it's this right you have to deploy
everything at once or nothing at all and
that creates a lot of cultural
problems which slow things down and
create a lot of friction so then we move
to this we move towards the
service-oriented architecture the SOA
and here I have an example of a services
team who's managing three different
services the accounting service
inventory and shipping and now we've
gotten a little bit better right we
split out that one deployment pipeline
into three different deployment
pipelines and there may be more but the
problem here is that it's not so easy
just to deploy one service if I have one
change now if you look at the very
bottom there in green we kind of have
these these domain objects that we're
using as a language to implement
features in the application so if I just
make a change to let's say customers or
accounts then I can just deploy the
accounting service no big deal no
problem but what happens if I make a
change to the address record then I have
a coordinated release of three separate
artifacts right and what happens if
something goes wrong now I need to roll
everything back at the same time as well
and so this creates a lot of complexity
which isn't very efficient for making
sure that production doesn't go down so
now we've arrived at micro services
right and we've gotten better at a lot
of things we've also kind of got a
little bit worse at some things but in
general it solves a lot of these
problems that we had with a monolithic
application architecture so first of all
small teams are going to organize around
business capabilities I'm sure most of
you if you've attended the previous
tracks today I've heard this story over
and over again and then we're gonna have
each micro service team expose an API
over rest over HTTP and they're gonna
integrate with other services so we're
gonna have this producer and consumer
economy of api's which are going to be
used to implement features now the
beauty of this so theoretically is that
each team can go at their own pace they
can independently deploy their changes
to production and they don't have to
worry about all these other teams
competing with them to introduce
features into one large monolithic
application so each micro service is
independently deployable right well each
micro service is independently
deployable which is going to increase
the speed that we can get changes into a
production environment
but each micro-service has to be careful
about the changes that are the libraries
that they're gonna share right so if
there's a library that's shared across
these microservices and i make a change
and i have a coordinator release then
we're stuck into the same problem but at
a hundred microservices or more that's
going to be very hard to manage so teams
can pick the best tool for the job
that's one of the benefits you see a lot
of yellow here in this example
application I have a movie application
kind of like Netflix I have the user
service the movie service rating
recommendation and analysis now each one
of these applications is a small team of
developers and each one is able to
choose the tools that are best suited to
solve the problem at hand
for example the rating service is
responsible for generating
recommendations they're gonna connect a
user object to a movie object using a
rating and they're gonna generate a
recommendation now what they're doing to
do that is that they're going to use
Apache spark they're gonna use graphics
to create a page rate PageRank
recommendation off of that data now that
data doesn't really fit well into a
relational database and so they decided
to use neo4j instead which is a graph
database and so one of the benefits with
this architecture is you can choose
these tools that are more efficient at
solving some problems that you would
otherwise have to use a relational
database and then transform that data
into a graph which adds a lot more
complexity but things also become harder
right so if we have a transaction that
spans multiple services how are we going
to manage rolling back maybe an
inconsistent state that spans three
different services so if I have a rating
service a transaction that spans the
rating service user service and movie
service and something goes wrong with
the user service now I've changed State
in three different databases all with
their own different guarantees and I
have no reliable way to rollback that
change right and so that's why we use
things like event sourcing because we
have a audit trail of all of the events
that have happened that have changed the
state of the system and can use that to
rollback
so now I'm going to walk you through an
online store example that I put together
I'll have you guys shout out a number of
how many micro-services you think are
behind this application
so this is cloud native outfitters not
quite let's try something else
so this is cloud native Outfitters
it's a online store application they put
together and it sells just for t-shirts
now this is built with microcircuits and
this is just the front end application
the it's a single page application just
with static content HTML CSS and
JavaScript and I can go ahead and
explore the product catalog here so I
can go to one of the shirts that's not
cool that's embarrassing
somebody got access to my AWS account I
shouldn't show that in my demos my keys
all right so I'm gonna pretend like it's
a real application alright so here's the
online store application and what I can
do is I can add products to my cart and
I can check out but before I do that I
need to sign in i'm redirected to an
oauth2 gateway and so I'll be redirected
back to the application so there's at
least two apps here and what I can do is
just a basic workflow of adding products
to the car and then checking out and
creating an order now if you want to
think in terms of a front-end developer
how hard would it be to communicate with
500 different micro services and a
back-end to develop out an application
now for our front-end developers they
want to be able to develop the app just
in the same way that they have with a
monolithic application and so we can use
something called an api gateway to do
that so i have you guys guests i know
it's not as exciting as showing you the
demo i'm sorry about that but how many
micro services do you think more than to
our power in this application i heard
five heard eight ten yes in the back
there's ten micro services here not at
the very top we interacted well very
briefly with the online store web and
that's hosting our static content in the
middle there we actually would have
interacted with another service called
the user service which is the oauth2
gateway now in this process of being
redirected back to the online store web
i'm able to use these services in the
middle to reuse these services across
all my micro service applications but in
order to develop against a lot of micro
services what i can use as an api
now they're in the center I have the
edge service in red which is going to
act as my API gateway which I can use to
reverse proxy into back-end services now
at the very bottom those are my micro
services I have a catalog service an
account service inventory shopping cart
and order now each one of these micro
services has their own database it's a
small team of developers who are
implementing features and deploying
independently but that API gateway in
the center is going to allow front-end
developers to seem seamlessly integrate
with these back-end services so they can
just reverse proxy to four slash account
and that gives them access to the
account service or a forward slash cart
and that will give them access to the
shopping cart service now I have some
other things here I have a discovery
service and a configuration server that
those things are gonna give me the
ability to be able to centralize my
configuration management as well as
being able to discover other services
now in the process of using micro
services or going to micro services it's
not so simple just to build new
applications and so companies are
wondering who who have solutions or
software that are 10 years or more old
how do I go from my monolithic
application to a micro service and so
this is one method which is called
splitting the mic splitting the monolith
where I can go into my monolithic
application and module by module I can
extract them out refactor them into
separate applications and then I can
communicate back over HTTP now the first
step in this process is to in this
example I have a customer service there
which used to have a friend front-end
inside of it the first step is I'm just
going to rip out that front-end and I'm
gonna create that as the online banking
application there and then I'm going to
communicate over HTTP back to the
customer service now I have a discovery
service and a configuration service here
as well which are going to help me as I
add more micro services be able to
discover discover other services and
manage my configuration now in the
backend that's going to be the first
place I take a look at when I decide
what's a good next service to extract
out now I have a user table here which
looks good of course there's no foreign
key relationships or anything connecting
it to the other tape
in the database which makes it great and
what I've done here is I've migrated
that to a new database called the user
dB
I've also refactored the customer
service all of the code related to
authentication for users to a new
service called the user service now this
looks very simple right so on paper this
looks good but in practice how well does
this work has anyone tried this is
anyone skeptical I'm a little skeptical
right because you have all this other
stuff there in the backend that you're
not really paying attention to right
like a data warehouse right or foreign
key relationships it's not so easy just
to rip things out and create new
applications now people do this and
they're successful with it but it does
introduce a lot of problems with old
applications legacy applications you
have an ecosystem of communication
between software that it doesn't make it
so easy just to rip things out and
create it as a new micro service so
there are problems with micro services
as well the first one is is that there's
no foreign key constraints between
services right so if I have three
different micro services and they're
referencing objects to one another that
are stored in their database if I delete
one then I don't really have a foreign
key constraint and the other services to
delete those objects as well I'm going
to switch my view real quick
so splitting up my large database with
years and years of history isn't so easy
and it's not going to be done without
interrupting the business as well
another microservice problem is I have I
have legacy problems I've got layers and
layers of legacy scarring that runs for
my ESV all the way down to my mainframe
and I have to worry about how I add
another layer of Micra services all
around this right so I can use something
called the strangler pattern which over
time you'll run a new workload
side-by-side was with an older workload
and you can begin to deprecate or begin
to phase out that legacy technology over
time
another problem is what about my data
warehouse right so not only do real
companies with real software have
complex database schemas but they also
have ETL is running back and forth
between a production database and data
warehouse right so I have to worry about
that as well now getting everybody on
the same page at a large company is
pretty difficult right so you have to
get everyone together to agree on what's
affected by taking a module in a
monolithic application and refactoring
it out it's a micro service also teams
are gonna be creating redundant
functionality right so I've solved all
my legacy problems and I'm on track to
success my teams are pumping out
features very fast so I get that hooray
but wait there's more code lots more
code and you have a lot of teams that
are creating redundant code like an
authentication provider let's say we
have 15 different teams creating the
same functionality and now we have
snowflake implementations all across our
micro services but nobody really knows
what's being created the same in each
one of these services also distributed
transactions are brittle right so I've
solved all my redundancy problems I'm
extracting out redundant code on
creating as a service and providing it
through cloud platform but now I have a
distributed transaction problem so my
teams are creating transactions that are
spanning these multiple services and
because they're using brittle HTTP HTTP
my data gets into an unrecoverable can
inconsistent state
so now customer support is asking DBAs
to change fields in the database but all
the DBA is left and so now I have a mess
on my hand so micro-services introduced
a bunch more problems and I like this
quote so every bug becomes a
murder-mystery right so I somehow
managed to refactor my 500 micro
services to use event sourcing to use
CQRS to hand to handle distributed
transactions and that only took 10 years
and now everything's herbalists in AI
and chatbots but now I can't see what's
going on with my application right so I
have all of these different micro
services and I have no way to observe
what's going on when something goes
wrong so I have to go to each one of
these teams to figure out what's going
what's going wrong so I ask questions
and eventually I might be able to trace
the root cause
so distributed systems are very hard
right no one said it was going to be
easy but we need these other things
these other tooling to be able to help
us solve these problems so without a
venture of and architectures in a cloud
platform you're going to quickly drown
from all the hard problems that you
might have not known existed so a lot of
people are using spring boots today I'm
just gonna quickly go through it what is
spring boot I like to call on fill webs
tweet this is about last year when he
wanted to explain the difference between
Spring Framework and spring boot and the
way that he explained it is that the
spring ecosystem is really a collection
of projects which are like ingredients
that I can compose together manually to
bake a finish service or a cake now the
eggs here might be spring MVC and the
flower might be spring security now I
can have to configure each one of these
components manually and put them
together for my finished application now
spring boot really is just a way to Auto
configure to ask Spring initializer for
a set of ingredients and you get the
finished cake so since my first demo
fail I'm gonna try it another one
and so I'm gonna show you spring
initializer so spring initializer at
start dot spring do is going to allow
you to choose a set of ingredients that
you need to build your micro service and
so I'm going to quickly walk through
this here I could generate a maven
project or a Gradle projects I can
choose my spring boot version and then I
can name my service I'll name this the
user service and then I can choose my
dependencies so here I'm going to choose
web I'm gonna choose JPA that's going to
allow me to create my data objects to
use ORM to map them to a relational
database so I'll choose JPA
then I'm going to choose H - that's an
in-memory database I can of course
choose my sequel but I'll choose H - and
then I'm gonna need a REST API so I'm
gonna choose rest for posit or ease
that's going to turn my data layer all
my domain objects into a REST API
the last thing I'll choose here is
actuator now actuator is a special
project I can add on to my application
it's going to expose a set of endpoints
over HTTP which allow me to introspect
my application so I'll choose actuator
then finally I'm going to generate my
project and it downloads a compressed
folder with my source code and I'm just
gonna go ahead and run it so I'm gonna
use the command here
maven spring boot run and that's going
to compile my application and start it
up
so the application is going to start up
on port 8080 and if I open it up in a
browser feeling lucky
all right so I've got a localhost:8080
in my browser and I get back a response
here in JSON
it's the hypermedia response which tells
me what I can do with my application now
one of the things I can do out of the
box here is go to forward slash actuator
and I'm gonna get back a set of links
here that I can use to introspect my
application I can look at for instance
health which tells me a status of my
application or info which tells me very
little right now and if I go to env I
get an error which is expected because
spring boots going to auto configure
everything out of the box right so the
spring engineers have an opinion of how
these components should be configured
now if I go to back to the source code
here I'm going to open this up in
IntelliJ IDEA
anytime now
area
alright so in the project here I have a
configuration file if I go to source
main resources I have an application
properties file now in this application
properties file I can override all of
the default configuration which is the
opinion of the spring engineers and one
of those opinions is that they should
secure the actuator endpoint so nobody
can actually look at the environment
variables but if you go to start dot
spring bio and you go to /v + V it's not
secured but in the application it is now
if I go back to the console output it
says here that I should enable security
so there is say a key here which is
management dot security dot enabled
which I can add to my application
properties and I can disable it I can
also do things like change the port of
the application I'll change it to 7:00
to 7:00 - now I can restart that
application
and we can see that it started on port
72 72 so if I go back to my browser I
can see here that I can access the
environment endpoint now just to walk
through this I can see information about
the port that I'm running on I can see
information about the system properties
if I scroll down I can also see
information about the system environment
now in a micro service architecture this
becomes very useful right you're gonna
have all of these different applications
and you're gonna want a way to
introspect the environment remotely and
so this gives you a way to do that over
HTTP now this is probably what I did
wrong with that first demo is I put my
AWS secret key in all of my demos not a
good idea I don't advise it and the very
bottom very important is our application
conflict now in this block you're gonna
see all of the overridden configuration
that you have applied to the application
so we can see here the server port and
can see here that I've disabled the
security now in 12 factor applications
you're gonna want to separate out the
configuration from your build and put it
in the remote environment and spring
boot conforms to this and so here you
can see that it's coming from the class
path of the application at application
properties but I can also retrieve that
remotely from a configuration server
which is going to host that file for me
so now the good stuff the event-driven
microservices all right so now I'm gonna
talk about some of the patterns that
I've used for adventure of and
microservices now earlier I said that I
build highly scalable hello world
applications for living
I have about five reference projects of
Micra services and one of them is a
bench of a microservices now I worked
with Chris Richardson a bit who is
probably the foremost expert on a
venturi but microservices he has a
website called micro services dot IO and
I learned a lot from him about what he's
done with CQRS and event sourcing and
I've applied it to our spring boot
projects and created micro services so
the first thing is that you want to
treat events as first-class citizens
right so you're gonna use practices like
event storming which is a way to use
domain driven design to come up with a
design for your data in your application
which you can use to separate out your
applications your micro services in a
modular way the second thing is that
domain events have a subject and contain
immutable data so any data that's stored
in a domain event is forever immutable
and shouldn't be changed to change
anything to change state then you're
going to append events which mean that
some events can be used to reverse the
state if you got into an inconsistent
state you can append an event and use
that to rollback also every domain event
applies to state transition to an
aggregate right so we if we have a
domain object which is an aggregate it's
going to have a status field on it now
every single event that's applied to
that aggregate is going to change the
state and that's very important because
we're gonna be able to use that to
ensure that multiple events aren't
processed on the same object right so if
I have two or three events come in the
first event is going to be applied it's
going to change the state and then we
can't change that state again with other
events also domain events can only be
applied if the aggregate is in a valid
State so if the current state of an
aggregate is invalid Fernet
that is being handled we're just going
to reject the event and we're not going
to add it to the event log so an example
of this here here I have a directed
graph which is a state machine and if
you know what your state is then you
know whether or not an incoming event is
valid right so in this process I have
order created account connected
reservation pending and reservation
added now as the events are processed
we're going to transition our state to
each one of these statuses right so
going from order created we have an
order created event which sits at the
edge and we know which state we can
transition to so if I receive an order
created event but I'm in a reservation
pending status we know that I can't
advance right I also create meaningful
exceptions if a domain event can't be
applied so every event handler has the
opportunity to raise a meaningful
exception about why an event can't be
applied so since you know where you're
at in that state machine you can say
things like this account has already
been confirmed or you can say an active
account can't create an order right and
so this gives you a way to create these
exceptions in a natural way so your
developer can understand what's going on
when something goes wrong also event
sourcing stores every state transition
as an event in a log so every event
that's been applied to an aggregate is
appended to a log and a log is used to
recreate the state of the aggregate and
models the behavior of an aggregate over
time now we can consume this event log
in the same way we use version control
on our source code so here I have an
example which is an event log here and
we see that the order events are order
created account connected and
reservation pending now each one of
these events is going to have a time
stamp now making this event log
accessible is pretty important so what
you can do is you can build a hyper
media API and you can attach the event
log as a link on a resource and so if
I'm consuming an API
maybe it's an account API I can see the
event log that's connected to an
individual account
also commands are going to generate
events so one or more events so if I
have an a command like create account
I might have multiple events that are
fired off and handled by different
services so you can also attach command
stag Rockets just like I attached the
event log and each command is an action
and it's implemented inside and
aggregates class and it's going to
invoke this theory with a series of
events and you can make these commands
successful again via an API so here's an
example of a order object which has a
series of commands attached to it
something like a connect account Connect
payment and create payment so these
event handlers can subscribe to an event
and apply state changes to an aggregate
and this is going to allow you to be
able to process events from other
services for example if I have one micro
service for an account that can trigger
an event to create a new order that
order will be created by an event
handler that handler that sits on the
order service also the event log is used
to generate the current state of an
aggregate so in an example here I have a
full state machine and this is for an
order and you can see the transitions
between each box and I can use the state
machine as a guide to understand how to
recover from inconsistent States so at
the very top I have order created and
that's going to transition to account
connected and then reservation pending
and then reservation added but then I
have a fork I can go between
reservations succeeded or failed now in
the case that something failed we see
that down there I have reservation
failed event and the state and we can
see a final state here which is order
failed now if things get inconsistent I
can always use this event log to figure
out where I need to go right it's kind
of like a map so event handler is our
nodes on a directed graph so here you
see that state machine modeled again
so each one of these boxes represents
the current state but can also be an
event handler and the events themselves
are just relationships between these
states between these event handlers like
for example reservation failed now we
can add CQRS onto this to create
materialized views from a stream of
events so in this model here I have a
command query model and on the left side
I have suspend account now I'm going to
create an API that allows my consumers
to trigger commands like suspend account
and that's going to write to my database
so I'll update the status of an account
as suspended and then I'll be able to
query that from the account model which
is on the queries side so you have these
two sides I have a command side and a
query side now creating this as
microservices one of the things you
might do is to separate out the command
side from the query side as separate
applications and so here have an example
of a spring food application which is my
command service and that's going to
expose an API with a set of commands
that I can apply to an aggregate now the
results of that is that I'm going to add
event to the event store here which is
Apache Kafka and that's going to serve
as my transaction log my event log for
each aggregate then I could have an
event processor which is another
separate application and that's going to
pick up events and it's going to be
those events will be used to create a
connected model of data that's stored on
different services so let's say I wanted
to create a reporting database that
connects together all of the data stored
in all the different microservices then
I can use the event processor here to
output a materialized view into a
datastore which will then be read on the
query side and then I might want to add
an API gateway on top of that so at the
very top here we have a front-end
application similar to the architecture
I showed you earlier and that's going to
make sure that these separate
applications are all connected together
as a seamless API
now I can also add event handlers as
surplus functions now AWS has a service
called step functions which does this
but it's also possible to create a
spring boon application which is your
micro service which serves as an event
source and so then you can feed events
into a server list application and you
can begin to create these service event
handlers around your micro service which
allows you to do interesting things like
change state
so finally again I build highly scalable
hello world applications apparently they
don't work very well but so I've done a
lot of research into this and I have a
bunch of open source projects and blog
posts that you can look at in my blog
and but the advice I give you is just to
do what makes sense but don't build
micro services without events right if
you have to think about refactoring
later all of your micro services to
start using events it's gonna be very
hard and that's all I have so since
we're in Chicago I should announce we
have spring days coming up so if you're
interested in that I can talk more about
that later and provide feedback using
the go-to app and I appreciate your time
thank you
so we do have some time for some
questions so you have any questions out
there in the audience how do you load
balance the micro service is it any
different from load balancing other
services so there's two ways to load
balance right you can server-side load
balance or you can client side now with
spring cloud we provide functionality
for you to do that from the client side
so back in 2008 Netflix created kind of
a cloud native platform and they built
in client-side load balancing so with a
discovery service I can keep track of
these instances and where they're
located and then in my client
application I can just load balance
switch between these separate instances
actually I just follow up on that
discovery service so I assume you're
talking about Eureka yes correct
so if a company is starting new with
micro services and going to cloud would
you still recommend Eureka versus
communities well I would recommend if
you're using a cloud platform if you're
using app as if you have to implement
the same thing in every service for
instance client-side load balancing you
should instead provide that as a service
to your platform and so I recommend
using server-side load balancing but to
also possibly container to container
networking actually let me go back to
diagram here so in this diagram here
that online store what you can do is in
the middle there that can all be
server-side load balancing now they're
gonna have routes that you can bind to
with your platform but at the very
bottom those can all be container to
container networking those can just use
something like Eureka for service
discovery we had a question on the on
the magic app wondering if there was a
link to your the repositories you were
mentioning all the presentations you can
put up on the screen yeah so people can
find all of your reference architectures
so you can find them at cannabis Danny
comm and I have tutorials and open
source projects for each
not your help there we go so each one of
these blog posts will walk you through
the reference architecture I have a few
of them here for a bent ribbon
microservices and each one contains a
link to the open-source project time for
one more question maybe okay well if you
can join with me in thanking Kenny very
much for his talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
