little bit out of place here because my
talk is not as deadly serious as all the
other talks I was at the first to talk i
thought it's a fluke maybe the others
are a bit more like but no they're all
serious so well mine isn't okay so
surprised click engagin and so on i am
CEO of a company in amsterdam since 14
years and we make enterprise software
stuff serious stuff with java and osgi
that's really really very serious and we
are mostly focused on sports and
entertainment is also serious depend on
how you look at it two years ago we
started to spin off called sand rato so
that actually means wireless in
Esperanto the the language nobody speaks
and I'm senior technology architect I
made it up because I thought it would
look nice on a business card but i'm not
really a architect i make stuff so that
land that has a nice award last season
we are innovator of the year and
wearable technologies the world cup and
so i'm going to talk about technology we
do a little bit then i'm going to do a
completely doomed demo because that
always happens in demos and if you have
only demo so far on a conference huh ok
we'll see and then i will talk about my
personal journey a little bit because
i'm really like a native software guy i
always built only software and now you
get down through all the
spiritualization to hardware and that's
actually a very interesting experience
so our products here for vets entrado is
a wristband and that's an example of a
wristband you put it around your wrist
and then things happen so if we before
we talk about that if we strip it down
we see this is basically the unit it's
flexible you can bend it it's very
comfortable easy to embed it has 8-bit
microcontroller
and a 900 megas radio so 8-bit
microcontroller does not run Java it
also doesn't run docker so deploying
stuff on there is messier it's also an
RFID tag that's not all that special but
it's still cool there are two LEDs which
are multicolored and there's a button
you can press and then something
completely undefined happens okay so it
looks like this if you put it on nice
looking cool people so the other part of
the technology is our base station so
that's the the hardware that talks to
the over the 900 megahertz radio to the
bracelets right so those are in for
festivals we put them around the
festival and they communicate with the
wristband so if we zoom in a little bit
on that thing we see different parts is
not that visible but I probably don't
want to turn off the light in the middle
is a QB truck it's a sort of Raspberry
Pi its arm arm-based and runs linux
fedora and java and oh yeah it even
seems to run docker but I haven't gone
around to that story i'll try later on
top is power of eatin ethernet its power
to hood bide ethernet and on the right I
want to just point out some really
rugged piece of hardware it's actually a
lightning surge protector so if this
thing gets struck by lightning it's
supposed to survive it never happened I
was hoping for it but because I will
want to see if that little thing will
say that QE but we'll find out at some
point I guess so so where we have
festival we put those base station up on
objects whatever we can find that's more
or less stable we tied them to that and
then so we can cover the area okay so
once once we are set up we the different
base stations start to see each other
and and for former mesh network because
they need to do that because they need
to have a very strict synchronization
between each other because the stuff we
do is really time-sensitive so they need
to see each other so this is part of a
map so here you see one two three four
five six seven in total on a large
festival we have about 60 and all those
things are powered by ethernet and they
have their own network connection so
what can this thing do so we have
basically a bi-directional communication
between the wristbands and base stations
and we what we can do with that is low
resolution positioning so the wristband
basically says I see these vision these
base stations and then they've seen this
powerful the the signal is this strong
and it reports that up to the base
station at will and that will ship it
further down the line and based on that
you can make some assumptions with
triangulation where that person is we
can also use the lights the LED lights
on the wristband to create cool light
shows so then the base station broadcast
to the wristbands to turn the light on
in a certain color or off another thing
we can do is to imagine this there are
like two people with a bracelet and they
like each other and they can like
connect each other and then the bracelet
will connect with each other and then
they will tell the system these two
people have been connected and then our
social media platform will make a
facebook suggestion out of that so and
it's also button on it and it can detect
that button and what happens then is up
to the festival I guess so yeah why do
would anyone want to do this well big
data basically the big thing is
profiling people because if you have a
festival that
multiple stages people walk around and
it's really nice for an organizer to
know where they were how long did they
hang out here to which artists were they
interested in so that's actually really
valuable data the light shows for the
LEDs are of course very nice because it
really integrates with the people and I
think also it's kind of essential to
give the user something back because
otherwise it's like here's your tracking
stages tracking beacon now go play so
you have to sort of give something back
the social media connector obvious and
also the RFID chip that's like very
traditional stuff you can use it to gain
access to stuff you can use it to buy
stuff for payment and also for example
we have photographers making pictures
and then they can scan your wrist band
and then you'll get a that picture so so
another nice thing to do for the
security guys different kind of security
is a crowd density map of of the terrain
so they can have like a like a weather
map they can see where the crowds are
and more or less how it's I was divided
it is not like very accurate it's like
easily 10 20 meters off and it's updated
every few minutes depending on the
number of bracelets we aim at over
100,000 so that's quite a lot of
bracelet so I think it's time to do the
demo so one moment
so I have here two bracelets and i have
here an ipad and tricky how do i do that
so if i press this then oh this is so
beautiful then i can make different
colors yeah only one guy lawdy so we can
also do the other thing the the
connection thing so if i hope it starts
blinking blue and this one too and if i
hold them together at some point they
green and then they're connected so so
basically what happens then is that they
power down their radio way low until
they have only range of like a few
centimeters and then they can in a
peer-to-peer way figure out that they're
connected it's actually quite quite
important for at that scale that they
can do it peer-to-peer and then once a
both figured out they're connected they
will try to upload the data to a base
station whenever that's possible okay so
it doesn't really look that impressive
with one guy wearing two wristbands so
it looks a bit better on a video maybe
we can turn off that light just for a
moment might be dead 12 okay turn it out
so I sound I think we don't have sound
now you turn off number good number five
got into everything mute something else
yeah well that was the thing that was
going to fail again that's an impressive
but still here you see 100,000 people
wearing their bracelets it's cooler with
music but it's a yes the main stage at a
large festival and it's a yeah it's a
pretty massive scary actually there's
too many people for me this is a crowd
that's insane okay I see some different
colors red blue okay so now I want to
move on to the actual more stuff we are
about here and that's like the
production process in software we call
it a build in hardware it's a bit more
complicated and so if we walk through it
we start with a PCB design so that's
basically the chip design which chips go
on there that is a fire switch to thank
you and and the firmware design so
that's basically low level software that
runs on the 8-bit controller then we are
prototype and we can play around with it
a little bit actually the design of the
leather band and everything that's
really closely communicated with the
client because they want to brand it
with their own logos and everything so
that's done by fashion people and so on
and they make it pretty and then they
make a mock up and then they assemble it
so the the PCBs are assembled in
singapore they ship it to Italy they
assemble the prototype then they test if
it works because they all do it would do
that if it's a test around a ship to
answer them to us and then we can play
around with it see if they're happy
we're happy and if not we can actually
reflash the firmware but that's a quite
intensive process so that's not
something we can do in production so if
it's all right then it'll ships to
belgium and they will make a nice box
and they package it well homeless have a
thousand of them and they will ship it
to the consumer and then they will the
consumer put it on their wrist and they
go to the festival and when and then
they show up and then it should work now
I think you can imagine that this part
after test is terrifying because you
have committed for one about million
dollars worth of hardware that that
firmware is okay so well that isn't very
agile but yeah sometimes that's the way
it is so still if you think about it
compared to only like several years ago
having thus FL the development cycles of
a few weeks in hardware it's pretty good
you can actually do stuff with it so so
how did we end up here that that's a
question I have asked myself many times
over the last few days I was talking to
a guy at the meetup and now I'm here so
so there is no gadget and gadgettrak but
there is I think a story to tell because
we have been talking about how early
software was designed by hardware
engineers right we built at first we we
were used to building bridges and cars
and anything well with build software
just in the same way
right and later we have kind of figured
out that in software you can get away
with a lot of things where you can't get
away with with Hardware because of that
cycle right so you can just try stuff
not good and turn it back so we have
been doing that and we have really
gotten used to that and and now we have
like the cloud native application we've
been talking about a lot and that
basically is like another layer of
virtualization so basically we write
code we write some kind of declarative
manifest how it's supposed to run we
hand it over to some data center OS some
KU benetti's or whatever and then some
an opinionated pass and then everything
will work out but in the end it's like a
long dash running away from hardware and
me in my general in my software job i am
running java virtual machines inside
containers on virtualized stuff and
that's for me it was really good to get
back through all those layers of
virtualization and see hardware again
because that was the yeah so I think it
is good to realize that again because we
have I think we software people have
gotten spoiled because we can do
anything and if it's not good we can
undo it and we don't really need to
think about and that's that's like
really the big power of software but it
does make you do lose some bigger
picture I think I mean mankind has been
making stuff for years that wasn't for
millennia that wasn't a job and they got
along also so yes so the things lean
agile and rugged actually I didn't know
that I was going to be an agile so I
thought those three so
I am far from an expert of talkin on any
of these things so i will put those in a
really in a wearable context right what
does this mean for a wearable thing well
as I wearable as we talked about we
can't change hardware that's around
somebody's wrist you can't change anyway
hardware actually at the moment we can't
update firmware we could figure out a
way that we can over-the-air push new
firmware images but that's quite an
undertaking for 8-bit microcontroller to
do that in a secure way and not open up
all kind of problems because if
basically if that upgrade fails then
it's dead right so but we can upgrade
everything else so whatever we have of
the whole store per stack that does the
interesting stuff that is a job so we
have to focus on that so if we move on
to to lean I think an important thing
for wearables is that it's wearable
right that many of the old school
wearables if you I mean you can strap a
Raspberry Pi around your wrist you can
do it but it really limits the scope so
if you can get away with really the
minimal amount of hardware on your
person and do all the other stuff
somewhere else let's say in the cloud
then you can really do much more and
also the power consumption is important
because now there's a battery in it here
and here so that that's kind of okay
that's a three-fold battery and that
will last for weekend but that's about
it and if you want to do more special
stuff for example we used to have an
accelerometer in here so you could like
I don't know make some movement and that
the picks it up and didn't made that
movement but it was in that sense we
removed it because it takes energy it
makes it bigger
and it's not really necessary so put
complexity elsewhere where you can
actually deal with it a little bit
better so rugged if I think about rugged
this is more the stuff I think about
first of all your wearable needs to
survive somehow so we have done a lot of
tests and seeing how well it holds up in
water for example because my drain it
might all kinds of stuff might happen to
it and also the users are really not
aware their computer users at that
moment they are just having a thing
around the wrist while they drink fights
play in the mud whatever if they if
people buy an apple iWatch they will
cherish it and be careful and not play
in the mud but for for our users we
can't really ask that of them so we have
soaked them in all kind of fluids and
see how long they survive actually it
turns out that leather isn't all that
great I guess there's a reason why
submarines are not made out of leather
because the funny thing is if you remove
the leather you throw it in the water
you take it out it's pretty much fine
not forever button it's fine if you have
it in leather then it gets wet doesn't
get dry so it is just in a wet sponge
for a day and then scrolled it then it's
dead so leather looks cool huh ok so
another aspect of our of our gig
basically is that it's a rounded event
there is a show time and then it needs
to work if it doesn't work before it
doesn't matter if it doesn't work
afterward also doesn't matter it needs
to work then if it doesn't work then
maybe you can fake it somehow but if it
doesn't do anything you're kind of
screwed so it is actually we can get
away with a lot of we don't have to
maintain the service right we don't have
to maintain up time for weeks or years
it's it's more like if you compare a
racing car to a airliner or something
airliner has to work every single time
all the time a drag racer will have to
work for I think like four seconds and
then you take it apart anyway right so
we can we have to just make something
burn the stuff and probably also
ourselves out in the process and then we
can move on so that that's quite
different to most situations where you
really want the uptime so then it's
nearly festival time and it turns out
that if you go to a festival it is
complete chaos it's there like 2,000
people building up 60 companies nobody
knows each other and well that's that's
too much but everybody is doing their
thing
and everybody needs each other so you
try to get up in the priority of the
other people so for example we need
network so we're trying to find the
network guys to make to make sure our
base stations work but the network guys
also need to power guys who have to
bring the generators but the generators
aren't there and so it's like there is
no planning there but still once you
kind of embrace that let your kind of
emerged in that chaos and you try to
figure out with all the people around
you what you can do you can actually do
amazing things and every single time it
has worked out and I have I've been
amazed that actually with especially
like network people they can be bit
grumpy if you want some I want this in
this segment it's not normally is not
really good response but if you are in
it together because if those lights
don't work we all look bad right so it
does create a sense of togetherness that
i do not see an enterprise an enterprise
you blame each other so what we did
learn though is that dependencies are on
other parties technologies are really
really annoying because you just don't
know what you're going to find when you
arrive we need power the power is there
powered by generators but yeah at some
point they arrive maybe they don't I
don't know so we were working on battery
power to base stations that will work
for a weekend so we can just put them
everywhere we want we have made a
pluggable network layer so we can plug
in different mesh networks or maybe even
simply 3g to do a process to data and we
are working on the embedding gps in the
base stations so you just put them
somewhere and they can wire up
themselves you don't have to geo locate
them yourself
final thoughts I need to check that
before my final thoughts were first of
all I do have a lot of appreciation for
operations guys now because if you are
in a situation like that then everybody
is on call basically everybody is there
everybody's together and network stuff
is difficult it really is so they're not
really they always say that it's
difficult but it's true and it really
has been really good for me to get out
of your comfort zone doing the hardware
stuff but also doing the festival stuff
and getting a different perspective
because I have I look at how enterprise
works in a different way now now I see
how festival works I also look different
at software now I've worked with
hardware and I can really recommend that
to try it also what I mentioned before a
little bit you can do amazing things in
hardware so nowadays it is not outside
your league of a small company to make
your own hardware and you can take that
in your thinking and because we usually
are thinking ends at the end of software
but you can make hardware and it's not
witchcraft I thought so but it isn't so
actually it can add a lot to the two
you're a poor thing whatever you're
doing maybe you can add some hardware
maybe you can do really cool things and
that's my talk thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
