generally do weekly sprites and we run
them sort of based on this hypothesis
that the entire team comes up with on at
the beginning of the iteration the
reason we do it is that what we want to
do is ensure that every week we're
continuously deploying software but we
want to sort of anchor our iterations in
a user testing session and we want to
ensure we know what we're testing and we
want to ensure that we know sort of what
analytics are coming back from that test
when we use that to inform that the next
week's experiment Lee and all of this is
sort of to the point of we want to pay
down risk in a project and oftentimes
that's technical risk oftentimes it
sections product risk so I think the
thing to be aware of is we're not just
thinking about development anymore we're
thinking about sort of how things are
going to be used by people and ensuring
that what we're developing is
sustainable but it's also going to be
usable so you don't get a lot of
crumpton here in your code because
you're constantly sort of refactoring
and aiming towards reducing risk in your
project so what we end up doing is we
have lots of conversations about stories
and he's really important to sort of
point outfits stories that are
understood by the whole teams are
actionable or incredibly important so
when I say get the story straight having
the conversations with your team about
what is risky how you can mitigate that
risk how you can design that risk out
entirely and then what sort of the
easiest first pass of a story versus
kind of the bigger thing these are the
types of conversations that can vote get
your team to communicate better with one
another and also honestly get to a
product faster so the other thing we do
which is actually really fun endeavours
got a bunch of these stories that come
out talk them through kind of hear this
like you mr. cross them cross up on the
wall and we're trying to figure out
what's the biggest bang for the buck
right so the product of our work has the
opportunity to take these stories
they put them up on the vertical axis so
highest priority at the top lowest
priority of the bottom and they're
really the voice of the product and the
customer is point in time what do they
feel like this be utmost importance for
them for this project and then both the
developers and designers get to come in
and take those feature stories and move
them on horizontal axis designer might
say you know system take two or three
clothes it's going to be action quite a
bit work for us to sort of solve this
problem that's a lot of work or they can
say you know this is a really quick hit
developers get the same voice right they
get to be like well I'm just an easy way
for us to do this feature it's going to
be you know low box so at the end you
sort of end up with this biggest bang
for the lowest ataka scenario what
you're trying to do is grab together a
set of features that it's going to get
you to you at the deliverable hole so
this is something that is you can
imagine being a consultancy but honestly
for any organization if you as a
development team and really a product
team can step away at any point have a
cohesive piece of software that is
usable by customers you've done your job
now you're not confusing people you're
not dropping at a bunch of features that
are sort of disparate you're delivering
a whole user experience and so what
we're trying to do is ideally every
Friday these Sprint's that we're doing
we can step away and there is working
software that has business value to the
customers so always sort Amy to the
deliverable hole is something that we're
trying to do in their teens and then the
other thing this question constantly
comes up really again squared is
designed fit in and this is kind of the
crux of agile a lot of designers are
like I'm not going to be working at the
pace of these developers were working at
what we try to do is what we call just
in time to time so there's two reasons
we do this one is that designers are
always going to need to sort of have a
big picture scenario and we're not
trying to rush them through that process
but what we can do is we can empower
developers with things like you know you
can imagine bootstrap there's a ton of
different frameworks at this point in
time
get a product out to where you can test
it with just enough design to where
you're finding that product market fit
you know what you recognize when you're
doing product development is that the
actual brand experience instead change
over time we were sort of fine-tuning
what people want in this application so
what we're looking to do is have just
enough designed to go to the point where
we can really validate or refute our
hypothesis about what it's useful and
then we can step back and oftentimes it
really project that's when we do a
design spike and that's when the desire
to really have a much better
understanding how people where you see
the product what they want out of it
what really that visual voice should be
at that point so what we're trying to do
is really empower the developers with
design tools through you know visual
style guides and using sort of
frameworks of exist so that they can
sort of continued development without
feeling like their pressure and
designers and they're a lot like fun the
other thing we're doing this is just
really a fun one is at the very end of a
project everyone has in their online
their own perception of what they
perceive as a project risk and a lot of
the time you'll watch like to develop a
team like run off with economies man I
think this is totally stupid I get
weather thank you daddy on them and they
see risking the project that's very
different in designers and the product
owner so what we like to do at the end
of a project is sort of get everyone on
the same page put a bunch of big
question cards up on the wall so what do
you think is the scariest part about
this project what do you think is your
biggest question boise this biggest risk
and people sort of now go in isolation
be right down on these parts of you put
it up on the wall and these stay on the
wall for the duration of the project and
it really sort of alleviates that sort
of like infighting that can happen it
also allows everything to be really
pathetic about with others like risks
are dr. John
so it's actually kind of a really
powerful dynamic you get everyone in
line okay so I want to jump into some
case studies so these were two clients
that we worked with that we're just
really amazing and actually on these
projects really helped fine-tune our
approach to integrating agile and in us
so bookrunners our company that's a
really amazing sort of objective they
are trying to make education more
affordable for students by having the
purchase of text ones to be much more
transparent in terms of the pricing
structure so what they were trying to do
was get to a place where they could put
that information in front of students
when and where they needed it which is
effectively at the university bookstore
when the students are sitting there with
their class syllabus so what we're
trying to do is a mobile solution we see
an SMS and mobile web kit is a lot of
these kids don't flip phones and then
additionally try and figure out what the
best way was for them to really
understand that they have a lot of
different options for purchase of Texas
so really amazing engagement really
amazing product came out of it second is
there's committee called share through
and what they're doing is they're the
platform or native friend advertising
being embedded into their umbrella and a
brand content and tracking that is sort
of where they can surface analytics to
marketing departments to understand
really where their brand videos are
becoming weathering viewed and when they
kind of go violence so what we wanted to
do is take all of the stuff they were
getting from you know the distribution
of these videos and wait huge far sort
of nested domains and figure out where
the video went went it was cute and
really at what point it getting really
popular through a firewall and really
who was the influencers it did that so
you can imagine it was really powerful
for marketers because they could sort of
have this one snapshot of where the
distribution and what channels of those
google+ facebook if it was shared where
their video really became powerful
so on a macro level this is that we get
a glance at carbon 5 so Monday's this is
where sort of planning are we and we're
also reflecting on the previous week so
we're in reflections I'll kind of go
into details on tuesdays when we're
specifies this is really where we're
sort of you know understand what it is
that we're working on starting the work
on the cusp line ways that we're going
to do is with the developers in the
designers and then Wednesday that's
where feeling and refining so we're
actually coding we're designing and then
Friday this is when we get customer
feedback the one thing I will say is it
read like to have a flexible schedule so
something that happens during the course
of this project is maybe you have more
meetings in on mondays at the beginning
of a project towards the end of a
project your meetings are going to go a
lot faster and it's mostly because you
have those conversations happening often
enough to where people feel more at ease
say let's table this for later you know
what we're doing let's have this
conversation so this is just sort of a
note that these schedules are flexible
and even though we anchor it with
kicking off with an iteration planning
on my day through Friday user testing
what we're looking to do is we're
maximizing the efficiency here
minimizing the amount of sort of
documentation that needs to happen and
trying to facilitate any conversations
between these different groups of people
as often as possible
so Monday's we do oranges your test on
Friday so mundane is really after the
weekend because of time to reflect you
come in this is where we kind of allow
the team to do a little bit of white
thinking and this is the time when
design can get involved in based on what
they saw the news are doing we can rent
as I insurance does anyone have any
familiarity with design shreds or
personas people actually I want to pause
real quick here how many designers do we
having it means developers Jory anybody
that's like product or sales or
marketing okay cool okay so shorts are
something that's definitely something
that's on the design side of things but
we have found it to be incredibly useful
to pull developers into those activities
because they have unbelievable deep
knowledge into how you can push
technology and that can inform design so
we would absolutely have the developers
in for this sort of like broad making
and I dating about how we could pivot on
our product particularly as we were
doing stuff they'd have a lot of
technical complexity to it the other
thing we do a lot of my days as we run
reflections again all I emphasized we
bring the whole team in so this is the
problem the designers developers at the
same time running a retrospective so
they're doing the I like I wish I wills
with one another and or clustering us to
sort of come to learnings about how we
can all work better together and what we
want to carry forward
the other thing we do is that when we do
our user testing we're ensuring that
we're capturing feedback so we actually
have an application that we wrote that's
available every wants to use it it's
effectively just like upper 12 white or
and it happens real time so you guys see
writing and moving the the next around
so you have distributed teams this is
really helpful and what we do though is
that this is sort of a living document
that allows us to keep track of what's
happened finish your test and it allows
us to sort of do clustering exercises
about shared observations of what the
users with us applications so we kind of
go over this and this inevitably leads
to a lot of ideas being generated have a
whiteboard writing this is where the
product people this is actually the
October and bookrunner jumping up with
an idea about how he wanted to see the
two different flows because we were
supporting SMS and the WebKit how we
needed to sort of have those two flows
happen based on some feedback that we
got from users from Friday's so it's not
a designer but he's jumping up and he's
sort of informing the designer with some
thoughts that he had some what he'd seen
the users do these are really easy ways
without creating a ton of documentation
and delivering it to your team that
you're having those conversations real
time and it minimizes the amount of time
that's not one individual person and on
another individual person don't
understand what's been given to them so
the final thing that we do really are
not on Monday racial kickoff meetings is
that we do our hypothesis definition so
this is something that can come out of
just great discussion and it's you know
also something that the entire team gets
to agree upon so obviously the product
donor is the one that gets to drive the
hypothesis but what you find is that the
whole team has really been having these
conversations and said the agreement
sort of comes together pre fluidly and
again this is where we're sort of trying
to figure out what are the features that
we need to develop that are going to
give us that cohesive whole hypothesis
that we can test that Friday with users
and what are we going to see a sort of
the metric that will refute or balladeer
on my mom
so the other thing that I'd like to
emphasize was on mondays we give our
teens some time to sort of pay out the
technical debt so having a couple hours
to do refactoring or do those things as
developers you're like oh this part of
the code is smelling a little bit I want
to fill out some tests I want to back on
it also what ends up happening is as
your sort of pivoting your product
there's features that are not going to
get used to anymore see if you can clean
this up keep your code really
streamlines you can continually add on
to an admission written for the same
thing ends up having a little bit with
design there's a lotta clean up that
happens and the funny thing that happens
is when you have people witnessing users
using both code it's lines they created
they are so excited so motivated to fix
those things so this is actually really
powerful what you do on Mondays so
Tuesday's we've kind of got a little bit
brought on Mondays this is when we
really focus and get specific I will say
this is what we're doing our story
writing but frankly story ready happens
throughout the week because there's a
really a time that this happens or think
that this happens this happens all the
time but what I will say is there's that
might heart to story writing a lot of it
has to do with the conversations that
you want to have about stories this
looks like the ton of stuff to writing
for a story um what I will say is that
what we try to do at the very beginning
of a project is sort of enforced some
discipline or a story writing by making
it really lengthy to begin what will end
up happening over the course of the
cycle of the team is that this will
degrade a little bit but even if it
degrades a little bit your bar is still
incredibly high so what we're looking to
do with the stores here is they have
that conversation but we're facilitating
the conversation with creating a
narrative and the narrative is really
identifying new persona that we're
writing this more and
or benefit our cert births and what it
is that we're going to be delivering for
them since business value and then we're
backing that up with a very clear
acceptance criteria so this is actually
pulled from Daniels being so he's
speaking at this conference which is
really pulling here from here this helps
us to sort of very quickly run through
the scenarios both as developers truly
identified we're going to have to
estimate this we want to really know
exactly what it is that we're doing and
it also helps the designers to really
understand from both the technical
standpoint as well as a product
standpoint we're all under rewriting
this together what it is that we're
going to be doing what the flow really
looks like what are sort of the edge
pieces that we need to think about
having the designer and developer there
talking with one another oftentimes you
come to the conclusion hey designer
there's a much easier way we could do
this you know this is going to be a
one-point story if we take this approach
versus a full-court story of creating
another bridge right so it has that
conversation that will get you great
efficiencies in your development and it
allows the desires to relate ran the
trade-offs more from a development
perspective so the other thing that's
going to end up happening at some point
in your project is you're going to have
a kind of story so is anyone here
familiar with story mapping okay so this
is actually a really effective way if
you start to label your stories with
either the personas that you're kind of
creating these stories for or sort of
specific enough search or caliber no
labels that really specify what those
stories are in sort of an epic context
this will give you this high level math
review of really where the product is
heading this is really helpful for
product knowledge that get really itchy
about what is it that my development
team is doing and it allows them to sort
of go upwards in the company and say
look this is where the products going
this is what we're doing through this is
how we're meeting the user needs so we
actually rewrite application old story
before I up for this
you use pivotal tracker and abuse labels
it literally which is suck it in
automatically and create the story
enough for you and then you can either
put this out or you can just share the
URL with folks that are interesting
story goes like macaroni pictures so
wednesday and thursday this is one you
know robert hits the red we're really
getting development done so we're coding
we're pushing we do continuous
deployment so every second of every day
there's a potentially new sort of
feature going out and acceptance we
really supporting acceptance of the
clients interested in it the other thing
that sort of naturally happens at this
point is that there is an ability for
team members to really be in pathetic
with one another and so they now a very
complete they have an issue or a problem
they can grab one another developer to
be graphic designer and they can jump up
and just whiteboard through situation on
the board without saying a designer I
need a design for this it just it
facilitates those sort of interactions
and the other thing else says I kind of
went through this before but the
developers if they get to story where
they don't have a design attached to it
they feel empowered to sort of take a
pass at it and they feel empowered
because we give them either a living
style guide or an actual kid a part of
design tools that they can sort of take
their first approach of this design
oftentimes it will happen what they have
sort of a concept of what the overall
picture is but it allows them to not be
blocked by design and then what they do
is once they're done they're almost
ready to deliver to our they need to
have a design polish on us and we'll
grab the designer and we do a lot of
this roots and desire develop a pairing
together and they're actually looking at
the code and they're doing sort of that
pixel perfect you know the sponsor kind
of out of line or maybe more white space
here you know let's get rid of it
they're doing this in the code so they
can just be checking in the CSS with
HTML whatever it is and they can deliver
it real time with the designer
there no documentation necessary no sort
of waiting for anyone so it's just a
really great way to sort through the
efficiencies running the other thing
that will say and think we all know this
is like as personally us as developers
we actually like to get stories rejected
mostly because it means that somebody is
paying attention there's a critical eye
being put towards the work that we are
delivering so I would say if anyone here
is sort of doing acceptance for the team
definitely make sure you're doing this
routinely it's the thing that sort of
allows developers to know that someone's
looking at the one that they're doing
and that it's being q8 as well so this
absolutely pays downward that light
being curd if no one is looking at these
stories is there any delivered so
acceptance is really critical so finally
Friday this is where we have to figure
out how we do how are we doing sorry so
in the morning oftentimes it's sort of
cleaning at the code doing q a sort of
integration testing and manually through
the code and insurances are ready for
the users that you're going to bring in
this afternoon so user testing is
something that you try to make as
lightweight as possible and it continues
as possible joint portion of our
projects and the reason is is that if
you can dedicate you know your Friday
beer time to bring him in five users to
test out your application you're going
to get such a great feedback on what it
is that you're producing to inform what
you're doing then this week one thing to
note is that plan this out so figure out
sort of what is the narrative that you
want to use to test about the hypothesis
that you've been working on that movie
there's definitely a little bit of a
trick to this it's good to do a little
bit of research into what sort of the
pitfalls all of you are of user testing
and how to set up a pigeon through tests
but try to keep it as lightweight as
possible otherwise it will be too much
of a headache for the team's really get
mom doing
so for us we um we actually wanted to
create sort of a physical space because
we wanted to test how students were
interacting with shelf tags in a virtual
bookstore so we actually used the book
bear offices and we would bring in users
a testicle 85 on Friday and we did it in
the offices so the developers were kind
of like hanging around they were able of
witness users without making them feel
sort of awkward and we would put up
these kind of you know fake bookshelves
and we would allow them use their flip
them so whatever is they brought you
know bring them in and say here's like a
38 $50 starbucks gift certificate or
amazon gift certificate and they
actually had a lot of fun with it and so
we got to watch exactly how they were
interacting with the tags how they were
interacting with the program what the
user flows were like where they were
getting stuff and we were just sort of
listen to them and let them run to the
narrative and we would be taking us the
other thing that ended up happening on
the nibbly project was it's actually
incredibly easy to get five students
there on a friday it is incredibly hard
to get kind of marketing departments in
to 10 on your application on Friday much
less them so what we ended up doing is
get as many as you can if you dislike as
you can as quick as you can but if you
do get someone of that caliber into your
office you want to make use of that time
as best as you can so with the nibbly
project because the data visualization
and we were doing had so much animation
and interactivity to it we wanted to
ensure that we were able to test with
this person as much as we could it not
what's good so we would run our
hypothesis at first and they were able
to see the visual language of deep
interface that we have created in code
and then we would abstract that out onto
a whiteboard mostly we did this because
it ended of you were the key to get
people just sort of immediately
understand all of the data that was
backing this
ace and we wanted to sort of rep on that
to ensure that they were gaining
understanding very quickly so we would
throw up sort of the icons the domain
language that we've used in this
interface and we would put it up on a
whiteboard he would start to draw lines
and we basically create a second to test
for them right then and there it's
almost like a paper prototype but fueled
by their understanding of what those
interactions were like and we could get
two or three more tests out of them so
that we could really steer develop in
the next week without having to create a
bunch of code to do that second test so
this saved us literally like two or
three weeks of Federation time because
we were able to have them are Kurdistan
and actually go through a secondary
scenario the other thing just want to
deridder make sure you're capturing
agrees with feedbacks somewhere
particularly if all of the team ropers
can't be there so we do filme them
although I have to say it's hard to get
people to watch video after user tests
so if you can get the development team
maybe not everybody at once but stagger
them so that at some point in the
process there's an ability with these
developers to get to see the code that
they're writing any spiders user it's
incredibly powerful the other thing is
that all of this actually takes a lot of
discipline and you are absolutely going
to get pushback immediately from
everyone the designers developers
everyone is kind of sort of complain
about this if you can get them to buy in
for the first couple weeks you start to
really get this rhythm of working with
one another and people will see the
value that they will see the value of
putting stuff in front of the users
they'll see the value in talking with
the design team you know ideally in my
world at some point in time we will see
the value including some of the sales
and marketing team in this to facilitate
that and all of this is sort of my
belief is that we have conflict with one
another but out of that conflict if
they're sort of a process that surrounds
it to gather what can the innovation
that can come out of that that is how
we're gonna find sore the next aha
moments in product and technology in the
future so these are really the
foundations of carbon 5 and how we work
on and we found it to be really useful I
mean effectively you're all surrounded
by a talent so let those voices be heard
and then have a structure behind them
and we use you know design thinking we'd
start up and ask
we kind of use we pulled from all of
those different process is to really
create this it will structure our teams
that it we can move forward and create
products that are better the other thing
is given a culture where everyone is
accepted and all of those horses are
allowed to be heard it empowers everyone
and it creates a lot of empathy with the
team and then finally short and
iterative is going to allow for people
to see their ideas vetted and allow them
to continue be interested in their work
they're not sort of like seeing drag
happen so as much as you can keep that
cadence moving and anchor it with the
Monday and Fridays that's really the
sort of core what we do on the fee basis
so that's all I got I definitely wanted
to leave some time for questions and
feel free to come up I've got some
information about artifacts or stickers
he wants these stickers not but if you
have any questions let me go when we
stripped all of our sensor went weeks
out and that we have you know snow
really long time since we've had two
weeks friends we like to try to keep
things as quick as possible accusation
to be really fast I would absolutely say
that this record three weeks prints
you're just pointing it out the one
thing that does happen a lot of the time
is that you'll skip the user test on a
Friday which is something that
inevitably it happens I'm just gonna go
line up the teens have to come in to do
the testing and that's when you sort of
lengthen it out to two weeks I will say
it is a little bit chocolate when I
happens that way people seem to really
enjoy that week as well do you uh Syria
large creature development or do do
concurrent there is given it's all
concurrent everyone so you know teams
can get its biggest like 12 you can have
multiple futures being developed to be
its get flow for people to know your
pizza so you have your branches that are
attached to your storage and each
individual team of developers is working
on
visual branches and so you can do
encourage it we used to itachi and the
one thing i will say about points are
that any story that's an 8-point
automatically you need skipper
every-down the five-point stories i will
say that there are weeks where you have
a basic really technically heavy stories
because you need some technical risk in
the project those are the weeks where we
do see sort of value in skipping a user
test because what we're trying to do is
really you know pay down that technical
risk what generally the stories are we
can be optimized for somewhere between
you know around like below the five
points that always happens and it's
totally fine the hypothesis proving fail
is twofold one it's kind of interesting
because I think a lot of product owners
are very sort of wedded to their ideas
that's actually fine but when they can
sort of see you know the development
team doing exactly what they want to do
and you know where they see value for
the product but then they put it in
front of their customers they brought in
their the exact sort of market target
that they wanted and they see that
that's actually not valid it's an
incredibly powerful experience for them
and it allows them to sort of like step
away from this you know they're sort of
hold on what they feel like was the high
value might try something else so you
know having sort of that hypothesis
being refuted is actually fine and what
ends up happening is the course of time
that you're what you're seeing happen is
that they're getting closer and closer
to really find the same if their users
value and that's a capable team sort of
moving in lockstep with one another
because everyone jerseys oh the thing
that we're doing people like that
actually and we're doing more of that 10
driven too much your dental patient
that's a good question so this does
change what ends up happening the bigger
the team and because we were good
clients what ends up happening is that
there's usually a design lead on the
client side and
finally on our side we have sort of seen
success I kind of said before that we
don't have managers and we actually
found but what we do have is sort of
this person that is like a product owner
so a really big client issuance
particularly with different companies
like honor desk or you know Skype or
whatever we're seeing sort of the need
of someone that can kind of streamline
the process across the two teams even if
the teens are co-located so that is sort
of a scenario where we're having more
designers four dollars yeah actually
that's a good point um so we do
test-driven development we have unit
tests integration tests you know we do
full stack of tests so when we're every
time we deliver a feature it goes
through you know our continuous
integration server it gets it runs the
suite of tests before even gets deployed
to staging that is automated and we're
very sort of that's one thing that was
pretty dark mad about is that we want to
have robust tests in our software the
secondary test is really more of its a
product test and it's the user test so
this is more where you're saying you
know there's the code that we wrote and
there's tests against that to ensure
that it's written order that it's clean
it's doing what it's supposed to be
doing but there's this secondary test of
is our product really doing what the
business should be doing is it doing
what users want it to do and that's sort
of the user test and there you know
there's a whole sort of entire talk
around user testing but if you can put
something in front of the type of person
that you have identified as being a
target audience of your product and get
feedback from them and make sure you're
not influencing that feedback you really
are testing whether or not that product
has got lives and those features that
you're creating a really valuable is
purpose of that product
for the automated testing we do
test-driven development so you literally
write a test you watch it fail and then
you implement it and you watching we so
we have not done a ton of we've
partnered with QA firms that will come
in sort of at milestones during the
course of the project and do QA testing
what ended up happening on sort of this
weekly basis is because you do automated
test that fixes a lot of bugs
automatically you also sort of forced
the that notion of acceptance that I was
talking about so you have somebody that
it's doing and critical acceptance of
story meaning that they're welcome
through their doing integration and
trying to find hedge cases that's
acceptance that also sort of make sure
that there's a pass on bugs and then
when the user to sit that's also an
opportunity we generally do sort of like
we run through the narrative that we're
going to give to the users before we
actually give it to them so if we find
those on that point we're fixing them
before they come in but then we have the
opportunity for them so when you're
doing that every single be your sort of
constantly fixing bugs as you go through
the process and then if there's going to
be a huge public release king of backed
by a bunch of marketing and that's why
I'm often times clients will request to
have if you a team the Qi team in that
scenario what we end up giving them are
there is when we give to the journeys or
tests but we also actually can suck to
print out all of our an aversion tests
and give that to them that's really
descriptive sort of ya doing lose that
momentum unfold in situations where I
require us to use our agency is if so
how to change a relationship like this
sorry how's a change yep it changes if
you're lacking how well absolutely been
so we we have always traditionally
partnered with design firms we got to
work like we still do all the time
remember the I do we sort of lots to do
we've got some really awesome design
firms and they everyone sort of has the
same objective they want to see
things a design get built and they want
it they want to see it get built instead
of their vision so what ends up
happening is that what they've designed
when you start to implement that and
make it for changes need to happen so
what we have requested at this point
from people that we partner with them to
sign firms is that early on the net
process we have weekly check-ins with
our dev team so that they can kind of
present what they're designing and our
dev team has an opportunity to say you
know you actually can't do this or did
you think about these edge cases for
this forum or whatever it is so that's
sort of one way to tackle that and then
we requested they have a design resource
that they want us at sort of like you
know part time through duration of the
development cycle and then we bring them
in for that like monday and friday so
they're not there the whole week they're
available real time that week so usually
you have like you know an IRC chat
scenario with them but we sort of
require that the Monday and Friday there
and that it's tricky I mean I will
absolutely say that like that's the
perfect world and that's not always the
case often times you're like wrangling
people and trying to get sore feet back
from them but it is you know when we
step off into the project that's where
the requirement that we set out I have a
question well I think I finished up
early you guys have fun could you talk
about the estimation yes but how many
minds
so what we don't necessarily prioritize
four points we prioritize four features
so what we're trying to do is once again
from the clients point of view what they
want is sort of you know as much as they
can get in friday right and what we do
is we try to guide them to say well you
can go really deep into something and
test that or we can take a broad strokes
so if you're like the smallest things we
can do to sort of get through this
entire flow so it's sort of an education
process of trying to figure out what are
the things that you can do in a week
that are going to be useful and then are
going to maximize not necessarily the
points you know because you can have
like a five-pointer that produces no
value in the product we're trying to
optimize for the most value that we can
produce or the product at the end of the
week and so a lot of that time is like
you can imagine maybe we need to do a
deep slide into a technical risk and
that's the five pointer and so we
minimize the amount of sort of user
testing or the user facing features that
we're doing that week or we know that we
want to have actual prop you know
user-facing features and we're trying to
figure out what is like the minimal
amount that we needs you on a dev side
and design side to put something in
front that user to see if they're even
interested in this kind of set of
features for this product is any sense
yeah points are a little bit tricky
because I think a lot of people think of
them as time and they do over the course
of a project actually sort of mapped to
time but we're looking at the more in
relevance to one another like this story
is really heavy we can break it down
into these little stories and get two of
them done versus doing do they want so
you do you benefit any kind of dwelling
the I mean its velocity right and
velocity is effectively like we have a
team strength of six so there's six
developers we have velocity of like 26
so we know given the stories that we
have in the backlog right now this is
how much that we're going to get done
before the state so we definitely can do
that and ebb as the project progresses
you get more and more sort of accurate
in that estimate because you've done
more features you sort of accepted them
and seemed sort of how the velocity runs
naturally so that's sort of how we can
estimate against time I would absolutely
say that when you're ready to do a big
release that there does start to be a
focus at those and weeks towards
ensuring that you know bugs are fixed
big things that have come up that you're
you're making sure you're focusing on
this yeah and I don't know if we've ever
reserved a week usually there's some
features they can push to math last week
we was funny because we used to sort of
really try to pressure the client to not
have that Weekly just about feature or
to not have any features in that last
week but it sort of it actually ended up
being it because of this process we
didn't have a kind of bugs to fix at the
end so unless you know so the big comes
up at the end in which case we would
define a week usually there's future
development being done I'm pausing here
because there are weeks in which
particularly with clients that are
coming in existing their faces we find a
part of that code base that means we're
factoring or these tests to fill it out
we absolutely will have weeks where
there is a designer's manager testing we
are literally refactoring code well
thank you all so much we've got
something out of that and give any
visual much influence eat and come grab
a Snickers
