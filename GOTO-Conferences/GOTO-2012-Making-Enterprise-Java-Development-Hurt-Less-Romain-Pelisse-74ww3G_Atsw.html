my fedora but for traveling days on a
date Lily let lift it at home so I'm
going to wear that instead instead let's
move forward well that's me obviously
just for the story this picture was
taken in the DTM Museum in Berlin so I'm
actually listening to some ddr music
rock enormously from a scientist and
this very puzzled expression anyway so
I'm mostly supposed to be a meteor web
based on earth with that I've been
working there for a little bit more than
a year now watchu just a year but I've
been in the reddit G basico stem for
much longer time I was an open source
architect at gene as a partner for that
for a long time I knew many people at
jeebus before the bus was bottled by
that and then I stopped doing people
from both sides I'm actually one of the
people inside that to be in the middle
i'm also a jeebus guy i know stuff from
java and i'm also read that certified
linux admin system robust stuffy as I as
ryan told this very good way for me to
piss both side because I can always
complain about the other side of the
side I'm talking with anyway I've been
waiting in the community for into open
chest cavity for a long time so I've
been committing patch on fixes to PMD
and I kind of became the project leader
a year ago basically the historical
particular left on I was like so no one
left so I just like okay no one's busted
by the way if you like PMD know that
we've released a new version like two
months ago I think which is allowing you
to analyze javascript code sauce with
PMD unlike a ver also a transcript
anyway I also worked on mackerel which
is a dvc a system like get and walk for
the community meaning and well I'm also
a teacher activated sharat because I
teach in two different schools and I
write a lot of stuff I have wrote on
something like a return something like
15 articles in a GUI
in France and well basically I don't
sleep enough well that's why also i'ma
go saturday anyway let's move forward so
while this talk is I think old making
gte or less something like that the idea
is that did we use to be painful on
maybe today it's less painful so before
we actually go into that let's talk
about what g2g is because there is I'm
for my perception a lot of misconception
about what g2e he is on what should be
doing so at that by that which should be
actually funny because this is this guy
is wondrin son probably one of the guy
who hate due to either most on the whole
planet because he built not only a
framework but a company designed to do
something other than what we was doing
which is spring but this is thanks to
general Denson that i actually
understood retweet so for a long time
more like 5'4 or 50 i was like GT was
like this bizarre complex specification
on people were doing GG stuff and like
what does it mean why do people do that
and then i read i think a blog entry for
this guy which makes things clear so
just out of the question who here has
already be involved with one or several
GT project show event okay so some tests
in those project how many time did you
actually add distributed system meaning
a gb local invoking energy be remote
flow of n that's perfect so basically
alf of it which is actually good good
thing because when Rogerson did the same
quiz maybe like 10 years ago everybody
was doing GBS hola everybody was again
Reggie to Italy and like two people were
like yeah we do distributed programming
that was the whole point of the edge
versification the idea was to be able to
have a distributed system so if you
actually do EG be without distribution
application you just run in for a while
anyway let's take a look
about what is that between a very big
line and big birches well basically de
chuy is a standard which means that it
has been it's it has been designed by a
committee from the GP it's actually
encompassing a lot of also specification
so there is one specification country
embraced ification which is encompassing
a set of other her specification it's
just a speck what I wrote or whether
it's performances various upon van der
it's just a speck you can say g3 is blue
you can say i use my GG application on
this web server on slope but to specific
itself is a specification it's an API
well it's actually two more than 10
years older now so it's not really that
new thing that the cool cool kids want
to do it's been there for a long time
and it has went through quite a lot of
change in the last two iteration what's
important here is that there was a big
adaption success when it was very
adaptable a KGB are so cool it's so
perfect so we're just run into that on
many many people were very and IP at the
end of the day so we're very happy like
adopting this thing on going forward
bejeebies on with thuy anh very ni PHCN
mostly because there every is if i think
that most people find the egb program
model to be like nice where structure on
stuff like that but quite cumbersome to
use and uncover some are not clean in
term of rack I in like when we're using
it be to you were supposed to any rate
like abstract stuff on you boo cod we're
very was very very quickly contaminated
by the heb of things Venus of this thing
on people add a lot of herbs in the
controller may approach especially when
come in terms of persistence like yeah I
can configure my persistence so I will
basically declare this bin and my my web
server is going to manage to save it by
himself well that's under being very
painful why it was first to complex if
you just look at the age of you to
specification
I let a fixed amount of stuff remote
lock or Baba it was too complex say well
I was way too many XML descriptor way
too many and that was also very I paint
pots there was no way to test this
outside the container so you were
cutting your stuff and pushing a GP and
observer on trying to figure out what
was going wrong maybe we were able to
have like some kind of remote debugging
system but you could not run any tests
on it so you could never have proper
regression tests on your AG be so that's
what people mostly co-pending about I
guess if you actually do some googling
you will find even big your list but
that's what we'll be focused for now ok
so as I said why do we need did we why
maybe first you don't that's true for
any kind of technologies before starting
using it try to know if you actually
need it I have seen in too many project
being killed by just technical trolls I
remember like we had this project
internet like two or three years ago and
only five years of five years ago it was
reporting project and the guy was like
yeah everything is in the end I want to
like start walking again on it and i
want to i will switch to mavin in never
managed to switch from evans so
basically mavin key this project you
could have skipped his end build and
actually do some curd and release some
stuff but he spent like two weeks
fighting this man on that basically key
to the project this was an open spot
jack doing on spare time so it wasn't
like after like two weeks of
around with my van you like I just
want to stop and do something apps so
before picking did we wonder if you did
so why do we need we do is about as I
said distributed programming you want to
be able to have one box running part of
the card invoking your remote box
running another part of the car so
what's actually unfold beyond that is a
collection you want to be able to run
track star system on if let's say part 1
gold part 1 part 2 got battery and
battery fail you want to be able to roll
back and restore proper state in part
two on with a puzzle in part one that's
what we lack in gb
well in to eat reduction while also
securities there is a bunch of stuff
about security so you can even define
with the GPU can even define which
method can be called white which user on
this kind of things you can also pass or
one security token and stuff like that
and of course a synchronous messaging
the infamous mobb middleware or the
messaging so you can send messages to
through a domestic to another part of
the application and also get in consumer
message you can passivate massage you
can store them you can proxy them
distribute them using GM SQ blah blah
blah blah out of the forget those are by
a sense complex to deal with for the
story I as part of my teacher molested
shyness school in France I did the topic
like 20 years ago which consisted of
four students to write a small GMS stack
a very small domestic and just that when
you actually start thinking okay how was
I going to do that I also going to
implement these and house again you
realize this is actually very complex
all of those considerations are complex
and g3 his ear to help you trying to
under them in a way that's that they are
first abstracted from the vendor on kind
of efficient or making sense but still
it's complex its complex why because
there is all the exception on link again
if you have like tweety tweety a
software thingy and something fell
somewhere out on the description do you
like throwing some back to the color how
this gave internal dad do you do you
roll back or not and how will you all
back if you have a large system which is
like booking hotel and flight and I'm
stuff and it's AV somting thing at some
point you need to roll back and consider
it a reservation or not to this kind of
thing so it's actually quite complex you
also need to manage message queues
missed because if you start sending
messages and have a signal score well
those cues can like Philip for very
quickly so you need to be able to store
the messages were able to offload them
you to be sure that the other guys going
to costumes em blah blah blah so that's
also very complex top
so basically at this point you could say
okay I don't need this 23 basically can
I go now well hopefully you may still
want to use it with other reason one
will be the standout I mean European
edge to application without using all
this thing still do bring a standard
application you got more stuff than just
using the side container and you got to
start out way to do it and there is no
way to know if in three years reddit or
spring is going to be here but
definitely the shoes tbogt pianist it
should should be some kind of GT
provider I was there because it's not as
you see right now it's funny because I
belief in earth but rod Johnson as left
spring which is probably causing for
some customers I'm concerned because
Vadra 'then was the guy leading spring
for the last ten years so maybe there is
no more no no go vision or stuff like
that actually it's completely false
praying is going to walk as a same
without him but this is the kind of
consideration you're into when you don't
have lots of all let's say support
office toddler behind you even if raided
go Capri today that we still other
people working on GT yes that has been
very much involved into the gcp walk on
we are behind a lot of specification and
change into g3 but we not the only one
pin yahoo the other thing you may want
to have and keep is a programming model
as I told you one of the scene people
loved in the first three gb is indeed we
was the programming model it was kind of
ugly battle axe a idea of having excess
lesbian and said for being and being
able to have like remote in a row blah
blah all this kind of goodies coming
with specification was nice and they
like that and that's actually sir I'm
like on during this fact because this is
going to be what variant a badger point
of what I meant to say next okay anyway
so we are all right we are right now
ig2g six and those already GTA 5 and GTA
5 already bring a box a lot of
certification so there was a lot of
reduce of XML use by interesting
addition so what you use to be declaring
in some kind of xml descriptor in a very
ugly way now you can just a note it so
used to declare this class is ng Bieber
Bieber no no I always added at setlist
as a full blah blah we replaced both
what it since you can still use the old
way to manage my systems which is called
cmp but you haven't you had a new way
called GPA which is provided way now I
call this and an I Bennett inspire
inspired API so it was strongly inspired
by the success of a bayonet and it's but
yeah so GPA is basically an study
session of the orem to hibernate we also
introduced EDI while people onto a CD I
into deeper into the specification
bringing the parents injection which was
the purpose playing on so on and so on
so there was if you look at will state
of duty before 235 there was already a
quite a lot of big big change in 235 and
yep so it's already quite simplified but
we're going to see that g2g 36 also
bring value going even faster than that
into suffocation so okay i'm speaking to
quickly I'm somehow you can get me yeah
nobody is screaming to Dell okay let's
see what's watch 26 bring here well
first of all let's look at the overall
2g so funnily enough one of the main
driver of of the change we've been
interesting into it for the last two
years is going from the Ruby community
because Ruby community has add this very
successful framework kohlrabi annoys
which has some kind of groovy
declination call grades and the very
well this is the strength of this firm
awkward to say we are going to configure
too many stuff because basically we're
going to have like very 10 default so by
a by default if you put stuff in the
data folder it's going to be to go to
the damages by default if you put this
in this other folder is going to go
there and this kind of I would say
structural framework has really helped
people writing quickly an efficient code
from Ruby our ads without having to ask
them to do munication enough to google i
would like for three hours to find out
which proper descriptor i need to deploy
that as part of this thing so this was
already part of you to e5 which is still
again going over there saying like okay
if we if if there is a sin default let's
use that and if you change if you go
beyond that configure by by default you
of a sudden default and just just add
extra configuration only if you're
required to let's hide here so we
basically swap XML to annotation so
before that we we add like a lot of XML
script or now we got a lot of pojos
which are which are unloaded which is a
good thing because one first allocation
you can write using cocoa space in
eclipse in uvd so you already got like
some kind of type safety that you add
that you have not you add that with XML
I know there was like plugin on tool to
generate the descriptor and I know
there's also a be some kind of ed to
dhruv Philip accepted to help descriptor
but i think that the code is still far
more easier and also in term of testing
its you can basically wrote simple
patrols on alerted them so do too if s6
is going further in this direction so
there is even more part of the
technology which have been notified if
one can say that and yeah one of the
main goal or so of gt5 was to apply it
so kind of change the applied in the egb
layer having those odd setlist as set
full they wanted to basically bring it
to the bring it to the web layer so i've
also just kind of approach where we just
met and stuff and like remove xml or
four
that's why ng to e6 the web dot XML file
is actually optional you have annotation
to replace it same thing with faces
config in the GSF world can remove the
faces config and I've like a day instead
of it ok so I'm going to do like some
kind of overview of the main feature of
this due to e6 permutation which I will
try to discuss regarding how it's
beginning to make your life as the color
easier so the one first big major
feature of g36 is obviously web profile
so one of the complaint people hide with
de twist web server is that was a what
kind of monolithic on huge if you want
if you grab a web server which is
jittery for compliant and started it's
going to take a long time i see that
jeebus was starting in like she was for
starting something around one or two
minutes and i think that i don't i don't
know anything about web blue on the
other property software but i think
somebody told me the exact those can
start in like 40 minutes or 15 minutes
it's kind of crazy timing and that was
mostly do because about like to be able
to be a GT we complain servers it to
start a lot of stuff in to have a gym a
stag you need to have like databases
Jenny tree wha bah blah so what they did
is like okay most people are not using
all of the we put in between most
people are just doing web application so
let's have a subset of the of the
specification which is going to be
simply or undressed contain what people
mostly use on let's call this the web
profile so there is still a very full
profile for like if I want everything in
g2e I can take the football file and I
got every specification and every stuff
I want to have but you can pick up the
web profile which is generally matching
what people need like 66 m / 10 and have
a lighter lightweight arraignment to
running
just a side note I see that maybe in the
next release of the tree we might we
probably going to see also profiles up
here probably one for messaging it would
be nice to have a profile just dedicated
to have a gym a screening and maybe have
the same default may be designed to be
wiser performance anyway so that was one
of the main feature and going to help a
lot of things we could people people
were before using like just Tomcat
saying okay just dumb cat can basically
switch using web / file another focus of
this specification as always was to
increase portability out well we've been
swapping application from jables to web
low from web low to express fish for
like a long time now people have been
doing that for the last five or six
years of we've gathered some kind of
experiences and basically it's quite
easy to do one of the issue which I run
into is like what specify specific to
the application server of course like
XML five but also some gendai name which
has kind of gender einem differs in all
web servers in all application servers
so the idea here was to standardize and
I name so that we can even increase
portability in this error okay let's
talk quickly about HP light we're going
to see that litter in more detail agb
light is actually the main focus of this
all torque because that's what people
have been trying to do by making gtv6
while accurately easier to use for what
people use it it's basically removing
the remote part of it so just with a
part of it and keep it keeps a group
self this basic this HP light feature is
basically allowing you to use all the
specifics all the power of the egb as
you want to use within a web app you'll
lose stuff going to have to be able web
services you can't have remote Cole you
can't have a second dose Cole but that's
stuff you already use but you can have
all the good deal also other goodies of
heb inside of our into the web app I
forgot to ask is
every ear like a Java developer or is
the report coming from the other
universe okay if if I'm talking about
stuff you don't know if you stop me I'm
probably assuming a bit that people are
Java experience but yeah if you are like
is there is some kind of acronym I use
that you don't really get to stop me
okay we also we also added some new
feature to the egb when I say we I don't
say myself I just say we read that as
part of the GTP we all saw that ad
features such as integral score which is
a very nice feature I'm going to demo so
tater and also some stuff about plant
ask so I like being able to diff to
define like some kind of crontab task
inside the application server I find
that very crappy because being a linux
Gaia I just find that far more easier to
just use crontab but yeah well I'm very
still people out there actually running
on windows which is always amazing me
and this guy can't rely on the upright
system to do that God's you can even
already need to start early anyway but
also changing to the GSF and the rest
and driven GPA part of it so GSF which
is a very cumbersome web framework I
will talk about that later has also been
quite simplified on unmetric easy and we
remove its image descriptor and we add
fast that instead of GSP what makes the
data rests we added West because like
you know rest is luck was the cool kids
are doing nowadays well that's so true
that it's actually difficult to find a
soap web services available online now
i'm trying i try to do that like four
months ago I wanted to do to have my
students play with her access free
public accessible web services using
soap but I felt I fail to find one end
up using the West other services from
google well no actually we fortunately
my school is running his own web
services so i use that but that's
actually difficult to find anyway so we
won rest is simple but you know we are
tougher guys so we don't like simple
stuff so we did we did a specification
which is called jacks
and i'm pretty sure it's impossible to
read and i'm pretty sure it's complex
but that's how we do things but
fortunately the API provide is rather
simple so GPA we updated to version to
the zero of GPA and that's also going to
be quite useful in term of while
simplification our parting less one last
thing that I'm not going to dwell too
much into this but remember that GT v6
is tied to java 6 and Jaya six is coming
with a lot of cool videos there is an
iOS every script easy with script
disease like this both water I used to
describe the fact that eight-six is very
well was designed to run script on top
of it so basically you have a lot of
it's easy to run script like Ravi and
stuff like that and like those all those
guy from the groovy JRuby GTO wall are
very happy with this release for that
for complex prison that I will not dwell
in too because I could address country
okay and there is also a lot of cool
ninja tk6 while bah bah bah if you end
up in your job being like having to push
forward to use the 36 maybe you should
google up a good list of the news of the
other DJ k 6 because I might be a couple
of thing here that's going to help you
push this over okay a few more words
about profitability well I already
mentioned that we've been doing those
kind of medication for a long time so we
all know well the first thing I want to
mention actually is that yes g2
application are portable I know it's a
bit painful to grab a while it was
running in weblogic and miquelon jeebus
but I mean that's generally and 55
half-day walks at was maybe you wanna
p21 of to issue they're going to fix
been baking gas pass but it's going to
walk just try for the front of it try to
grab open it the AP and recompile it on
your windows I mean that's that's way
more difficult we turned in being stuck
in the driver war people from the
Waltons forget about that possibility in
Java is a reality
so yeah it's there and those five days
of migration are still being difficult
because of some details one of you tell
beings agenda items so that's why we
sterilize Emma I actually don't like
that because the bad thing about
distillation is that every web app
server how's the obvious way to declare
names which are still can of a valid
there is a new way coming from a
solution which is also kind of walking
and between the new way on the old way
you end up having like two or three or
five different valley name if you start
jeebus s7 and push a gb into it is going
to publish six different gender names
and can access this beam by those all
those different chennai names those them
are going to work if your remote if you
recall if you call this way so we end up
right now in a state weather is probably
you will be led to believe that there is
like five way to do it or six way to do
it but in your case I will be only one
and that's kind of confusing on the long
run this is useful I mean in two or
three years everybody is going to use
the default GI named as I've been
standardized to call that Association go
to help load migration but right now I
find that very chaotic I had a very bad
against meant where part of the issue
was discomfiture on running on how do i
invoke my EGP how do i find into three
because basically or the name you gave
me to not work on especially in the gbus
universe this is also going along with a
 we have many technologies to
communicate with an e gb and there is
the old way to do it jeebus reemerging
way there is no way to do it so you have
like way to invoke like to watch way to
invoke four or five genuine aims by the
time you've tried all the possible
combination your boss is very pissed off
at you anyway that's stats right now but
that's still a good singer now rather
than the role i will just love that to
happen a bit to have to appear next year
other than today
we also know we are all to test a GPS or
this HP light outside the container
which also increase a lot portability
because you can fix a lot of stuff
locally with test unit tests and end up
having less thing to test on check on
the on the actual container okay moving
forward I'm sorry it's a bit dry but
that's yeah that's a chewy it's at
phantom I'm tried I tried to me to make
it fun but yeah i like i like the amount
of coffee to do that properly anyway why
such as such although a typo here so
yeah shipping it so rock star of the
specification it's actually funny
because forming italy is a rock star
thing but it's not really i don't know i
don't think that if you before you enter
in this room if you were thinking g36
where you actually think about a bit
early light which is the scene as was
going to stuck your mind neck yes that's
a cool feature of it i don't think so i
think this kind of went unnoticed anyway
so again the idea was to leverage the
fact that people who are very happy with
the programming model of heb there were
some good stuff in it and try to give
them what they need so the part they
like in 20 gb specification on remove
the passcode needle so what do you got
you got the bin life cycle so you got
you got Singleton's by the wasting
button is actually a new life cycle life
of my own row when you live stats from
Sandow g36 specification you go to shun
beans test to assess lesbian stuff like
that you got interceptor which is very
nice because now it's not a way to use
AUP I don't know how many people I've
already used aop or no yo p okay so just
to expand but we don't know your pc
school aspect object programming which
is basically a way to a cure self into
your own core so classical example you
want to log some stuff when you go
inside the matter and you want to log
some you go outside the matter if you
put the logging inside the card of the
metal you're polluting your biz
spittle with lock code which is ugly so
what we want to do is have another cut
somewhere writing looking and say okay
before you call this guy Weaver on my
card doing the logging here that's what
LP deuce does so of course for logging
it's a very good example but you can
also implement cash with aop that's a
fair way in a good way to do it you just
like add coming out of the method which
is just going to read about the bases
you just grab the stuff put it in local
cache put it in memcache don't put it in
your ideas I don't like with this it's
kind of buggy but whatever you could put
that in some graph cash or if it is fun
we also have in span and this is
completely eaten away from the actual
implementation nice and now you well you
used to have several way to do this I
was aspect vets so was i SPECT gee
Minnie stuff or going around i think a
string as his own way of doing a UPS or
spring aop and jeebus also add a lot of
aps that's into the bus for because aop
was basically part of the internal
mechanism of Java's and yep so now we
have a stole our way to do it with a pop
RPI and have to wonder on how its
opening because it's happening according
to specification that's nice to have so
one that's not the most honorable
feature what people really wanted our
Papa support photos action that's coming
with a debit and security that's to feed
you that people are going away going to
be happy to have into gb gb date so
that's what you get on what you don't
get is message read the vibe in out no
GMS tag out all the web services rest
remote gulp waste your crap ness also
out I mean it's cool you may want to use
it but it's out of it will it features
which allow you to have a very
lightweight each between light compliant
little bit will lead compliant container
okay one of the cool thing with this
issue between it is the fact that it's
embeddable actually not with embeddable
is a real award because i can find the
proper
spinning for it but it's unbeatable you
can embed edge between it inside some
kind of container and you can just run
it as part of unit tests so you don't
need to have an actual container running
so JD three bubble a good to know good
so yeah that's just how I ought of all
start about that well basically you can
run it outside the container that's a
one-for-one fries yeah you can logo you
can do some kind of logo local debugger
and yet nice side of that also is that
because you can embed the container you
can well test during integration tests
you can test each village eek so if
you're relying on the heb to do some
part kind of injection or taking care of
life cycle which is what you want to do
it's kind of nice to know that you can
run that how it says the catenary is
going to be test doing integration tests
or even unit tests because I mean if you
use a gb you're going part offshore well
tactical applicant ethical business
logic is going to be part of it should
be so it's kind of nice weblog tested ok
moving forward yeah ok you get the
ballot in a war which is also cool
because yeah basically that's actually
not really good important feature you
could deploy gb in two years but people
have been so scared of using g2e people
so ate all the stuff that came with air
I sing on the marketing level being able
to deploy eyes on the war is kind of
nice also you can even if if your
company was having some kind of crazy
architect who forbid you to use EA or
three years ago while you can't use a gb
with war so ok look Wow ok that's
basically it so yeah agb light is
diverging success of of the adaption of
gb without removing all the programming
distributable I mean crap test that was
getting in a way ok still have time ok
GPA so I won't talk a lot about GPA I
will just say again that sk sk
possibility is now reality I mean
I used to work with some people were
like there is no point you into using a
bayonet because you can't move your coat
from one application to another with a
bayonet because nobody's shown today
will change the veggies and blah blah
blah well that's actually force and very
for Speed many people are able to use
GPA correctly and having like several
data sources like software and reliable
to support like the software into
several different data sources which I
would visit with GPA on I bayonets and
so that's ready that's what is there now
so and I really think it's a good call
to always be portable on this and
disregard okay let's move forward with
that what bring GPA to the 20 to the
what does it bring for you in terms of
simplicity or in term of help while I'm
not fully and the carnival rate of stuff
mostly the square pi which is nicer but
it is also by joseph about cash on there
is some addition in term of floating
stage it so now you can overlooking a
pessimistic looking approach when you're
doing so action on so that's not very
useful for you as a developer but it's
kind of mac GP operation already because
now you can actually under what I will
call real critical operation
consideration swoozie app use the API of
this study you can switch locking
mechanism you can you can have cash all
of that in a subtle way it's not like
the coolest feature ever but its sale
okay GSF that's I was a lot of kin a lot
of cleanup into this thing sadly I'm not
really another great guy I mean however
this is my email client okay so i'm not
really the best guide talk about that
but i will try anyway the good thing for
you is I actually did as a first gig in
my preferred carrier I did a very not
complex which is more GSF application at
the time Joseph was belly out and so
yeah I have some another GF but and not
to you I guy definitely anyway so
one of the good thing of GSF is that it
has again strong playing model if you
have never looked at this diagram
explaining how jsf process and request
take a look at it it's quite interesting
it's quite like it's like a good way to
understand as anything coming in GTE
wall it's a bit of a synced overstocked
it's a bit over design but yeah still
good yeah I just day but just have those
for you is on the life cycle like if you
want to start some information it's
going to take care of that this object
store information is going to be in the
session only basically taking care of
the objects still going to be there when
you came back with the next request and
it's also going to do it off validation
and it's offering you well the OL idea
of GSF fools too well to make it funny
basically give the power to swing the
rapper to right web application so I've
a set of you I'll component you can
reuse black table that that that are the
data array of while uicomponent on build
your web application as something those
UI component into xml page and having
that as a way to walk so were you
pushing forward the component model but
that's very bad for websites for my part
of you on from what I've sing like
Joseph is perfect if you having this
kind of project where you need to move
an old Native Client into the into an
intranet you had this all and if Karen
would be bored I like in putting out of
stuff while are you going to do a decent
job building GSF because you're going to
map this native UI with the component in
GSF when you're going to be able to do
some kind of thing that makes sense in
both wall but if you want to write a
website something that is somehow rest
well GSF every prove you're a scheming
dling it's basically hiding out of stuff
from you so you can't really use
properly you're going to be cut really
easily at this out of the box of rest
URL with GSF which is very bad because
when you go to poram your shim you can
do rest but on a security level you can
do it
thing with the rest proxy and that's
very bad also internet well you should
always try to have like clean meaningful
URL it's always good to have any way
it's very a flea session-based so
instant test test by default and
adjacent application I wanted to become
very memory angry so that's also a bad
thing because when you do websites you
want to be very very stateless and there
is a lot of the wall sort of server side
validation which was of course slow
while not slow but we had to wait for
the server to tell you that was
something wrong blah blah anyway we
clean this up a bit in this diversion so
we remove why allow the infamous faces
coughing XML which could be as big as
that one become quite complex has been
completely removed it's optional now you
should have it but you can get most of
your job done with visitation on some
default no more GSP Godhead GSP I mean
is there anybody here watching like GSP
ok I'm not going to runs about that but
yeah I just like for me Zack PHP in Java
I mean if you want to do JSP go go crazy
and do some cheese some PHP fortunately
I'm not new stove also i was going to
make you leave the room but i still ate
those i'm very happy to see GSP not go
away because you guys to use them but
there is actually a better way to use
them which is fast let's and first ex is
basically simple it's HTML pages
describing all the component with some
kind of macro language but a lightweight
macro language and that's way more
cleaner way to work at least for my part
of you yeah on the good thing is that
you got now on it HTML pages so your um
your designer is going to be happy with
that you can grab your XML pages and
play with it before you had to give you
the GS paper jeez I'm like yeah but but
this crap in the middle of it is that
really like HTML road use it those are
fully full plane xxxtreme web pages of
course the UIL going to Uppercross
appear correctly but you can add the
stuff she'll start and do whatever you
which is good I think and of course I
Jack support because now we need to be
at jacks you know I a jax is everywhere
and i want no you say it in Denmark in
French with the Ajax because it's like
actually this is a brand for a washing
machine the washing powder so it's got a
jets which led to a lot of bad jokes on
the French burgos Ferb out like I'm
going to wash my whole room with a
Jackson Baba anyway now it's there and
it's quite good to have I won't drive
into that because again and not know
jack expert but you haven't sold a way
to use as xvideo I still believe that
GSF is still too strongly tight with the
idea of writing application and
naturally website but that's another
issue it's better than it was before but
I'm pretty sure if you want to write
this big this I I load website you are
going to use some kind of lightweight
framework also than this one ok I'm
going to do a couple of dive into the
car not really Admiral fortunately or
unfortunately I don't want I don't know
is that so first example a second of
school I already like that because when
I looked at this part of it for the
torque over ok that's cool so suppose
you want to have some part of you cut
being done asynchronously typically you
got a guy or doing something and you
want you're going to process the order
but you want also to do some logging or
you want to send an email and you want
not to be stopped by that you just want
sirki send that take care of that in
another thread and I'm going to go
forward me bite my bosses it's stupidly
and freakishly easy to do in a degree 6
you have your bin which happen to be
steadfast you say okay my better send
order is at a synchronous and I have
this code this particular process order
and when I reach the point where I call
send order order the container is going
to return immediately saying okay I'm
going to grab that and it's going to I
synchronicity call this other guy in
another thread all of this for you and
the magical part is a following you can
use it as that this year it has to work
with just a jar in the independent we
just talked about dry in the right class
pass this unit test walk
actually no you don't need jobs because
it's a pojo if you look at that if you
look at the slide before it's a POJO so
you can test this in a synchronous
manner iving like address CO and debug
and stuff and when it's working we
deploy and magic land under plane man is
going to be a synchronous that's cool i
find it go anyway some kind of
demonstration on algae to e6 walk rest
you want to do a rest api why because
you want to be a cool kid that was a
quick lead are doing and you want to
impress this girl with this garlic /
ring in the office is no la quiero que
i'm doing and restful api so that's why
you want to do that well what else again
very easy the class is going to deliver
rests a rest api so i'd pass to indicate
which class is going to let this api and
then you just out that i'd get at post i
did eat at put that's all while I if you
want to specify which kind of output you
can add add produced okay so is this
nifty parameter go in at past paradigm
which is going to go into the pass on
ack the power on which to the param
value you want to achieve and put it in
the right singing and all you have to do
is that and that's that's pretty cool I
find it cool on auto you know not
impressed by that maybe you know about
that but yeah I'm still impressed by
that okay while I'm paid by reddit so I
think it's fair I talked a bit about
jeebus so yep we released as always we
release a new version of our web server
which is matching the specification so I
seven is a g36 compliance web
application server ok that's it supposed
to be fast it's actually very fast
except that's actually funny it's not
fast if you're running into an old
laptop with one car in those case if you
run this s7 in with one car it might be
stronger than before because this guy is
a flea every paralyzed everything is
touching in a parallel manner so yeah if
you don't have any possible eyelids
those parishioners going
be stacked which make no sense okay well
there's been a minute change in jeebus
seven but I'm listening to focus on what
kind of makes sense with you 36 so of
course we provide a web profile that was
the goal of it so we we all agree that
we need to have web profile for 30
episodes ever and we did it while there
is a wee supporters already since that
tree months we have a supported version
of jebus blah blah blah what must be was
focus here is that the old product we
square where we will project was
completely redesigned them again for the
third time in your story we rewrote
everything we write awaiting reward
whatever thing and I actually felt a
very good thing it's a it's a good thing
that we wrote project on a regular basis
because at some point you end up in
having knock there is no way to fix that
without fixing the architecture so we
will change everything and we make it
for far more light weights we remove the
old gem external and we make every part
of it lazy loader which me that's when
you are the upper we start jeebus you're
going to start all the crap you will
choose which start a mini Morrises you
get deployed your bar and then because
you're why is engageable eat according
service is going to be boot I'm not
going to have a huge memory footprint
because gee boss you're running locally
is just running what you actually code
we also simplify the lodge the
configuration we introduced this crazy
idea of being only one configuration
file file that people are like they're
crazy I mean do you know actual services
at one with only one configuration well
absolutely also it is on linux but
that's another issue so yep that's what
we do that's the fast things a lot
because you can basically deliver one
file to look at your dropper if you're
doing some kind of internal platform for
everybody just I've like these jeebus
one file up go there is also a CI tools
so you can actually change the file
using command line you can script
entirely the way you want to tune your
web server
but yeah so yeah one conference tried to
roll them all and yeah that's mostly
making this simple notification so
that's actually a bit of bummer because
yes if you live in school right now and
start using GPS 7 now I think you'll
find that easy you'll go with this HP
situation edge between three leads you
go with this Jenny I stutter name and it
would be easy for you think that story
stood there and people were kind of used
to jeebus four and five and six well
once it just like got the s7 in their
face like oh a basic change how I
do that how I do these affect my a gps
not working because i don't use a proper
name which tend to use so right now is a
bit of not a mess but it's a bit complex
right now way more than when we expect
more we would like to think that things
are going to clarify with the next feliz
because in the next phase we're going to
prune stuff you're going to remove when
g two is six to eight seven we're going
to remove deprecated technologies which
remains a stack a bit more thinner but
right now oh yeah i think it's very it's
quite was simple to use is seven but let
me maybe it for you maybe i'll show you
i don't know maybe there is people still
has a density here for you it's going to
be easier but for you luck all guys who
have been doing a KGB for like seven
years you might be a bit like wow it's
good to be a bit rough still it's was it
where he was it okay i'm going to try to
concrete because I'm on time actually so
yeah brah so yeah joey is a standard
proven night way technology now it's
it's there it's table is that sexy BTW
stable to us till tomorrow yeah okay
okay way to be quick about one thing as
anybody here ever use x 11 you know
experiment this thing to do like api and
stuff i happen to be one of the few guy
we're still dead in school like five
years ago and if you look at x 11 on the
community on the specification while
it's done its way well done you can
whatever you want with this
specification you can be any kind of you
I with X 11 that's why people stop using
it I hope is not going to be the case
here I'm i hope that due to me is
watching a point where it's very very
stable easy to use it's clear is defined
really it's nice so I hope we're not
going to drop it to do something else
that's what happened with copper also
Kaaba was very good and very well
defined before we're happy with Kaaba at
the end but at the end dropped it on
move to something else so I would say
that the tree has switch this maturity
level now it's cool unstable I think I'm
done yeah well question but I guess it's
going to be lunchtime so any question
maybe quickly how is that clear or did I
just like make you all sleep okay cool
well in this case thanks have a good
meal and while oh yeah as Josh I essex
is my email on the first slide so anyway
if you have any more question you can
have admin email it's easy hama article
that my first time so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
