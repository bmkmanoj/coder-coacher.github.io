to give a talk after that but I'll try
so this story began with Apple it began
with the Apple FBI case of about 18
months ago when the FBI asked after the
San Bernardino shootings at the Health
Department in which 14 people were
killed and a number injured they asked
Apple to open the locked iPhone that
they had found and they said that only
Apple could open the iPhone and that the
iPhone might contain evidence of what
whom the terrorists had communicated
with and other information that they
would want now was a little bit odd that
they claimed it would contain
information about who the terrorists
communicated with because they were
talking about an 18 minute gap that they
couldn't figure out where the terrorist
was but the other point was that of
course if the terrorists had
communicated with anybody during that
time the information would have been at
the cell towers Apple fought the the
case they fought it on a legal basis and
they also fought it on a security basis
I got involved because I'd been asked to
testify in Congress on the issue Apple
did the legal argument I'm not a lawyer
I keep reminding people I'm not a lawyer
even though I have written law review
pieces and so on I'm not a lawyer I'm
not a lawyer I'm not a lawyer but I
argued the security part and I argued
about the security risks that would
ensue meanwhile the FBI was arguing very
very strongly that only Apple could undo
the security protections on the phone
none of the security protections on the
phone included that if somebody punched
in an incorrect pin ten times then the
data on the phone would be destroyed if
if they punched in an incorrect pin then
the time to type in the next pin would
double all the way up to doubling ten
times and so it would slow things down
what the FBI wanted was for Apple to
send an update to the phone that would
undo apple's security protections
and the FBI claimed that only Apple
could get past its own security
protections well our Apple argued a
legal case inaccurate argued a security
case the FBI argued in Congress had
argued in in the courts and then the FBI
discovered that lo and behold somebody
else could get into the phone so the
court case went away but the issue did
not I found myself
after the testimony being asked to give
interviews and talks and so on and I
realized it didn't scale I could only
travel that much around the world or
even around the United States and so I
spent the last year writing a book and
and I have flyers outside about the book
but what I'm going to talk to you about
is security risks of what the FBI and
various law enforcement surround the
world are asking for although
interestingly enough not so in Germany
so in 2010 the FBI began talking about
going dark it said it was having trouble
listening to wiretap communications
because people were using encryption
this of course is a phone from the Dark
Ages it may exist in your grandparents
home it existed in my home growing up
it's a phone that doesn't move but that
does phone calls
that's what it's supposed to do phone
calls the crypto wars are about two
different things the crypto wars in the
1990s were about end-to-end encryption
the crypto Wars now are about locked
devices as well as end-to-end encryption
so the first crypto wars were from the
1970s to 2000 and first it was about
publication could academics and Industry
people publish about cryptography in the
United States you may know we have the
First Amendment which prohibits the
government from controlling publications
you can violate the first of all it you
the government can control things but if
you publish something if somebody were
to publish if somebody working for the
government were to publish a classified
document they could be prosecuted under
the violating this this Secrets Act but
they can't be you cannot prohibit a
newspaper from publishing ahead of time
that one got settled by by a voluntary
arrangement for academics to submit
papers about cryptography to the NSA
before publication it was a voluntary
arrangement some people do some people
don't the NSA asks for some changes
sometimes everything I understand about
that is that everything is free and easy
and there's actually a pretty good
relationship between NSA and the
academics on this in the 1980's the
fight was about cryptography standards
as all of you know the only way anything
works on the Internet is if you have
standards because otherwise nobody knows
how to communicate with anybody else in
the United States we had the National
Bureau of Standards now known as the
National Institute of Standards and
Technology which divided designed crypto
standards for federal communications
federal civilian agencies that sounds
like a pretty narrow thing but if you're
a US company and you're selling to the
world at large ten percent of your sales
go to the US government so you pay
attention to those standards and it once
the device once your devices have those
standards in there
than other people adopt them so although
it was a standard just for the US
government if it was done right it could
be used widely in the 1980s the NSA
wanted to take charge of designing those
standards there was a big fight
missed one in the 1990s was the real
battle and that was over export controls
and the reason that was a real battle is
the u.s. like Europe controlled the
exports of communications and computers
that had cryptography in it that also
had the effect of controlling domestic
use because no manufacturer wanted to
make two systems one with weakened
crypto for export abroad one with strong
crypto for for use domestically and so
they did one thing that had weak crypto
by the late 1990s it was problematic
because the Defense Department in the
United States wanted to buy commercial
off-the-shelf equipment they were
required to buy commercial off-the-shelf
equipment they wanted it with strong
cryptography internet was booming
electronic commerce was booming
everybody wanted strong cryptography of
it enabled in devices
there were also ad hoc and military
coalition's that the US and Europe were
involved in and during those ad hoc
military coalition's unlike NATO you
want to be able to share crypto with
countries where maybe this year they're
on the same side as you but in three
years they might not be you don't want
to share with them the best of your
technology but if you can buy it in
commercial off-the-shelf equipment cool
so in 2000 the u.s. changed its export
controls Europe did it six months
earlier apparently Europe did it because
it also one of the reasons was that it
knew the US was going to do so as well
and so we thought okay now it's going to
be easy to get good crypto in all sorts
of systems that in fact took six eight
ten years since 2002 the now the FBI and
not just the FBI claims it's going dark
in 2010 it said it wasn't able to
understand communications because of
end-to-end cryptography and everybody
here knows what I mean by end-to-end
cryptography yes good
but since 2015 it's been about locked
phones so in 2016 director Comey at the
hearing at which I spoke talked about
warrant proof encryption he said if we
have a warrant to get into the phone it
shouldn't be worn proof some of someone
I know from the NSA retired from the NSA
said well you know the law may give us
the right to get into a device but
doesn't mean that it should be easy but
not everybody heard what my friend said
from the NSA the UK has the
investigatory powers act its meaning
about the requirement of the law to
require companies to hand over keys even
if they don't have them is unclear no
surprise Russia has a package a legal
package that says online services must
retain the keys China the same thing
australia plans to banned end-to-end
encryption and there was this charming
interchange where somebody said well you
can't undo the roles of rule of
mathematics the laws of mathematics and
the australian prime minister said but
the the australian laws have precedents
here I'll leave that one alone and then
we come to Germany where I see strong
support for civilian control of
cryptography and that is a really
impressive bulwark it's not only
impressive because it's a single nation
doing it's a nation doing it but it also
means that applications can be built
here and sold elsewhere and that's a
really important aspect of this entire
discussion so before I go into why we
need to have strong cryptography and how
important it is I'd actually like to
talk a little bit about how you do
investigations in the digital age and I
want to go through a couple of them the
first one is an investigation in the
second half of the 2000s a Security and
Exchange Commission investigation the
security and change Exchange Commission
controls things on Wall Street so that
there isn't insider trading and they got
a tip that the Galleon Group was and was
involved in insider training that is
somebody was giving people in the
Galleon Group information about which
companies were going to be merged which
companies were going to be acquired and
so then the people in the Galleon Group
would purchase stocks ahead of time and
make big amounts of money so the sec
interviewed raj rajaratnam
to ask him about a particular person
they have been looking at the
communications that they were able to
get on the basis of this tip they asked
him about our particular person
and what they did when they did so you
know this is how investigators work they
go on and on for a long time then they
say you know it's getting late all of us
you know we should take a bathroom break
baby get some coffee let's let's take a
break oh by the way have you ever heard
of this person Romy eighty one because
they'd seen an interesting message from
that person Romy 1881 and he says oh
yeah that's Romy come so what what are
the sec people do well the FBI goes and
visits Rumi Khan and they show her lots
of evidence that she's been illegally
sharing information with ratash Ratnam
and they certainly have enough dope on
her to put her in jail and this is of
course an important way that the police
investigate people whether it's drug
dealers organized crime insider training
you flip somebody's small you flip them
again you flip him again you flip him
again it's part of why locked phones are
problematic for state and local police
who do a lot of drug investigations that
start on the corner and they get a
low-level dealer and flip and flip and
flip well under legal threat she did
what all of the low-level people do she
cooperated and she taped messages with
ratash Ratnam and what happens next by
2011 there's thirty five people in jail
including him and he gets an 11-year
sentence how did it happen there was an
instant message from her that says do
not buy PLC m until I get guidance it
says het guidance but of course we all
know how well it is easy it is to type
on a phone do not buy PLC m till I get
guidance clear information that she is
giving him insider information and he
then buys the stock and so on and so
forth what's interesting about this is
think about what it would have happened
fifteen years ago that would have been a
phone call that happened before he was
being investigated before anybody knew
about investigating him now it's an
instant message which stays around let
me do another one and this one is a
terrorist investigation you may remember
that in 2005 there were four bombs on
three Underground's and one one bus in
in London killed a large number of
people injured many more for weeks two
weeks later there was a similar attempt
but
this time the bombs didn't go off they
created a little bit of smoke in each
case and nothing happened and there were
four people that the British police very
quickly figured out were the ones who
had done it
they had this photo they found other
photos they started blasting the photos
all across the press everywhere they
could what happened three of the four
were captured through people recognizing
them and informing the police one of
them wore a burqa head-to-toe covering
went to the London bus station and took
a bus to Birmingham wasn't recognized
despite the fact that he was
six-foot-something wearing a burka
looking trying to disguise himself as a
woman he was picked up a couple of days
later in the streets of Birmingham when
he when he wasn't wearing the burka two
others were recognized and identified
and picked up in the apartment building
they were hiding in the fourth one went
down to the South of England then back
up to London where he was met by his
sister and brother-in-law he got
somebody's passport because they knew
who he was he couldn't travel on his
passport he got a brother her
brother-in-law's passport somebody's
phone and he went to Paris Milan Bologna
in Rome where he was going to stay with
a brother in Rome except he was using
somebody's phone and the British were
tracking him through Paris Milan Bologna
Rome and he was picked up on location
information they this is 2075 they cell
tower at that point the phones are not
yet doing GPS they're doing cell tower
recognition but what they do have is you
know with cell tower only gives you a
region but they knew where his brother
lived so they went to the brothers
apartment and my goodness they found him
there so now you think about that and
you think about the difference between
the way investigations happened 30 years
ago where people didn't carry radio
antennas that showed where they were at
all times where we didn't have the
ability of the the CCTVs that that were
an early part of this story and we
didn't have instant messaging but I also
want to talk to you about cyber security
or when things go wrong and the one I
want to talk to you about is Sony so
Sony got an email and just around this
time of year two years ago and said
we've obtained all your internal data
including your secrets and top secrets
if you don't obey us
we'll release data shown below to the
world the Sony leadership the the
corporate leadership completely ignored
the message it's not clear anybody even
read it they probably thought it was
spam but it wasn't spam they released
films email and HR information it was
pretty embarrassing to Sony like
everybody the Sony executives gossiped
among each other they said nasty things
about Obama they said nasty things about
other movie stars about other producers
and so on it's a good lesson to all of
us that if you're going to say something
nasty use a telephone do it in person
use an ephemeral communication system
don't do it in something that stays an
email it's also a good lesson to all of
us that films you know films are digital
and there was no reason for them to be
sitting right on the corporate network
but they were
why Sony Sony had produced a movie that
mocked the leader of North Korea North
Korea didn't want the film released
North Korea then threatened or at least
the group that was threatening Sony
threatened to bomb the movie theaters if
the movie was shown Sony said okay we're
not gonna show the movie at this point
some people pointed out to Sony that
it's one thing to electronically attack
across the Pacific it's completely
another thing to put bombs in movie
theaters the president that is President
Obama said this is a national security
threat which at the time seemed to me a
bit extreme but looking back at it now
with some hindsight I think okay he's
talking about the idea that a
nation-state is attacking an American
entity and he's objecting to that and
he's calling that a nation-state
in any case he Obama embarrassed Sony
into releasing the film I would say he
embarrassed them twice because the film
was also a dud but that's a different
story
what did Sony do wrong it did three
things wrong it forgot it was in the
digital business it was making films if
the executives probably thought of films
as these things in big canisters that
you you know carry around to different
movie theaters no films are bits and if
you think of films as bits then you
protect them as bits the same way the
financial world knows that money is bits
and you protect the bits
it's toured lots of information that it
shouldn't have I told you about you know
if you're gonna say so that's something
nasty to somebody do it in person do it
about somebody else do it in person do
it on a phone do it on an encrypted
communication where the bits disappear
at the end of the communication and it
failed to use good security practices
what do I mean by that it used to get on
to it's email passwords and it didn't
use anything else so for those of you
who went to Richard Clinton's talk
earlier today you know that the Pat's
password like cuts alone wound is pretty
bad but you also know and this is my
version of fb9 berliner but as as
Richard pointed out everybody
substitutes
a one or an exclamation part mark for an
i and an eight for an e and so on and
and that doesn't work real well either
what it didn't do was do two-factor
authentication
it didn't do it then it doesn't now so
what I want to do now is separate a
little bit the issues for you about
encryption because they're really two
different kinds there's encryption
talking about the phone about the
communication and encryption about the
locked phones and I want to start with
end-to-end encryption so does everybody
here know what forward secrecy is or
should I briefly explain I need a
response explain so if you use the same
encryption key for a series of
communications that if if your adversary
has been collecting your communications
over time and certain adversaries do
that for example the United States
during the Second World War
collected collected Russian
communications over a long period they
does everybody know what a one-time pad
is it's a key that's just very very long
that U is the length of the message and
you use it once to encrypt the
communication so it's a string of 1 in
zeros with your communication which is
also ones and zeros you add it together
then to decrypt you add the key back in
and it cancels itself everybody with me
on one-time pad at least as much as you
need to be well there the Russians were
using one-time pads during the Second
World War but it was hard to get to
their various embassies they reused the
one-time pads in the in the mid 50s the
u.s. figured out that they had done so
broke some of the messages that was part
of how the Burgess McLain Philby group
was exposed at that time what you do to
protect against when your adversary
collects your messages is if you use a
different key for each communication we
call that forward secrecy that means
that the the adversary
if he finds your key will be able to
break your system moving forward but he
can't get any of your back stuff because
the keys have been calculated previously
and they're they're gone so if you want
to break end to end encryption if you
want what the the FBI calls exceptional
access access to a communication even
though it's end-to-end encrypted you
break forward secrecy everybody with me
on that good and this by the way is
discussed in a paper that I've done with
guest 14 other people called keys under
doormats we also observed it breaks
authenticated encryption what's
authenticated encryption well when
you're communicating over an electronic
channel it's pretty hard to authenticate
the other guy you really want to know
it's the other person and not somebody
stepping in in the middle so you you do
a crypto communication that doesn't
ocation for you and then you do another
crypto communication that that encrypts
the community communication end-to-end
what we know from many years of doing
cryptography is that the mathematics and
cryptography very rarely breaks the
protocols breaks sometimes and the
implementations break all the time okay
if you want to look at where things are
going to break vote for the
implementation that's where the problems
are so authenticated encryption is a way
of getting around that problem by having
fewer protocols and fewer
implementations use the same key for
authentication and encryption but if the
FBI says we want exceptional access if
law enforcement says they want
exceptional access then what they want
is they want to be able to break the
confidentiality but if they don't care
about breaking the authentication what
that means is that the authentication
becomes separated from the encryption
you're back to two different systems
every software engineer every software
engineer knows that complexity is the
enemy of security there's also the
problem that weak cryptographic
algorithms last decades and that
undermines security for the long term I
showed you that picture of that black
phone I'm sure some of you use your
smart phones to call those phones they
have to be at your grandparents house or
your great aunt's house and why does it
work because in communications we prize
backwards compatibility somebody has a
browser from the 1990s that browser can
access the Google web page it can't see
all the dancing pigs or whatever else
Google might put on the page but it can
it can access the web page because we
believe in backwards compatibility in
the 1990s we had a rule about short
crypto small key crypto because that was
the requirement or under export controls
two years ago in what's called the freak
attack
the the researchers found a way to get
the browser and the server to rollback
the crypto both sis ends had to have
systems that supported 40 bit crypto so
they rolled back the the protocol so
that both of them agreed they were doing
40 bit crypto which is of course easy to
break you put in a week system a week
end-to-end encryption system now to
satisfy the requirements of law
enforcement and then you decide after
five years hey that lets the bad guys
for break-in too much we don't want to
do it you've undermined not just the
last five years of when you had it but
going forward another twenty because of
backwards compatibility and then finally
there's the question of who holds the
keys if the US wants access to
end-to-end encrypted communications
somewhere in the US has to hold the keys
does that mean when I bring my phone
across the border I then have to get a
new phone in order for the German
government or the UK government to the
Canadian government or is there a fast
way that if if police in this country or
a different country want to get at the
keys they communicate with police over
there it doesn't work in a fast way
because in the US for example we have
the death penalty and a lot of Europe
will not extradite criminals to the US
if they face the death penalty they're
those arrangements don't happen
overnight when you agree to
sher evidence and so on they take a
while because of differing laws so the
problem of holds the keys is serious
back in the 1990's the US government
proposed the Clipper Chip some of you
are old enough to remember it was an 80
bit encryption system in which two
agencies of the US government would hold
the keys it wasn't popular in the US
AT&amp;amp;T implemented it on the secure phone
device they thought they'd sell it
around malls in America when I checked
in 1997 they had sold 15,000 secure
phones and half of those went to the FBI
that's not selling in malls of America
and you can imagine that if it didn't
sell domestically it really didn't sell
abroad because who wants keys abroad
stored with agencies of the US
government so that was the sign that
went around sync clipper designed by RSA
the company there's a different issue
about phones and so once one thing you
have to do is think very hard about how
we use phones phones of course we use to
communicate we use to store data and we
do lots of other things with them why
would we log phones
well there's theft of phones and there's
theft of data so when smart phones first
happened the theft of phones was really
rampant if you think about it in cities
it was really easy to jostle somebody
grab their phone and run away you're
talking about a $600 device pretty
pretty little effort to get a $600
device so Apple put on an activation
lock and Find My iPhone and theft's
really dropped theft the data was a
different story
so Apple found in the late 2000s that
there was a group in China that figured
out a way to take the data off of lost
misplaced stolen phones and this this
group had figured out a hack that would
get data off the phones get email off
the phones and then they would use that
to do identity fraud you know send the
mail saying hi I'm stuck in Barcelona
somebody grabbed my wallet I don't have
my passport I don't have any
identification grandpa can you please
send me five thousand dollars or five
hundred dollars so I can get home
what Apple did is they began protecting
email through encryption they figured
away in 2011 how to entangle the key the
device key with a pin so that thieves
couldn't get the the data and this
Chinese group was not only doing the
hack in a box in China but they were
selling this tool abroad ok so the
problem was not just in China with
stolen phones in China but everywhere
Apple's response was we're going to
protect the data on the phone so they
first did it for email and then they
expanded that protection to other data
on the phone well why why should you
lock phones so there was a very good
talk at enigma conference two years ago
about the most effective way to break
into systems the most effective way to
break into systems is to get the login
information of a sysadmin
or somebody with lots of network
privileges that's what you do especially
if the network privileges they have come
through a password in the user account
and that's it so the best way to stop
that is to have a second factor now some
people will carry USB keys and so on but
many people won't everybody carries a
phone and so using a phone as second
factor is a really good way to protect
yourself and your accounts
sometimes SMS was the original preferred
way to use second factor authentication
you want to get on to some protected
account you get an SMS sent from the
account like maybe your gmail account to
your phone and then you type in the code
that you get on your phone and and
you're in except it turns out that if
you are an important character like the
black lives matter activist DeRay
McKesson then maybe you'll be the target
of an attack so all of a sudden somebody
is sending stuff out of his Twitter
account but it's not him what happened a
little bit of social engineering hi to
the phone company
my girlfriend smashed my phone when she
was mad at me I lost my phone when we
had a car accident whatever it is I have
a new phone number for the account could
you please send the SMS over here
instead
very effective social engineering and he
doesn't know what happens till all of a
sudden he starts getting messages saying
why are you why are you standing out
these Twitter messages damages is done I
mean you can undo it but the damage is
already done better way to do it is to
have a a program on your machine on your
on your phone do Oh Google Authenticator
so you're not getting an SMS to your
phone you have to have the phone with
you because the phone itself calculates
the second factor so duo is a small
company in Michigan that is producing
extremely usable second factor
authenticators for large universities
large pieces of industry but where they
really aimed for was the small users
what they told me was the hair salon
owners and the garage mechanics because
they wanted a system that was usable
when you build a usable system lots of
people come google authenticator is a
different version so why does that argue
for locking phones well I don't have to
tell you that if you make it easy to
break into the phone you make it easy to
mess up the second factor Authenticator
on the phone as well
you weaken both of those you weaken the
data of data protection but you also
weaken the protection of programs on the
phone let me give you one other history
lesson in the 1990s the u.s. passed the
communication says assistance for Law
Enforcement Act which required that all
digital telephone networks be built
wiretap enabled wiretap enabled meant
that you had to have wiretapping
capability built into the switch the FBI
had been very nervous about things like
call forwarding they used to be able to
tap at what was called the phone frame
and the phone central office very close
to the phone number but with things like
call forwarding with a call doesn't go
through the frame and to the phone but
gets turned around at the switch they
couldn't do it so they wanted
wiretapping capability and built into
the switch think about that for a moment
you're building wiretapping capability
into infrastructure what happens well I
talked to people from the NSA and in the
mid 2000s because NSA is responsible for
evaluating the security of all switches
and routers and communications devices
sold to the military that examined
switches and devices that were what
we call Kalia compliant they found
security problems in all of them they
hadn't examined all switches and routers
only the ones that were being that the
DoD Department of Defense was thinking
of buying they found security problems
in every single one of them in the Kalia
compliant part pretty amazing the other
part is the the story of Greek Telecom
some of you may know the 2004-2005 for a
period of 10 months senior officials in
the Greek government the Prime Minister
the head of the Ministry of Interior a
head of the Ministry of offense head of
defense head of the opposition party
were wiretapped hundred senior people
that was the Europe had a similar
requirement to Kalia what happened Greek
Telecom had bought a phone switch from
Ericsson they didn't want wiretapping
capability they didn't pay for it switch
got updated wiretapping capability was
put in not turned on because the Greeks
haven't paid for it in addition there
wasn't auditing capability because the
Greeks hadn't paid for the wiretapping
capability somebody turned on the
wiretapping no auditing because it
wasn't part of the software and for ten
months there was wiretapping it was
discovered when an SMS went awry now
I've just told you how it was done I
haven't told you who did it because we
officially still don't know who did it
there's suspicions but what's the point
you build capability in for wiretapping
you make it easy to break into systems
it will happen
so how would police investigate if we
had locked phones and if we had an to
end encryption well as I pointed out
already there's cameras this
communications metadata
there's cloud data if you think about
Facebook if you think about LinkedIn if
you think about Google if you think
about the thousands of cloud providers
what they do is provide value by working
on the data you give them and so while
they will store it encrypted they use it
in the clear and if law enforcement
comes to them with a warrant to get at
the data they often usually have it in
the clear or are able to get it in the
clear and of course there's the internet
of things I don't know about cases in in
Europe but I know there are cases
already in the US where
internet-of-things the Fitbit on the
wife's wrist that shows she walked
around the house a whole bunch before
she was killed as opposed to the
husband's story that he came back from
some event and there she was lying dead
no that wasn't true the the other pieces
of infinitive things who provide that
provided evidence for law enforcement so
for example you might have
communications metadata which is what
enabled investigators to discover who
had killed her re the prime DX prime
minister in Lebanon who was killed by a
truck bomb studying the patterns of
cellphones in Beirut the day he was
killed and for several months before
they in covered a large conspiracy just
looking at cell phone patterns they
could see who did it and then because
they hadn't done quite the right
tradecraft they were also able to see
who in fact Pete some of those people
were on the right you're right
yeah you're right there's an automated
license plate reader Palantir the
company in Silicon Valley told me about
an instance where police had a had a
warrant to be able to follow data they
were following the cell phone of a
particular person a particular bad guy
they automated license plate readers
told them where the bad guy was going
they were following the car to start
with that told him which cell towers to
look at they discovered that the cell
towers there was a phone number paired
there were two phone numbers this is
data that people didn't have
investigators didn't have 15 years ago
the cell towers uncovered for them a
second bad guy in the car they were
following a bad guy without leaving
their office and then of course there's
hacking software and the FBI has been
using hacking software for over a decade
as I'm sure law enforcement in in Europe
has as well so having told you all of
that I have to tell you why encourage
cryptography zoos and for that I want to
talk about civil society at the time
that the US government the defense
agency said that yes there had been
Russian hacking efforts in the recent
campaign and confirmed that in January
2017 one of the important things that
the government that the Intelligence
Agency said is
we assess Russian intelligence services
collected against us primary campaigns
all of you knew that think tanks and
lobbying groups they viewed it's likely
to shape future US policies you guys
probably don't think about civil society
much but it's something that is the
absolute glue in democracies a healthy
civic society the group of organizations
that sit between the people and the
government I know the names in the
United States I don't have the right
names here or in the UK but they're the
Sierra Club's that work on the
environment they're the professional
organizations like the American Bar
Association or the American Medical
Association that produce reports about
how doctors should be certified or or
whether cigarette smoke causes cancer
there are all sorts of organizations
like that they are very important for
transmitting information from the people
to the government about what the people
want and from the government to the
people about what the government is
doing they're the activists who pay
attention to very complicated things
going on healthy democracies have them
countries that are teetering towards
autocratic societies don't and in
particular interesting tidbit is that
when the the Soviets took over in the
Soviet Union in the in in 1917 one of
the first things they did was eliminate
civil society organizations the same
thing happened in East Germany
Czechoslovakia Poland at the end of the
Second World War first they they
eliminated opposition political
opposition through assassination but
they also went after civil society
organizations you know one example to
think about is the role of the Catholic
Church in Poland and in the overturn of
of Soviet domination in Poland the
Catholic Church was really important
there and something that the Soviet
Union had always been very nervous about
so let me tell you about two Civic
Society issues one of them is
Climategate now you may think that in
the United States we don't believe in
climate change we used to I don't know
why we don't so much anymore because of
course it's actually more apparent now
but in 2008 seventy one percent of
Americans believed in climate change and
the house which is one of our two
legislative bodies in the federal
government passed a major bill on
climate change in anticipation of a
meeting in Copenhagen the bill was
supposed to go up in the Senate but what
happened next was Climategate in which
mail from the University of East Anglia
was stolen climate study group in the
University of East Anglia was stolen
remember I told you about the sort of
jokey way we write an email so there was
should I present the material this way
should I tweak the data that way you all
know we do this all the time we say it
we talk informally we say things
informally that if we were giving a
presentation to a customer to a boss
we'd be much more careful because the
much more careful is actually accurate
but we're sort of fooling around which
we're talking informally well the Mail's
got published selectively pointed to and
within two years the belief in climate
change dropped in the United States and
the trust in scientists dropped and you
know what what's going on in the United
States now in terms of how much support
there is for doing things to to to stop
climate change to counter climate change
another example there's a terrific
organization in Toronto called citizen
lab it's part of the University of
Toronto they study attacks on human
rights groups and on journalists and one
of the studies they did recently was one
called tainted leaks they looked at the
american journalist david satter who had
prepared a report on radio Liberty's
investigative reporting and it was
investigative reporting about situations
in Russia Radio Liberty is a US
government funded organization
Satur was working for the u.s.
government he was writing a report on
radio Liberty's US government funded
investigative reporting what happens
next is he is the report gets stolen and
doctored versions of the report that
make it appear that Russian
anti-corruption activists are being
funded by the US government so I have a
small example from the tainted leaks
report the original report says Radio
Liberty Russian the Radio Liberty
Russian investigative project is gaining
traction blah blah blah it changes it to
the Russian Investigative Reporting
project is gaining traction if you're
trying to undermine
the position of Russian anti-corruption
activists you're trying to undermine the
position of Russian anti-corruption
activists one of the best ways to do it
is to act as if they're being funded by
the Americans which they're not so you
take a report like this you you change
it and you publish it and it got
published on on various sites known to
belong to to Russian entities so that's
what happens so I want to talk to you a
little bit about the role of civil
society and I have a bow whole bunch of
different ones the National Academy of
Sciences which is the US National
Academy of Sciences prepares reports it
might be reports like the one I'm on
about what alternatives are how you
would judge alternatives for law
enforcement to get plain text
if encryption is widely available it
might be on how forensic investigations
are conducted or how whether the study
of the use of DNA in court cases is
adequately scientifically based all
sorts of reports some can be on
controversial issues some on less
controversial issues how you do STEM
education science technology I don't
remember what is for engineering and
mathematics education all sorts of
reports what happens if you taint the
emails of those scientists or you taint
the data in these reports the National
Academy of Sciences uses senior
scientists and engineers and social
scientists from around the country to
produce their reports their reports are
really influential in Washington they
affect how bills are written they affect
how law is because they're seen as a
unbiased view of reality a trusted view
of reality but if you taint the reports
if you go in and effect the report a
number that it's supposed to be 1.3 gets
changed to 1.8 just before it's
published how many times do you have to
do it before the National Academy of
Sciences reports aren't trusted or the
American Cancer Society or if you think
about stuff at the local level every
locality has arguments about whether an
immigrant housing place should be built
over here whether money should go
towards kindergartens or or the housing
for the elderly all sorts of debates
civils
xiety is what knits groups together but
if you start creating division in civil
society
you really hurt democracy so whether
it's the Sierra Club which fights for
conservation or the Southern Poverty Law
Center which exposes hate speech hate
crime or Planned Parenthood or
Greenpeace and some of you are old
enough to remember the French attacks on
Greenpeace about whaling so if the
French government can go after
Greenpeace what if another nation state
does so if I think for a moment about
civil society what does civil society
need if we go back to when cyber attacks
first happened that happened in the
1980s over military sites that's when
the u.s. discovered that the Russians
were snooping in now we know less about
what the where the US was snooping but
we do know that the Russians were
snooping on US military sites actually
the person who was doing it came from
from Germany and was tracked to Germany
at the time was a German tracked into
Germany in the 1990s we found similar
attacks and I say attacks they really
cyber espionage on government sites by
the to thousands of course it was major
espionage on industry now we're talking
about threats to civil society it's hard
enough for governments to protect
themselves it's hard for industry to
protect themselves civil society are
small organizations largely threadbare
budgets no good forms of protection what
they need to rely on is a Bic wa tiss
security a Bic wa - security supplied
through things like and to end
encryption and apps like signal and
what's happened and so on and locked
devices that secure that both enable
phones to continue to act as second
factor but also protect the data so in a
nutshell the going dark is not a debate
is not about security versus privacy law
enforcement in the United States and
sometimes in in the UK and other places
talk about its security and privacy we
have to protect you know you don't have
any privacy if your nation isn't secure
etcetera etc this is really a debate
about law enforcement investigations
versus personal business and national
security that is to say we're in a
situation where much of our values much
of what we value much of much of our
strength comes from the data that we
keep on digital devices of various sorts
and we need to protect and secure them
it's about securing those devices versus
making law enforcement investigations
more more simple to do and so it's
really a debate about security versus
security and when I phrase it is a
debate about security versus security
then you can take a step back and think
about what law enforcement might need
law enforcement has had for the last 15
years the ability to investigate phones
easily the ability to listen to
communications easily because encryption
wasn't a Bic WA tiss when they had that
ability we probably didn't fund law
enforcement quite the right way we also
didn't educate law enforcement about how
to do investigations in the digital age
so one of the things I discovered during
the process of writing this book was in
the late 1990s the FBI the NSA was going
deaf now that may be hard for you to
believe because of course you've all
seen the Snowden disclosures but between
the variety of different kinds of
communications which were not only fax
and email and phone but all sorts of the
new applications that were becoming
available because of the web the volume
of communications because all of a
sudden we had a different way of
communicating you no longer had to call
somebody in order to reach them but you
could send them many more communications
in many different ways the volume
variety and the speed which is also a V
word that I'm forgetting somebody in the
audience can remember it for me but that
that's said of three things by the end
of the 1990s the NSA was not doing its
job very well and there was a lot of
concern about whether or not I could
listen in well one of the things we
learned in the Snowden disclosures is
just how effective the NSA had become I
know there's a new issue about its tools
being stolen but but talking about its
capabilities extraordinarily hide the
NSA retooled between the late 1990s and
the mid 2000 mid to 2010's
to the point that even though it faced
encryption a former NSA director could
say it's signals intelligence
abilities was better than ever the FBI
didn't do a similar retooling it didn't
say oh the communications world is
changing data world is changing how do
we do investigations in this new world
and that's the thing that really has to
happen in this debate about security
versus security so with that I'll thank
you
and remember to rate this session thank
you very much
are there any advantages of a hard token
device versus soft token apps for
two-factor authentication
sure I mean hard token is harder to mess
up and and if the FBI gets its way about
about making device software about
making phones easier to unlock on the
other hand when you have a phone you
always know where it is and when I
worked for son I had a hardware token I
came back from a trip from Europe and
the next day I couldn't find my hardware
token anywhere and I looked all over I
couldn't find it and then I thought
maybe I'd left it in Brussels and then I
realized no I'd locked on once and I
couldn't log on without the hardware
token and that's when I realized one of
my kids had hidden it and once I knew
one of my kids had hidden it I knew
where to look but you know when you
think you've misplaced something you
look between the cushions on the sofa
you don't take the cushions off the sofa
to see if it's actually underneath the
cushion because that wouldn't happen so
so the point is that convenience of
course is the phone hardware token is
probably slightly better but it's
probably not worth it for most people
you mentioned that Germany is bacon
private encryption are there any other
countries with similar stands nobody
who's as important economically and
who's as strong technically nobody else
is in the same league do you think
there's a limit to protecting data from
law enforcement so it's not about
whether there's a limit to protecting
data from law enforcement you can't have
a robust for example stock market if
financial companies were able to hide
their information you have to in fact be
able to investigate so in fact stock
brokers and other financial institutions
are required to record their
communications anytime you call somebody
in an institution like that a media
you hear this call is being recorded and
you want that transparency you want the
transparency that banks are required to
have but they have to excuse me have to
report any transaction of over ten
thousand dollars their various
organizations that have to have
transparency I assume that drug
companies dealing in opioids have to
have a certain level of transparency
about who they're selling to and how
long they have to keep the records and
so on so it's not about preventing law
enforcement from ever getting any
information it's really about the issue
of enabling a certain level of
protection within society versus making
law enforcement investigations more
efficient thank you
what advice do you have for women who
want to work in cyber security be tough
but I think that's true for women in
computer science or technical fields
regardless be tough I think it's really
useful and this is not true just for
women I think it's really useful to
think broadly as well as deeply it's
important to be an expert in a
particular area but keeping abreast of
things across including usability
including where government policy is
heading sometimes you want to make a
change in your career but not make a
huge jump make a small jump and having
that breadth is useful but having that
breadth is also useful when you're
having conversations with people at work
so when I when I was teaching at
Worcester Polytechnic us now and so I
haven't yet taught at Tufts but I will
say the thing same thing to my tough
students I told them that when I was at
Sun I found speaking several languages
was really important and I didn't mean
Mandarin which I don't speak or Spanish
or in English I really meant being able
to talk to lawyers and business people
and computer scientists but having that
breath of being able to understand the
other person in another field was really
valuable and of course that's true for
men and women thank you do you think
leaks such as Viki leaks or Snowden
helped or actually hurt countries so the
Snowden one is a a nuanced one
Snowden released lots of documents some
of those documents like the one that
talked about bulk collection of
communications metadata bulk domestic
bulk collection of communications
metadata was a secret interpretation of
the USA PATRIOT Act I don't think a
democracy can ever have a secret
interpretation of a law that's
completely antithetical to a democracy
democracies work by open laws and that
includes no secret interpretations of
the law secret interpretation of the law
is like a secret law so that was
extremely useful in fact we had a change
in law as a result of that the other
thing we discovered from Snowden is that
NIST was in charge and is in charge of
developing cryptographic standards for
use by the federal government NSA got
NIST to recommend an algorithm dual ec
drbg that was a random number generator
that it strongly appears that NSA had a
backdoor into so whether it could
predict how the random numbers were
generated than the random numbers were
of course used for a crypto algorithm
once he can predict the random numbers
of a key you can predict a whole lot
can't you or you can find out a whole
lot what that did is a tainted NIST's
reputation as a purveyor of crypto
standards this had been extremely widely
respected over the previous 1518 years
for the way it handled the advanced
encryption standard competition which
was open to the world and the algorithm
was actually picked by the algorithm
picked was designed by two Belgians it
was respected for other competitions
that it was running in crypto standards
that was a really serious harm others of
the pieces of information that Snowden
released I think were less important to
release on the other hand what he did is
he largely released I don't want to say
metadata but information about things
that NSA was doing but not actual
sources and methods WikiLeaks is
publishing all sorts of information it
has no business doing if you think back
to what it did in in Afghanistan
publishing the film that showed drone
pilots targeting civilians was an
important thing that was a pretty
horrible thing that was
happening it's important to show it but
publishing information about informers
in Afghanistan or Iraq putting people
those people at risk
I think WikiLeaks is is in Crete is
incredibly damaging to democracies is is
a very twisted and warped sense of of
what's healthy and so I I don't I don't
have the respect for WikiLeaks I you
know I have mixed feelings about Snowden
I think he did some important things I
also think that was probably too much
release all right one last question
Windows Linux or Mac so when I started
at Sun I joined a group that was doing
Linux this was 1999 my PhD is in
theoretical computer science I do know
how to you know I can look at a piece of
mathematics and tell you this is a
reasonable piece of mathematics system
administration is not my strong point so
using Linux in 1999 was awful god-awful
and I was really relieved when finally
my group said okay go ahead and get a
Mac because every time we updated our
VPN it was somewhere between 2 and 14
hours for me to update the VPN on the
Linux box Linux was not well supported
in those days
I like Mac's I find them usable and and
much better to use then than Windows
Windows has really improved its security
story in the last dozen years Microsoft
has a much better security story than it
did and I think it's actually a
reasonable security story but I think I
can go on record as hating word which I
have to use every time I read a lore
review paper I have two co-authors and
it's a race which one of us says I hate
word the earliest and in writing a paper
thank you so much for being here thank
you for your key no thank you thank you
