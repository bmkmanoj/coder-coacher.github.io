Copenhagen countries and I'd like you to
have my
like a financial you you're a frequent
speaker at the Hope conference and well
known for having experienced both as a
developer and on the operation side of
things you're an active person in the
DevOps community and we would like to
talk to you about DevOps and and
continues delivery
Noby I'm happy to be here yeah
Keith tell us about yourself and your
work so I've been a software developer
and architect primarily that was most of
my career in the early 2000s through an
unusual set of circumstances I found
myself in need of a contract in a hurry
and I was able to convince a hiring
manager that I knew enough operations to
to do technical operations supporting a
development group that was really the
start of my introduction to operations
and what I quickly learned was that I
didn't really know anything about
operations so it was what you might call
a crash course in operations that effort
supporting the development group led
into supporting the production
environment as we got closer to
production and and then living with the
system after it went live for the first
two years of its existence and that was
when I formed my impression that living
with a system in production was a lot
like living with a baby a newborn infant
it would demand attention in the middle
of the night every night for the first
six months through that experience I
came to understand that the software I
have been delivering into production for
many years actually wasn't that good at
running in production and the software
that most of us were delivering wasn't
that good at running in production and
so that really changed my outlook on
development I've since tried to take
that experience from being in operations
and bring it back into the development
community starting in 2007 with my book
release it and through the talks that
I've been doing at go-to and other
conferences you think it's pretty much
what you're seeing now on this thing up
just pretty much but you experienced
thank it's an outgrowth and I think a
very positive one
I was focused on the transition from
development to operations the fusion of
development and operations is actually a
really nice development beyond that even
the terms DevOps and continued
continuous delivery that used a lot of
movement are they different views on the
same concept can you describe what's the
difference between their names
I can describe my perspective these are
both relatively new terms
they each have people who identifiable
people who coined the terms so there of
course the best people to define them
but the way that I view them is that
continuous delivery is a way of
organizing the software creation process
I think it Springs out of the lean and
agile movement and it's really about the
flow of work through the software
development lifecycle and all the way to
the production environments DevOps I
think really is mostly a cultural
phenomenon supported by tools but it's
primarily about
the attitudes and collaboration of the
people so you might regard it as a way
of organizing a group of people rather
than organizing the process of the work
flowing through the system they're
clearly related but I see them as
somewhat distinct yeah how do you see
the adoption of these and is it
something a few companies have success
doing and why the rest of the world see
it as a really nice concept for a
struggling really hard to to implement
do you see weight free Morgan Station
starting to to take up these things I
think there is some struggle continues
delivery is not something you can easily
do with a system that wasn't built for
it you have to make some changes to the
system to enable continuous delivery
safe continuous delivery likewise
existing organizations that have strong
barriers between development and
operations may find themselves sending
conflicting messages to their people on
the one hand we want you to collaborate
as
on the other hand all of our incentive
structures our organizational and
management structures prevent you from
collaborating so I think that it's
harder for an existing mainstream
company to adopt then the newer more
nimble startup companies that frankly
don't have much legacy to support so
we're seeing the innovation coming from
the very young companies and the older
ones are trying to adopt as much of it
as they can so I think I hear developers
saying it's hard to introduce develop
synchronous delivery in the organization
organization in your presentation you
you laid out that convention I would
tend to say that when you make changes
to systems they break and DevOps tries
to trust this outside time if something
hurts do it more often is that why it
can be hard for developers to introduce
these things into their companies that
because of this culture and how they are
organized and many tuned by the
conventional wisdom certainly can be a
challenge you know I find it sort of
amusing that perhaps ten years ago we
were asking questions about how can I
get a j'l software development to be
adopted in companies it seems hard to do
that and probably ten years before that
we were saying it seems hard to get
object-oriented software development
adopted within companies so it's just a
repetition of the same pattern that you
know there are techniques being
innovated but it's not just the
techniques that you have to bring into
the company
you bring the techniques along with the
culture and the mindset and that always
takes longer to adopt there will be a
diffusion inward regarding the
conventional wisdom about change
breaking things I've experienced it I
had data in my days and operations that
50% of our set ones would happen within
24 hours of major
to the system and so my response at that
time was exactly the same less change
hold it back let's stabilize the problem
that I didn't see at the time was by
holding back the change you actually
increase the risk so every line of
undeployed code is a risk
it's unproven code the more of that you
accumulate the more likely it is that a
change will break something
conversely if the changes you're
deploying they're very small tens of
lines
dozens of lines rather than hundreds or
thousands of lines then the odds of one
of those lines breaking your system are
also much smaller and the time it takes
to find the breakage and fix the
breakage is much smaller so change does
produce additional risk and if you do if
you don't add any compensating
mechanisms doing more rapid change will
create more downtime and more
instability this is why I say it's hard
to take an existing system into
continuous delivery you have to create
some additional mechanisms to help make
it safe such as extra monitoring and
transparency so you can tell immediately
you know after a deployment the number
of logon failures went up or maybe my
average response time on the website
went down but the worst case response
time went way up you need that kind of
visibility to make it safer to deploy
these changes that's so good we can use
trying to to do some some DevOps and
continuous delivery is it something you
think that every project could do can
you do it when making software for space
shuttle healthcare budget protect our
bank or is it easier we always hear when
people go out of the DevOps
tracks oh this would never work on my
project it's just a webpage there yeah
but you're taking that I made a joke
during my presentation that continuous
delivery is easier when you're sharing
cat photos
than building the Space Shuttle or
nuclear power reactor I'd like to take a
clear-eyed approach to risk and risk
management so I talk about what's the
number of opportunities for error the
probability of an error occurring and
the cost if the error does occur this is
the standard risk equation there are
some industries where the cost is very
very high you know nuclear power plants
life-support systems in hospitals
medical devices of all types the cost is
very very high on the other hand there
have been some very interesting examples
of what I think of as near continuous
delivery one of the Mars pros that NASA
launched actually did not have its
complete software installed when it
launched now you would think that this
is you know the ultimate in the one-time
launch but it turns out they could
actually upload new code to the probe
while it was on its way to Mars so as it
was launching it only needed the
software for controlling the launch it
didn't need the terminal guidance and
landing software that package got
uploaded later so that's a very
interesting approach to continuous
delivery in a domain where I wouldn't
have thought it was possible very cool
and also I think isn't there are many
things you can do I think it's really
interesting that this thing about him
DevOps about monitoring and metrics
learning from your production system and
actually feeling how how does it work
and stuff like that you can do a lot of
the things even though you don't release
everyday yeah stuff like that this is
one of the reasons that I I think DevOps
and continuous delivery are related but
distinct because you can do DevOps and
get all of that valuable information
from what your production systems are
doing without redeploying code on every
commit so yes I think everyone should
learn what's happening in their
production systems it really bothers me
when I'm dealing with the development
team that can't see metrics from
production
I'll go on to do something different
people are starting to talk about no ups
yeah its developers running the software
but your folks in that so you're leading
me into a charged and controversial area
this is my first time on record talking
about no Hobbs I think that when you
scratch the surface of no ops what it
really means is that there's not a
distinct group labeled as doing
operations but that the developers
themselves are responsible for how their
code operates in production which to me
really means that Ops has just been so
thoroughly integrated into development
that developers are also ops so it's not
no ops in the sense that operations
doesn't happen it's no ops in the sense
that there is no distinct operations
group so do you think we all still have
maybe we have functional teams with
developers and with ups guys who think
so that one specializes in some
programming skills and then another one
has skills in setting up infrastructure
stuff like that how do you think it will
meld together so that it will pretty
much be developers know like we should
call it I think it's really the former
case I think if I look at a typical
developer I see a person with multiple
skills and multiple facets so one
developer may you could code into the
backend and also know a lot of front-end
JavaScript or CSS and be good at the
design side of things another developer
may have systems thinking and the
ability to analyze things that are
narcotic chiral level and another one
may have that operational mindset and
skill set so I think we'll see a
blurring of roles versus people and I
always prefer to focus on people as
individuals and tie the skill sets to
pieces of work okay it's great
it's still pretty much in this very face
this adopting continues today already
and and DevOps and I think I often hear
people say that software projects are
very different and companies are very
different we have small startups we have
large enterprises like you've already
talked about they have very different
cultures and it's like people
experimenting now it's an early phase
system and a lot of people are doing
their own experiments do you see that
when we start to learn from each other
but we get into a very diverse space
where people do things that match the
context of their projects whatever think
we'll see some best practices or some
way of doing things that will emerge I
think that variation is really important
to achieve innovation so we constantly
need people exploring solution spaces
and exploring problem spaces and some of
those approaches will be viable and
people will emulate them so that
approach will spread some of those
approaches will turn out to be non
viable and the approach will die out or
perhaps the company will tie up so I
think a sort of an evolutionary view of
that variation is essential and then you
have a selection process on top of it I
also see that context is very important
so I do consulting sometimes with large
firms that have their core enterprise IT
group and they have different forces
acting on them than say a dot-com group
the core IT group has limited upside
they could do a tremendous job and get
double the performance out of their
existing systems but the core eyeties
function is really about cost
containment and no matter how good a job
they do they're not enabling a lot of
new revenue on the other hands on
systems that interface directly with
customers like comm systems
or customer touch points at point of
sale or whatever there's a very high
upside potential so you could do
somewhat of a better job and get much
more revenue this is something that Don
Reinertsen is going to talk about
tomorrow in terms of asymmetric payoff
curves so when you're in one kind of a
group you have limited upside and only
downside if you have massive cost
overruns if you're in another type of
group you have practically unlimited
upside and so you might be willing to go
over budget if it captures you you know
three times the revenue why would we
expect the same set of practices to work
under such dramatically different
contexts I don't I think context is very
important whenever we talk about
practices so it's supposed to for these
subjects and as it is for a lot of other
things in software absolutely so it
leads me to the tools do you think we
have oversee a lot of new tools emerge
and how should we build our deployment
pipelines how should we automate stuff
how should we do money trying in metrics
do you think that is the tools out there
I will see a new wave of things coming
factors for some of these problems we're
beginning to see a new wave of tools
already and I think we'll continue to
see again variation and experimentation
with tools and some of them will be
adopted in some world
Patrick Dubois was talking about metrics
driven development yesterday and he
offered us the Twitter hashtag
monitoring sucks which is where people
are collecting complaints about the
existing monitoring systems they tend to
be too narrowly focused - static -
difficult to use in a cloud-based
environment all of them sort of show
their age and betray the idea of systems
as being relatively static compared to
the monitoring time frame when you're in
a cloud-based environment say using spot
price Amazon instances you may fluctuate
by a hundred machines on a daily basis
none of them have long-lived identifiers
this will drive Nagios insane so the
tools do have a need to evolve and I
think we'll see a lot of experimentation
around monitoring tools around
operational tools we've seen great
variation and experimentation with
deployment tools I think those are all
still focused too much on the individual
boxes and we're gonna see more tools
that describe entire topologies so we'll
see a lot of new experimentation over
the next few years
cool yeah what's the one tool you think
you need this
I can't even just one no okay but a few
that that I really appreciate at this
point in time I think graphite is a
fantastic tool for capturing metrics and
displaying them I'm using that on all of
my projects
SATs tee goes along with that as a very
easy way to feed graphite in a safe way
because the last thing you want is your
system hanging because it can't talk to
monitoring and I really like em
collective for issuing commands to
groups of machines and making change
across groups of machines simultaneously
so those are among my favorites right
now I'm doing to make 15 DevOps work at
the moment but we can we look forward to
hearing from you information from you
soon you know at present I work for a
development services company and so
we're not operating a lot of the
software we deliver but one thing we are
doing is baking into our template
project in our methodology deployment
and monitoring so that will never again
deploy a system or deliver a system to a
customer that doesn't have these things
and so you'll see some open source
coming from us with template projects
and baked in monitoring metrics and
deployment like will your DevOps moving
forward to see what's coming thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
