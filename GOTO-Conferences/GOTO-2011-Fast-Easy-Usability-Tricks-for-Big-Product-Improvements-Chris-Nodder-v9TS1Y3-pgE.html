country and they pretty much assure you
from the word go that you are nuts yes
this is my last name okay not with the
strange oh but yes so I think Jana said
everything that needs to be said about
me I'm a user experience consultant but
I'll say one thing about what that means
lots of people make lots of people make
claims about what they can do for your
product I would say that let me make
some of those claims myself I can
increase the number of users of your
product for you by helping you make it
more desirable I can help you work out
how to retain more users by making a
product more satisfying and I can help
you increase increase the revenue from
your product by making it so that people
understand what they're doing as they go
through it so that they complete
whatever it is that you're doing that
you're trying to monetize them from and
it's not a lot of people who can make
those claims but what at the point I can
help you do it yourselves so although
I'm a consultant I'd rather like to put
myself out of a job and that's what
we're going to talk about today is how
you can help yourselves simply by
watching your users and what do I mean
by that well you're all saying well we
already listen to our users why do we
have to do this
well you're not saying that because
you're sitting in this room but you get
that a lot at work right you get a lot
of people saying that kind of thing we
do surveys we do focus groups we've got
all these metrics let me tell you some
things about those it's very difficult
to write a good survey that doesn't
really just do it doesn't just reinforce
what you already knew because the
questions you put on the survey are the
questions you know to ask there's the
whole set of questions you don't know
you should be asking okay metrics
metrics are awesome I love metrics I
love having an interface between metrics
and some user experience work because
when I do user experience work I don't
normally have very many users that I'm
working with and having the metrics
me what the problem is observing users
working tells me why it's a problem okay
and focus groups I'd our focus groups
for okay no laugh from you in the
audience that means that you like focus
groups I think the problem with focus
groups is that unless you have an
incredibly good moderator and unless
you're actually asking people about
their real behaviors already you're
gonna hear whatever you want to hear
from a focus group group and if you're
getting a group of people together to
ask them what they do already you're
taking them away from their environment
so you're getting what they tell you
rather than what they actually do and
that leads me on to what I want you to
do and the people who are familiar with
the Lean Startup movement will know this
as getting out of the building what I
want you to do is go and watch some
users and specifically find the pain
points if you fix the pain points that
your users have the things which are
causing them issues right now
they will hug you it will kiss you one
maybe not I for me the sign of a good
product as if I can have somebody in a
usability study when the product is near
to being released and I can give them a
reward at the end of the study something
something for coming in maybe some money
or maybe a product if it's the kind of
product that the company makes I can
give them but it's when they say I don't
want that I want what I just played with
yeah that's the sign of a product that
really works how'd you get there let's
talk about that how do you get to the
product that people would hug you and
kiss you for how many people think they
have that product today already awesome
come see me afterwards we'll find out oh
did the Lego guys put their hands up in
that case yeah you know sure we can all
aspire to that right
I can do that from up here to watch Wow
so anyway here's what you need to do
you've really read this while I've been
talking find some people to watch then
the hard part interpret that without
adding bias the bias that you bring to
the to the process then when you've been
done the interpretation you have to turn
that someone hands on some product ideas
and then you have to make those product
ideas into designs then you have to make
sure those designs are what your users
want it so you take the circle all the
way back through let's talk about each
of those pieces in actually no that's
not let's talk about why let's sell that
you on the idea of doing this it's quick
traditionally so here's the thing I'm
talking about how to do this in an agile
environment but you can do this in any
environment you can run these same steps
and traditionally usability people could
be seen to be slowing down your process
because they wanted to do a whole bunch
of research and then they wanted to kind
of talk to you about it and then they
wanted to maybe have some meetings about
what that meant we can do all this in a
week I have done it several times with
teams in a week think of this as sprint
zero or if you're halfway through
something and you haven't done this
believe me it's worth your while doing a
spike doing doing some time out to do
some research to find out where your
problems are right and you can do it I
mean even if you got a one-week sprint
if you've got a two-week sprint you've
actually got more time two weeks might
be a bit too much but we'll see as we go
through this you'll see what I'm saying
about this it's a lovely thing to get
the team working together when I do this
work I want everybody on the team
involved specifically the developers
because who are the people who determine
what the product finally looks like it's
the people with their hands in the code
right
that's the developers if I can give
developers in the group an understanding
a real visceral understanding of what it
is that their users pain
they can become sensitized to that and
build better product for that for their
users this is a cheap thing to do as
well running a set of focus groups can
set you back an awful lot of money and
like I said who knows what that gives
you really doing this you're doing it in
a week you're doing in a very sort of
guerilla method mechanism way doesn't
take very light and very much money to
do it and it gives you value over a long
period of time people on the team will
continue talking about what they saw
when they went on these visits for
months for years okay and that's
valuable it's a lot more valuable than a
focus group report that nobody reads and
then here's the very important point and
this is something that I talk about
whenever i try and talk to people about
user research i the one thing I like to
say is I'd like to speak from data not
from opinion think about how many
opinions there are on the team everybody
has one right think about how many
arguments there are on the team we're
always having arguments in fact
yesterday it was the it was Yahoo from
endomondo who said the best argument
wins well what's the best argument is
the one that's backed up with data right
so if you can bring data you can stop
arguments which means you can get on and
actually do some of your work I mean
it's fun to have arguments every now and
again but if they're getting in the way
of the work that's just a waste of time
okay so first step find some users to
watch some users so who are your users I
wonder how well any of you could really
define your users if you're looking if
you're the kind of company who says oh I
users could be anybody then stop you're
not ready to do this yet you need to
have a pretty good definition of who
your users are now personas you've
probably heard the word personas you may
even have persona to be around they're a
nice thing to have you don't need to go
to that level of detail but you do need
to at least talk to the marketing people
in your world and see who they're
targeting that might be a good starting
point I don't always use market
segmentation to create personas I want
to know who my users are but it's a good
starting point then you need to find out
where those people are and then you need
to go and find them there's different
ways of recruiting I I wouldn't talk
about this except every single talk
where I don't talk about how to recruit
people I get questions about how to
recruit people as if it's a hard thing
to do it's kind of hard but it's not as
hard as some of the other things you do
so you can you can always advertise on
your site that you need people to help
you out what's the problem with that
okay big audience nobody wants to talk
to me itself select oh we have a you
don't get the typical user yeah you get
self selection bias
it's the people who come to your site
who are signing up for the studies it's
not the people who should be coming to
your site but don't right now yeah if
you ask your sales people very very
nicely and promise that you won't say a
word while you're out on the sales call
with you they might let you there's some
salespeople in where I'm going no they
might let you come out on some visits or
they actually if you sell it the right
way they might be you might be able to
convince them but actually all those
complaints they're getting from their
users you're in a position to help them
out and to actually listen to those
complaints and get those built into the
product as features so they can sell a
better product okay you can there's all
sorts of other things here I mean if any
of these don't make sense to you ask me
afterwards obviously the further down
you get the more expensive it gets but
the more realistic those users are going
to be more likely okay there are people
who are professional study doers who
hang out on Craigslist and they know
what to say to make you think that
they're representative of your users and
then the night before they come in there
we go okay what was that thing
SoundCloud let's check it out and so
that they're not users but they like
making money from coming in and giving
you their opinions
there are two things you need to take
with you on a site visit something to
write on and with and this you know what
I can see the smiles you know what this
is for don't you your mouth it goes
across your mouth there is one thing you
need which isn't on here when you go out
but this is the proxy for it because I
know you it might be hard for you to
have this thing and that is humility
humility you need to feel you need to be
very you need to push your ego down okay
even if you could do that there may be
people on your team who would find that
difficult so we take the duct tape with
us as you need some know it really you
know it's just a question of having
conversations with people up front and
the conversation goes actually I'm gonna
come back to this slide conversation
goes like this your job is to take notes
smile encouragingly if you are going to
ask a question preface it with I'm sorry
I'm such a terrible developer but could
you tell me why and then if you do ask
questions ask questions that clarify
something rather than asking questions
which lead users down a certain path
this isn't an interview is an
observation and it's not a conversation
either
and by being quiet for a little time the
people you're watching will forget you
are there you don't believe me now but
if you've ever done this you'll find
that it's true they don't completely
forget you're there but they start
behaving in a very much more natural way
if you instead keep engaging them they
can't forget you're there and so they
won't behave in a natural way and
instead they'll do a demo for you of
what they might do rather than showing
you what they really do don't sell them
on your next cool product idea okay
they're telling you what then it's well
you know it's called credit ideas but
not going to tell you directly what
users say and what users do or two
different things and what you're doing
is you're looking for what they do never
ask them to predict the future users are
terrible at predicting the future okay
what do you think you might want this
product to do in six months time soon as
it does today I think it's not it's not
something they're good at so let's go
back once like if you're gonna do this
observation you need to go to where your
users are because you want to watch them
working in their natural environment if
it's a mobile device that you're if
you're got an app on a mobile device if
you bring them into your offices to
watch them working with it it's not a
natural environment they might be
normally using it standing at the bus
stop or at lunchtime with the with an
iPad next to them on the table
who knows you've got to work out where
it is that they're most likely to be
doing this notes when people start doing
this they often think to themselves you
know what why don't I just take a video
camera with me the video cameras great
at taking notes for me and that's kind
of the problem because the notes stay on
the video camera I used to have clients
request videos from me and I never did
this but I wish I had I wish I'd
inserted something halfway through one
of the videos that said if you're
reading this I will give you a discount
off the next piece of work I do for you
a 50% discount on speech I would never
have had to have honored that discount
because nobody ever watches the freaking
tapes they don't it's a waste of time
who's going to sit there and transcribe
them and if you send them out to a
transcription service to have them
transcribed you're missing the
opportunity
of listening to them okay plus it means
that when you're watching the person
you're not processing in the same way
you can sit back and passively watch
like you watch TV and that's bad you
want to be sitting forward and actively
watching how many visits do you do well
you need to do at least three for each
kind of user that you've identified
because that way you'll know that it
wasn't just some crazy whack job that
you had but yes really all your users
are like that yeah and you probably want
to do at least five visits so if you
only have one user type do five visits
if you have two user types to six visits
etc when you go go with two people if
you go with any more it sends to freak
people out because there's just too many
of you getting very close to somebody
you know especially if you're in an
office environment and you're huddling
in to somebody's cubicle sitting there
like there's no it's a bit it's
uncomfortable so but at least two of you
there's a couple of reasons why getting
to where you need to get to on time it's
useful to have somebody who can navigate
and somebody who's driving yeah yeah
it's true safety physical personal
safety I've had some weird places I've
been in there was one guy who was living
in a citizen America I actually work in
Seattle but I live in Seattle I used to
work at Microsoft and one of the when I
was there working there I went out on
the site was it to a guy who was living
in a double-wide trailer where he had
ferrets running around loose in the
trailer I took one of the marketing
girls out with me I say girls it's not
they weren't all girls in marketing but
this was a new she'd just done an
internship and then come back as a
full-time person she's wearing this
pretty little dress and she's sitting
there thinking and I knew what she was
thinking like don't let the ferrets near
me don't let the pros near me ferret
everybody know what ferrets are like rat
like things but yeah they're cute
actually but yeah the other thing is you
want one person who's doing the engaging
not necessarily interviewing but that
mmm-hmm and you want another person
who's frantically scribbling everything
down okay so what do you do when you've
got all this information you've got
these notepads
full of stuff
you create an experience map every
observation you've made goes on a sticky
note this is where it makes sense to
make to to think to talk about what kind
of observations you're making what
things do you write down use a quotes
what the user said if you start
designing your new product while you're
in it in the observation with your user
you've wasted that time instead just
keep writing what they're saying
keep writing what they're saying put
those sticky notes on the wall and
arrange them I'm going to show you what
I mean by this so we actually came up
with a color-coded way of doing this
because it kind of makes sense because
most people have a lot more yellow
sticky notes and their office than other
colors so you use yellow for your basic
things you write down what people said
if you could manage to work out what it
was they were trying to do write that
down put that on a post-it note did you
find out things where they say oh I
always have problems with this write
that down if you saw them doing crazy
stuff write that down as well like in
the physical world
so for instance printing something off
putting it down in front of them and
typing it into another product yeah
that's a crazy thing that's a user
action then take those take what you've
just done
put a whole bunch of them on the on the
wall and if you have questions about
what you saw write those down put those
down on a different color post-it note
if you have design ideas this is not the
time to be redesigning your product so
write them down and move on move on yeah
this is a way of stopping those
conversations before they start you've
captured the idea you move on it's a bit
like brainstorming and affinity
diagramming all in one yeah then after
time you'll have all this stuff written
down on the board and you can start
grouping it into tasks you say well this
looked like it was a task that somebody
was doing this looks like it was a tasks
that somebody was doing so you start
giving those tasks labels and you might
even group the tasks together into
activities you'll end up with a lot of
questions a lot of design ideas if you
took photos while you were out on the
site visits pin those up as well if you
picked up I say artifacts if you because
this is a word from
from ethnography or archeology an
artifact is a thing that is used in the
process it could be a piece of paper it
could be if it's in an office workflow
environment it might be a form they have
to fill in anything like that if you can
make photocopies of them or take camera
pictures of them do it because it's it's
it helps you understand what the process
is that people go through now it helps
you understand where the pain is that
the guys are now here's some examples
there's a guy who's talking the rest of
talking another group of people through
his experience map it's become an
information radiator you know that term
as agile term it's a it's become
something which is pushing information
back out again you can see he's they've
got the groupings of the user comments
they've got tasks they've grouped the
tasks or these blue things they're here
oh look don't get hooked up on the
microphone oh look there's some things
which skip one of these sections so
they've even put that in so you can see
visually how the process flows so it's
not just an affinity get diagram it's
got time in it as well this is a group
of people working together to create one
of these experience maps so you do it as
a group I think of it as a data party
remember you've had everybody on the
team out on different visits you won't
be attending all of them so you'll have
to brief people on how to be good
observers and they'll be going out in
pairs it's probably good to if you if
they used to pair programming they this
is just the same thing it's pair
observing right you might want to pair
some some people who are more in a
development role with people who are
less in a development role or a more in
a business role so you get two
perspectives from the same visit
everybody who goes out the apt on the
visits comes together in the room at the
same time they all write their person at
the same time they'll stick them up on
the wall at the same time then as a
group they group these things and
arrange them in the chronological order
yeah you'll get some disagreements
different people on different visits or
different things awesome that's
brilliant
that means that you've seen you've
actually uncovered one of the things
that could be a problem for you when you
do the development work later
you'll get a whole bunch of pain points
and that is also a wonderful thing to
get because it's the pain point you're
looking for remember if you fix users
pain points they will love you they will
love you and I was saying you want to do
this in a way that reduces bias the way
we're reducing bias is by having
multiple different people go out so they
all might have some individual bias but
it kind of cancels out when they all
come back together as long as you don't
have some kind of groupthink team bias
that you all have okay and hopefully
that's not a problem the other thing you
want to do is see as long as at this
point you're still focusing on the
problem and you're not trying to focus
on the solutions yet the bias won't come
out okay because you're keeping focused
on what the users problem is you're
still talking about the user and by
using the user as your focal point it
stops all those arguments about what I
think we should do this what I think we
should do that you're still talking
about the user you're still talking
about data now we need to turn that into
product ideas how do we do that well we
write scenarios you might be familiar
with use cases now this is kind of like
use cases it's said typically with the
use cases it says the user does this I
like to say a specific user I like to at
this point have these these personas
these group these users we cared about
them like to talk about it in their
terms okay when you went out on the site
visits you would have had a goal for
what you wanted to observe something
which was the kind of work that you
think your application is going to
assist with now you've seen what people
do in the real world you can write
scenarios which would make this better
make the real world situation ideal you
don't want to describe UI you don't want
to say while Fred comes to my
application he clicks on the login
button after he types in his username
and password he sees a screen with five
fields on it the first field is this the
second fit that's not what we're doing
what we might say in a scenario instead
is after Fred logs in he's presented
with an area where he can customize his
information so and that would be
sufficient for our scenario
the other thing we want to make sure is
that we understand what the outcomes are
let me show you that in a more visual
way so here is a little thumbnail
persona of somebody this was created in
maybe 10 15 minutes based on the
information from the site visits here
are some stickies which say more about
who this person is let me read some of
them to you she's a college student
she's a daddy's girl you know what that
means it's like she gets daddy to patent
to buy things for her by being wrong
she's a first time car buyer this task
is around buying cars she's an active
social participant in her college she
likes to make her own decisions so
that's some of the things about her so
that's the persona that's the person
we're creating it for then the scenario
is she told her dad that she needs and
she wants a new car
she asked her dad for advice but she
wants to make the decision herself her
dad recommended multiple sites to her
that she could go and check out cars on
she posts on Facebook and Twitter asking
for suggestions about a cute new car so
that's that's the level that our
scenarios are let me show you another
one
I was written by another team who were
doing a similar kind of thing so here's
their persona this is Bob and he's
actually he's a pricing mercenary that's
what they called him a pricing mercenary
he's the kind of person wants to beat
down people on prices in America when
you buy a car you don't pay the price it
says on the car the idea is it's like a
game between you and the salesperson to
see how far down you can beat them and
how far up they can get you yeah it's a
good keep waste of time it's not a game
you want to pay if you play if you have
a foreign accent then you buy your cars
on the internet right yes believe me
I've been there several times Bob is
savvy and knows how much he wants to
spend he goes out and gets the minimum
requirement from his son he's buying a
car for his son he browses multiple
sites magazines consumer reports
articles on his own once he's got the
results once he's resolute in his opt-in
his options Bob and his son go and test
drive some cars so you know we're going
through the process at the end it's he's
presented with an opportunity to this is
this is what their thing was about
offended with an opportunity to leave a
review and this is what their goal is at
the end they didn't really carry out the
part car buying process they cared about
the leaving the review part of it
because they actually the business
reason for this is if they have more
reviews they're a better sight for
people to use to choose cars from so
their goal of business goal is to get
people to leave reviews but how do you
do that so this is what this scenario is
all about okay so we end up with some
scenarios and that's now describing our
ideal behavior we've not drawn a UI yet
so now you need to draw some UI and we
use the term called of design charrette
now Charette means carriage this wood
comes from 19th century France probably
from the occulted bow art where the
students would be coming into the
college in the morning in the back of
the the chariot across the cobblestones
still doing their homework that I needed
to hand in to their professors and so
it's like yeah we see the Lubell shows
Kirk okay my friends not so good yeah
Haggar day oh no oh I see look poopoo PN
so in the back of the carriage okay your
French is worse than my friends okay
good the what they're doing is they're
having conversations about their
drawings that they're doing and saying
what mine is the best
no mine is the best and they're they're
all pulling off of each other and
drawing off of each other to get the
best idea okay let me describe that in
words for you
what you do is you choose one of the
scenarios that you've just written out
you get every team member individually
to sketch a solution now you don't have
to be a good good artist to do this you
can draw it as a screen design you can
draw it as a storyboard you can draw it
however you want as long as you could
hold it up in front of everybody else
and say this is what I think should
happen okay then you get together as a
group and everybody presents to the
group then you can either just
say yes I think it's a good idea no I
don't think it's a good idea and you can
vote on them or you can use Doc voting
who knows what doc voting is okay for
the rest of you it's this idea of either
taking little stickies or having a pen
and you have say you had ten different
designs ten different people had done
designs maybe every person would have
maybe four dots and they could use all
four dots on one design if they wanted
to they could use two dots in two
different designs or they could spread
the dots out however they wanted to at
the end what you end up with is these
designs on the wall and everybody's
walked along put their dots where they
want them and you can see very visually
very easily which were the designs that
people thought were the most appropriate
designs okay and you're doing this in
your team so there might be some
discussion around it too much fine as
long as at the end you either do another
round of this so that everybody has
another chance to draw things having
learned things from each other remember
the people in the back of the carries
saying Oh mine is the best no mine is
the best because of this oh well in that
case I might draw that in mine mine's
even better yeah so maybe you do another
round or maybe if you if you don't have
very much time you just say okay great
thanks for all the input we'll take the
input and now we'll go off and maybe a
smaller group of people the ones who
actually do the design work what I will
say is if there's somebody on the team
who actually knows something about
design heuristics you can also use this
as an opportunity to train or to teach
people on the team about good design as
a link down here remember these slides
will be available to you afterwards it's
a link down here to jakob nielsen's ten
usability heuristics it's funny I'm
still plugging my old boss so if you use
these it's a good way of teaching your
team about some of the basics of design
and usability if you're not a usability
expert it might be more difficult to
bring that in and maybe you just want to
stick to the stuff at the top here okay
here's some people doing a design
charrette here's some people doing some
drawings here's a storyboard look at
this this is a piece of paper which is
already set out with storyboard places
for people to fill in here's one that
set out with iPad templates so that if
you're doing an iPad solution that you
could easily just draw in on the
template screens here's one set out with
iPhone templates so if you were just
doing an iPhone these things are
available free online smash
magazine did a collation of them a while
back so they're all available to you and
here's the actual Charette so here's
somebody saying well here's my idea and
everybody else is looking at it then
later on they'll vote on it and in fact
you might have noticed a couple of
slides back on one of the scenario ones
it actually dot voted on the scenarios
that they were interested in - so you
saw some little sticky notes on there
it's actually on certain areas it's like
well this part of the idea is a really
cool piece everybody agreed that that
was a cool piece so that's the design
charrette I'm zooming through this my
email address is gonna be on the last
slide and if you actually want to go off
and do this yourselves which I encourage
you to do send me an email and we can
discuss it in more detail but I'm
zooming through it because they don't
give as much time for these things so
now you need to build a paper prototype
how much time I've got left 15 whoa if
let's say 10 you need to build a paper
prototype this is where you're starting
to say well why don't I just code it now
right no that would be missing the point
the point is we still don't know what we
want to code and yes you're all awesome
mega coders and you could code it in 10
seconds flat
you've probably code it in less time
it's gonna take us to put it together as
a paper prototype but the problem is ok
little discussion for a bit into a story
I presented at the PDC in LA in 2003
this is the the professional developers
conference for Microsoft and I wasn't
doing this presentation but then one of
my bosses was doing a presentation on
what Windows Vista was going to look
like and he did the presentation using
flash yeah and this was before there was
any code and so everybody walked out of
that session thinking that the UI was
already built and that they could take
it home with him that day and start
building things in Windows Vista
it wasn't built if you start building
code for these prototypes you or
somebody else in the organization is
going to say great you've finished but
you haven't because this is just the
start this is just the start yeah well
this is what we're going to do in a
minute we're going to use it for a
usability session we're gonna do user
validation and the problem with that is
users that respond differently if you've
got code they think it's finished they
don't give you the same kind of feedback
I've worked out that I've I've actually
observed more than 2,000 users of the
course of my career professors probably
more like 3,000 now and I know that they
behave differently when you give them
real code than they do when you give
them paper to play with when it's paper
they'll actually even take it and draw
on it and say no that's not what I was
thinking I think it should be like this
which may be useful maybe not useful to
you but they're responding differently
to it it's not like they're gonna take a
pen to the screen and say no it should
look like this it should look like this
yeah they're not gonna do that and at
this point that's what you want you want
interaction with them so before we get
to user testing it we need to build it
you've got some UI sketches now you need
to turn them into something a bit more
real but not that real the way that I
would suggest you do this is to be as
minimalist as possible only build the UI
elements that you mentioned in your
scenarios that are necessary completely
necessary to make this work no tools
options no nice-to-haves
no visual decoration just the pieces you
absolutely need to make it work the
Minimum Viable Product okay you're
familiar with these terms you're just
not familiar with hearing them in this
situation but why would you build
anything other than a Minimum Viable
Product in a paper prototype if you're
going to build something if you're only
going to build a Minimum Viable Product
when you actually turn it into code
right make sense
and feature creep is our worst nightmare
so let's cut it out now rather than
later on the way to do this is you
actually get somebody reading through
the protist show you the scenario and
saying oh okay well that needs a piece
of interface and so we list that down
and I'm really oh here's another piece
that we need some interface for list
that down and then you literally build
each of those pieces of interface
separately let me show you separate
pieces of paper see this these are all
the interface pieces we're going to put
together to build our UI the reason for
doing this is you will be wrong your
design will be wrong you're awesome
you're wonderful you're the best
designers and developers in the world
but you will be wrong and it's much
easier to change things if you just
stuck there's some awesome glue out
there now which is post-it note glue but
with no post-it note on it and so you
can stick it onto anything and so now
you can stick these things down and then
if it's in the wrong place which it will
be you can peel it up and put it
somewhere else isn't that brilliant you
never found a use for it till now but
now you can go out and buy some and
justify buying it because you can use it
perfect so again here we've got some
different paper prototypes we've got one
here that I don't even know what this
was I think it was supposed to tell them
it was supposed me think that told
people when they were going to turn up
on mass at the dealers place to demand a
discount from the dealer if there was
five people they should be able to get a
much better price for the car if each of
them was gonna buy a car I think I'll
settle that what that one was and this
one I can't remember what that was it
doesn't matter this was interesting this
was a paper prototype where you had to
read a QR code so what did they do they
took one of these templates they cut the
middle out of it put some of that
acetate stuff in that you use for
projectors and put the QR code on it so
that when they came to do the usability
test the person who was doing it held up
this thing as if it was the real one
pushed the button and then it read the
QR code
okay you don't think that's cool I think
that's really cool the people doing the
usability test completely understood
what it was
okay even though it's a piece of paper
with some acetate in it they completely
understood what the interaction would be
in real life oh so this would be if I
was going to the car because in because
they have details stuck in the driver's
side window in the car so you could walk
up to the car you could push the button
on your phone and it would tell you
about that car and maybe more than what
the dealer would tell you it would tell
you other things that but what other
people thought about that car for
instance okay so actually very cool to
be able to mock it up with just a piece
of paper and some acetate here's some
more these are see how it's all
individual pieces that way when the user
says what I want to sort this by a
different order you can go oh okay yeah
dynamic prototype mm-hm
and we did some very wrong things with
this and it was very easy to just swap
it around so that's how you build your
prototype why are you building the
prototype several reasons one it gets it
set in your head how it's going to be
but then you can go off and usability
test it there's no point building code
because you're gonna throw this the
prototype away so use the paper it's
amazing how good people are at playing
let's pretend we used to play this one
we were children didn't we we should
play let's pretend all the time what
adults can do it to and they actually
enjoy doing it you did warm bodies yeah
your users don't have to be
representative users at this point
because your prototype isn't a
representative prototype your prototype
isn't real so for instance I was doing a
study recently while I was doing some
work with a group who were building
something for hotel managers and for
this first round of prototyping that we
did we just used people from around
their office
who'd stayed in hotels before not at all
representative not something I'd want to
do later on in the process but because
we're being scrappy and fast and because
this is very early it was enough just to
know if it would work if people in
general could move through the interface
later on as we've got to higher fidelity
prototypes and to real code we'd want to
get to higher fidelity users and real
users
understand make sense good you want to
give your people tasks to perform with
this you don't want to just show them
perfect I would say well what do you
think of this do you like this bit do
you like this what do you think could
you use this you could use this right
you could use this right mm-hmm what
would that be an example of a leading
question instead of even asking them
questions what we do is we say can you
do this task for me well where'd you get
your tasks from well guess what you've
already got them because you wrote
scenarios the only thing you have to
make sure is that the tasks you give
your users don't use the same words that
you've used in your UI because otherwise
all people are doing is pattern matching
right matching from the task to the UI
so find a way to input your information
there's a button on the screen says
input no no find a way to give your
information to the application it's
really bad because you have to get out
the thesaurus after a while and say okay
well what's a different word for input
it's hard but you can do it rest of the
team can sit and watch again not too
many people it gets really freaky you've
got ten people they're going waiting for
this person and and and you'll notice
I've got this little thing up here
saying run a user test I had to put down
here because you guys might have got the
wrong end of the stick no you wouldn't
other people on your team might have got
rung under the stick users are testing
the prototype you are not testing your
users if your users feel like they're
being tested you've done something wrong
they're helping you test the prototype
they've become a member of the team for
10 seconds to help you out okay if they
feel like it's a test of them you're
doing something wrong at the end you
want to say thank you how can you say
thank you in the US we tend to give
people Starbucks gift certificates or
movie tickets to fuckers or if you've
got I mean think about when if you're an
exhibitor at this conference what on
earth you're gonna do with all those
t-shirts after if you haven't given them
all away by the end of the conference
perfect reward for taking part in a user
study yeah yeah you'll have a list of
issues after your prototype fix them
retest afterwards this is why you put
all the pieces the prototype down in
separate places you can peel them up put
them somewhere else you can draw new
ones on there whatever it takes and this
is one place where you don't have to be
completely rigorous if you've had three
users come through and they all have the
same problems don't go and test two more
users just to see that they had the same
problems to fix it fix it okay it's all
very much like the wizard in The Wizard
of Oz pay no attention to the man behind
the curtain
what you do is you have one person who's
handing the use of the task and
interacting with them you have another
person who's being the computer right
and they've got all these pieces of
paper and they move the things around so
when the user says the user has a pen
and that's their Mouse okay and so if
they have to put type some into a field
they actually write it in the field you
might want to stick little bits of
sticky note on there so that they can
write on that and you can peel it off
and then you've got the same prototype
for the next person and they point using
their pen and that's their mouse and
then when they point they say I'd click
this button then the computer goes okay
I've got a piece of paper with a piece
of paper they put it down you might at
the beginning have to say my computer's
a bit old it's not even a pentium class
computer it doesn't work very quickly
but you know and actually what we have
done sometimes is we've even had a
little hourglass that we put down on the
page while we were finding the next
piece or specifically if we didn't have
the next piece of paper as like oh sure
okay but that's an idea opportunity
that's how you could say well what would
you expect to see now yeah and you're
getting input from your users you're
getting input now I will let you write
code now you may write code please think
about this sensibly why would you have
people wasting time developers how many
developers in the room
okay now leave your handle cheese okay
leave your hand up if you like doing
rework you sir are a freak no you might
be in a TDD environment or something
like that but it was still like okay no
no it's not right not this kind of
rework okay especially not in the UI
level why don't we get it right for
time in a cheap way developers you are
the probably one of the most expensive
employees in the organization I don't
want to waste your time you may pursue
you may start perceiving this as a waste
of your time but I'm telling you what
this makes you into smarter developer
this allows you to how much how much of
the interface even if it's specified to
some level of detail how much of the
interface is actually specified
beforehand and how much do you make up
as you're going along a large proportion
of it you make up as you're going along
so who's gonna help you do that well you
are now because now you have more of an
understanding of what it is your users
are trying to achieve so when you have
to make up that piece of code for that
piece of interface you'll do it you're
much more likely to do it away that will
work for your users in a way that they
will want to come and hug you and kiss
you well actually looking around this
room maybe not so much but but you get
the idea
remember developers you will be busy
during this whole time you will be going
on the site visits you will be doing the
design charrette so you will be doing
the study you will be watching the
studies I'd love it if you actually were
the moderator for the study or at least
the computer for the study okay because
it's important that you feel this pain
firsthand that you develop the humility
that you need okay if you if there are
some developers out there who you feel
would actually be more harmful than
doing good by being allowed out in front
of users there's always some back-end
work they can do all right but how many
times have you even been in the position
where you've done back-end work which
you've had to redo because the interface
needed it to work a different way I mean
even just like what are the key fields
in your tables and stuff like that it
can change depending on how users think
of the world
what's the hierarchy we're gonna use
what's the what's what's the information
architecture we're going to use it
change it depending on how users think
of the world so it's better that you're
doing this stuff than anything else okay
what do we do we went and found some
users to watch we did some some mapping
of what they told us to interpret it
without bias we made some scenarios so
we were creating product ideas we turn
the scenarios into designs with our
designs charettes
then we did some user testing which is
awesome fun
is really good doing user testing it
really is it becomes almost like I've
had people taking bets about whether a
thing is gonna work on our right in user
testing it's a good thing or a bad thing
I don't know it's kind of cool it shows
a level of investment that people have
in the code were in in the paper
prototype working or not okay so these
were the benefits remember what I said
it's a great bonding exercise you can
see how that's gonna gonna happen now
you view as a whole team you do all this
work now when you have a feature that
you're developing the future you can say
remember when we did that visit and we
saw that thing and there's other people
say oh yeah and it helps you because
you've got a common language a common
understanding it is cheap yes you're
pulling everybody from the team into a
room for a week but you're saving so
much time down the road down the road
really you are it's easy to interpret
the results you get back from this stuff
because you're talking about users users
behaviors and as long as you keep
talking about the behaviors rather than
what that means you can easily turn that
into product and like I said having that
real data means less arguments or at
least it means more productive arguments
which finish faster yeah okay thank you
very much
so any any questions any questions yes
how would you test knowledge so if we're
doing a revolutionary product rather
than a an evolutionary product to a
tacit knowledge and the kind of stuff
that how'd you get to knowing what it is
that you should be building yeah how'd
you get this right right so so your
users are doing one thing because
they've got an existing system but you
want to build something completely
different
well you still want an the thing that
doesn't change is the behaviors or at
least their goals right they still need
to produce a thing or they need to feel
a way about a thing or whatever it is
that's the same so I'd say it's even
more important to watch what people are
doing now in that situation so you can
see broken broken broken broken okay fix
fix fix fix wonderful new revolutionary
product okay it's how you fix it that's
the problem it's the difference and
that's up to you being a creative team
but the thing that you've jumped started
with this is you've got the crib
you've got the input for your creativity
in a way that you didn't have it before
before you were relying on second-hand
knowledge and you were relying on what
the system looks like today now you're
relying on how users work how users
behave how users talk to you about
things so you've got their vocabulary
that they use as well and now you can
start thinking about it differently if
an example of doing this yeah I don't
like using this example idea of the
design company there's the shopping cart
fiasco it's that they've got this video
to type into Google I do shopping cart
video as in shopping cart thing you push
around they redesigned a shopping cart
and they did it by going out and
observing the interest in think the
reason I don't like using this example
is because you never see the shopping
cart they designed which was this
revolutionary new design because I don't
know why it kind of looks cool but I
don't think they actually did the final
round of sort of user validation they
should have done or or at least they
didn't have all the stakeholders in the
room because it may be the people who
make shopping carts although the stores
don't use it don't like them I don't
know but they used this process they
came up with something revolutionary as
a result like I said not the best
example because you don't see it in real
world but you can using this process
actually makes it easier to be
revolutionary rather than harder yeah
other questions yeah
yes you can
but how much do you prefer being in the
room with somebody rather than a Skype
call with somebody yeah yeah so you can
do it remotely but here's the problem
you will lose much of the fidelity one
of the things I love about doing a site
visit is what you see okay so for
instance the post-it note with the steps
on it for the process that people can
never remember how to do it so you say
you tell me more about that person oh oh
yeah so many times I forget what to do
so I had to write a post-it note for
myself to remember it or you you look up
the list of phone numbers so here's an
example I'm working with a different
hotel client they were saying we went
out and did some visits with people who
were the who owned the management
companies that manage hotels in a
franchise chain we were saying well how
did you get your information because
they wanted them to get it through an
intranet
you know it was an extranet kind of
thing and so he pulls out of his pocket
a piece of paper and it's got ten phone
numbers written on it three of them are
crossed out because as people have left
the organization he says well I start
with this person and if they don't know
the answer I go to this person right
those of you working on intranet you're
going yes
yeah would I have got to that if I was
doing it over a Skype call maybe maybe
not so by having that you've reduced the
ecological validity to use the
psychological term you've reduced the
impact of being in the same location as
your user and seeing what's around them
there's this thing where you can see if
somebody sitting down they've got a
certain amount of space they can reach
while they're still sitting down the
things in that space of the things they
use very frequently when they stand up
there's more space they can reach the
things in that space of stuff they use
occasionally then they've got filing
systems well where's the help manual for
your system as somewhere in here I know
I put it in here sometime I'd actually
use the help menu I used the manual from
the training but I can't seem to find
that because I lent it to Fred last week
you learn so much about things by being
in the same location that I think it's
worth traveling and I've actually
convinced teams to spend the budget to
travel and they've said I'm glad we did
that because subsequently they learned a
lot more than they would have done if
they had stayed away the other problem
with doing it remotely is if you've got
end-user customers some of them may not
be sufficiently sophisticated to set up
stuff on their end yeah that's it time
if anybody has questions that are come
see me afterwards if you have questions
about if you want to do this is my email
there's my Twitter handle but I don't
tweet very much so don't expect me to
read it send me email</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
