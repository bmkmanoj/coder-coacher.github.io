it's a new generation of programmers
isn't it as old haggled programmers can
we go to a go to conference a go to
conference maybe ASCO sub conference
most you don't even understand this do
you most you don't even get that goto is
considered harmful oh dear dear dear how
words get recycled welcome to my talk
there we are the end of projects and
what happens next most your work on
projects don't you even know what
project is I suspect not a spectrum of
you in forever surprise the end of
projects and what happens next
this often goes by the hashtag no
projects we tried using the hashtag be
beyond projects for a while that uses
four extra letters in Twitter that's a
lot of real estate it's an idea that was
kind of brewing in my mind and the color
guys who deserves some credit Joshua
Arnold and Steve Smith and between us we
all kind of came to the conclusion that
project as conceived by organizations
are wrong and don't work and the
interesting thing is they kept the kind
of angle that Steve Smith came from when
Joshua all all came from Ikea we're all
kind of slightly different they all kind
of complemented each other I'm the one
who picked up the baton and I'm probably
best known for running with it these
days and there's a lot of their thinking
in this presentation a lot of their that
their ideas in here and I long ago
stopped knowing which bit was mine and
which bit was Steve's and which bit was
Josh's and yeah anyway and if if you if
you not met me before I know some of you
had the bad look to have me inside your
companies that I might do ever called
and I'm Alan Kelly I'm really a writer
I'd like nothing more than sit at home
with my keyboard and write books but you
might have heard that doesn't pay the
bill
with maybe paydays mortgage but doesn't
pay my mortgage so I get out into the
wide world and I do training courses for
people and sometimes hit skills matter
doing training courses and I do
consulting I don't use the word agile
coach because they what most agile
people call coaching is giving advice
and actual people pay me for they value
what in my head they don't value for me
for being a marriage counselor so I'm an
oculus Alton to sort that's my original
book which are a fairly deep look at
learning and knowledge and how it maps
into agile better that's the hard core
book on the software business hardly
mentions agile at all and that's the
book what I wrote accidentally recently
in the last couple of years and that's
the same book there's different covers
sampan my hybrid extreme programming
Kanban is a book I wrote using a system
called lean pub how many of you know
lean pub know if you try writing a book
with lean pub you write a bit and you
post it up on lean pub and if people
like it they get it they even pay your
money for you can even charge you can
write you have to back a whole chaps you
can have a few pages and you can put it
on sale and if people like it and you're
motivated you can write a few more pages
and a few more pages you can add a
chapter and a chapter after not friends
of mine usually and probably recommended
it and because I've written books I just
can't cure so I started playing around
with it and posting some stuff up there
and you know what people bought it now
we talked a lot about feedback in agile
but you know what the best feedback is
money money is the best feedback you
know this when you go for your
performance review and your manager says
what a great job you've done both for
kicks a hard time for the bank and
there'll be no bonus this year right and
when you get money as feedback its
information the amount of money you get
the fact that somebody is deciding not
to buy cinema tickets they are giving
you money that is feedback and when you
get that kind of feedback you you you
you okay doesn't pay my mortgage you
know I've got a slush fund and PayPal of
a few hundred doll
I'm buying software from the US I might
use it doesn't pay the mortgage but it
tells me people value this stuff this is
a problem and this book and lien pub
kind of summarized it I can write
chapters and I can sell and people keep
buying it when am I done well am I
finished these books had I had a formal
contact with the publisher and it laid
out a table of content and it laid out
an end date and they laid out some other
details - didn't say what had to be in
the books I had to write the books to
know what would be in the book but we
had a formal contact most people who
write books I'm reliably told extend
their deadline and miss their deadlines
and my wife once said to me I think
you'll be the only author whoever
finishes before the deadline I laughed I
mentioned this to my publisher and she
said you know what I think she's right I
had within the deadline I didn't finish
guy reached the deadline I finished
because I'd written everything I wanted
to write I've done the table of content
I was done both those books that's a
project you are done because you've hit
the deadline there's no more time you
had done because you've done everything
on your list
yeah in a world where people keep
thinking of changing new ideas changing
requirements the things we used to
resist in the old days by now shall we
embrace change and we take on all of
your quirements in a world where we're
valuing those requirements and you're
doing the highest priority wants the
highest valuable ones and they keep
coming in and you keep doing that
highest value and you keep earning more
money in your basement
and in a world where you're releasing
every two weeks every two days every two
minutes maybe when are you done on what
criteria would you say you are done I
could write and I could add more to this
book and I could get more money
maybe I'm a dick chapter and I tweeted
it I knew a few more people would buy it
and because it's digital
all the people have bought it before get
the latest copy there's no need for them
to wait until I've finished you can get
some and you can read it and if there's
a new copy you're going email telling
you to update your Kindle or your iPad
whatever
when are you done when is that book done
I got bored of writing it so I decided
to call it done at that stage I had to
invoke a batch process called a copy
editor I had to pay somebody to come and
copy I did my work and which is good I I
called it done and I put in for a print
on demand publisher and it sat there for
six months and then I decided I wanted
to actually make it available on Amazon
if you don't make available on Amazon
blah blah blah I better have a proper
cover so recently I paid someone to pick
you some cover for me
another bit of a batch process and if
you buy the physical copy you can buy
the physical copy if you're lucky you
can even beg this off me at the end if
you want a physical copy I cannot date
it but if you buy the lean pub version
look I've told about updates it will get
updated and they'll get change not very
we are getting now occasion I change
something these days I'm on to zamp and
to the next edition projects problem
number one the benefits anyone recognize
this anyone do project manager training
this is how we judge the success of a
project on schedule on budget on quality
quality and features gets mixed up
because there are some people in this
world who believe quality's a dial on
the wall and when you dial it down you
go faster doesn't apply in software if
you know somebody who believes they're
doing lower quality and software the way
of going faster they don't belong in our
industry in quality if y'all go faster
you dial it up so project managers talk
about quality we usually mean features
yeah we judge project success on these
three criteria do you see the problem
where is the money
are you judged on today to a budget
quality when you take when you at the
end of the month when you go home you
think I'm not very much to my pay packet
but you know why I finished a month I
schedule yeah we are in business to make
money okay some of you do open source
momusu you're in business to make money
where's the money where's the value
where's the benefit if your success
criteria are shared your budget and cost
where's the money
underlying the project model are some
assumptions assumption one the valuable
not the value is known before we begin
the project we know how much value we're
going to get the second is there's no
valuable in flexibility if you
doing a project and you start to see
there's something over there that it's
more valuable if you see there's some
other requirements over here you're
supposed to do what's over here if you
say I'll do the valuable thing and you
don't do the thing you were supposed to
do you could do a load of really
valuable stuff but you'd still fail
because you've not done the stuff you
were supposed to do these are two really
big assumptions that underlie the
project model and the problem is they
don't hold in software development
requirements change the world changes we
are in the center of the city when the
center the banking community could you
imagine if on what September the 13th
2008 what you've gone home you had the
perfect project you had the perfect plan
you had the perfect people everything
was in place to do the perfect project
you in home on September the 13th 2008
it was all perfect 9 o'clock Monday
morning you're going to do a preppy
project right the world changed didn't
it on Sunday evening when Lehman
Brothers when our business
how many banking project looked the same
on that Monday morning as they did on
the Friday the world changes and we
can't stop it capers Jones if you not
come across him he's an American who
spent most last 40 or 50 years analyzing
software projects used to work for IBM
and he came up with his figure in his
book in the u.s. requirements change at
the rate of 2% per month you got a
hundred page requirements document those
written a year ago 24% changed or rather
think of your mortgage compound interest
applies that's actually a change of
about 27 percent you got a hundred page
document and it was written a year ago
27 percent of that document needs to be
thrown away it's the longer you spend
writing that document before you start
cutting code the more it's going to
change because the clock starts when you
start writing the document not when you
start writing code gets worse this is
getting a little bit old now but I'm a
short I could find similar surveys
because they similar things survey of IT
directors and managers from 2006 from
Cranfield
our survey said 70% of these managers
believe they're failing to identify
and quantify benefits adequately 70% of
IT managers 38% admit openly overstating
the benefits and also obtain funding I
know you wouldn't do this but if you
work with somebody who does you could be
stupid not to do it yourself because if
this guy over here keeps exaggerating
his benefits and his projects keep
getting funded and yours don't yeah
you'd be silly not to join him and start
faking it to 38 percent openly admit how
many would admit you behind closed doors
after a couple of beers I wonder just
worse 80 percent report review and
evaluation X face it to many of us just
miss evaluation altogether evaluation is
the feedback step that is missing in
most software development projects
remember I said about feedback money
being the best feedback if people buy
this I'll do some more that old I'll
throw it away how many of you actually
look at what you've delivered and see if
it makes a difference it's very easy for
doing some makes a great big website you
can see sales or hips or something if
you're doing an internal corporate IT
project how do you know people are using
your software review and evaluation
inadequate but why is this due to the
focus on achieving cost time quality and
not on whether intended benefits by
going after cost time quality etc we're
doing something that psychologists call
goal displacement rather than facing up
to the hard facts that the work you're
doing is useless and no one will ever
use it you keep pursuing cost and
benefit or cost and schedule and that
and yeah drives me mad show me the money
so look the original version are no
projects talk I can slag off projects
and I tried to over time put in a few
suggestions for improvement here
solutions that might help you number one
is very simple stop looking at those
criteria and start focusing on the
benefits start rating your projects on
are they delivering benefits what is the
aim
goal not scheduled and course and all
the other rubbish yes ask not
when will the software be done but ask
when will the software next deliver
value and if you set yourself up a nice
continuous delivery pipeline then
hopefully the answer is going to be a
couple of hours maybe you're not that
good yet few days okay
when will we next get value when will we
not get benefit from this this software
development we remember benefit is not
always value there can be benefits other
than financial benefits if you're in an
NGO you're in a charity or smell a cool
value just make something easier but
other things are applicable when we you
next get value when we do not get
benefit not when will it be done because
done with my book done done is a
meaningless concept what's that just
think it's just stream of value the
value just keeps on coming this means
you've got to change your governance if
you work in an organization does
portfolio management of some kind of
governance you've got a problem because
the most governance is based on project
management criteria are you on the
schedule are you on the cost are you all
are we ten percent done twenty percent
who cares if it's really valuable it'll
keep on giving so you've got a change of
governance systems you need to say what
have you delivered for me lately what
have you given me what value what
benefit and can you prove it not just
we've delivered two thousand lines of
code valueless hey I'm Kevin Leone says
code is not an asset code is a liability
functionality is an asset so this means
you need to change how you do portfolio
review I think portfolio review and
governance should be like Dragons Den
the the product owner and maybe one
techie walk into the room and in front
of the portfolio review committee and
they sit there and they think why should
we give you more money for your project
why should we keep your team working
what would have you done posed lately
and you have to answer them and you take
questions and if they like it they give
you some more money they allow you to
increase the team size or if they don't
like it they reduce your cut you off
make portfolio review iterative and make
it like Dragons Den get interactive yes
just fix schedules Finch it to fixed
schedules for portfolio review now this
gated process where the project managers
oh we're not ready to go to a stage gate
yet we haven't finished doing something
or other therefore we'll delay it delay
delay delay strip out the delays from
your system if you're not ready to go to
a stage gate because you're not ready
you failed it yeah where we go this is
the second big problem software isn't
temporary software doesn't stop if
people use your software they will want
changes if people use your software
they'll have ideas and saying don't want
to hear where your word isn't a good
thing because you're blocking off the
value and if you'll use your software
and it's useful they'll want it updating
because technology changes I know some
of you still support XP and ie6 but most
software's been ported on to more modern
platforms only dead software stops
changing and I can prove this the first
time I did this talk was getting on for
two years ago now January last year I
went to SourceForge and I looked for
some open-source projects moodle's
really big popular learning management
system the week before I did this check
it have had 23,000 downloads that sounds
like useful software to me people see
value people are getting it and it just
had a code update three days before
coding and use proceeded together
there's a thing called web talent I
haven't got a clue what it is it's a
Python written in Python for BitTorrent
library zero downloads and guess what no
one had changed the code for nine months
pear Lord whatever that is zero
downloads no code changes for 18 months
if your code doesn't change
people aren't valuing it people aren't
asking for things if people value your
product they will want changes and you
will want to change and improve your
product if they use it it will change
only dead software stops changing
unfortunately dead software is what
object managers are trained to achieve
end dates cause more problems end dates
reduce quality because you know a
technical death stuff you've been
wrestling with the last few months and
you really want to refactor and fix
since the end date is coming up I will
leave her and also the team are supposed
to be dispersed at the end of a project
so you're all the knowledge goes poof
away
it also means we consider late-breaking
requirements inferior if I gather all of
your requirements over here and I write
them down laborious ly for six months
and I get them approved and while the
guys over here comes in the next day and
says you know what I just occurred to me
we need to have it read there's a lot of
value in doing a Manchester United
website in red sorry you've passed a
cut-off gate you've cut some stage gate
and we automatically consider late
requirements be less valuable why is
that yeah intuitively I get a feeling
that requirements movie hours later on
may well be worth more because now you
understand what you're doing and the
things you've now built and perhaps the
things you've talked about and now
people thought about some more
late-breaking requirements may be
inherently more valuable but the project
model says they're late I keep saying
the project mala keeps track of project
managers let's not be unfair to them
many of you have never seen this before
if you're hard core developing you might
get surprised so a project this is what
our project managers are trained in this
is what our organizations agree on this
is a mental model of project management
a project is a temporary organization
that is needed piece unique and
predefined outcome with predetermined
resources constants and temporary
organization yeah maybe your team is
temporary or maybe it's not tempura both
our problems and here's the American
version project management institute
same kind of idea a project is defined
by two key characteristics temporary I
think generally the the it's the the
temporary nature although it's not
clearing these definitions it comes out
as having an end date and I
say X perhaps the defining feature of a
project now we have a problem which I'll
come onto in a few minutes about
language here when a project manager
says project he is picking up his prints
to his PMI Bible and when he says
project he means this for many of you a
project is a thing you open in Eclipse a
project is a set of files for many of
you a project is just this Cistus thing
the idea there has an end date I have
had developers of previous conferences
who've seen this presentation they've
come to me afterwards and said I didn't
know that what project was think about
it if your project manager is thinking
this and your thing something completely
different you aren't going to get on
you're gonna have disagreements software
development and project management to
match made in hell software is here
forever will hopefully have ever many
software projects go away but they're
dead
yeah project management is about
managing the temporary this may seem
like I'm speaking linguistic hairs here
but remember the project manages a
trained in list of they are measured
when they do prints to and PMI
qualification tests this is what they're
tested on now maybe the your
organization doesn't really run projects
like that
but that's how it we could project
managers you'd find getting a project
you forget a job in this square mile is
a project manager without a print store
PMI certificate you'll find it tough you
might get job as a scrum master blocks
another story isn't these rational end
dates and we talk about end data and
they tend end end dates and capers Jones
has something to say about this as well
more than half large projects they have
predetermined end dates selected which
is forced on the project by an arbitrary
decree that wouldn't happen in the UK
with it nobody come on oh yeah you know
what I actually don't think this is a
problem I'm all for end dates which come
from arbitrary decrees and more from
deadlines particular those two week
sprint iteration deadlines
I'm all for deadlines I'm just not for
end dates we as humans are very good at
working to end dates and we can harness
a factory harness we working
and daily stand-ups and things like that
we can harness that benefit of end dates
oh sorry we can harness the benefit of
deadlines in your own language may stop
here we can harness the deadline effect
but the end date end dates induce bad
thinking they say oh we don't need to
improve this code over here because the
project will be over
although grab behind this project is
another one and look the solution here
is dead simple work to the business
deadline when the business come to you
and say we want all of this how long
will it take you to produce this just
say no you say to them when do you want
it by we could take the same demand
suppose them spoke we wanted to set up
an an e an online shop so if we're gonna
sell things we're gonna sell things for
Christmas I say to these guys my budgets
a million pound kept in a drawer with a
project plan and tell me when it would
be done if we have a shop by Christmas
million pounds I don't plan and I say to
these guys over here I want to have a
shop for Christmas I've not got very
much budget and I'd really like you to
be up by this Christmas I bet we get two
very different solutions wouldn't we the
end date is just another engineering
criteria another engineering constraint
most of you are engineers you work
within constraints you work within the
fact they are working on ARM processors
perhaps you work within the fact that
your shop is a Python shop perhaps you
work within a whole bunch of constraints
the end date is another one whether your
solution is a fantasy UI or website or
an iPhone app or command-line interface
you can change these things you can
think about what solution can you build
in that time and it may be you build a
rough thing a minimal effort product
let's be honest minimal effort not
minimal Viable Product those words are
abuse a minimal ethic product right now
and later on we'll build some more
effort product and some more effort
product and keep on building it do good
work within the constraints with the
business say gee I must have this as
soon as possible well if the business
that I must have this yesterday you have
to say what is the value of this what is
the value of you having this tomorrow
you wanted this yesterday how much does
a value yesterday
million-pound yesterday's gone and we
don't have a TARDIS so we've blown a
million pound oh dear nothing we can do
about it
if the value tomorrow is half a million
pound if we can get something out the
door today we can have a half a million
pound tomorrow maybe in a week's time
the value is four hundred thousand pound
maybe in a month's time the value is
three hundred thousand pound you know
that time and value are intertwined in
all sorts of interesting ways it's not a
question of how long will it take it's a
question of how valuable is it if you
have it at different times and does that
value change if the value doesn't change
at all with time I think sure do a great
big traditional project but if you find
that the value declines over time then
think about what you can engineer to
capture some other value now deadlines
good end dates bad end dates lead to all
sorts of engineering compromises we
don't want to make temporary
organizations the most destructive idea
in software development you know you
know you know you work for big corporate
they get a load of people in this take
some people from other parts of the
company they hire some contractors they
do all this work and the project
managers know it's a temporary
organization so come the end date
goodbye contractors go back to every
week root mean take you so you call
crawled out of permease finds me else to
do it or you can't find something I
would bear fire you then all that
knowledge goes the knowledge is in your
head doesn't matter how many documents
you write you know just matter how many
documentary write the knowledge is in
your head and the more documentation you
write the more documentation won't be
read and the more expensive the project
will get when you write all the
documentation the knowledge is in your
head if you scatter that team to the
four winds you will lose that knowledge
why do you want to do that because after
all you are temporary organization you
spend all this time stormy Norman for me
before and any anyone read a bit about
teams which makes other presentations
here today
these stage is a team pass sue we're
missing one out on the end
destroying if it's a temporary
organization we're going to destroy the
team at the end now we go through
storming norming
money it only gets paid back when we do
performing and then we destroy them why
not keep the team together keep the team
together and continue to exploit that
team that team is a core resource that
team has capability that because money
so get your money's worth
keep the teams together don't destroy
performing teams if you destroy
performing teams you lose knowledge
disbanding teams capability knowledge
performance track record yeah yeah I
call it corporate psychopathy
when a company takes a performing team
and says goodbye of course one of the
problems here I was talking to some
people earlier today from a well known
bank which has an office all of about 20
yards from here and you were talking
about this you know they're sending the
two thieves in their organizations as a
team and the team does a project on the
codebase and the project ends and that
team do another project on the same code
base and that project ends and the team
does another project on the same code
base yeah they do a project and a
project and I put one project follows
the other project the team may change a
little bit but basically the same team
knew what project and certainly lacks my
experience of working in bang sucks my
experience of a lot of corporations I
even hear today about a bank here where
there's a project manager trying to
assign a say and one project one release
isn't that nice
what is it a guardian do 300 releases a
week 300 projects a week finishing at
the Guardian that's going to cause a lot
of work for project managers isn't it
don't release your staff learn to see
your team as a productive resource you
might inject different projects into the
team if you still genuinely have
temporary things the team is permanent
you bring different work to the team
does somebody want that photo did you
get it okay look this is dead simple
keep the team together
aim for continuity bring the work to the
team
look continuous flow.you heard about
that today I'm sure Dave mentioned can
I should have continuous delivery on
their wife not God continues to live
well continuous improvement
yeah oh yeah it's Friday Friday calm
down I serve a beer jet like from this
week continuous benefit continues we
hear about this all the time
agile conferences don't we you don't
hear about temporary continuous is not
temporary I take you back to the prince2
and PMI definitions prince2 and PMI tell
you how to manage temporary things do
you live in a temporary world temporary
flow no temporary improvement well it
might be for being honest but we don't
want it temporary delivery what's
temporary delivery you roll back really
quickly temporary benefits no continuous
continue continues not temporary think
of your team like a sausage machine you
keep the team together you put in pork
me to get pork sausages you're putting
chicken me you get chicken sauce you
playing horse me you get beef sausages
bring the work to the team bring the
work in they bring push something out if
you put in work a change request to
change the crest comes out you ask them
change the color website a different
color the website you hints with a
database he'll need projects you need
teams if you want to call a package of
work a project yeah and I think it Dan's
been say something about this it if you
want to consider a package of work and a
funding item as a package and call it a
project than by all means do it just
don't have a temporary organization
delivering it you have an organization
that has capability and their
capabilities center around one of your
your products one of your technologies
there's some common thing they center
around any time you may grow the team
you might shrink the team people may
join people may leave but on the whole
the team is stable you bring the
different types of work to the team ah
how are we doing on time okay we're
getting there ah 8 minutes good look
keeps him together photo actor team
small things small things this is the
problem
projects are big projects are big
packages of work big funding decisions
signed up my big man with big checkbooks
big big big you know if you're gonna if
if your project processes you've got to
go to your CEO get a project signed off
it's gonna have to be worthwhile him
getting our bet to sign off isn't it and
since he's a big man he only signs off
big things you won't put more stuff in
there and a lot of projects can end up
looking like those that legislation they
pass the American you know they call it
pork barrel politics they want to build
a new aircraft carrier but not everybody
in Congress wants to vote for new
aircraft carrier so you find a senator
here the senator from Ohio who's got a
lot of pig farmers in Ohio and the pig
farmers could do with a bear money so
right at the end of the aircraft carrier
law says we'll spend two billion
developing an aircraft carrier it says
and we'll give fifteen million to pig
farmers in Ohio this is how American
politics works all as all the bills go
through spending all this money there's
all these riders on the end called pork
and the same two of software projects
you know we made you explicitly we may
have to add some pork or it might just
be that when your business analyst comes
I said them and what do you like from
this software what you like from this
software he goes around collects that
list there's all the things that people
wanted before and haven't happened
there's all the things they think they
might want in future and they know this
thing's late-breaking requirements are
valued less than things they thought of
earlier they better put some more things
in for good fun yeah we start doing it
there big problem is software
development doesn't have economies of
scale you've all been brought up with
the economies of scale maybe hanging
more walk forward on these cars and you
all expect do when you go down to test
goes to buy milk if you buy while those
big four pint cartons of milk that's
gonna be cheaper if you buy four one
pint cartons of milk that's economy and
scale with these studied economics or
operational research that's what your
program to expect isn't it you've all
heard this a million times thing applies
you go down to Tesco's well usually
sometimes they cheat on you check the
price labels and it's true of milk if
you buy for one pint cartons of milk
it's generally more expensive than
buying one Marg carton of milk
unfortunately while this is true for
milk it's not true for software software
is best bought
small cartons you know you think about
it small user stories small teams small
developments small deliveries small
small small small comes up again and
again in software development
unfortunate projects are organized for
large in software developed we keep
going back to lots of little things
small is cheaper projects try and makers
go big we want to work in the small
software for cartons a software milk
will be cheaper than one big carton and
it reduces your risk you buy a big cart
in the software milk and a tiny bit of
it has gone off you lose the whole
carton you lose four cartons in one go
four pints in one go you buy four little
cartons of milk and little bits gone off
a little bit of that milk will blue
screen you only lose one the other three
are good suppose you do one release a
year and that release contains a book
that will blue screen your users see
every release you do blue spilling their
machine if you do one release a week and
you have one bug the blue screens the
machine a year still then you'll they
will see 51 releases the work and one
that doesn't okay
small cartons of milk are cheaper and
they reduce the risk big increases risk
ha hang on
no oh yeah yeah stop thinking big start
thinking small so I thought this this is
a slide I want it's the orders funny and
you know traditional project suppose
there's a risk we calculate this 30%
risk this project there's worth a
million so the value at risk is 300
thousand you know simple crooked
management risk calculations we could
argue with but people do do this
suppose you split into two each one
contains half of what you want each one
contains half the risk each one contains
half the value it means the value at
risk is now reduced if you keep
springing it down further you reduce it
sixty thousand at risk here as opposed
to three hundred thousand lots of little
will releases will reduce your risk and
by the way you'll probably get better at
doing releases you'll improve yourself
forget about whether you improve on are
the
just mathematically you reduce the risk
of doing these little things and each
one has a lot less risk but you will get
better you will improve your processes
you will remember to press return each
time it's what we call back size we're
not saying build this wait a long time
build this deliver this wait long time
get a lot of this saying oh hang on so
dislike no I think I played this deck I
shouldn't have this slide normally as a
counterpart with has lots of little bits
coming little bits of functionality
little bits of every little bit of money
little bits for general a little bit to
delivery slot a little bit they all add
up to the end of projects projects are
accounting codes projects are how we
account for our time for our money for
something else and nothing more nothing
less
finished software is dead software at
this point there's a project manager in
a new business somewhere coachmen just
sneaked in and he's fuming he's angry
because I have miss represented projects
because X be honest the project managers
you work with their reasonable guys they
they they don't break up teams they know
teams stay together they don't stick
stop dodging dog lead requirements
documents are not stupid they understand
a bit of value yeah and they do allow
change they do consider value to do
we're continuing alan kelly here is very
naughty because i just happen to have
taken words from the project management
textbook and use them to slack off
project managers but project managers
have reasonable people who have reached
good skills by the way i'm not well as
people who say there's no project
managers on an agile team and pet there
might be a space for a project manager i
just want to understand what they do and
where the add value because a lot of
those people who call themselves project
managers have been in our industry for
many years and they have a lot to add to
the project to the work to the thing
we're doing it's just we need to
understand where they are because i have
a think of projects its projects are the
problem not project managers many
project managers a reason well guys i'm
pet accept this but in return i would
ask what is a project if your job title
is a project man
and you don't break up teams you don't
believe in tempie organizations you
don't stick dog Lee to requirements
otherwise known as predefined
requirements predefined outcomes if
you're not sticking to them then your
prince2 definition is out the door you
appear my definitions out the door if
you do allow change you do consider
value you know you're looking you're not
looking at those success criteria I
talked about before schedule budget and
Co so what is a project if your project
manager who's reasonable is a project
and why have you got project managing
your title you know what I think
happened most you can't remembers I
think it's like Dave an anaemic remember
the 80s and the 90s and you know when we
were entering the workforce the in thing
was delayering the organization and you
saw a lot of middle managers and junior
managers being thrown out of
organizations as they all went for flat
hierarchies and we cut those layers out
I think what really happened was those
management layers we shipped out in the
90s they reformed as project managers
and they told us they were temporary
organizations need management there is
management work to do and if you're
developers only things you've got no
manager I love it my fall on you and
let's see how happy you are then so
project managers can be reasonable
people but what's the project and why
does prints to contain this definition
why is prints too misleading us and what
does a project manager actually manage
if a projects are figment of our
imagination what's a project manager
this is the third problem with projects
language when we use the word project we
mean different things when an investment
committee used the word project they're
thinking about agreeing to spend a sum
of money to try and achieve an outcome
and they're allocating money in chunks
when the project manager uses the word
project he's talking about those prints
two definitions when a software
developer uses the word project you'll
probably think about a collection of
files or maybe a file in Eclipse or an
option on a menu somewhere we mean
different things as part of reason we
have this misunderstanding so if you're
our project manager if you are
reasonable maybe sit down with your team
and talk about what project actually is
I think we have a lot of what's called
false projects and this is very common
in the larger organizations and some
financial institutions we use the
language of projects but we don't
actually mean projects we have a team
and they do project X and when project X
comes to end the team do project Y and
the team is largely unchanged you know
contractors come and go but they come
and go in the middle as well as at the
boundaries the team's log jung-jae and
they work in the same codebase and when
project Y is finished the same people
more or less move onto the same codebase
and a new project said I'm right behind
every project there's another one
waiting to come III did some work with
them an organization you've never heard
of but is responsible for those devices
in your pocket the work and they every
one of their projects ends on schedule
on March 31st and the new projects all
began on April the 1st isn't that good
they always meet their deadlines and I
said what happens if there's some work
left oh I would put that into the next
project and does anybody get made
redundant if the funding doesn't the
funding always comes there projects were
just aligned with a financial calendar
yeah let's stop confusing people the
word language of projects confuses
people it means different things to
different people with different
constraints this is my model waterfall
2.0 continuous continuous flow
continuous delivery continuous
requirements it keeps on coming we keep
on delivering stuff yeah this is what we
need to get good at doing work in a
small lifts or small molecules coming
down falling down coming out and we've
met valuable do that get good at it go
fast
seek out the value and don't stop this
means we've got to change the way we
manage because while management is based
around projects management is optimized
for big in software we're good at lots
of small things we need to rethink how
management happens so what optimized for
small act a law that is about four folio
management governance and yes project
management base ourselves around teams
crazy isn't it do you think it could
ever work there's a place where this
works really well basically everywhere
within about a hundred miles of Sand
Hill Road Palo Alto these are the people
who do it these are all venture capital
companies any of you try to raise
funding for start-up pickly a start-up
in California you go to the venture
capitalist and you say me my mate in our
garbage we built something do you see
it's good and they go oh yes they might
ask your business plan these days they
ask you for a very slim business plan
you say we think we can do a load of
good stuff with this and we think
there's a big mark and we make loads of
money and if you convince them they'll
invest a little bit of money but they'll
give it to you in tranches I'll give you
a little bit today and they'll promise
to give you some more in three months
and some more in three months but you'll
have to go back to them in three months
and you'll have to show to them that you
have actually improved the product you
can't work together as a team and in
some way you've improved you
understanding your customers and maybe
some bee report it and you'll do that
eventually they'll say you know you need
a lot more money we didn't fuchsias some
friends and they'll all pile in for a
lot more money but they want to see that
you are delivering benefit that your
team is capable of doing something and
they want to see you've checked out your
market that you now understand the
market maybe people are giving you money
and if you keep doing that one day
you'll be profitable but hey look you
know Amazon still aren't profitable and
they've been doing this long enough you
know if you do it well you'll get more
money from them and eventually you'll be
able to make money yourselves and that's
the governance do you know what happens
you go our business if you can't deliver
stuff if you can't sell stuff if there
isn't a market there you go out of
business and these guys accept this
these guys accept that crap nine out of
ten investments lose the money they go
out of business and perform one in ten
breakeven and one in a hundred is a
Google and they'll get all their money
back in the corporate world specially we
don't do failure we don't have the
option for things not to work we extend
our deadlines we give them more money
etc etc venture capitalists know to let
things burn out they let the failures
come out you get a Darwinian effect it's
like natural selection
if we can't have failures and big
corporations if we can't things don't
work everything has to work if
everything has to work then you're gonna
want a little guarantees upfront that
means you're gonna need all that
predefined requirements and if you don't
have fade it as an option you gotta keep
asking for more money you gonna keep on
getting more money oh the organizers
would like me to ask you to rate this
session but I say red orange green
frankly I find that useless knowing that
50% of the people liked it ten percent
of people didn't understand it and
thought dissin delighted probably cuz
their project managers doesn't help me
but the organizers would find it very
very useful nowhere to book me again
questions put in a quest connect to do
that on the app ah very good i didn't i
didn't get that I've been to several
conferences before where people drop
cards and the organizers send me a man's
a you've got fifteen green cards like
that's not actionable feedback
this sounds like actionable feedback
please rate it thank you yes we're
saying thank you we've got a few minutes
for questions I overrun slightly but hey
I'm in charge the schedule now I'm up
here John like estate ages isn't it tell
you how that new house could be you know
these are the things you could roadmaps
for me are possibilities they're maybes
they aren't promises they're roadmaps a
lot of roadmaps most of roadmaps most of
what's on the roadmap you don't really
need to show your customers for me
what's your own roadmaps are things like
and what I'm what do we see happening in
the world in the next if the roadmaps
five years five years say what do we see
happening in the world in the next five
years there are some things you already
know are going to happen in five years
time in five years time there will be an
election in this country that might or
might not be important to you in five
years time we might opt for a radical
socialist alternative if you believe
that
in five years time we know we know some
laws that we pass the next few years
because they're already approved that EU
level they're being turned into the laws
by all civil servants and we passed
shortly and that means shortly after if
they'll be adopted by Germany in France
too we already know about the trade
shows we attend because most companies
attend the same trade shows year after
year after year we already know about
some new developments in our industry
learning about tech all this to feed
into the roadmap roadmap paints a
picture of how the world will be in the
future it doesn't give us a definite
feed if definite description of how the
world should be there's a load of work
done it shell a few years back on the
thing called scenario planning about
trying to understand how the world might
be not so that you can plan and be ready
for that world lane happens but so that
your minds are used to thinking about
what could or might not happen so road
maps I think contains a lot of this
maybe what if what is happening attached
to that I think there's ideas for
functionality there's ideas for what you
may develop your software and they can
be plunked on at different dates you can
say look in two years time though that
you can say right now the EU has agreed
to a new law about I don't know drug
regulation and that will come through
the pipe and in two years time it will
be an effect in the UK do we want to
change our software so that it can work
like this well that might be a
no-brainer you might have to or if
there's something we could do which
means our software could exploit a new
market which is going to be opened up by
this change you can put that on a road
map you could even show that potential
customers and say you know what that
this new legislation coming in in two
years time we're thinking about doing
something for it you could go further
you could call that your first MVP you
put an item on the roadmap you show it
to customers if the customer gets
excited that's your first bit a customer
validation but just because an iPhone is
on the roadmap does not mean you've
promised to do it items on the robot by
definition and epoch and that doesn't
mean you have to do them you put them on
a roadmap it may or it may not happen as
time goes by as you get closer to those
dates on the
map you need to think about moving that
in because there's going to be a lost
off a lot of maybes on your roadmap so
when you get six months three months out
you need to be thinking those things on
the roadmap they've been sitting on the
roadmap for two years and nobody's been
interested in them fir them away there's
some items on the roadmap and people got
so excited about them we could sell them
today but maybe there's no value today
maybe they can't use them today maybe we
as long as they are developed within 18
months and then you don't have to begin
work on them immediately so I'm all for
roadmaps but I don't think roadmaps are
promises and robe apps should be
considering more than just features how
will the world be unfortunately a lot of
small software companies even some
larger ones their product guys seem to
be an extinction their sales department
as you put a large check under their
nose they certainly start jumping up and
up and down if you read a guy called
Marty Kagan Silicon Valley product group
he's really good on this stuff and he
talks about and specials if you keep
doing specials for customers yeah you'll
get the revenue from them but you won't
scale your product because you're going
after what this product ones and that
cup burning you've got to think about
the market anyone else
the having the argument that software is
is dead ten is quite hard when the
project managers have put in a face
towards the end of the project that
involves transitioning your software
yeah yeah I like the symptom of the
disease they see your team as temporary
what they're saying is we need all the
really bright guys to build the software
they can build and then we'll give it to
these guys these guys are half the price
so a long way away
I think they can't really build new
software you know it's that kind of
thinking wouldn't you've got the
knowledge in their heads and this you
know you could bring in some of these
new people you could share the knowledge
and and culture them and get them to
learn it but you can never have that
kind of knowledge transfer it never
happens if people put that on plans
people talk about it and it doesn't
really work it only really works if you
know for the first six months or
whatever the people you've transitioned
it to are learning what you did it's a
very inefficient way of working in the
extreme it kills software you know
because of people who are taking it over
don't really understand it I'm also
believer when it comes to maintaining
software and fixing bugs it's where your
best programmers are needed you need
your best people to make the changes
because all of you've done a training
courses offer attained how to build
software on you every every course in
university teaches you how to build
software how many of you are trained in
how to maintain software what I
surprised none of you there's one or two
place in the world they train people to
maintain software but most of what you
do is maintain existing software and fix
stuff I mean what you're describing is
is a very nasty symptom of the disease
which unfortunately makes it harder to
fix basically I think if you just forbid
people in your organization from using
the word project just replace the word
project by white space you put it on a
lot better actually remember that
replace the word project by white space
and we better
please don't tweet it to remember effort
hey anyone else have to stop there okay
sorry if I shortchanged your own
questions vote for the vote for this
session put in a question put in your
comments how can improve it I fiddled
with slides and I made it worse I
apologize I'll promise not to do it
again so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
