to be here it's always interesting to
get set up as a speaker with a
microphone like this and as far as I've
seen today in this room like all the
speakers have had facial hair and always
get stuck in your mustache and it just
gets disgusting but it's it's okay now
so far at least I'm coming from a
JavaScript background I've been writing
JavaScript for forever it seems and back
then it was different basically the
first Java Script conference with one
speaker Brendan Eich invented it what is
javascript anyway and then I lunch in a
quick wrap-up so it's kind of
interesting to see where we are today
and then how we're actually progress
this might be fake by the way and it's
really interesting to see a novelist was
talking about this morning how it's
become the de facto virtual machine
right now that we have JavaScript
everywhere and more or less every device
it's just a little bit about me I'm
Swedish and for all the danes i'm sorry
i'll start with that it you see Sir like
that and when I get the chance to travel
to go to a conference usually wherever I
go it's warmer it's not warmer here it's
not ok so I kind of expected more than
mark you're supposed to be the nice
place if people have beers and sitting
outside and it's really cool I'm the
editor of the Mozilla hacks flogged
which is basically our developer facing
blog at Mozilla so it's one of the
things I work with and with misil hacks
vlog we try to cover any kind of topic
that's interested or interesting for web
developers doesn't have to be about
Mozilla products or technologies but
just overall as a developer using open
standards what would be good you know so
we try to cover as much as possible
there I do tweet a fair amount as well
more focused nowadays before which is
yossi meal I'm opening the fridge and
now it's actually about html5 Firefox OS
and similar things and when I go to a
conference I can you know talk 45
minutes about something and then
afterwards it's all
is going to be someone then comes up to
you it's like what is my cell how does
it actually work everyone else about
Firefox what not really what's behind it
so basically we're the good guys that's
that's all you need to know and if I try
and elaborate on that the point which
was a lie that Mozilla is a nonprofit
organization so the reason for existing
is that we want to make sure that the
web stays open we don't want one player
to have complete control over it like
the Internet is such an essence of our
democratic system that we have we want
everyone to be able to contribute and
also take part of that so what we work
with is trying to make as many things as
possible standardized and make sure that
is accessible and the next question of
course not like yeah that sounds great
how the hell do you make money because
apparently you need to pay for things at
the end of the day and most of our
income is based on different
partnerships we have donations from
number of organizations and then if you
use firefox and you use the search field
we have a number of different search
provider sirs we get a commission from
google from microsoft with being from
yahoo etc from things like that so
basically enough to to stay afloat I
would say and as you know we do a web
browser again we're the good guys and
usually when we talk about web browsers
and people come and an a so so what
about Google Chrome they have a lot of
users now that that must really suck and
it doesn't actually on the country I
think that's wonderful look back
whatever 10 years in time and Internet
Explorer was completely dominating the
market now we have a number of good
browsers like a more or less all the
browsers out there are quite good just
the performance boost in the last few
years have has been amazing so I think
this is great i'm getting a much better
balance a much better competition now
where people are also spurred to build
better products and also one in my mind
misconception is usually that okay
mesilla and we're
I think Google and we're fighting
Microsoft etc and that's not the way it
works like we all talk with each other
more or less every day on different
topics we work together on standards we
work together to try and ship the same
thing to make it easier and more
interoperable okay we don't talk that
much with Apple well we talked with all
the other people Apple are they have a
different approach but we're we're
friends at the end of the day and
especially something like exam is going
to talk about later with WebRTC that
that's a really close collaboration and
none i think is great we also try and
bring awareness to people about
integrity what kind of data you you
share online and you can actually see it
and and the common for this that we
think that well you can't use Facebook
you can't use anything else don't share
anything and that's not it I think the
key word here is awareness so whatever
you put out there is going to be
accessible to people it could be through
the things that Michael showing how
people can intercept data but it can
also be the service which services do
you actually trust so I think it's
excellent to share information but just
be aware of what you actually share we
also try and work with trends and see
where things are going and the good
thing here of course especially looking
in in the mobile world what can we do
with you actually adapt to mobile what
can we do to adapt to the things that
that people need and on a mere more
serious note and coding the fight club
thing here basically you know buying
things you don't need for money we don't
have to impress people we don't like and
I see this pattern even stronger in the
Western world like Western Europe and
the US and such and if you look at new
york times the average number of devices
a New York Times subscriber has is 66
different devices to access the service
and we've sort of gotten past the point
of oh yeah I can
get online in a modem in a cupboard
somewhere too you know I have 15 things
on me you haven't watched a Robocop
walking around accessing the internet
from their legs and I I think that's
great internet is great but I think one
thing here as well it's also to keep in
mind that instead of only chasing
devices or having the status through
devices looking more at the the value
work trading how can we share things
more and another thing as my my new
friend Mike said we're all idiots with
deadlines and I think that comes down to
our technology choices that the
technology we use or huge to use it's
very dependent on the pressure we have
on our shoulders the pressure we have
from managers and such and and I can say
before I joined Mozilla and my last less
real job was working for a newspaper
agency and they were building ipad apps
and as long as he worked on iOS that was
find you had objective-c and you had all
that and I was the only thing that
mattered and then Android came along
it's like I was android okay we
need to build for Andrew as well and
then two months and buys like oh
there's a new android tablet with
different dimensions how can we actually
adapt things to different sizes this
this is impossible and I think the thing
with the technology choice is there is
basically we've had the web for such a
long time and it is more or less
intended to deal with all these things
we will make sure you can keep using the
same technologies everywhere instead of
having your separate team for each
device or actually work with and this is
where Firefox OS comes into play and the
entire thing with firefox OS is that
everything is html5 CSS and JavaScript
as soon as you boot up the phone what
you see is a Firefox window if you want
and every F that runs on the device is
like an iframe so everything is running
is its own protected soundbox content
but it's all running like in a web
browser so if you look at other
platforms
like with Windows Phone an ubuntu and
other things that coming up that they
say that well we support native and we
support ational five and we support it
basically means that they built their
own thing with something else and then
then they tell you to build something
with patient five whereas we're
dogfooding ourselves like we need to
build the entire user interface with
html5 as well so if it doesn't work for
us it's not going to work for you and
vice versa so we're in the same boat
there we have the same possibilities and
the same challenges and Firefox OS is
built up of three main parts so we have
a really small linux kernel called gonk
and when we started I think the first
device that actually got it working on a
couple of years ago was a samsung galaxy
s2 so we looked at the drivers needed to
make that work and what was in Android
and they will grip that with everything
in the android kernel that we didn't
need and we started from there and to
see how could actually access the
hardware and make things work so we have
gone get the colonel and then we have
gecko which is the rendering engine fire
fox so soon as you start the following
you basically get into Firefox and then
we have Gaia Gaia is the user interface
in Firefox OS which is the html5 layer
and let's see two three months ago now
was the first actual launch of devices
into the market I'll be completely
honest and say that it was so you know
one dot zero launch and if you think
back to something like Android one
that's zero it's out there right and
then keep on improving with that but
it's also talking about the am with the
phones and going back to talking about
buying devices you don't need for money
we don't have etc that the goal with
Firefox OS from the get-go hasn't really
been to compete with iphone 5 or 5s
Nexus 4 etc it's more about how can we
bring a smartphone experience for an
affordable cost how can we bring a
smartphone device to emerging markets
you know Europe in the u.s. sure people
have lots of money but what about the
rest of the world so there's an estimate
the two billion more people are going to
come online in the next few years and
then almost exclusively through mobile
if you look in South America and Africa
in the china etc and especially if you
look in Africa like in Africa we have
more people who have mobile phones that
I have access to electricity so in the
villages you have these charging poles
and run up there to charge your phone
for an hour and then they take off doing
whatever they do I don't know but the
charger phones I know about that part
and the thing is of course in most these
countries the phones that people have
are all feature phones like an old nokia
or something like that and how can we
give them a smartphone for the same
price how can we give them a rich
internet access and experience through
that so we were working with a lot of
operators and hardware partners and more
or less the pricing has been around 100
US dollars on or when it was launched in
Spain a few months ago 469 euro we also
have phones available in Poland
Venezuela Colombia and we have a few
more markets that are coming so I think
that's just important to keep in mind
that this is not the next iOS or
something like that over time though and
a few months ago it was announced one
really big collaboration for us with
Foxconn and Foxconn is the company who
built the first iPad and first can have
already you're always partnered with a
lot of major providers just building and
delivered to them and then they want to
get back into having a bigger part of it
for in producing their own devices who
they can brand themselves so we need a
partnership with them around Firefox OS
and they want to build initially seven
different kinds of devices so we're not
talking about low levels smartphones
we're talking about high-end smartphones
we've talking potentially about tablets
we're talking about tvs I don't know
cars and I think what's interesting here
is that we're just talking more and more
possibilities we can still have the same
code you can still have the same API so
you can still have the same
possibilities that's just spreading out
and firefox has to start about two years
ago
and I wrote a little blog post if you're
interested in the story so it's kind of
interesting to have been around from the
get-go like it showed up as a wiki page
and that's interesting with being
Mozilla that we do everything in the
open so I find out as much for the
things we do when they're public done
internally it's more like oh this is out
there on your wiki what is this I like
 I don't know and you frantically
read up on it so I found out about it
and it sort of evolved since so what I
want to talk about today is basically if
you look at mobile phones how can we
make sure to bring the web to mobile
phones and I can make sure that we can
also offer the user experience that
people expect people like apps the one
have apps so we've been looking at
building open web apps and basically
using the same technologies HML sorry
it's from five CSS and JavaScript to
build apps or external device and have
the access that you need as an app on
the device and I I know they're going to
sort of sound too good to be true but I
think it doesn't have to be that hard if
you're looking in the mobile world right
now look look at the things like QR
codes like you can have a stream lee
long instruction or you can type in a
URL i know what i would prefer this user
and i think we need to go more and more
in that direction how can make it as
easy as possible for users and
developers so open web apps is basically
whatever html5 code you have if you
already have a mobile website with
responsive design that already works on
mobile that would work out of the box in
Firefox OS as well the only thing you
need to add if you want to make it
installable as a nap it's a manifest
file and the manifest file is adjacent
file describing your app so what it does
in the file and then well dogless thank
you for Jason it helped it's basically
naming it you're having the launch path
you're having icons for different
resolutions developer information you
can also have installation access and
localization and things like that and
this is all you need
so if you already have a mobile site add
this and you're good to go you already
have a mobile website and if you've been
working with things like PhoneGap or
titanium etc and if you do want to use
html5 to build something it is hard work
to get it on to other platforms but you
getting on here it's just add this file
and you're done we also have a manifest
checker did the most normal or common
problem that people have is of course
you might have some invalid Jason or
something like that so we have a
manifest checker you can make sure that
it's valid it has all data needed and
then you can launch it and we also
looked at the two different ways how to
offer apps to developers like how can
you build apps the easiest one is hosted
apps which means that if you have a
mobile a Chanel 5 site you can keep on
running it from your own site you can
just add the manifest file and make it
installable on device but you still have
all the control like there's no app
store review cue that you have to wait
for or get approval or something like
that you update the app whenever you
want to you run it from your own website
you have the offline support you might
want then we also have the option of a
packaged app and a package up means that
you sip up all the files in your app and
you install that package directly on the
device and as a packaged app we do have
a Firefox marketplace that's optional so
you can use that if you want to for
findability or for selling apps where
you don't have to but with packaged apps
you also get a higher security clearance
you can access more things directly on
the device and then you need to do a
package lap or we can actually do a code
review to make sure that you're not
going to have some malicious code on
your device and the mike was also
talking about content security policy
and to make sure that a packaged app is
safe it has to match the content
security policy as well and if you look
back to 2007 and where I sort of think
they when I first iPhone came out like
it was amazing and was breaking so much
new ground and they said that everything
is going to be web apps you can just run
things in mobile safari and you're good
to go and you
went by and then we had objective-c we
had the App Store Sarah and I think
personally what they went wrong or
didn't go away that I would like to see
them going was to rather expose things
on the device like with the first iphone
the only thing you can do with load
documents you could read web pages and
that was it and I think instead of going
the objective-c route instead if they
had just expose more things directly
through api's to the hardware to the
phone they could have stayed with the
web layer so with Firefox OS we looked
at what can we do so I think that the
current count right now is up to 28 new
api's and the idea with all these api is
that you're going to have as much power
as well native languages on other
platforms if you look at objective c if
you look at java you can do in on their
platforms what can you do directly from
the web layer in Firefox OS and also
make sure that it's a consistent
experience no matter which device it is
you don't have to adapt it for every
device and one really really important
thing as well with these api is like we
can come up with 480 is but one really
important factor here is that we want to
have them standardized we want to make
sure that we're not the only one
implementing them because if we really
want building it we can do whatever
proprietary thing we want to and that's
not the point we want to make sure that
the web as a whole becomes better and
stronger and more powerful tool for
developers especially in the mobile
world so with all this api's we're
aiming for standardization some of them
have already been standardized and some
of them are in the process and we have a
few security levels for the AP is if you
look in left hand side we have web
content which could be something that
you run in the web browser and Firefox
OS it could be any page you can have an
installed web app which equals here to a
hosted app so it's installed as a nap
but is still running from your own
website same security level but then we
have the package web apps and then they
have access to privileged JP I swear you
can do more things and the thing on the
right-hand side is certified api's which
are api's
that only we can access right now it
could be like accessing the telephone to
make a call we want to make you know we
really sure that not anyone can do that
and we also have a wiki page outlining
all of these api's and they're not
looking at the api's themselves so if
you look in the on the right hand side
you have three different columns you
have D a and B and D is short for
firefox on desktop a is firefox on
Android and B is the old code name blue
to gecko Firefox OS but what I think is
good with this is that it gives you an
indication what kind of api's are
supporting on which platform like it
doesn't make sense to have this API on
well desktop on android on Firefox OS or
isn't only applicable for one it also
with the color coding shows what kind of
security laboratory is like is it a
search of AP a certified a PID you can't
access or is it an API that anyone can
work with and we will talk about the
manifest file before and if you want to
access certain api's you can add the
permissions part so if you want to
access contacts or alarms you only just
request that permission and you can
describe what you're going to use it for
you can also describe what kind of
access you want if you want to access
context you want only read access read
create etc and on mdn wish I would
humbly say is the best web developer
documentation ever but I'm humbles I'm
not going to say that we have a page
about permissions so they outline all
the permissions that you might need to
ask for and how you ask for them in the
manifest file so looking at the regular
api api is that are available to
everyone no matter if it's only a web
page or a hosted web app and i'm going
to go through a number of them just to
give you a taste of what the code looks
like and how you interact with it so the
first if your eye is the battery status
API and how can you just access the
battery level directly on the device and
this one has already been standardized
as well and if I remember correctly it's
in chrome as well on I'm looking
desperately for Chrome
you should hear I think it's in chrome
on Android as well and it's also on
desktop so and the idea with this API is
to make sure that you can check the
battery for the moment you can build
your own widget if you want to just show
off the battery but can also be good
defending what kind of operation you do
like if you can see that there's low
level on the device you might not want
to start to sinking operation or load
three megabytes of data or something
like that so you can make the use of
experience more seamless put Iraq
without actually asking the user and you
have a few properties like you can check
the level of the battery you get a
boolean whether the phone is charging or
not then you also have a charging time
and discharging time and charging time
is basically if you connect to the
device how long time is going to take
until it's fully charged and
respectively fully discharged you have
events like charging change which
basically means that you plug the phone
in or unplug the phone we have
notifications and with notifications
it's very similar if you've been working
with Android how can you show a
notification directly in the device and
talking about standardization I should
point it out that the things that
haven't been standardized yet they have
the moss prefix and as soon as we can
get them standardized of course the
prefix is going to go away so you can
create the most notification the native
notification takes three different
parameters the first parameters is the
title of notification the second one is
the description just saying what you
actually wanted to say and the third one
is optional we can pass in a URL to an
icon if you want to have an exclamation
sign for certification we have the
screen rotation API so if you want to
control when your app get started how
it's being presented to the user you can
lock the orientation so you can finish
this locked orientation to portrait no
matter how matter no matter how the user
is holding the phone or you can lock it
to landscape or similar we also have a
few other options like landscape primary
which means that if you start the app is
going to go into landscape no matter how
you're holding it but then if you start
twisting and turning it's going to adapt
to how you're holding it
we have the vibration avi the vibration
API used to be called the vibrator API
but for obvious reasons people got the
wrong connections and as as you see so
we sort of moved on from that and and
the idea with the vibration API is just
you know have a vibration alert or
notification on the device so you have a
vibrate method you pass in the number of
milliseconds so the first case here
means that it's going to vibrate for one
second the second one is slightly more
interesting we can pass in an array so
you can have any kind of notification
patterns so if you look at the array in
the second example the first value is
going to vibrate for 200 milliseconds
and then is going to be silent for a
hundred lens going to vibrate for 200
etc and we're also seeing the people
building apps based on on vibration we
had one navigation app where people had
the phones in their pocket and they were
riding their bike to work and then when
they got to the next intersection it
would vibrate once if you're supposed to
turn left and twice if you're supposed
to turn right just do the small things
to build on top of that and beyond
selling apps in the Firefox marketplace
we also support in-app payments and so
basically we can do is that you can
create a most payment or basically the
most pay method and depending on which
payment provider you have you get token
from your provider you can call that
rider with that token and then you get
back back a successor ever event handler
and if the payment goes through you can
give them more smurfberries or something
else that's vital and we also put a
small example up on github with the
precedes verifier so you can just get
the code from there if you want to build
the in-app payments and the simplest way
to doing that if you use to receive
things yes using the prompter method I
think the only things you need right now
is the story well and the actual support
URL and that you need to verify the
payment and then you're good to go and
I'll touch on it later we also have a
simulator for Firefox OS and with
there you can have different test cases
for your receipts so you can basically
say that okay no matter what the receipt
is going to be valid or invalid or it
was a refunded payment so you can test
different use cases without having them
actually failing for you and one place
where I think is really interesting
especially as a JavaScript developer
like I started with you know HTML we had
great backgrounds who had HR elements
and then finally we got to mouse over
events and it was hallelujah and where
we got them from there is and what I
like is when we connect the digital
world with the physical world and one of
the guys is the device proximity API so
if I have a phone and I can move the
round then with JavaScript I can detect
how close am i holding device to the
table or how far away am I and so you
have a device proximity event and it
will change the value in centimeters
because the metric system is superior
only my opinion but you also get two
other properties you get the max
property and the main property and the
max property tells you it the sensor in
your device how far can it be away and
still give you accurate values and a
minimum of course is how close can you
get and still get actual values and in
my mind that we thought it would be you
know meters you could run around with
your phone and you can play hi lander
and all of that it turns out that the
maximum value I've seen so far in device
is 10 centimeters so it's kind of a
letdown but I think over time though and
it's completely dependent on the sensors
so now it's more of use cases like you
have the phone you hold it up to your
your head to make a call or something
the phone knows that you can turn off
the screen and similar but over time I
definitely think we're going to see more
more and other use cases we also have a
myint light and with immune light if you
build an app you can detect the light
conditions where the user is using the
device right now so if they're in a room
like this if they hold the phone up to
the spotlight if it's a really dim
living room
and so in the nice thing there of course
you can load different CSS depending on
what kind of contrast you might need
right now with the users out in the
bright sunlight or similar and you have
to delay device light event and device
light event return something called the
lux value to detect how riot or hard
damn it actually is and the locks value
it ranges from about 30 up to 12,000 and
what a device can detect such a huge
span but we need to know is below 50
it's really really dark and then over
about 10,000 that means it that you're
rubbing the device against the light
bulb or something which is sort of my
job to test things I worked a long time
to get there okay and we didn't nap as
well you can check the visibility of
your app and this is actually not one of
them the web api is but just an easy way
with the visibility change event to
detect if your app has focus because if
your app doesn't have focus you might
not want to run a number of things in
the background it's only when the user
is actually using it or you can whatever
greet the user when the user comes back
to your app or something like that and
you have the document dot hidden
property and you sort of have the
opposite if well if it's visible and
right now we only have a few privileged
api's and we're looking into making the
certified API is accessible to as many
people as possible but the same time
security has to come first so so these
are the first few that you need to be a
packaged app to have access to and it's
about device storage it's about browser
API if you want to build your own web
browser TCP socket to access and
contacts we also have system xhr so if
you want to do across the main request
you can do that you know without using
course or something like that if you use
system xhr in the privileged API you can
access any URL and do do those requests
and looking at device storage you have a
navigator got dot get device storage
method and you can have different
keywords like videos so you can go into
videos folder and you get a cursor to
enumerate all the files that you have in
the video folder and if you get an
actual result you can utilize the html5
file api just to see what kind of file
is that what's the type of the file did
the actual mime type not just extension
what's the size of the file etc and then
you on the fly you can also create the
test player so even if the video claims
to be video file you can create the test
player sees the video actually place as
well then if you place then you know
okay this file is good I can present a
list of maybe three files out of 10 to
the user it these three files I know
you're going to work on your device and
I think one thing that's a really good
middle ground here between security and
actually giving you access as developers
is something called web activities and
if we working with Android and we seen
intense on Android wear your app can
register support for a certain action
this is very similar to this and Google
was working with web intents for a few
years and it's sort of frozen for now
but there are discussions to see how we
can move forward and then web activities
is the thing that we've been working on
which are much smaller scope I would say
and we'll see how we can actually bridge
that gap over time and it is things like
how you can interact with the camera
there's no camera API right now and to
be honest one reasons for not having a
camera via is because we want to make it
much better we have a camera on device
you have our own API for it what we want
to make sure that you have much more
support for white balance and aperture
and things like that so you can use web
activities so if you call the web
activity named pick which means you're
going to pick a certain file type off
the device you get a menu from the
operating system saying that okay the
pic activity all of these apps support
pic and then the user gets to choose
what kind of have to run so you still
have the step of user consent then you
can go into the camera then you can take
the picture and then you still get
access to the camera but with the help
of the user and the way you do that is
that you have a most activity object and
you have a few parameters from for the
most activity
so you can have the view activity and
you have data so you can have filter for
your data like okay I want to do the
view activity by only 1 2 view PNG files
and you have a success Handler and error
event handlers basically when you get
into the other app and you get back
again and in your own app if you for
instance you're building out your own
Twitter app or something else in the
manifest file you can also as you saw
with permissions before you can reduce
your activity support so you have an
activities part and you can say that
okay my app supports the share activity
but I only supported for P&amp;amp;G and then
gif files and when my appt is being
called as a sharing activity I want you
to send the user into the sharing about
HTML file and this position you have to
option this position is means it means
leave the current app and go into my
appt into this file and do that but you
can also do in line instead of window
which means stay in the current apps
keep on working there and stay in
context and from within your app you can
register an activity handler and within
the activity handler you get the
activity request and you can do what
kind of data you want to and you can
post back a result through requesting a
poor or post back an error if you want
to and talking about a number API is I
think one thing that's also important to
touch on is the future because we always
talk about this is what we have right
right now I think it's important to talk
about intent where are we going and what
are the things that we're planning on
supporting because as you know and then
sort of back to idiots with deadlines we
get get a few things out the door
there's always more you want to do when
the things you want to do better and
better over time so if you talk a bit
about the future it's doing the water
change here
do a few api's that we're already
working on it just didn't make it into
the first version and it's about
resource locking and I also peer-to-peer
one thing that's really really exciting
i think is WebRTC and how we can have
proper communication without plugins
through web technologies and that's
going to be Sam see you later after me
today but we're working on getting that
in there like we already have web what
you see on desktop in Firefox and Chrome
we already have it on Android in chrome
and firefox and it's not not really
there in Firefox OS yet and one of the
limitations there is that the hard word
like the specs of the hardware is much
lower so how can we actually give a
decent user experience to the end-user
so it's not about the actual security
it's more about actually having it for
you know making it worth it for user may
can actually be a fluent seamless thing
we're also having a web and of capi
we're having a webview USB API if you
connect something through the USB cable
calendar spell checking etc one thing
that also like is that we have a
keyboard API and where I think android
is superior to iOS is the possibility to
have a completely customized keyboard if
you use Android and then you have
switched key or Swiper something like
that that that's great for you sir not
everyone's going to love it but for some
people it's invaluable so we hope to be
able to offer that to use you as well
like we already have one developer
working for one of the operator partners
and in a few hours he implemented a
two-finger scrolling api basically on a
mobile device it's always really hard to
put the cursor at a certain place like
you tap on the screen it's like Firefox
and it didn't really work so what he
implemented was actually based on an old
photo type is that if you hold down the
shift key and then you scroll with two
fingers you scroll the cursor in the
text that you're typing in things like
that how can we expose that how can we
make it much easier for the user through
simple means
and from the get-go right now if you
have a Firefox OS phone we have a few
apps pre-installed so we have naturally
a Firefox browser so it's kind of a
browser in a browser so think inception
and you're getting close to it of course
we have messaging and calendars and
calling and all of that so it's actually
quite a long list with all well whatever
normal means but the usual things that
people do on a device and one thing
they're really liked about Firefox OS as
well is that from day one everything has
been done in the open from day one we
had a commit on github for what was then
called booty gecko which is the core
operating system I'm the same thing with
Gaia which is a user interface like all
the code folder to use the user
interface in the phone is available on
github so anyone can look at the code if
there's an app you like you can just
copy the code and do the same in your
app if there's an app that you don't
think is as good as it should be you can
just issue a pull request I think for
the first version we had 300 something
external contributors just making it
better because it was out there and I
still think and I can't emphasize that
enough just sharing code and sharing
knowledge leads to so much better things
and kind of a sidetrack thing we're also
looking into overall with the web how to
make it easier to build websites
especially people doing layouts people
doing interaction how can you take that
pain away from you as a developer so a
really really big thing there is web
components how can you actually offer
modular computer components on the web
how can you just have small snippets of
code you get all the interaction with it
so we have something called Mesilla
brick which is basically all this
different web components being
implemented so what you have in the HTML
code is that you have x tags so
basically in the HTML tags sorts with an
X dash and then the name of the element
then you include a javascript file in
this case that the brick file and you
get also the CSS to make it look in a
certain way that you can adapt if you
want to but through javascript you get
all the interaction needed and so in
this case you would have an ex flip box
and basically you can just flip sides
and or have it you know show the back or
the front of a card and you also get
methods with that as well so if you have
a flick flip box element you can have an
event listener in your page you can just
call the toggle method of the flip box
that means that your card is going to
toggle so there are a few elements that
we're working with their to make that
better like app bars in all mobile app
how can you have an app bar at the top
we're having calendar and Dave figures
and decks and such and of course all the
normal things like sliders so back to
Firefox OS getting sorted with Firefox
OS one thing is well that we wanted to
make easy for developers especially
using web technologies and without
naming other platforms getting a
developer environment on certain
platforms is kind of hard and the
emulation is not perfect so we're
looking how can we make that easier so
we created was the Firefox OS simulator
so you install it in Firefox as an
extension directly in Firefox and we
have all the the source code basically
the same source code that runs on the
devices running directly in the
simulator and you have all kinds of
debugging and then testing apps testing
payments and such so if you just used
all the simulator you can more or less
get an experience that's close editing
in the device then at the end of the day
especially for performance if you have a
game you might want to check on an
actual device but you can still get very
very far with the simulator you can have
an existing web app and just run it in
the simulator receiver works out of the
box then you're good to go and something
in put together a while back was to the
boilerplate app for Firefox OS and with
all the API so I've been talking about
and web activities and having privileged
api's so try to make it as easy as
possible so
ball of light app is not dependent on
any library because I want you to pick
the library that you want to use I'm not
going to tell you to use jQuery or dojo
whatever you should choose what works
best for you I'm not the one to make the
calls for you so you have all these
completely standalone snippets here for
each of the buttons in the water flap or
you can call an activity or you can call
a certain API you can see the action you
can test in a simulator how is working
and then if you have a app that's ready
for prime time you have the market place
where you can sell apps if you want to
and I think one thing that I didn't talk
about before as well like in the
marketplace and especially if you look
in emerging markets not everyone has
credit cards or not everyone are willing
to give away their credit card
information to a certain source so what
we have is support for operator billing
so if you want install an app you can
get the cost for that app directly on
your phone bill and if you have a cash
card the price for that app is going to
be deducted from the amount that you
have on your cash card so just these
small things to make it easier for user
and then sort of getting away from all
the sign up things we also have
something called a developer hub which
is going into three different things
like the design build and published
steps about apps so there's a lot of
documentation there as well and what I
think is all about is trying things out
a number of months ago now my oldest
daughter had a birthday and she turned
eight so we thought let's give them a
letter cookies you know basically you
have a package of cookies and each
cookie is a letter letter L letter M etc
let's see if they spell something
because you know they know how to write
now I took about 30 seconds so this was
the first word
which is kind of terrifying it wasn't my
daughter by the way you have this kind
of shining moment because you don't know
what's going to happen next but at the
same time what I liked about it is that
it's completely unexpected and it sort
of ties in with us and with having all
the cold open source I want to throw
things out there I want you to do hack
away on things find the flaws make it
better we have no preconception that
we're much smarter or that we're doing
everything perfect nothing's perfect but
I do think that by being willing to
share and open up for other people we
can make things better together and then
like I said I only having this fervor to
comic relief but break things okay i'm
sorry i have a small fixation I have to
have this in there I can't even
motivated but i think that's that's the
main point that when i made today i
don't want you to leave your current
mobile development environment I want
you to keep on building using web
technologies and just make sure to
target midi mobile world as well through
web through more api access and by end
of it all experiment play around see
what happens because we got to have some
fun as well we don't live that long so
it's too short to be boring all the time
thank
and questions I get to pick one side
works so I'll do a quick one what about
WebGL support yes we have WebGL support
oh Christ anyone have this question what
is the relation of Jason manifest to the
config.xml in w3c package web apps back
don't this approach partially the same
purpose yeah they do so the thing is
here and if you look at chrome web apps
as well like the manifests for chrome
apps and the manifest for Firefox apps
are very very similar and then ascend
with the the web apps back with mp3 SI
and xml file is also very very similar
so there is ongoing work to the unified
is of course we want to have one format
i I couldn't agree more i think it's
crap to have more than one format for
something that's fairly easy so i really
hope we can do that should i keep on
going I don't know what I'm on time ok
so how will always updates be propagated
to end users over the air so the
operator is going to push updates to the
upper system directly to users that's a
lot of questions so any question I don't
actually answer just come and find me
later and I'll make something up so I
have time to think about it as well so
does it mean that Firefox OS supports
background processes or apps by default
so it's updated after Alberta make sure
is not utilizing unnecessary phone
resources in the background the simple
answer is no we don't really support
background processes it's more of a out
of memory thing especially on the
low-end devices so it means that your
app will continue to run in the
background and of course they're the one
that's having the focus is getting more
resources but your app will still be
running until you sort of run out of
memory so it's not really up to you as a
developer to control that that's our
issue to have the multiple apps running
at the same
over time though I'm not sure about the
background process support and that to
be honest it comes down with your
hardware support as well and what kind
of performance you can actually get out
of device how many things can you run at
the same time but we have in the 1.1
version of Firefox OS support for a push
API so it's more about when you actually
need things to happen in your app you
can call the push API to notify the user
or get the data or something like that I
could go on for long hat if I didn't ask
you a question please come and find me
instead so we can let all the other four
people go to the bathroom now thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
