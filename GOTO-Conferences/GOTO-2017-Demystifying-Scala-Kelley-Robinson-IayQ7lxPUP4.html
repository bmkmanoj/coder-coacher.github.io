yesterday that this talk was actually a
lot harder for me to write than I
anticipated it being because I've been
doing scala for about four years which
really isn't that long but it's really
easy to kind of forget all the things
that you start to take for granted when
you do an introduction so hopefully I've
done a pretty good job of starting at
the beginning here but if you don't have
any previous knowledge of Scala and
anything doesn't make sense please let
me know I think one of my big goals for
the Scala community is making it more
welcoming to beginners I think it's a
very good language to teach people and
unfortunately there's not a ton of
resources out there that allow that
right now this talk along with some of
the other things at all mention in the
talk are in attempt to bridge that gap
but again don't be shy there is no such
thing as a stupid question let me know
either Twitter DM s come up to me after
if anything doesn't make sense
I will take that upon myself to
hopefully clarify that for you or help
you find the person that can answer that
question so this background picture here
this is lesan in switzerland it's kind
of a poor at the Swiss hotel so I put
this here will one it's a pretty picture
that makes for a good slide but also
listen is where the EPFL university is
and this is the University they're the
creator of Scala works and so he's a man
by the name of Martin oder scheme he
created Scala in the early 2000s saul
has been around since about 2004 and
they continue to do a lot of development
out of this university in Lathon and so
there's academics PhD students and
professors that are working on the
language and so I'm here today to kind
of translate that into something that's
useful for all of you bridge the gap
there between academia and what might be
interesting into you as industry
programmers that want to learn a little
bit more so as George mentioned my name
is Kelly I lead a team of Scala
developers and data scientists that
share through in San Francisco we are an
ad tech company keeping the internet
free
yeah and as a manager mostly these
series I find myself writing less code
and often explaining how things work to
other people whether that's other
engineers or products or executives and
so hopefully the domestication is
something that I've had a tiny bit of
practice at at this point and I'm going
to try to translate to all of you today
all right what are we going to talk
about so we're going to provide the what
what is Scala provide you a brief
introduction we'll go over some of the
syntax here so for people that haven't
seen the language before get a little
bit of an intro to what the language is
then we'll talk about why people use
Scala and probably why you might not or
I don't know this this section might I
might ramble more about why you
shouldn't use Scala more than you should
we'll see how it goes and then if you
are interested in learning more how you
can get started all right so let's start
with an introduction to scallops so this
is going to be pretty quick after the
session you're probably not going to be
an expert Scala developer I give you the
tools later on to kind of go around and
play with the language if you're
interested but if any of this seems
quick or like I mentioned if there's
anything that's unclear let me know
after hopefully the resources are there
for you to look things up the goal is to
give you some familiarity with the
language and some idea of the things
that you might see or hear about that
you can then go and know what to Google
later which let's be honest the software
engineers is our entire job also some
warnings of common gacho's which in any
language is going to be a few okay in
order to explain Scala I need to explain
eine garden who here knows who I know
garden is okay you're my new best
friends for everyone that doesn't know
who I know garden is Ina Garten is my
personal hero ina is a chef on the Food
Network she has a show called the
Barefoot Contessa what you might not
know about ina is that back in 1970s ina
worked in the White House for the Office
of Management and Budget
righting nuclear policy budgets and
around my age she got bored with that as
one does and said
screw this I'm going to go buy a gourmet
grocery store in East Hampton and so she
did that and has been cooking and
writing cookbooks and appearing on her
Food Network show ever since so I can
make some explanation or metaphor about
how Ina Garten represents Scala you know
she's creative she's powerful she's
successful but really I just introduced
her so you have some context because I'm
going to use her in all of my examples
so we're all on the same page now all
right some syntax intro for Scala so one
of the things that you might notice
about Scala is there's no parentheses on
method calls so that's something that
you see in a language like Java so you
can call is empty which will return a
boolean without the parentheses
semicolons are optional you can include
them most Scala programmers don't and
scholars language that's statically
typed so every return value has a type
and that type doesn't change and it also
has type inference and so you'll see
chef there you don't have to specify
what type that value is the Scala
compiler will figure that out for you
and so it knows that that's a list of
strings and then elements in a list are
indexed by parentheses which is a little
confusing but that's how we do it I know
it's a very practical chef this is a
catchphrase that she's known for so if
you are not somebody that wants to go
through the trouble of figuring out how
to grow your own Granny Smith apple
trees store-bought is fine and so if we
want to write a function to tell us if
store-bought is fine this is one of the
ways we can do it and so what I'm going
to start to get into is there are many
ways to write a function which is a
common theme to Scala which is there's
many ways to do anything in Scala and so
this is one example of how you write a
function in Scala you'll notice that all
of the arguments in the method have to
have a type and so your name there is of
type string every function also has a
return type and the return value is the
last line of the method
this is the same function because the
return value is the last mind of the
method you don't have to set it to a
value so this is equivalent to what we
saw in the last page and because this is
only now one line you don't have to
include the curly braces in the method
this is the same thing again and you
don't have to specify the return value
because functions like values also have
type inference and so this method will
be able to infer that the return type is
boolean however types provide safety
this is one of the reason people like
statically typed languages and so if you
were to write this function and you knew
that this function you wanted it to
return a boolean and you accidentally
return a string value the compiler would
tell you this was an error and you
wouldn't have to write a test for this
which is pretty useful and so I advocate
for using types especially in functions
and for values when there's a chance
that you might mess something up and
let's be honest as programmers we often
mess things up I would like the compiler
to tell me when I'm wrong instead of
having to rely on my memory and then
calling a function here is how you can
call the function again the compiler
will help you here so you know you can
feed in a string which is what it's
expecting and that will be fine but then
if you give it an integer it will throw
an error from the compiler a little bit
more of some syntax data is immutable by
default and so if you set
I know gardens name to the Barefoot
Contessa you can't change that value
later and so unfortunately for me I
cannot become the Barefoot Contessa but
it's safer for the overall program and
then this is the same thing if you do
any methods on values you can change the
value but that's going to return a new
value and if you then print the old
value after you do that to uppercase
call on it it's going to return what you
had before so values remain unchanged
that was some syntax and now we'll talk
a little bit about some of the features
of the language and some of the things
that Scala prides itself on and some of
the
you're going to hear about a lot when
people talk about what Scala is this is
probably one of the biggest things that
you hear often about Scala I think I put
it in the abstract is that it's some
combination of object-oriented meets
functional programming when we talk
about object-oriented you're thinking
objects are values there and that
operations on values are method calls
this is very similar to things that you
see in Java but it also has functional
programming and I think for a lot of
people I think that's the the bigger
jump and so I'll talk a little bit about
what what functional programming is to
me and what I think you need to know in
order to get a base understanding of
functional programming in Scala so first
of all functional programming is an
example of a programming paradigm it is
a style or a way of doing things it is
not something concrete like a language
and that's an important distinction to
make because you can do this style this
functional programming style
object-oriented as a style imperative as
a style you can do this in any language
but some languages make it easier to
write in this style
Scala makes it easy to write in a
functional style the biggest thing about
functional programming is that
everything is an expression and so when
we talk about expressions you can talk
about syncing and values and not
side-effects you're not causing aspects
all over your program everything's going
to return a value and a statement in
that case of a statement something that
would cause a side effect is going to be
a method that has its special return
type of unit and so unit is kind of like
void it's just basically saying that
nothing is happening there's no return
type there and that's indicating that
there is some side effects that's
happening in the function excuse me an
expressions are useful for functional
programming because it helps us break
our programs into smaller pieces and
this helps us as programmers reason
about our programs and understand the
meaning of our programs functional
programming as a discipline came to be
because people were trying to be able to
better understand what their programs
were doing so if you think about
breaking things into pieces you know
that this piece over here is doing
something and this piece over here is
doing something else and you can combine
those together to make more
complicated programs because it's easier
to reason about and test the individual
parts I wanted to quickly talk about
side effects so when we talk about side
effects reminder side effects are not
inherently bad people talk about wanting
to avoid side effects because they do
come with some downsides and we say a
function or something in your program is
side effecting if it modifies state
outside of its scope and so that's
things like modifying global variables
something that you see in a lot of
languages when you're iterating through
a list every time you do that I plus
plus you're modifying state you're
changing something outside the scope
there side effects also occur when
you're dealing with the outside world
and so anything like like making an API
request or printing to the console those
are also examples of side effects and so
people want to avoid side effects
because they're make your program not as
predictable when you're dealing with the
outside world you don't know what's
going to happen there the API request
could fail the console something could
happen with your computer you never know
but again like you need side effects at
some point you have to interact with the
outside world in order for your program
to do anything useful the idea of
functional programming is isolating
those two certain parts of your program
so the rest of it is easier to reason
about and so when an expression has no
side effects we call it a pure function
and pure functions have this property
called referential transparency and
referential transparency is a big word
that's the same thing as saying that a
value can replace the function and
there's not going to be anything else
that happens as a result so you can
replace your value of like if you're
calling an API in a method then if you
replace that with a value your program
state is going to change because then
you're not going to have that side
effect there and so referential
transparency and pure functions can be
used interchangeably and again this
makes it easier to reason about your
programs and smaller pieces immutable
data is also a huge bonus for
expressions because if we were modifying
state constantly that would detract from
that idea of making it easier to reason
about your program
so expressions wrapping up this idea of
functional programming the most
functional programming encourages using
this idea of pure expressions of
avoiding side-effects for as long as
possible so that you can minimize the
amount of unpredictability that there is
in your programs I mentioned this
earlier but pure functions are also
infinitely easier to unit test and so
you can take some of these principles
that a language like Scala makes it easy
to do but again this is just a style so
you can do this in any language that
you're working in and you can think
about some of these benefits of writing
small reusable pieces of code that are
easier to unit test long drawn-out
methods that have a lot of side effects
are going to require inserting things
like testing mocks and that's going to
make it harder to write unit tests for
your code we've introduced some of the
paradigms at Scala follows
object-oriented and functional and what
are some of the features that Scala then
employs to make these paradigms what
they are this list is ripped directly
from the Scala Lang homepage at Scala -
Lang org which is a weird website title
but alas there you have it and I'm going
to talk about a few of them the first
one that I wanted to mention is the
interoperability with Java so Scala is a
language that runs on the JVM what does
that mean so Scala compiles to Java
bytecode and the JVM the java virtual
machine is able to run that and so this
is useful because like you have
different reasons for different
programming languages Scala is another
language that gives you some tools that
to write software in a slightly
different way than Java does but Java is
a tried and tested environment
essentially that you can easily deploy
there are a lot of tooling around that
and this has been around for three
decades or more that you can use a lot
of those tools that Java has made for
the community that they've been a part
of to make sure that that the code is is
runnable on multiple environments it has
the VM so that Scala doesn't have to
work on worry about compiling to
different hardware
what else so you can also use Java
libraries in Scala because different
stack traces can mix in seamlessly and
this is really useful especially helping
a language like Scala gain popularity
very quickly I think a lot of languages
you know that are only let 13 years old
don't get the kind of popularity that
they do unless they play nicely with
some existing environment and that's one
of the things that Scala gives you and
so you can use Java libraries directly
in your Scala code so you don't have to
re-implement a lot of the more
complicated things and so there's a lot
of like math libraries that do
differential equations or things like
that you might be importing because
Scala doesn't have the equivalent and it
doesn't need the equivalent because it
already exists yes so then also the
virtual machine can run on any platform
and there's a lot of tools for testing
and debugging your environment debugging
Java bytecode and those things alright
type inference is another big thing that
people like about Scala and so I showed
you that before you don't have to
specify every type on every value or
function and this is really useful
because it helps write more expressive
code you don't have to take the time or
the keystrokes to necessarily type out
the type of every single type in your
program and this saves you the
programmer time but again as we saw in
our function example sometimes these are
helpful for you and so this is one of
the things that you have to learn with
Scala is when it's useful to write the
type and when it's useful to leave it
off and sometimes it can get too verbose
sometimes it's really useful for you to
make sure that that is known it's not
only safety and a built in test for your
code that the compiler will catch but
you can think of it as also
documentation for the next person that's
editing that code
another thing that Scala has that they
like to talk about is the the multiple
inheritance of traits and so there's
very flexible interfaces that you can do
with Scala mixin multiple traits to a
given class and we can look at an
example of this so traits can extend
other traits and then you can have
traits that extend traits that X n
traits and so in this example you know
you have a garden that's a Food Network
Star and also a best-selling author but
because she's a Food Network Star that
also makes her a celebrity chef and so
you have this type inheritance and this
hierarchy that you've defined here and
then if you have something like this the
idea here is then you have some function
that's going to take in a celebrity chef
and then you can use Ina Garten Android
Troy in the same context even though
they technically have different top
level types pattern-matching is a really
useful feature that Scala provides in
the language you can think of it as
switch on steroids
you can match against class hierarchy
sequences values types anything that you
want this is a very basic example of
what pattern matching in Scala will do
so you'll take in some value and then
match on what that value is and return
some different values there the
underscore is the catch-all case in the
situation and you want to make sure that
you have that because otherwise you will
get an error a runtime exception the
compiler doesn't necessarily catch this
by default you can configure it so it
will but you want to make sure that you
provide that default case to catch the
anything else that you might have missed
you can get a little bit more
complicated with pattern matching and
this is where it starts to become really
powerful and so Scala has this feature
of sealed traits and this is a way of
saying that anything that extends that
trait is going to be the only things
that extend that trait and this is
useful in a pattern matching situation
because then if you're matching on an
ingredient you know that it's either
going to be a produce a meat or a dryad
it's never going to be anything else and
it can't possibly be anything else so
that's really useful for you you don't
have to then
create some catch-all caves know what to
do with the default there you have to
build that into the ingredients in taxi
you've defined above and then going back
to some of these functional paradigms
that Scala employs the idea of
higher-order functions is really useful
for the Scala language and this allows
you as the programmer to be expressive
and succinct in the way that you're
programming your whatever you're working
on at the time
functions are first class objects that
means that they can be assigned to
values they can be passed into functions
they can be returned from functions and
this treats them like a lot of other
things in your programs thinking of
functions as values is really powerful
here's an example of House colleague
uses higher-order functions so if you
have something a shelf life on your
ingredient trait you can basically split
this into two groups and so if you want
to partition the list of ingredients
that you have into two groups you can
then use the higher-order function of
partition to do that and we can compare
this to the Java code for this example
which is a lot more of your Bo's you
have to define a lot of different lists
to in order to populate these as the eat
now or eat later options and we can look
a little bit more at that higher-order
function so partition there is the
higher-order function and you because
it's taking in a function as its
argument and the function signature
there is indicated by that fat arrow
which is saying that it's a function
from int to type of boolean and so our
input there is that lambda I and then I
is compared to the number seven and that
returns the boolean
I will come back to this example in a
little bit but first let's talk about
why people would use Scala and why
people like this language as it is and
so one of the things that I was looking
at when I was writing this talk is my
company is in Scala we've been using
Scala since 2013 I wasn't there when we
made the decision to use Scala but this
is a case study that we did with a
company called typesafe back in 2013
about why my company shares we decided
to use Scala to confuse it a little bit
more types of changing the light button
which is what's on all of your lanyards
today typesafe is was created by the
founder of Scala and some other people
and they do Scala and Java consulting
they also work on the Scala compiler and
so there's some people there that in
addition to the work that people are
doing at the EPFL in Switzerland are
actively contributing to the open source
project and making the Scala compiler
better creating new releases managing
the open source community managing all
the projects that are in the core
library so anyway this is a case study
back from 2013 and the links there if
you want to read it all again this was
before my time but a lot of the reasons
in it are very familiar and things that
you hear a lot when you talk to
companies about why they decided to
choose Scala is a language for their
company I like this quote from the case
study which says share through
developers were quickly productive with
Scala which can be attributed to their
familiarity with Java scholars
expressiveness and lack of boilerplate
code which is some of the things that
we've already talked about some of the
things that we haven't talked about that
we're reasons that share if you wanted
to use Scala was we needed performance
stability and extensibility and share
through is add text so anytime you load
up a website you want to make sure that
that ad is loading and not slowing down
the rest of your browser session
something's very important for an ad
tech companies to be able to do
previously we were running on Ruby it's
really hard to write an ad server that
can return something in ten milliseconds
using Ruby we thought about becoming
expert Ruby developers but that wasn't
going to be productive for anyone so we
decided to pick any language performance
was probably the
biggest consideration that we made and
because the team was more familiar with
Java as opposed to C or C++ type
languages Scala was a natural contender
so we were basically deciding between
Java and Scala and I think because Scala
was a little bit more expressive at the
time and it was new and interesting they
ended up going with that we like the JVM
we also liked that Twitter had invested
a lot of resources into Scala and so
some of you might remember this from
probably I don't know five ten years ago
when Twitter was having a lot of
problems Twitter has a lot of capacity
issues and so when you get I don't know
ten million people all tweeting about
The Bachelor on Monday nights you have
issues where the Twitter starts to go
down that was actually a problems they
had the bachelor was taking down Twitter
and so they invested a ton of time
resources also rewriting a lot of the
Twitter back-end from Ruby to Scala and
in that process they started
contributing back to the community they
had demonstrated that Scala was a
production level language that could be
useful for their for their youth case
and they had ran a bunch of libraries do
everything from networking to JSON
parsing to a lot of like other
distributed systems type functions so
there's a lot of libraries and resources
and educational resources out there that
Twitter has contributed back to the
Scala community and so in the early
2010's a lot of people that were moving
over to Scala did so because they
thought it was a good idea because
Twitter had demonstrated that they could
do it too and so if Twitter can use this
language in production my tiny startup
probably can too
which i think is a good argument so that
was kind of share throughs reason for
wanting to use Scala
I also took to Twitter to get this
answer from people and here a couple of
my favorite responses so Katie McCaffrey
who is coincidentally an engineer at
Twitter said that it's accessible
functional programming on the JVM makes
sense
Chane here I like this one it's the most
functional easier to refactor language
that I can get paid to write so I think
that's important there are jobs in Scala
a lot of people hiring in Scala and I
think that's important that people will
pay you money to write in this language
I think there's a lot of other languages
out there that people find very
expressive and elegant that you're not
going to find anybody to pay you to
write so that's a good point and then
Travis here who is a probably one of the
nicest people I've ever met and also a
big open source contributor in the scala
community he has this interesting point
that's because it's a disaster but a
disaster that has a lot of the right raw
materials lying around all right there's
a lot to unpack there so we can talk
about a couple of this anybody was in a
dance talk this morning about effective
teams yeah so he gave a quick preview of
this which is you might have already
gotten the sense from this is that you
can do anything in Scala in like 14
million different ways and that just
grows exponentially and so there's all
this flexibility that the language gives
you to write the language in whatever
way you want you can write it as an
object-oriented style you can write it
as a very functional style you can mix
them both together it's really up to you
as the programmer and all that
flexibility is going to require a lot of
discipline on your team it gives you all
those materials to go crazy we saw like
the traits and the classes from the
object-oriented aside it just it has
everything that you could ever want and
this is probably my favorite tweet of
all time I think about this tweet
probably about once a month and I just
laugh which maybe says something about
my life but if you're not careful your
code can end up looking like this Bloody
Mary and that's a problem because as
delicious as individual pieces in there
might be like nobody wants to actually
deal with all of that at brunch so that
brings us to some sad truths about Scala
there's a spectrum of how you can write
your code that I've already talked about
so you can write it in the more Java
object oriented type of way or you can
bring in some of the influences from
functional languages like Haskell and
you can write your code anywhere along
this spectrum using any combination of
ideas along the spectrum and any single
function you can do both of these at
once it can be very confusing and
there's also a lot of disagreement in
the community about how to write your
code there is no Scala language syntax
guide at least not one from any one
official and in the language
I mean individual people are very
opinionated about how to write Scala but
there's not a standard from the
community also some of the purists on
the Haskell side can be kind of means
which is another unfortunate thing about
it and because a lot of these issues
about how you write code often come down
to the people on the team
that can be really hard to deal with as
a manager now I can tell you that
dealing with people is often a lot
harder than dealing with code and some
of you are probably familiar with this I
have a friend that's working on AI right
now and she always says that she just
wants to get people out of the equation
and then we won't have any problems
anymore oh I just thought this is funny
uh yeah if you write Haskell you're
never going to run it in production so
you end up getting a lot of Haskell
people that come to Scala because like
Shane said you can actually get paid to
write Scala sorry if there's any Haskell
purists in here I'm sure your lovely
people another so this is some Scala
source code the source code in Scala can
be really hard to follow this is a
particularly egregious example from a
third-party library but it's a
demonstration of what you might see if
you're looking at the code unfortunately
Scala it has really good like you might
be familiar with if you work in a
language like Java it has really good
support from IDE s and so a lot of
people use IDE s don't try to figure out
what that says I'll put it back on this
a lot of people use IDE s to look at
their code work through their code bases
as you would be able to get the overall
structure and a lot of the benefits that
IDs provide integrated development
environments if anybody's not familiar
things like Eclipse and IntelliJ both
have Scala plugins that are really
powerful and that means that you can
look at the source code which is really
useful but at the same time then you
sometimes see things like this and that
can be really intimidating and doesn't
actually end up helping you at all so
even though standard library have some
pretty crazy stuff in it and there's
reasons for a lot of the things that are
happening in the standard library but
sometimes like again I've been doing
Scala for four years I don't claim to be
any kind of expert in it and there's
still like days that I look at some of
the source code and I'm like what the
heck is going on here
and then I just end up feeling more
confused than I was originally so going
back to this partition example these are
equivalent and so this is an example of
two ways that you can write something in
Scala and there's actually like three
more ways that I can think of off the
top of my head to do this
and that underscore there is a
convenience function that basically does
that I fat arrow to I it's saying that
takes this like whatever element in my
partition in the list and give me a
shelf-life this can be hard to wrap your
head around if you haven't seen
something like this before I was at a
Scala conference a couple weeks ago and
somebody asked one of the the compiler
maintainer is what their favorite and
least favorite feature of Scala was and
their answer for both was the underscore
so it's one of those features of Scala
that's hotly debated it can be a
convenience function but it also loses
some of that documentation that you get
by writing out things a little bit more
explicitly and that can cause a lot of
confusion everybody's favorite from
Scala and Scala has what it calls
symbolic operators and so this is valid
code I literally just like Jam some
things on my computer and came up with
that and that will compile the reason
that that is allowed is for things like
this so it allows that so you can
right things like the plus function on
different types that makes it so you can
write that in a convenient way that
doesn't require you writing or special
casing that operator something different
but there's certain libraries out there
that don't have any kind of word alias
for their symbolic operators and again I
made that one up but it's not that far
off and some of the things that you
might see in Scala and if you ever try
to like understand what a function is
doing and some of the the IDE plugins
for this like don't catch some of these
compiler plugins you can't see the
source code and then you try googling
for like backslash - - parentheses and
like you don't get much out of that so
that's a problem with Scala there's talk
on martin urder c who is the founder he
he wants to build into a next feature a
releasable language the idea that every
symbolic operator has to also have a
word that comes with it and that you
know might be descriptive of what that
function does which can be helpful
through the programmer but again adding
more ways to do things why not and this
is probably one of my biggest issues
with Scala is that a lot of Scala
instruction and I was talking to some
people about this at lunch is a lot of
introductory resources for Scala is very
littered with jargon and so you'll I
probably used a lot of jargon here today
that you might be thinking like Kelly
what are you talking about and I
apologize for that please make me aware
of that if anything I said doesn't make
sense or is unfamiliar I like to check
that in myself that I know what I'm
talking about something that I don't
share context was with people but you
know you'll hear things like closures
and lambdas which I definitely talked
about monads Pro functors semi groups
like you don't need to know what all
those things are but you end up hearing
about that even if you're like a week in
the Scala because people think it's cool
to talk about a lot of this stuff this
was evident after there was a conference
in March a Scala conference in March in
New York and there was a software
engineer at Twitter that attended the
conference and she was baffled by all of
the jargon that she heard and couldn't
keep up with the conference even though
she
is a software engineer at Twitter it's
not exactly easy to get a job there
you've got all these people Twitter
probably employees like 25% of all the
Scala developers it's probably an
exaggeration but they employ a lot of
Scala developers and know the language
very well and can help somebody like her
learn the language but she was still
taken aback because all these people
were just dropping all this jargon
constantly about all these cool things
that they could do and so this comes
down to a lot of the the major
principles in Scala and my issues in
Scala that I can summarize into just
because you can doesn't mean you should
and that's something that Scala makes it
easy to can all those things but it
doesn't give you a lot of restrictions
on what you should or should not do
despite all of that Scala is still
pretty awesome I think some of the
reasons that it's awesome is because
it's powerful because it allows you as
the programmer to be creative and
flexible and there are a lot of jobs
learning or using Scala and I read a
report recently that said learning Scala
and getting a job in Scala can earn you
a 22 percent pay bump so that's pretty
cool keep that in mind
reasons people write in Scala alright so
if you are interested in this and you
want to get started how are you going to
go about it there are literally
thousands of resources out there I trust
everybody in this room knows how to
Google but I'm going to give you four I
think resources for getting started with
the language the first one is the
language repple and so you can download
that here with the link that I provided
I will post these slides immediately
after this talk and so all of these
links are available for you I play
around with a rep will play around the
code see what you can and can't do I
think that's a really good way in any
language to get started with something
so wanted to make that resource
available the biggest language for
teaching is going to be this Coursera
course it's put on by a combination of
the Scala Center and Coursera and so
what is the Scala Center the Scala
Center is a relatively new initiative it
was started last year by some of the
people at EPFL in Switzerland to be a
govern
body for the Scala community and so
their focus is not on compiler
development as much as it is on
education and open source initiative and
so some of the stuff that they've been
working on is writing these courses
making them available these are
available for free there's four of these
courses to get you started on Scala I
think at least three of them are
available and by the time that you
finish all three of those fourth one
will probably be available and so
they're big on education big on open
source and making the community more
welcoming some of the stuff that they
worked on in the last year was revamping
the code of conduct for Scala that was
something that had been sitting around
for a while and hadn't been touched her
enforced for a while and so wanted to
basically give that a refresh and make
sure the code of conduct we had a way to
enforce it what would happen if you were
on Stack Overflow and someone was being
an asshole how do you handle that
situation they also opened up a new
forum discussion and so they use a tool
called discourse now instead of Google
Groups and discourse is a very good way
of threading discussions and responses
so if you have any questions about the
language you can post something there
and people can start a discussion with
you and the code of conduct is enforced
there so that's really the best place to
get started you can go to Coursera the
first course I've linked to there and
then like I mentioned there will be
three more that follow that the second
place that I would recommend you heading
is if you already have some familiarity
with scholar you don't like doing these
massive open online courses like the
Coursera course a company called 47°
has put together this website full of
scala exercises and so these are in the
browser and the one that I've linked to
here is the very basic beginner one for
learning the language itself but they
also do a lot of these exercises for
learning how to work with different
libraries that you might encounter and
so even if you get to the point where
you're using scala in your job and you
want to know how to work with some json
library you can go here and kind of get
a feel for how that library works by
running through some of these exercises
and so the 47° people are super great
really nice people and they've put
together this resource for giving back
to the community and last but not least
is this organization called skull
Brij you might be familiar with the
bridge program from other languages the
bridge program was started about 10
years ago with rails bridge and the idea
with rails bridge is to teach
introductory programming to
underrepresented groups and give people
a safe space to learn and a weekend
workshop they can get together ask
questions hack away learn a new language
or a skill and there's some great things
about this so first of all if you are in
an underrepresented group you can attend
one of these workshops I was talking to
someone in Chicago a couple of weeks ago
I think there's going to be a scholar
bird in Chicago in June so stay tuned
for that and also if you're not in an
underrepresented group teaching is a
really great way to learn and I think
some of the most valuable experiences
that I have and I can think of when I
was learning how to code come from those
moments where you go to somebody more
senior than you and you're like okay how
do I do this and you're expecting an
answer and instead of giving that answer
that person says I don't know let's
figure it out together and that's a
really valuable moments of the people
and I think most of the people in this
room could be at that point already and
so you can definitely give back to the
community and learn some stuff of
yourself by attending one of these
workshops and contributing back to
people that may be less capable of
teaching themselves that kind of stuff
or just have left less confidence which
is really one of the reasons that
workshops like this exist so if you get
any baseline knowledge or even if you
don't have any baseline knowledge you
can be a TA and help out all right now
you are ready to go and learn more about
Scala or maybe I've convinced you that
you don't want to learn more about Scala
either way if you do you have the
resources to get started again I would
love any feedback of anything I've
talked about is unclear I think one of
the biggest things that the language
needs to work on is making it more
welcoming to beginners and there are
several initiatives right now that are
making that better so things like the
Scala Center and Scala bridge that we're
both started in the last year are going
to be really big for making this
language easier to ramp up from people
that are outside of the current
community
remember Scala will give you power
flexibility and creativity
and have fun with that but don't forget
that that flexibility comes with a cost
remember to be disciplined with the code
that you write don't try to do too much
bring it back to those ideas of
functional programming of making your
code easier to understand and I think
you can do a lot and that you'll really
enjoy diving in to Scala once again my
name is Kelly Robinson here's my contact
information and thank you for listening
ok thank you Kelly and thank you
everyone if you have not already done so
please go into the application and give
her a great rating there were a few
questions like so we'll do those and
we'll see if there are any additional
questions in the room let's see so what
is the best way to find Scala bridge
meetups there is a Twitter account that
tweets up most of them and I would say
go to Twitter / Scala bridge there's
also a websites calibrates org okay next
question
does it have any testing frameworks
support yes it does it has probably
about five testing frameworks of course
and there's definitely like 70 different
ways you can test things in Scala but
there's a big one that's called Scala
tests as it would be and there's pretty
good documentation for that and also the
the maintainer of that is a super super
nice human which is really great for
wanting to understand the testing
librarian so if you have any questions
about how to get started with testing
you can post on some of those forums and
you'll definitely get a lot of help
there and then the next one is somewhat
related question how would you rate the
available tooling for Scala for example
things like running unit tests
automatically as you save or caching
compiler errors as you type any language
can do that but a language may or may
not lend itself to those uses yes so
there's some things that are built into
some of the IDs that can do this
automatically one of the things that
Scala has that I didn't talk about is a
build tool called the Scala build tool
and that's known as SBT &amp;amp; SBT is
probably how you're going to do a lot of
your dependency management and also how
you're going to run a lot
your tests and so one of the cool things
about that is there's a little function
in it that you can do like till the test
and it will recompile and run your test
every time you type a change and save it
and you can also do that with like tilde
compile and it will recompile any time
you make a change and so that's built
into SBT and its really useful while
you're typing things and if you hit save
and you're like oh crap I put the wrong
type there oh crap I return the wrong
type there and was expecting the right
type and that kind of stuff okay what
would you say the advantages of Scala
over go what would you say are the
advantage of this color ever go aside
from the existing Java libraries that
can be leveraged and object-oriented
support I mean they're very different
languages so a language like go if
you're doing any kind of systems
programming I did go for about a year
before this current job and it's really
great for a lot of like your closer to
the metal and go programs are really
satisfying to write because I think
somebody said like you start at the top
you write your code to the bottom and
you're done and that's like how you
write and that imperative procedural
style program Scala you can do a lot of
different things it can be more exciting
for you as the programmer because you
get to think about all the ways that you
can write your code which we know and
love but it's not as opinionated one of
the things that I personally love about
go is go func and Scala is starting to
add something like that but it's not as
opinionated as something like go so I
think the biggest difference for me is
there are going to be some differences
in the use cases for the types of things
that you're doing but go is a much more
opinionated language and so if that
works for your team and the the stuff
that you're trying to accomplish and
that might be the best choice for you if
you come from a background that has more
Java development or Java development
expertise or maybe you're in a market so
it's easier to hire Java developers
Scala might be a better choice for you
okay what are the shortcomings of other
programming languages that Scala is
addressing that's a good question hmm be
nice don't be
I don't know if I have a good answer for
that is anybody here familiar enough
with Scala to be able to answer that
properties yeah I was I was telling
George earlier yeah the multiple
inheritance that I talked about with
traits is pretty cool there are other
languages that do that but not a lot of
ant lling would just do that well I
unfortunately am NOT a great person to
compare Scala to Java because I never
actually did any Java development I know
how to read Java code because I have to
read a lot of the source code but I
don't know enough about the language to
comment on it too much okay and there
will decide to be available I will tweet
them right after this I think that's the
last one we have in the tool are there
any additional questions just kind of
related to one of those previous
questions but like I mean when you think
about go there's like a reason it was
created like why was Scala created just
because the professor was having fun
yeah I think that's why a lot of things
in Scala were done was because somebody
wanted to have some fun with something
um his reasoning for it as he wanted to
I mean he's a professor he's an academic
he wasn't trying to solve any kind of
like industry problem with this and he's
still not a really nice guy but like
he's a little out of touch with some of
the industry use cases and he does a
pretty good job of trying to understand
that by like talking to the community
but it's still like you that's one of
the reasons that he started types a
flashlight fund is to bridge that gap
between some of the academic influences
of the language and the things that
people actually started using it for
those dang users they always do things
you don't intend them to do his
motivations for refer to Rey I think the
name Scala comes from scalable and so
you wanted to write a scalable language
and make something that was very
expressive I might be putting words in
his mouth but that's the impression that
I've got base tons of some of the stuff
that I've heard and read and talked to
him about okay any other questions in
the room
all right thank you everyone for joining
