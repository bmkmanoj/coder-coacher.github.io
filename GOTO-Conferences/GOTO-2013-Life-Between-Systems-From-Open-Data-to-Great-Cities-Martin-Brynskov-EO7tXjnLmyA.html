life between systems which i think is
really what we need to think about
because what we want to do with open
data open government government in
general is to create spaces for life and
while we build systems me included and
we tend to focus the systems well that
happens when you build systems and we
actually want to focus on the life
between the system and there's a nice
parallel so just so you know who you're
looking at this is me i have a masters
in information studies and smell stuff
did my PhD at the computer science
department with lego looking into how
the mobile phones were changing the way
tween girls play make Lego weren't
interested they are now and now i'm
professor at the University of office
coordinating all the Smart City
activities so not just technology but
business health you name it and I do
some stuff by myself as well so that's
probably why I'm here I'm part of some
centers so the smart cities we have a
center called digital urban living
that's a great place if you get the
chance to combine cabbie advanced
visualization interaction really fun and
now we do this participatory IT thing so
participatory IT is no at the core of
what I want to talk about here we also
put out a book it's in Danish so I'm
just gonna prove that we put it out
right so the life between the systems I
think that's what I've been I have been
doing for the last at least decade but
there was a guy who did that before do
you know this guy anybody knows this guy
jaan gale he's a danish architect and he
wrote the famous book life between
buildings using public space he was
banned from the school of architecture
for not looking at the buildings but
life between the buildings see he he
this is in the 60s so the high modernist
era when you put up you know the large
urban plans with you know efficient
housing and so on and he actually his
wife suggested to him I look look what
what what what's the kind of life that
you'll produce
you know the conditions for here then he
started looking into how people were
living in these no great places and one
of the things he found out was that if
you have kids you tend not to want to
live above the fifth floor why because
you cannot see them playing down there
so it's not just about putting people
into a house and have them feel you know
safe from weather and you know have a
place to sleep and eat and so on there's
a lot of context that you have to
consider and I think it was really a
great talk we heard just before this one
and because the kind of thought that you
have put into how people use your your
systems rings very much you know along
these lines and I'm sad to say that
we're really bad here in Denmark this as
you would have gathered from from the
people who came up here later I'll I'll
work a little on that so this is the
inspiration said let's let's not look
actually too much on the system's yeah
sure they need to be there but let's
look at how what are the conditions for
life that we create how are the
conditions for life that you create
using open data or it's a big problem
because like you said what's open dates
that's a lot of things so from my
perspective I have a bit broader
approach it's not just about the open
data it's within this smart cities
challenge which is basically the
challenge of everything because what's
not in the city what's not connected to
city somehow everything okay so I I come
from this context the open data must
work to some purpose somewhere to some
people right should be obvious that's
not the conclusion you would get to if
you look at the daily systems and just
to be very clear this is not a new thing
this is sort of a timeline you don't
have to be able to read read it but it
goes from the 60s and up until the
present day and we've had all kinds of
cities they're just the worm called
smart cities call of all kinds of things
technology great intelligent smart
saying
but they were essentially about how we
could you know do things better tried
again and again and again again and and
people have actually been very good at
this for a long time so one of the first
rethinking of a city based on a you know
new kind of infrastructure was the
futurama done by GM general motors in
New York during the world fair in 39 and
it was it was a vision of a city that
was remodeled around this fabulous
infrastructure called the automobile and
it was really really well done this is a
some decades later where GM made another
iteration on this but what's interesting
about this picture i think is actually
not the car it's the fact that Mommy and
the girl are buying the groceries why
not the guy why I mean we don't have
these cars actually they look a lot like
the Elat that if any Danes are here the
first really popular electrical car and
so so we may in fact say that we have
these cars that didn't become popular
but what I see when I say this picture
is that I see a lot of stereotypes
cultural stereotypes I'm not going to
bore you with cultural stereotypes but
just to say one thing is getting the
technology out there another thing is to
have it you know support a certain kind
of culture and it wasn't just the the
car all kinds of infrastructures
infrastructures for life this is a sort
of algorithmic way of building it's from
67 you can still see it in Montreal
anybody from Canada here nope well it's
an impressive building and housing
project all the houses all the cells are
just alike and then they have been been
put in nice ways except in 67 you didn't
have that more much dynamics you could
work with think what you could do with
you know really interesting robotics
into them stuff today the problem about
many of these visions for future cities
or future
society's is that they've been sort of
spectacular would you deal with I think
you said that that was like the everyday
hassle these aren't solving everyday
hassle they're spectacular they're made
to look great and yay let's get there we
won't build this they were put on show
and that was the case in 39 and it's
still the case when you come to see many
of these infrastructure visions been to
South Korea anyone yeah have you visited
the Songdo the the greenfield city was
built right it's very much a spectacle
it's a showcase and it's not very lively
it's not like a city that you would go
to as a tourist so the problem is the
many of these visions they actually
don't get to what's important for people
they yes they build fantastic
infrastructure's but they miss the whole
point and there's a science fiction
writer called and sorry I'm oh I didn't
blind anyone with a laser frederik pohl
he just died unfortunately but he said a
good science fiction story should be
able to predict not the automobile but
the traffic jam and I think we can see
we can see some parallels to that when
we today deploy systems we can see a lot
of visions about oh wow great systems
single sign-on yeah but they forgot to
think about the you know the life that
those systems created the interesting
part is that even in back in the 50s
they were also pretty good at spotting
the traffic jam not always the
technology companies that's still the
case but other people so let's have an
example here of a very modern situation
with a lot of complications
no no can I just open it everything is
automated
he's visiting the family
is the uncle of the house
Wow right design is break hey
it's a wonderful film and tatty of
course he's you actually also made
traffic so he he and listen she and
visit this this cacophony of systems
that we're having now I think that's a
pretty good example of what's happening
when we go online try to use these awful
systems and I'm going to show you a few
Danish systems just you know to scare
everyone you know them all the Danes
will laugh and look down and say oh man
so we of course we have single sign-on
tied to your social security number and
incidentally to your DNA as well works
for us that's the name ID should be
called Bank ID now it's being sold off
to whoever detail purse that's the the
monopoly email infrastructure but that's
next year becoming mandatory for
speaking to authorities let's let's look
at IC 4 if you go to have you been to
God's been nice nice nice venue just
around the corner really the old freight
train yard you can go a really wonderful
cultural production place now go up on
the tip like standing you know in
Titanic like you stand on tip you could
you see out and what you can see is the
IC for graveyard it's all the fabulous
next-generation diesel trains that we
bought from you know the Italians that
couldn't really make actually as I could
make some great trains and late with a
signed by the guy who made Ferraris and
so on and they could also connect them
and I'm kind of nice but the software to
hook them up didn't work so actually
that grounded they're not supposed to
know go really interesting how not to do
it so this is how you log on just for
you poor souls who know it and don't
know it there's a wonderful java applet
that of course doesn't work on mobile or
anything an applet without kinds of
trickery to make it run so when you
actually
get inside this is detail post this is
mine and if you go to your inbox which
of course is not what is shown when you
enter you see this and and I'm I'm not
stupid with you know systems and it took
me know while to figure out how to
actually create a message so so this is
the new post neat post that's how you
create meshes no no way making it easy
like a big nice button for you i'll
create a new ok so just just to say that
we really we would want you to come and
do some systems for us please the model
clearly doesn't work and so like fairy g
from Apple said recently I'll bash Apple
later and so the interesting thing is as
we saw actually the good system is a
smart city all the good things that we
could have dreamed about they're already
here I mean they're in Hawaii and maybe
someday they'll come to us too but they
were here in different ways and it's
it's not I mean I chose a mobile phone
well actually Chris speed did but the
mobile phone is here for a reason
because many of the the services that
are really really perceived as helpful
the based on mobile and I was really
happy to see you talking about you know
simple things like texting and SMS
services because that's that's how you
reach directly to to where people on
their lives so the interesting thing is
that people will happily buy you know
equipment digital equipment to
instrument the Smart City out of their
own pocket for you know hundreds of
dollars they'll happily do that but they
hate the systems that govern may make
how's that how's that so I mean we have
these systems that work really nicely
y'all know tripadvisor by the way office
is on the front page of tripadvisor if
you have the city guides that's another
story how we end up there and banking
slowly coming to the Western world I
mean after Africa and Japan there's this
really nice texting service for stamps
for you know old snail mail but just
just
I mean you just write one word and send
it to 19 19 BAM you'll get a coat back
you write it on the envelope and dump it
works that's smart cities that those are
smart systems and those are the ones
that and I mean that's exactly thinking
that that you have that we would like to
see so my argument is that we actually
know both what the bad systems are and
the good systems are now then the
problem is not anymore how to create a
Smart City because we know should be
these nice systems the problem then
becomes what kind of city do we want
that's sort of a harder problem do you
know about wicked problems yeah so the
ten sort of characteristics of a very
wicked problem like you don't know when
you've solved it and stuff like that
creating a city is a wicked problem
obviously so to attain the good city
what what's the good city now we're a
bit back to Young gale and creating no
life between the buildings and so by my
first conclusion that I like to share
with you to carry on for the rest of the
talk is that this smart city and that
includes open data that's first and
foremost actually a cultural and
organizational transition I think
looking from from the previous
presentation that that carries pretty
well I mean yes we can build the systems
when we have the right people to work
with both internally in our governor in
our organization and in you know our
partners and it's very much its kind of
thinking about how we actually want to
go about and create nice societies so we
look more about the context for the
systems than the actual systems because
we are system makers we're confident we
can build them so it's not just totally
haphazard what has happened there's
actually a bit of structure to this
development the three phases just to be
brief and the first one is where
many of these efforts have been
clustered around you know a physical
place so you build us a smart part of
town we put all the tech companies the
next phase is where you build it up
around an entire sector that could be
energy could be health care could be
education so it's not just you have a
lot of places where this plays out it's
tied to all the intricacies of the
sector and at the moment many many of
cities and then regions and countries
that are you know forward-thinking there
in this face they're pretty good ties
within the sector's but but the last one
actually going across the silos is super
different you don't think you'll be
talked too much about how you then
manage the cross silo of the
dissemination of good practices and so
on but it's it's super hard because so
much is tied to the culture of a
department even you know I'm at the
University it's horrible so um we
actually we would really like to see how
we can take this further in a way that's
not just making efficient cities but
it's actually creating cities where
those who live there feel that they are
part of building it I mean I'm from the
participatory IT send or so while or you
know city it's Greek I have a degree in
Greek and I get to use it like once
every year and city in Greek means means
not just the space in the building it
means to people i mean we the people
whatwhat's when your citizen what is it
well you have the obligation to defend
your city it also means that you make
your part of the city and I mean the
conclusion is that whenever you speak
about cities it's not just a generic
city it's actually I mean it's soon gets
very political I mean look at the u.s.
today it's it's not just about you know
doing things right it's about where you
want to go now just two simple examples
of how mmm
the way we design technology embed
certain political values I mean and this
is of course from Rio it's the IBM
control center I spoke on Thursday
Aquino to side by side with Rick
Robinson from IBM who was probably not
you know seeing this as the perfect
example of how IBM would do it
everywhere but there was a specific
context in Rio but it's just to say that
this is well one thing it's not very
participatory it's rather one way kind
of thing now let's look just outside of
these buildings another place in Rio
it's a favela poor part of town called
Virginia it has the population of same
size as always so quarter of a million
all living in less than one square
kilometer it's pretty dense it's totally
open so oops sorry the the sewer is open
the the garbage you've want to get rid
of something you just do that even
electricity if you want power you get it
and also in terms of you know
information many of the houses they have
a number on them know like like we do
like 10 or 15 or 30 to the difference is
that in racine yer the numbers don't
mean anything apart from you know the
fact that they're nice to have so you
can you can choose your own number it's
open in the wildest sense of the word
but it's not necessarily place you would
want to live actually they're reluctant
to getting more structured because then
have to pay for the power and stuff like
that it is it is truly you know
participatory you can use the city you
can use what's around you're allowed to
do that well there are people you have
to ask but that so these are two
extremes you could say and I think what
they are telling us is that to
paraphrase the other quote that it's
it's super easy to do something digital
yeah sure we can do that open is
actually also very easy we just open up
but we we might not want to do that
getting getting it right is what we want
to do so if we take these as sort of the
outliers sore the super controlled
mm-hmm I don't think many cities would
want to be designed by Steve Jobs
probably be really cool but also not not
very inclusive or the totally open
bottom-up thingy I mean they're not
really for many of us real options so we
need to figure out what's what's the
style what are the different things that
we want to build with the systems we
bill of course you put in your own
whatever where you're from so um I like
to put to you usually i might have you
know clickers or SMS you know you can
you can vote while while you watch this
but it would be great just you know to
raise your hands there are five
questions so what's the primary
motivation for throwing out you can say
open data or or the smart city solutions
and here they are is it to have good
tech solutions it's to you know be more
sustainable better about the environment
it's about creating ownership better
economy efficiency it's the quality of
life so I want to see some hands how
many think that having tech solutions
out there is the primary motivation for
doing these things from your perspective
what well I'm not counting but I'm once
so if you have to then no one oh that's
actually like the politicians last week
environmental issues a couple of hands
right ownership right little more
economy bettering the economy about the
same as ownership I'd say hi Miguel it's
been a while quality of life everyone ja
Jan Gehl one
the point is that that's what you so the
politicians at the danish planning
association meeting that they were like
800 people and you know third with
politicians rest were planners and urban
developers in that audience everyone
said either ownership or quality of life
so they go back into the city's what
happens they have to talk to the IT
department and the finance minister and
then something happens it's really
interesting that we all want to do this
but then something else happens so
that's really one of the basic issues
how come we have these visions and then
they go all detail post and named ed
what what happened so to me that's
that's actually the real benefit if we
can change something there okay a bit
back to the cities this is a the world
population and the red half are the ones
who do not live in cities they live
outside cities the three other sections
are cities blue more than 10 million
sols mega cities Green between 1 and 10
million inhabitants and the yellow one
is cities with less than 1 million which
would include hours my point here is
that often when we talk about solutions
for cities be it open data or whatever
we tend to focus on the mega cities the
dark has and the you know Tokyo's of the
world but there are more of these so
actually it's interesting to figure out
what works in our house and other places
just just saying now here the next slide
is the most compressed argument wide why
is that you will see in this
presentation this is how I see the main
challenges and how the answers to these
connect so to me I see the the general
problem we're facing is actually
complexity I think many would say okay
so let's open up let's break it up small
assists and more accessible yeah right
but then comes the next question how
open and open how
then that leads to a discussion about
the rights we need to implement we talk
while tech community often talk about
rights but the politicians they don't
get it and then something else happens
and actually as soon as you go into the
sector bead energy or health care or
education or whatever cultural scene
then there's a disconnect people talking
in different languages so so it's it's
really difficult to translate through
this and I would say that that what we
need to get out of this stalemate you
know yes we want livable cities whoa
then we talk about IT budget that is to
create the new kind of partnerships and
open data is very much embedded in this
that was it so to give you a quick
overview of what's happening in Denmark
which I think would be interesting here
because they're quite different it'll be
a quick rundown and I'm coordinating
together with the urban housing and
rural affairs ministry the Danish smart
city network and incidentally we we have
strong involvement from all five regions
in Denmark and I know the office work
better because I I was one of the
cofounders of this smart ah whose
initiative so it's exactly trying to
build these partnerships it's it's it's
built on you could say to developmental
tracks one is more strategic and
actually not so well funded actually not
really funded and there's a then there's
a project one and that's much more
that's like the internet week office
which you will soon I think hear more
about it's it's about the open data
portal that's being launched and so on
so we try to separate the strategic
thinking from the you know
implementation so on it's based on a
model called top up which is the best of
top-down and bottom-up and it's actually
marketed as a scandinavian third way
this is how it looks does a it's
available online if you want to see it
and the purpose is not to build this new
society but actually to coordinate and
make sure that these disconnects are
connect
it so this top up is basically everyone
and his mother and I really mean that we
had a lot of work groups working and
some of these work groups never went
anywhere and some became really and the
open data actually became quite big so
just to show that we actually have
things on open data so it's built on the
secant to a platform it's a distributed
platform you can have your own server so
university has a server the city has a
server the region has a server I mean
you can just build the private companies
Alexandra Institute has the server and
they just exchange data right of course
some a small business they would or a
small organization and NGO for instance
they would not want to host a server so
the city offers that a sort of public
space digital public space yeah put it
here don't take responsible for you need
to pick a license and so on but it's
it's offered please or if you're the
region you have healthcare data ah don't
put that out right so you have your own
server and you just open up you know on
a need to share basis this interfaces
with the initiative in Copenhagen other
cities and the Danish sort of public
drive for open data I think that's how
how these things should be done and it
it's not just you know little things
like oh let's put this totally useless
data online and well there's a 3d map of
office all the kind of stuff that you
used to pay for but but it's us also I
mean it's kind of thinking this kind of
distributed scalable architecture
thinking is also being built into how
the things like the the metering in the
district heating system is working and
it's not totally integrated yet at all
but it's the same kind of thinking so
when there's a tender out for a power
metering in houses and you know
centrally and all this infrastructure
stuff a lot of effort is created both on
the instrument
entation side so the sensor side and the
user interface size whether it decide
whether it's its users in their own
homes or its operators to have you know
many options so there's an open
infrastructure where you and the
business you can go for a tender and you
can actually make a make a business but
still the city has a flexible
infrastructure really nice I think ha so
rethinking the city and and all this is
basically seeing that this new part of
organization if is the new thing not the
stuff I mean anybody could do a data
portal and maybe we can even do it as
nicely as they do in hi sorry it's what
happens with the people around it
there's even a label you can slap on
your stuff if you think you want to show
you from ours Copenhagen and that was an
interesting development following the
talks there they have a big smart city
initiative also and quite well
coordinated and they're focusing now
interestingly on open data and you can
go online and see what the company in
connecting thing is all about all about
and it'll be be it'll be scaled up
considerably over the coming periods in
alibaug just north of here this is
strong City University cooperation which
is sort of central to many of the
successful initiatives anywhere you look
and I mean in all bore there they did
the GSM standard right they know how to
do hard infrastructure really well but
they're also focusing on the soft
infrastructure side Kallenbach it's a
small city on Ceylon it uses a tenth of
the Danish energy ten percent so of
course they focus on on demonstrating
clean tech and how that folds into your
own making City vile a small city south
of hours they call it smart city in I
height or you know the very citizen near
thing and actually that that initiative
grew out of the knowledge center for
integration so the people who have to
you know accommodate people who are on
totally foreign to Danish culture they
build someone
for mobile applications and I mean
technical services to reach these people
so the point is that you don't know
where in a city this start it doesn't
have to be in the IT department where
everybody knows about Drupal and open
data could be in the integration
services the point is you need you need
somehow to connect all these potential
fertile bets for you know smart city
development or stupid term but what good
things happen yeah how many in here are
Danish okay the other way around how
many are not okay so interesting almost
5050 so if we take this together
actually the informal organization seems
to be a key to where things are
happening so we're an organization
allows for sort of in-between space ways
isn't totally formalized and it isn't
totally you know random and favela style
that seems to to to be a fertile way to
go about okay so agile doesn't work for
top management we heard right and that's
sort of the point about top up we need
need both it's tied to the overall
strategic goals of a city of course open
data doesn't change the overall goals of
the city of course it doesn't it is
focused on partnerships and just to
iterate actually well the actual
instruments hmmm we can build them the
problem is that open data open big data
open government instead of things clean
tech they don't create great cities they
don't create great societies in and of
themselves it's what you do with them
that also means that that many of these
indicator models of you know how smart
cities are how prepared they are which
includes openness update and so on they
they cannot be used to actually act on
we like this one because three danish
cities are in top five its european
middle sized cities or something but
they're useless in making it you all
know these structural models well maybe
just forget them
because you cannot create anything from
them it's just a dissection of what's
already there now what we need is
maturity and phase model so that we can
benchmark how far are we from what we
want to achieve and a few good models I
think our are starting to appear so what
actually seems looks like the most
places that are successful in using many
of these technologies and and you know
rethinking cities in light of technology
technology development it's actually
looking like the speed boats are are
much more efficient than the super
tankers I mean a speedboat can then turn
into a supertanker but but it's much
easier to identify what's driving this
and where we want to go the problem is
of course that that is also in itself a
complex organization and exercise to
have you know internal and regional
national and all kinds of you know
follow what's going on but still if you
have motivated people that are allowed
to work on good stuff they will fill out
fill out the gaps ok now comes the
second most condensed argument wise
slide in the talk this one these are my
proposition for the five formats of
these smart city solutions or things and
and the point is actually that that only
the first one is actual tools and
systems that would include open data the
practice around them the partnerships
you need to create them the governance
models and the guides guides meeting
people my physical people who can go out
oh no you're on seven through you do
like that those four much more important
than that one not to say we shouldn't be
good at building systems of course we
should so back to open data I few slides
in Danish but I really like the graphics
I'm sure you can see them this is
looking at the problem from the
government side this is how it looks yes
we know technology is you know driving
the development and we're not really
following at least enough
denmark ok so we open up we have this
gray digital city what do you want to do
it this is this government yeah we want
to what do you want us to stick it today
they don't a bit I mean it's really hard
being that position I'm sure we have we
all met people who want to do it but
what so many of these systems are very
good at pushing out data but how do we
make this a loop so the people can
participate and contribute and then
there's a whole value of thing sorry
google but so this is scandinavia bless
you this is Scandinavia we have a you
know a sense of community a sense of
society that we would actually probably
most of us like to retain so we cannot
just put everything in the cloud and
forget something has to be done and
first first and foremost how do you how
do you react on this feeling that you
have to do something that's looking at
it from the government side many are you
know enlightened and know how to do
things but the broad picture is it's
really hard to act even if you want to
now there's the industry perspective on
the data economy and you all know the
sad story there isn't one this is until
can Anderson and well there's profit for
companies but that doesn't create a data
economy you all seen these you know
billions and billions of euros and
dollars in aid Mackenzie Accenture we're
going to make a lot of yes sure because
I mean there's technology and everything
so of course data and and open data will
will be part of the economy but for the
moment it's not it's not a coherent
concept it's just not there just to make
sure that that that we agree on that so
what can we do what do we have actually
in our hands well we have this thing
called open data now the problem is it's
not just data it's different kinds of
later like you also talked about and
some of the data is you know really
helpful so like mapping data things that
are readily available to our hands to do
good stuff with and it's it's out there
but it's certainly not all the date and
certainly not all the data that's easy
to put out there because well this could
be neutral but in a way ugly because it
is this great data it's it's gold under
your pillow but it's really just exhaust
from the systems it sits there and
there's no business case on freeing this
data I mean why should a metering
company Oh use a lot of resources on
opening up for the meeting data they
were to all which goal is gold mine yes
it's the new economy yeah okay so
where's my business model it's not there
okay so it's not being opened so so
that's the ugly part of the neutral but
it's really just the who cares they do
we don't know there's no incentive to
put it out and then there's the bad data
depends on whose perspective I that
could be you know disrupting a business
making web servers that make something
transparent it could be you know
revealing government practices being bad
or something so that's bad for some
people it's good for some other people
but as long as it's bad for the people
who have to make the decision to open
the data hmm maybe not gonna lie happen
really know quickly and in a well-funded
and nice man i'll be sort of really good
low priority thanks to ben Hammersley
for devising this this this is spectrum
so whenever we look at data of course we
need to look at what kind of data and
who wanted out you remember the
speedboat who's on board and where do
you want to go think about so who what's
the agenda here actually on the open
data portal in Aarhus we had the taxi
bills of the local authorities you know
politicians that was yanked pretty
quickly I'm not sure it's up yet it's
it's publicly available but it wasn't
like the prime showcase interesting
so what can you do with open data this
is City Hall maybe you've seen it just
out there and just for the architecture
ones this is not cement its really
really nice stone up from Norway please
it's a modernistic you no wonder peace
walk inside it's great now what we did
was something called City buck report
basically you should be able to file a
bug report on anything I mean not just
the whole industry but literally
literally anything and and here's
everything in the city all departments
and you just something's wrong my school
my son school isn't working well about
one interface how hot can it be and we
want to show that and we actually did
show how the interaction with the city
based on the public records of you know
emails and letters going back and forth
forth how efficiently they were handled
historical data on freaking City Hall
and again this is super easy no it's not
super easy it costed a lot of time
resources lesson maybe you if you're in
this room I mean he was the manager of
putting up all the LEDs 5500 was a lot
of work but it was relatively easy it's
not complex task now the complex task
was to get permission to do it actually
we could do that because this model was
partnership but then came the concerned
phone calls oh you're revealing our I
mean that's that's the real beauty of a
provo type like this not a prototype or
a prototype to show hey it's no problem
we can just do it you want a simple
interface to reporting anything the city
yeah here it is it's even built I mean
tied into a nice open data structure and
we can give it you know significance in
you know public space but actually it's
really hard to do and not because the
technology always just decided to
introduce what's called track-and-trace
so whenever you say something to the
city you get a link back to your case
you don't yet but that's the intention
and one you get that link within 24
hours and then you can track your case
like you can track your blu-ray from
amazon this happened sort of out of this
conversation is it's more complicated
than that but it's just to say that
doing things can actually even though
we're not going out to solve stuff right
away it can open up up a design space
where we can then go in and these little
speedboats can get some some fuel so
that was a project this is a real bill
thing if you go down to the harbor front
it's the new library and citizen
services center being built cost a
fortune but it has all these things
media facades and open data helpdesk
included so the basic point this is not
about technology well of course it's
about technology but its first and
foremost about changing culture and
organization you should always finish
with some advice so here's some advice
in case you slept through the whole talk
don't focus on the shiny solutions well
it's fun but it's not what's really
going to change anything be nimble and
you'll speedboats not pyramids smart is
not a feature it's an experience while
you know it oh it's supposed to be smart
then then you kind of know it sucks and
please remember that a city is a
rights-based partnership taking place
somewhere I do have one extra gear so
open data this is this this picture is
chock-full of data it's stored in a form
called DNA now if you want to know the
life forms that on this lake up until
recently you will go out and you would
count them find them take a sample of
the water and count how many of the
little critters are bottled up that's
taking some time right like they do it
for a couple of legs every year just to
know what's there who's swimming who's
Sarah what can you do now is a little
snaps glass
just take a sample wherever in the lake
and do a DNA analysis of it and you'll
know same thing you'll know what DNA
based lifeforms live in this city
there's not the city I was my point Lake
what happens fast forward when this
sample can be analyzed uploaded to the
cloud immediate response for cities you
have a shitload of open data you have
shitload of knowledge about everything
that's going on on every corner in your
city who is there what they did and you
better be prepared for the kind of life
you create between those systems thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
