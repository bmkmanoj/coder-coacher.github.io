to welcome you to my talk about Web API
that developers laughs who have you had
had been listening to the talk before
all right that's very good because
actually I haven't spoken to Oliver
before but fortunately we do not share
much in our presentation so at the end
there were some question that I will
cover so that is very good I know that
you already know West and there have
been thousands of talks and
presentations about that so don't be
afraid I won't cover that I won't
explain the very basics of rest and HTTP
and I won't bother you with the basic
difference between remote procedure
cards and how to use correctly resources
there are a lot of press practices out
there that are well known agreed but I
will skip them today not because they
are not important it's just because of
only 45 minutes time and i would like to
concentrate on other aspects that are
also important and hopefully interesting
for you i decided to to give this talk
this this title it's of obviously are
catchy but i think it's also adequate
because that it's what api is all about
they have to be optimized for developers
not for machines and this perspective is
very important and i would like to start
explaining this arm on a very high level
you have you have this arm we have the
scenario there's a client that uses the
implementation of a component or service
and it's done
the API this is the external visible
operations with input and output and
this is the kind of contract that is
made between declined and the component
or that service that's clear I think so
and of course there is no contract is
being declined and the implementation
which brings us the decoupling from the
implementation so that could be changed
or could have complete a difference deck
and there's another arm function that is
integration and reuse because that API
that is the client is using it's
optimized for this purpose it's
optimized for integration and reuse that
means we have different quality
attributes for API and our
implementation the AP the implementation
is probably optimized for performance
for maintainability testability and so
many other quality attributes but API
this is something else it should be easy
to understand easy to use easy to learn
and many others similar attributes so
therefore there's another function that
is sometimes forgotten or it's not that
obvious and this is communication among
developers because whenever there is a
piece of code that should be reused by
another team or by another developer and
the original developers not intend to
ask and explain how this could be used
there's a communication problem and of
course the solution is the API itself so
the API becomes a communication channel
and that's why we have to optimize api's
for this for this purpose so api's again
are intended for developers not for
machines it's for people if you are
using in the web or on the web on
standard HTTP if you are comply to the
rest principles it helps a lot but I
think it's also important to provide
documentation that is that is accurate
that is it has enough information
brings examples because usually
developers learn very well this examples
but I don't want to stress this more
than this I would like to take this
developer perspective and come to the
next topic which is UI design Oliver
before spoke about the render domain
driven design and how this can be used
to identify the resources and their
aggregates root aggregates this is a
completely different topic I concentrate
now on the UI design which is also very
important for web api's Web API design
and I'm not saying rest api so i'm
saying more general api's so yoga UI is
of course a unique identifier for
resource you know that and you have an
example which is can you see that yes
answers 42 and I'm sure you know which
answer I mean it's the answer to life
the universe and everything so this
brings us to to this arm book but on the
other side such a new I could be very
cryptic and as the same function it
uniquely identifies a resource which one
is better depends on the use case arm
this is readable we have an intuitive
understanding that this book or this
answer on that is written about in this
book is mint and this is very cryptic we
have no idea what it is maybe for a
machine it makes sense but not for a
human reader nonetheless the client
should never create the links by himself
this is a task for the server the server
provides links this is a basic concept
of hypermedia and undressed when we look
at arm this example this is jason most
amazing JSON document with an array of
links in this case it's just one link
inside and there's a hyper reference
relation and the math
the method is get of course this is the
HDP operation that is used to call that
link there's a relation that it explains
the semantics there's a long list of
standard relation types that should be
reused as possible if that's not enough
you can define your own and you have to
define that this is part of the API
contract and there is this hyper
reference this UI so and without knowing
anything about this API we can see it's
API from a paper and it's a sin talk
installation it's version 1 and here's a
payment and there is this arm it's
obviously an ID because it starts with
pay minus 2x and so on so this obviously
identifies a unique payment and this and
maybe other resources are put together
in this group of other resources that
are called payments so without any
documentation without knowing anything
about this API we just see this link and
we can lead a trigonal understand it
it's intended to be used by a client I
mean a machine in this case but at the
beginning if we want to learn and
explore such an API this helps a lot
when we can read the UI's so and then
again what is the question the question
should we care about your eye design no
from a pure rest point it's not
necessary now the links the eyes are
provided we just use them but then again
why not it's no contradiction there are
many api's that aren't really restful
and readable your eyes help us a lot
help us as developers to understand and
use the API what are the advantages of
your eye design well we can read our DUI
and guess what the nature's all about
this when we look at this we see it's
part of the github API there's a rizal
collection resort called users and this
is probably the name or the idea of a
specific user and his followers the
support sauce and now we can read that
this you are identifies the followers of
mood of the user mode jumbo so it's very
easy to make it readable Hecuba this is
not necessary for rest but it helps a
lot because if we remove this character
more jumbled follow us we can go
directly to users and we expect to get a
list of users which is actually a case
or we can navigate directly due to
another user by replacing a jumbo
there's another ID and it works so this
is very nice to get to know an API to
experiment with it and to to learn it
and of course proper your I design helps
us to make stable links or your eyes go
wide program links or white broken
bookmarks and if there's really a good
reason for removing or moving our links
or resources then you should answer this
with a proper status code what's more
about your eyes I said there should be
readable and they become very readable
when they are short of course there
should be a shot as possible but not
shorter that means using abbreviation
could be counterproductive so don't make
them shorter as they should be be
consistent identify patterns that you
want to use identifamy identifying names
and stick to them don't use synonyms for
the same concept which when it when it's
not necessary and the side for case and
stick to it typically plural nouns are
used and recommended strict lowercase is
my favorite and if you use strict lower
case you cannot use chemicals anymore
but sometimes you need
a kind of separator force different
words to make it more readable than just
use hyphen because there's arm setting
the problem with hyphens in urs what's
about side of file endings we find them
in the internet a lot there's for
instance and this is almost a joke the
this you are or this UI identifies the
dissertation from Royal fielding who
wrote initially about rest and of course
this has had to have sort of fire ending
because it's a let's find a web app but
actually there is no real technical
reason for that but then again they are
also quite modern api's we seedpeer
deedee trotter api and there again use
soy defy earnings i'm sure they know
what they did hopefully but there's a
good reason i think they have been very
practically cuz they just understand a
support only JSON and XML and there is
no content negotiation just JSON and XML
so if we replace this descending jason
with xml we get another representation
of that user and this could be this is
not pretty this is not rest but it's
practical because um if you put this a
URI into an email and send it to
colleague he will get the same
representation the same object without
any other additional headers and so on
so this is practical what's about
trailing slashes um there's a there's a
similarity in the semantics between the
UNIX file paths and the UI's arm if I'm
not mistaken this identifies the UNIX
file and if I use a training / I have a
directory right
the same should be true for you is but
let's look at this first of all we have
our books again and we it's it's a
collection of books because this
identifies a list of books and it makes
sense to use a trailing slash because
it's similar to directory because it's a
collection of more things okay it works
if you identify a single book we have no
trailing slash because it's single book
and we have a single file without
strings let's make sense in a way but
then again what's now this book could
have chapters and the chapters could
have a single chapter so this is obvious
problem and therefore I recommend using
no trailing slashes at all be consistent
and use them just where they are
necessary to separate these these parts
but not at the end that's very easy
another thing about trailing slashes
sometimes you find in a hypermedia API a
kind of directory resource that is the
the first resource in your in your arm
you I then it provides the first links
to study navigation to start a
conversation with you I and if you do
this try to avoid making this I made
this mistake once and that's why I
created the slide don't remember we're
moving the the trailing slash what's
about relations these are also important
for a proper UI design
usually on the UI UI design follows this
pattern which is a hora cool and it's
very easy and effective we start with
collection and assassin item there's a
sub collection of sub items and they
could probably a sub sub collection with
subs are pilots and so on so it's very
handy to model one to one and one too
many relations and we could create a a
person that is part of this group we can
get later the single new person and we
can delete it so it works very easy but
what's about n2m relation or
many-to-many relations in this case we
have a group that has zero one or more
persons and again the person has zero
one or more groups we could use the same
approach for example i put arm this
array into my group and here i identify
the are the persons are that are part of
this group actually there should be g1
sorry and on the other side in the the
person i identify the groups that the
person is part of so but now i have a
problem what about caching when i change
this one this could be still in the cash
so that works not very nice and the
other question is which one which one of
both is leading maybe i have to update
after update both but this wouldn't be
an atomic operation when I have to
change both so as a better way of course
and this is done with subscriptions so
we create an separate arm resource in
this case i'll call it membership and
this membership gets the person ID and
the group ID and then i can easily
create get and delete this membership to
head
remove a person to group okay so caching
works because I have just one unique
identifier for this resource I can
create delete it with one cause so otama
CD is is this was working and I even can
put here additional properties which I
couldn't do in the in the previous
approach at the at this example I used
already here and here and here prefixes
and I think this is a very good idea to
use them for IDs arm agent 007 of course
it's readable but maybe better is this
one with the prefix or if you have a
person and this has a this cryptically
ID you can have a prefix to make it more
readable again I recommend using strict
lowercase and hyphens this is also done
by Gina which I'm sure you all know they
also have a prefix in this case it's not
lower case but it's it's very handy this
way because you see to which our project
this ticket belongs and is that also
other advantages that I want to explain
because this ID is a sequential ID it
starts with one and continues if you
create a new ticket then we would get
five hundred and seventeen eighteen and
so on and this makes this UI guessable
in this case it's an advantage because
we know when we see this UI that there
are five hundred and fifteen other
tickets and they can use this
information as to navigate to to another
ticket of course you do this every time
every day I'm sure so it's very
practical and the the UI in our web
browser become becomes or gets part of
the UI that we use every day that's also
hackable because we can use it for
navigation we can
lays the 516 there's another number and
go directly to the ticket so and this is
possible through this proper UI design I
said this is an advantage but they are
other use cases where it's not I rented
this super cool app arm it doesn't exist
this just for this this explanation so
we have here or API of our super cool
app and there's the resource of users
and here's the why of this very specific
user in this case I guess that there are
only three hundred and thirteen other
users and this is a disadvantage because
I started to use this API with it which
I thought is super cool and then I'll
see that there are only three hundred
and fourteen other users I thought there
were millions so it's obviously a
disadvantage and Hecuba is in this case
also disadvantage because I can arm go
to other users IDs and this could be a
potential security issue one less
sometimes it's a good idea to work work
with sequential is sometimes not
nonetheless never please use a
one-to-one relation between your
database key and your public ID even are
even here which looks actually like a
sequential like a data base sequence
it's not there's a difference ok the
next topic are slack IDs stack overflow
I'm sure you know it he is also a kind
of resource called questions and that is
followed by an ID that identifies a
single question and this is the unique
part of this UI and this slack at the
end this training slack is
no and it is created by the question
that the user has asked and again they
follow arm they use proven nouns are
they use strict lower case and they use
hyphens which is very good and this one
is created by the title or the question
that you just asked and now we can read
and understand this resource before we
go to that side and read it so it's a
kind of natural key and it helps us to
optimize our search experience because
when we see the results in our search
are then we can decide if you want to go
there or not all right that's all I have
to say for UI UI design the next topic I
want address our partial responses the
first technique that is well known is
paging if you have a list and you don't
know how long it actually is or it's
just just just too much data to load it
with one call use paging you know you
start you say get products page one
count five this is the maximum number of
items you want want to receive and maybe
you have some other properties that that
had to identify the correct order and
the second page are is like the first
just here page two so it's very easy as
an alternative you could use wet linking
which is from the user experience from
the developer experience a little bit
more easier and handy so in our array of
links we provide armed a link to the
previous page to the page that was
currently loaded which was page two in
this case to the next page so we don't
have to create this link ourselves we
just use this link but we could also go
directly to the first pace or the large
there the last one so there are
different things possible with a
blinking that's support
paging but what what's about streams of
data and usually we have streams of data
and this year I will show you that
paging is not the best idea because
again we start reaching reading the
first page page one count five and then
we have written the messages from six to
ten which is what makes what we have
expected but in the meantime to other
new messages have been added if we now
want to read the next five d this year
and with just say page to count five
this won't work because the the subset
that we want to read is computed from
the very top so we get seven and six
again so it's not very good for data or
list of data that changes quickly as an
alternative you can use cursor ring when
you start clearing just specify the
amount of items you want to read let's
say count five again and this is indeed
what we get the message is from six to
ten in the meantime to do two new
messages I edit and then to read the
next page on the next up I'm sorry going
down going down with our go to cursor to
read these we specify again count five
and the max ID the max ID is the lost ID
we head from this read which here we
have the ID six and six meters one is
five if our client is not capable of our
computing this ID we could provide a
link or we could define the semantics
differently we could say arm it's the
max ID is exclusive then our client
could use the smallest ID or that he
knows but linking would be a better
approach to help them cross ring through
this stream of data
so we have now written we have now
written the the first ten pages but in
meantime a lot of other messages have
been added how can we read them again we
can read with count five and start at
the top and to a wide reading the
messages down here again we specify a
new parameter that is called since I t10
that says that we want to stop here we
want we don't want to read them again so
here we are and finally to read these we
use all together count five since I t10
and Max ID 13 and we only get exactly
these three missing messages so cursedly
covering is a nice alternative for
pitching arm actually it should be used
every time I don't see the advantage of
paging I would recommend using crossing
every time um there's another way for
for working with partial data or or
loading only subset of the data that is
part of an aggregate on aggregate route
and this is embedding and linking this
small examples based on siren it's a
hover media format and this is not a
complete siren document I just show you
the the two links that are important for
this for this example there's the self
link that identifies these document
itself and there's another link called
author that is a user defined relation
type and this brings us to the author of
this book so this data is not included
directly inside this document but it is
linked and we can now go to the sub
entity and load it if it's not necessary
this is a kind of lazy loading we go and
read this data only if it's really nice
sorry and it's not directly added into
the document which makes the document a
lot more smaller but my headline says
embedding Russ is linking it's also
possible the siren to embed the data
directly and this is shown here arm here
is the link but it's also embedded
directly so the client receives the data
directly without an additional call but
there's this is very handy but there's
one disadvantage because the client
cannot decide if it's embedded or if
it's just linked the client has to work
with both possibilities and therefore I
would like to speak about graph q air
that helps selecting only specific arm
fields of data that you want to have
graphed where is not very helpful to
build a restful api actually when you
use it or many api that uses are not
restful but actually it's it's very
helpful and let's let's have a look okay
graphically that was originally
developed by Facebook and there's a
reference implementation in JavaScript
and there are other open source
implementations for Java and Python as
well and other languages maybe and the
whole idea is to create a query that is
sent as a string to the server that
supports this API and thus krory
expresses in detail which fields are
required by the client and based on the
square e the representation is created
and sent back and all that is done with
a strong type system that also supports
introspection let's have a look at this
first easy example want to have the
author Douglas Adams so we create this
shorthand curry that has no name
and the only field we want to have is
name and then as a recite we just get
this author with the name nothing more
because we this is the only thing we
want to have so it's possible to define
a set of fields with ID first name last
name I can also use more complex data
and nest nest these fields and as I've
have shown before it's also possible to
use these user-defined functions leave
this function book ID and cover picture
cézanne's oh this is this is part of
the schema that is defined before that
is part of the API of craft create
another head full function of craft we
are fragments so you can externalize
some definitions and reuse them again in
inquiry so this query is called book
krory so this is just the name and
inside I use this user-defined function
book and inside I specify the fields I
want to have with that fragment and
these three dots are actually as
operator this is this so-called spread
operated to include fragments so if I've
shown you examples to read data but it's
also possible to change data this is
done this mutations this mutation
mutations are central post and the
others to read data are central to get
this mutation likes a book which means
the the like count is increased by one
and i think its eps self-explanatory was
head what's happening I'd ended
identified the book 42 and then the
black counter is incremented and as a
result I get data back and this is the
book with name and my count
okay there are some other very
interesting features but before I can or
i want to explain them after this this
example that motivates and makes it more
more understandable so what happens if
our API changes at the moment if we have
this structure we read our books 42 and
this is the representation in Jason that
has an ID and tighten and price and now
our business finds out that this price
is not accurate enough and wants to have
portal and network price this is of
course a breaking change because the
other existing clients rely may be on
the field price and this was removed
therefore it's better to leave it in and
add the others but this could also hurt
existing clients because an old client
might not be forward compatible it might
not can handle these unknowns because
these are new and not known to existing
clients so therefore we could use the
graph ql introspection API and the
client can can create this query on on
this book this crore is called book
inspection this is just the name off of
my example and you use a built-in
function that's called type and we want
to have the the type information of the
type book when I have the name and some
information about the fields one a list
of fields you want to include all
deprecated ones with name the
information if it is deprecated or not
and a reason another aside we get this
we get the type of information of our
book here's a list of an array of fields
the first field is the ID that's not
deprecated but our price is deprecated
this gives us a means for our clients to
ask our API are rich fields are new if
there are new fields added if there are
other fields that are deprecated so this
is a very nice way to inform our clients
that something has changed so an old
client could continue using this curry
because you wants to have ID title price
nothing else and the new client could
use put a price because price is
duplicated our server also knows by the
requests that it receives which fields
are actually required and if there is no
more client left that uses price then we
actually all eventually could remove
this field without breaking any existing
client so it's very good for extensions
that are compatible and I would like to
continue with this topic and talk about
rationing because this is done usually
wrong and would like to start with the
distinction with the making a difference
between data versioning and language
versioning data versioning arm happens
because a resource can have over time
different states of course the data can
can change and regardless how often this
data is changed the meaning remains the
same so existing clients are not hurt by
state changes but then again they are
language changes and when a language is
changed or extended this state remains
the same but the data is represented in
a different way and if you should use
language versioning or English extension
as rule number one try to make it a
backward and/or forward compatible use
version identify us as a
must resort to denote incompatible
changes so backward and forward
compatibility is very important backward
compat compatibility is for instance if
our new USB port supports the altar to
point o sticks then we can say this USB
port is backward compatible and there's
also forward compatibility this is the
case when our old thought supports the
even the new sticks so this part is
forward compatible but you see we can
look at forward and backward
compatibility from two perspectives
there's a perspective of the port and
the ND dis dick and the same is true for
agents and origin servers so and to
speak about I have created this small
summary and would like to speak about
more about consumers and producers and
their compatibility a consumer could be
backward compatible this is the case
when when a new client receives a reply
from an older server usually the newer
client looks up the version identifier
and behaves properly armed the version
could be encoded in two in the demand
time or as a parameter of demand time it
could be encoded in the URL directly arm
but also directly inside the
representation when it's an XML document
um we could use our name spaces on the
server side we can also support backward
compatibility and this is the case when
a newer server gets a request form an
old client and usually we use a
replacement or side by side replacement
means that our existing old server
completely replaced by new one and the
new one speaks both languages the old
and the new API side-by-side means old a
new server are deployed side-by-side and
maybe there they use different mum types
or different your eyes and there's an
API gateway in front of them and the
dispatching to the white server the old
or the new one is done behind the scenes
it's also important to have version
notifications because the existing
clients have to be notified that there
is a new version available this is
usually done out of band with emails
through documentation or newsletter
sometimes links can be used but often
it's done out of band what about forward
compatibility the if the consumer is or
the client is forward compatible this is
the case when a an an old client sends
or receives an old client receives reply
from a newest newer server and if this
is the case this old client must accept
unknowns remember this example was the
price and the proto an enterprise and
old client suddenly receives new fields
and has to work with that and these
unknowns must be preserved if there's
for instance a long conversation between
client and server and there's document
that is sent back and forth between the
client and server of course the client
must not throw away the unknowns it must
be preserved and necessary is also a
version identify a substitution model
that defines how the client interprets
the given version identifier because
they are different algorithms possible
the version identifier could mean that
this is the latest version that the
server supports or it could be the the
minimal version that is necessary that
supports all required features so there
are different semantics of identifiers
this must be clear
and finally last but not least the
producer this server could also be
forward compatible and this is defined
in the media spec if there's a there's
also a that has to accept requests from
New York lines then the API that this
server implements has to define where
and how these extension could happen so
there must be clear expectations to find
and so if you build the server and we
say future client can send extra data in
these fields or can use this our
extension bonds then this is possible
later for on your clients and
incompatibility is identified by
checking the version identifier and on
the producer side we can have side by
side with both installation or a
breaking replacement so it's very tough
topic that's why i have put also inside
all also added here these these
reference when you have led a little bit
more time you can have a look at it our
handling I think I have some minutes
okay it's not much our handling is our
last topic I want to speak apart it's
very important to provide an API that is
easily used it has a good user
experience because from a user or
developers perspective and API is just
black box if something goes wrong and
there's no meaningful helpful reply then
our developer or our client does not
know what has happened and how can you
fix that so a lot of time is wasted and
maybe he decides to go to another API
that does this better common problems
are usually are tunneling even errors
through 200 okay or
using for every problem 500 and saying
internal server error and nothing more
so this is both are not very helpful
knowing that something went wrong
doesn't does not hit me so there has to
be additional information HTTP provides
a lot of status code I'm the interesting
for us are the 400 and 500 codes for
client and server hours the most
comments are this one I'm sure you know
them but I want to say one thing about
the 400 you can use this status code if
for instance you are JSON or XML
document that the client sends you it's
broken it's not relevant you cannot pass
it then it's a good idea to use 400 bad
request because it's not well formed you
cannot read it if however the XML or
adjacent as well formed but it's
semantically wrong then you could
probably use 422 which says that the
entity is not processable this is an
extension to actually be but it's more
specific so I recommend using 422 when
it's maybe better than 400 400 4 and 10
3 I think of unknown I don't have to
explain it on the server side there's
500 as the general explanation that
something went wrong and 503 and five
and four often used 500 for this is
maybe not norm okay this is when Wendy
the gate racer or the web server this is
used as gaping as gateway or as proxy
does not have a reply from the upstream
server then you can use 405 but anyway
what I want to tell you is if
a problem and use 500 that's not enough
you have to be more specific than this
and let's have a look how habla how
other api's that are unknown do this
here's an example from the Twitter API
the switcher AP is our use an array of
arrows in this case you have just one
hour inside and it has a message and the
code and the message is for us
developers and tells us what has
happened in this case we have it says
sorry that page does not exist and
there's a code that is intended more for
machines and we can look up in the our
documentation and see that letter
corresponds with HTTP 404 which is
correct and there's often explanation or
what was the reason so it's a good idea
to report the error with appropriate
HTTP status code and in addition provide
additional information this with these
kind of messages this is also done by
the Trillia API and they do a little bit
more than this they have of course the
the message that reads are no two number
is specified that this parameter is
missing there's a code and then there's
even a link and this link can be used to
find very fast very handy the
explanation so we go to this UI and see
here's our arrow and here's even an
explanation that that helps us to avoid
this error so let's go back again for a
head for our messages use the right
statuscode use additional proprietary
our code to be more specific to be more
concentrated on your business problem
and if it's possible provide a link in
to you directly your documentation so
that the user or developer fine set up
very quickly okay and now we have time
for some questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
