64 slides this will go totally smoothly
I'm sure my name is Scott Hanselman and
this talk is called scaling yourself you
can see the 90 minute version of this
talk up on my website feel free to go on
google for scott or google with bing
first god that would be all so cool
that's that's Darth Vader on a cat
that's awesome I've been in software for
a very very long time this was something
I've worked on and I blog about
community and I've written some
applications for the phone I've got some
books that I'm not very proud of I've
got a podcast that I'm proud of I've got
one called this developers life that I
do with Rob Connery that I'm very proud
of I've even got a video that I sell on
how to be a good technical speaker and a
lot of people say well Scott you're
doing all this stuff how why do you do
it how do you are you not sleeping how
do you stay productive why do you put
all this effort into trying to be
productive and it's because I must dance
I just I can't I can't stop whenever I
think about stopping I think about this
little boy and how excited he is about
doing what he's doing now I try to give
people advice on how to be productive
but when they don't take the advice this
is what I call them
hopefully you'll take the advice so it
turns out that the less that you do the
more of it that you can do this is the
standard law of scale right this
actually here's an actual graph that
shows writing to dev nul see the
throughput goes up and the latency is
effectively nothing turns out that if
you do nothing at all you can do it
infinitely now the amount of information
that one has to absorb has changed in
the old days there was basically all
this that was all the information in the
entire world and then a little bit later
everything became 1,000 plus right I
mean that's just emotional bankruptcy at
this point whether it be Google Reader
or Gmail if it says a thousand plus
obviously you just give up at that point
you should just declare that in the old
days I just had to know everything that
was in those two books but that was it
there was no internet there was those
two books and I was alone in my mom's
basement and that was the sum of all
human knowledge and then the internet
happened and suddenly there's exabytes
of information being created and half of
it is garbage and 1/3 of my day is
wasted by interruptions I'm completely
overwhelmed and we tell ourselves that
we're going to be able to pull it off if
we just work late tonight
or you know honey it's just a really
busy busy season for us right now and
just once march is over or once April is
over after this summer we'll be able to
spend some time together and I just need
to work late to catch up this is a
danger side this is this is a danger
sign there's also this phone enos that
happens this feeling of being a phony
and I've blogged about this I'm actually
on the first page if you google for
phony that was actually not the plan
but if you google for phony my smiling
face is like right there like so feeling
like a phony is this idea that I've got
so many emails and I go to work I do my
8:00 to 5:00 or my 8:00 to 6:00 I go
home we make dinner to put the kids to
bed and then what we do we work until
2:00 in the morning and we do it because
someone's going to catch us and realize
that we really have no idea what we're
talking about and we're just lucky to
have a job everybody feels like that but
the thing is hope is not a strategy
hoping that you're going to get past
this is not a strategy so what are some
things that we can do I want to
juxtapose two words one is called
effectiveness
was called efficiency effectiveness is
goal orientation this is picking
something to do this is doing right
things picking a goal and doing that
goal that's effectiveness
I'm just opposing these two words
because in English they're close and in
other languages they're even closer
efficiency I was in Bulgaria giving this
talk and tango went back and forth this
Bulgarian guy before the talk because
they use the same word to describe these
two different things and we had to come
up with like a word for effectiveness
and then a phrase to describe efficiency
so for for people that don't speak
English as a first language
effectiveness and efficiency can feel
feel like the same word but efficiency
is doing things in an economical way
process oriented so phrased differently
effectiveness is doing the right things
but efficiency is doing things right
that means effectiveness is picking a
direction and efficiency is running
really fast in that direction when you
realize those two things are different
it becomes an extremely powerful tool
that you can use this is an example of
being wholly ineffective I don't know
why he thought that was a good vector to
go on now you've got all this
information that's coming in to your
life and I don't mean your email inbox I
mean the inbox of your life your mail
your your do you have TiVo like a DVR
you know you can tell it to record
Dexter and then it just fills up with
all the Dexter shows right okay you have
that though that's an inbox also now I'm
going to say these things need to be
triaged and I use the word triage very
specifically I didn't just say need to
be dealt with need to be handled need to
be man as need to be triage because what
does triage make you think about makes
you think about the zombie apocalypse
because when there's a zombie apocalypse
and everyone's dead we got to start
triaging these bodies we have this toe
tag here's a toe tag we have to go
through all these bodies that are in my
parking lot and say who's walking
wounded who is non-life-threatening and
then who is just a pulseless notice that
they don't say dead they say more
pulseless our non breathing because it
would be just sad to say dead people
that doesn't mean that we grab the first
person and we deal with that person we
triage them we sort them we sift them
but isn't it funny that an ad for viagra
an email from me and an email from Steve
Ballmer are all peers in our inbox
sorted only by date so there's basically
three kinds of work that David Allen
from getting things done talks about
there's predefined work work you set up
ahead of time there's work that's
interrupting you and this is where we
get in trouble there's that urgent work
it must be really important it just
happened but the most important thing is
the defining of work so rarely do we
find ourselves doing that how often if
you actually put on your calendar one
hour of time to say I want to sit down
and think about what work I need to be
doing no we we panic and we look at our
to do dot text and we sort it and then
we just kind of freak out for a while
and then the to do dot text gets log
gets larger as Brian said dropping it is
so powerful do it drop it delegate it
let someone else do it or defer it but
drop it is such an amazing thing to
scale yourself and when you're trying to
decide what to drop you can use Stephen
Covey's quadrants this is the importance
axis and here's the urgency axis when
something is both urgent and important
like a pregnant wife or an appendix
being burst you should probably do that
now if it is neither urgent nor
important you should dump it but
unfortunately what happens is we spend
our time on things that feel urgent but
are not important at all but the urgency
is an addiction trivia not urgent not
important
crises urgent and important phrased
differently phones in-person people
dropping by your office both urgent and
important Twitter I'm going to focus on
Twitter neither urgent nor important but
I don't think any of you guys work
because you're always on Twitter now
this is a picture of a mouse with an
electrode attached directly to his brain
and he just has to push that lever to
stimulate the the pleasure center of his
brain if he wants to feel better he just
pulls to refresh that feeling of
excitement that kind of direct pleasure
center of the brain he just pulls to
refresh and just pull to refresh and you
get that feeling of of something has
happened I'm
getting work done do you remember when
there was just one set of footprints on
the beach that's when Jesus unfollowed
you on Twitter because you were tweeting
too much now all systems at work
including the Internet itself have flow
control so drop packets communication by
its nature is fault tolerant if you ever
had a conversation with someone over a
cellphone and make a couple words drop
out you could still understand what they
were saying because computer can become
communication as a nature is fault
tolerant sometimes dropping the ball is
the right answer when anyone ever went
in when anyone ever calls me and
suggests and asked me for suggestions on
how they can over time in their life
they list out all the things that they
have to do the first thing I say is
which one of these can you say no to
even if you've already committed to it
what can you say I can't do it and for
us as successful computer people and I
know we are a successful computer people
because we are here at a conference
which by its nature puts you at the top
1% of all computer people that exists
because you came to a conference that's
amazing you should feel really great
about yourself for that is that saying
no is virtually impossible to us we'd
love to say yes we'd love to get things
done but you will feel so much better
about yourself and you will get so much
more work done when you can actually
sprint and focus on something as opposed
to juggling things also there's this
notion of psychic weight that people
don't think about and I brought up that
issue of TiVo we call it TiVo in the US
but the DVR when this thing first came
out I could go and say I want to watch
Law &amp;amp; Order and I hit record get a
season pass and then suddenly there was
like a whole law and order channel was
there all the time what a joy this is
going to free up so much time because I
can watch TV whenever I want to but then
I realized that this was psychic weight
that was pressing me down because okay
we got like seven law and orders on the
thing okay we'll put the kids to bed
early tonight and we're going to bang
through law and order and then we're
going to get this thing under control
and we're going to handle it and then
we'll be back on track so somehow this
TiVo which was this gift from God this
was this amazing glorious of Pro tippity
thing has now become the primary source
of psychic weight in my life so I think
about the things that I want to get done
I want to think about what are the three
things I can get done
today what are the three things I want
to get done this week this year and if
watching the entire seven seasons of The
Wire is one of those things then
absolutely put it on your list but if
not it should probably be the first
thing that you drop when you're going
through your week you need to have a
vision on Monday of what your week looks
like and on Friday you need to stop and
look back on your week and think about
the reflection was that a successful
week what could I have done differently
what could I change then you do it all
over again the next week I think that
being busy is a form of laziness being
busy is not thinking about what you
should be doing so that you're not so
busy
we find ourselves just being busy it
turns out that being creative and making
something is the opposite of hanging out
I'm always impressed when people that I
see tweet a lot suddenly stop tweeting
and then maybe a week or two later or a
month later they'll come back with an
amazing new creation it's like wow that
person just made a list of the things I
needed to get done and Twitter wasn't
one of them and they went off and they
created and then they came back and they
shared it with us it's the opposite of
hanging out it's it's it's funny because
it's true
turns out arguing on Twitter is the
worst thing that you can do and we're
all we're all guilty of doing it you it
no one has ever come up to me and said I
am so glad that you argued with me on
Twitter completely changed my life I've
can I've converted to Buddhism now and
you know I I've got a smaller house and
we got a Prius never happens on never
happens if you talk to someone on
Twitter and we think about things like
efficiency take the things though all
the data streams this is homework for
you take all the data streams in your
life and I want you to sort them signal
versus noise what provides you value and
what doesn't this is mine I'm a
community manager so my community
there's a lot of phone and Skype and
video calling so that's important
last thing Google Reader and TiVo most
powerful tool that you have in your
arsenal is mark all as read just do it
and never look back and don't feel bad
and just feel the release of the psychic
wait short your list
see how I've sorted my work email
specifically with bosses versus
people who have cc'd me on stuff the one
email rule that you need in your life
the one thing that will fundamentally
change how you think about email is if
you put an inbox for stuff that your
cc'd on and you train your boss next
time your boss sends you it to do and
CC's you want it don't do it don't do it
and then when he says why didn't you do
it oh you see seed me I thought you were
just informing me he'll never do that
again act on stuff that you are mailed
directly and stuff that see seed it
changes your life look at this I took a
250 email inbox and chopped it down by
2/3 because the stuff in the inbox is
important to me and the stuff in inbox
EC is not I've extended that a little
bit as a community person notice how the
inbox external my community people who
don't work for my company they're
important to me I've answered all of
their emails don't check email in the
morning because if you respond to email
they will write you back the number one
way the number one way to get more email
is to answer email so don't put more
energy into things that you don't want
one wants you and remember if you're the
person who answers email at 2:00 in the
morning you've just taught your boss
that you're the person who answers email
at 2:00 in the morning maybe you're
doing that because you want to move up
at the company or maybe you're excited
or maybe but you've just taught them
that you're addicted to urgency and you
literally have here's a thing to let you
know how addicted urgence you are how
many meters are you in the morning when
you're sleeping from your phone and if
you don't have to do anything other than
roll your body like this to check your
phone that you have a problem when
you're driving put your phone in the
trunk can't text when your phones in the
trunk but you can still Bluetooth when
you're sleeping put your phone across
the room so if you really have to answer
the thing go across the room but more
importantly try not checking email until
noon and you will be surprised at how
much work you get done because what
happens if if you check email in the
morning you time travel you wake up at 9
you check email boom it's lunch and then
you go to lunch and boom it's 2:30 and
it's like okay it's 2:30 I'm going to
start working now that all happened
because you check the email in the
morning last one I think I'm running out
of time right how am i doing
you're killing me well I'll slow down
that will okay so let's talk about
cancer conserving your keystrokes is a
really important thing
if Brian emails me a really interesting
question about you know asp.net as much
as I like Brian as a person and I enjoy
his drunken emails if he sends me an
email and I send him back an exciting
and long five paragraph with a code
sample email that he solves his problem
I just gave him the gift of ten thousand
of my keystrokes but there is a finite
number of keystrokes left in my hands
before I die and I am never going to get
those keystrokes back and I've just
gifted them to Brian I don't even know
if he read that email so what should I
do to multiply these keystrokes given
that there is a finite number of those
keystrokes left in my hands I write a
blog post and I nail him the link and
then after I'm dead my keystrokes
multiply every time I get a page view
that's 5,000 keystrokes that I did not
have to type you should never write a
long email to someone never more than
three or four sentences anything longer
than that should be on a blog or a wiki
or it should be in your products
documentation or it should be on a FAQ
or a knowledge base or anywhere in the
world except email because email is
where your keystrokes go to die you guys
remember the Pomodoro Technique any
Pomodoro people here and one have their
official Pomodoro timer the Pomodoro
Technique is this amazing way to do
personal scrums isn't it funny how the
project manager on your team is the one
with a thousand emails that are unread
in their inbox it's funny how that works
out then the programmers have any email
but the project managers got it
basically emailed bankruptcy thousands
of emails can't manage their own life
but they're managing your project try
running your life as a scrum do little
tiny work Sprint's Pomodoro is a unit of
time I think it means tomato and Italian
and the idea is that you have this timer
and you set the timer and you put it
down and then you focus on one thing no
multitasking you focus on one thing for
25 minutes it's amazing
you won't be able to do it you will
you'll be vibrating with the need to
multitask and you'll just be like any
like alt-tab you're like well what
happened which is and then suddenly
you're on Reddit and you like I didn't
even touch it in my brain just took me
to Reddit I don't know how it happened
when that happens when you've
interrupted yourself internally just
write it down just tick put a tick so
imagine you have a sheet of paper it
says all right I'm starting a Pomodoro
I'm starting a 25-minute work sprint
every time I interrupt myself I put a
tick just to be aware of it just to
think about it to be aware of the number
and type of interruptions and then look
back and reflect and you say you know I
interrupted myself six times in 25
minutes and you're going to get numbers
like that but then you'll do it again
and you'll interrupt yourself twice and
then you'll interrupt yourself once and
you want to interrupt yourself at all
and a Pomodoro will feel like that and
then you'll start thinking about a
Productivity in your life as how many
Pomodoro's that you got done in a day
and you'll say man that was a four
Pomodoro day I got a lot of work done
how many hours was that like it was like
two hours but there's not the point it
was like so productive because you were
sprinting turnoff toasts you guys know
what toast is fred is online thank God
Skype I don't know what I fred has a
birthday I don't know fred is but Skype
felt the need to interrupt me with a
piece of toast that popped up on my
screen turn all that stuff off
notifications background processes
anything at all that is going to keep
you out of your flow you see Usain Bolt
texting while sprinting no because he's
sprinting that's why it's called
sprinting remember that anything
important that happens in the world in
the news in your life into your work
will come your way many times if there's
another 911 somebody will tell you you
probably didn't learn it by hitting
refresh on your favorite news site
someone might something might happen
someone famous might die is Lady Gaga
dead is she dead f5 f5 if I try to
remain in your flow be wrapped up like a
child is in the thing that captures your
attention get that excitement back and
that excitement does not involve alt
tabbing over to Gmail
multitasking is a myth this is funny but
multitasking does not work the optimal
number of threads in any system is one
thread that is a computer science fact
and if you think you can multitask
you're wrong and I hate talking to
people I totally can multitask you can't
it's biologically impossible the mo they
test the best multitasking you can do is
think about a problem and then sleep and
then let the background threads do that
work for you while you sleep and then
wake up in the shower with the answer
that's like the only multitasking that I
even know about but all you're doing is
wasting time task switching and task
switching causes time it's a context
switch you ever been working on
something and working in something the
phone rings and you're mean to like your
dad so why was I so mean to my dad we
called you at work at 3:00 in the
afternoon and you were totally focused
on something that afterwards I'm sorry I
was really working on something well
what could I have done I could have
turned off the ringer and then I'm sad
for like 10 or 15 minutes that's the
context switch as I get back from that
phone call that I screwed up back to the
work what was I thinking about context
switching context which he doesn't work
here are some things that you can
multitask on and they are few and far
between and they start with walking and
chewing gum but the number one way that
I do multitasking is I work out while
listening to podcasts I never have time
to listen to podcast I'm so busy busy
busy well if you're working out listen
to podcasts I like watching TV I
unapologetically love to watch TV and if
I tweet about it people like how do you
have time to watch TV
well the rule is I'm only allowed to
watch TV while I'm working out so as
soon as I stop working out TV has to go
off so I got the iPad and I've got like
seven seasons of the wire and I just run
towards the iPad it's like a carrot and
a stick that's what I've promised to do
if I'm going to be watching a show I am
always moving there is no actual sitting
on your ass watching TV for me you have
to work out and if you make that rule
for yourself you realize that that is
really great multitasking commuting and
reading if you commute on a train or in
some way that doesn't involve driving a
car you can do that utilize your idle
and waiting time the iPhone has
completely
change the way that I poop I have no
idea what we were doing in there before
weren't you thinking this is completely
unproductive time you know and then the
iPhone came along and instapaper and now
poop time is good time we set up these
guilt systems my friend Kathy Sierra has
this great blog post about a guilt
system we have these you know think
about the pile of books that you have
I'm not going to read the ruby way this
week but the ruby way has been on my
desk for three years and what happens is
I move it in the stack so every once in
a while they'll look at the guilt pile
the monument to my own stack of failure
and I'll walk out I'm probably not going
to read all these but I'm gonna move the
Ruby way a little higher and then I'll
move the css3 down and then I'll
probably I'll probably only read this
much but the guilt pile persists I have
actually had guilt piles last so long
that the technology has been come
obsolete
from the moment I got the book from the
publisher until it eventually just went
out of business think about this for a
second and this guy uses it in the
context of making money if it is not
helping me make money it's mental
clutter and it's out now let's get rid
of making money if it's not helping me -
what is your goal spend time with your
kids pay off your house grow your
business in any decision if you're going
to do something is that helping you with
that blank whatever that blank is for
you I stopped caring about my career
when I had kids so everything that I do
every decision that I make is how I can
get home to my four-year-old my
six-year-old faster I'm going to be
going to a conference in Poland tomorrow
morning and they're mad at me because
I'm going to be doing the conference I'm
going to leave that afternoon and they
want to show me their beautiful city and
I think that that's great but the thing
is their beautiful city will be there in
a couple of years but my four-year-old
has only have fifty two weekends in his
fourth year and every weekend I missed
that is a fecund in his fourth year that
I will never get back so I'm gonna be
home for dinner on Friday thank you sir
rock on
so here's your homework my friends I
want you to audit and sort your sources
the things in your life I want you to
think about scheduling work sprints turn
off all distractions think about your
inbox and then go look at your personal
toolbox notice that I didn't talk about
Evernote or any of these fancy systems
it all speaks to what Brian was talking
about you can spend more time reading
productivity books and making
productivity systems when maybe all you
need is a to-do text maybe what you
really need is the will to do it and the
recognition in your mind that there is a
difference between being busy and doing
the work that you want to do I'm you can
find all this stuff and a longer version
of this talk up at Hanselman comm thank
you very much was that enough time yes
sir so sure so why do you have a wheat
planet add a plan so again with every
single thing that I've talked about here
pick the thing that makes you happy this
is not a religion this is a perspective
and if you have a system that works for
you rock on
so don't this none of this is Dogma okay
it's just a thought but my opinion is
that the number three is a great number
four or five is too much to hold in your
brain too much to focus on one or two is
not really working hard enough
three is a great number so every day I
wake up and I say what are three things
that I can do today I may have a
thousand things to do today but if I did
three of them I could look back on the
day and say that was an awesome day
maybe it's two but whatever whatever
works for you three is a great number
it's a nice round number
then it allows you to it allows you to
to scope things but the three things you
would try to get done in a single day
are different than the three things you
would get done in a week because those
things would have larger scope right fix
bug number three that's a day thing you
know release version 1.2 that might be a
week thing and a year thing might be you
know double the size of the business you
can pick the amount of time that you
want to spend on these things but the
rule of three allows you to just
arbitrarily chop things up and
accomplish something so that you feel
good about yourself so if the process
for you is four or ten or twenty things
whatever but the point is to end the day
without guilt
to end the day with that psychic wait
because I mean maybe I'm just talking to
myself here but I truly believe that we
have had that feeling at the end of the
day where I didn't do a damn thing today
I dicked around on Twitter and I was at
the client's office and I was on the
toilet for half an hour and I'm billing
the guy so that was like a 30 30 euro
poop and and we've had those days you
know I mean we don't talk about them no
one talks like no one puts a microphone
on and says that I feel like such a
phony today so what do we do when we put
the kids to bed and we try to make the
day not suck from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.
we don't talk about it we don't tell
anyone about and we know who the other
people are though because we see them on
chat because they're the ones with the
green dots while all the yellow dot
people are asleep on corporate chat
God's green dot people he's always up at
2:00 a.m. and I know he has young kids
and he's probably really freaking out
too so why do I pick three because it's
in round number good question all right
so the gentleman is pointing out that
sometimes when you separate email like
this you are going to miss context yes
you absolutely will miss context and the
question is are you have you put
yourself on a treadmill at work that is
a sustainable treadmill if you have a
situation at work right now where you
have too much responsibility or too much
email or too much whatever and you're
worried about missing out on context
then you need to change how your job is
you have too much to do you shouldn't
need to be constantly checking email for
fear of Keeping Up it's that very fear
that I think we just need to let go of
I've got probably 500 emails I usually
have zero but I'm on vacation right I'm
here in wherever whatever country this
is and you see how that works
sweet Sweden yes we know the point is
that that I'm watching people like they
give their talks and then they rush back
to delete email it's just like oh my god
is my job really come to this is this my
job deleting email so I actually end up
having trusted aggregators people who
are not willing to drop things so I'll
call them and I'll ask them what's going
on isn't that funny I used to have a
thousand blogs that I would read right
and then who's the greatest blogger blog
reader in the world - Rob Robert Scoble
he's always talking about how many blogs
that he reads
so I finally decided I'm not Robert
Scoble he's a freak and it's not healthy
to keep up on that many blogs so you
know what I do
I read his blog so I took the thousand
blogs that I read and I picked five
linked blogs I found my squabbles and I
read those five blogs and they give me
an aggregated news it's like why we
listen to the BBC news on the hour
because it tells us what's going on so I
don't have to watch all the other news
find your aggregator inside of the
company who is a person who can tell you
what's going on who can keep you
up-to-date I read I do less emails but I
actually have more one-on-ones with my
boss I told him unapologetically if
you're making me delete email if
deleting email is my job then I'm going
to get less work done so let's have more
15 minutes stand-ups one-on-ones you
tell me what the hell's going on and
then I'll be doing work because it's his
job to read all those emails so drop the
ball is what I'm telling you to do okay
fantastic question any other questions
what a great crowd put a very relaxed
and mellow crowd lunch let's eat thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
