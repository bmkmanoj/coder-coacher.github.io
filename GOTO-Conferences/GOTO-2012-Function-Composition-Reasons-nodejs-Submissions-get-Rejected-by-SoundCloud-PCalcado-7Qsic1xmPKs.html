work for Sun cloud without so here's my
boss I'll try not to contradict him
sometimes it's a bit too hard but I
think we can get some compromise oh yeah
he's doing the rooms so that one
interesting thing about soundcloud is
alex was saying we are growing a lot we
we would love to be able to hire someone
every week at least for some time until
we reach the number we think is ok but
it's not that easy to find these people
and one of the reasons not that easy is
there we are quite strict in our
recruitment process and if you if you
pay attention to Alex the same please
say you was your reputation it's because
we do I give a lot of freedom tour
people we the first thing you get on
when you joy sound card is a pair of
headphones and the necessary that gives
you access to pretty much everything so
and to be honest if you join my team I
don't I will help you set up your
machine I'll try to help you with
whatever we can but I won't be I don't
want to babysitting you I won't be there
to support you and have some soundcloud
specific problem like where the hair is
the coffee machine or why are the
instructions in English in German at the
same time so this is the kind of stuff
we will help if we're going to help you
with but we are not going to keep an eye
on what you're doing to make sure you're
not doing something wrong we hired you
we think you should be doing the right
thing we hope so and well first forgot
please click do so the way we try to be
the way to try to find our candidates is
applying exactly a very simple method
compared to some companies I've been to
before which is like couple steps you
click the link you sent the resume
someone's probably going to call you
they're going to have a chat with you
and that like okay someone send you a
coding challenge so it's a small problem
the nature of the problem depends on
what kind of background you have I am
what we call it back engine engineer so
it's going to be a web app with some
my name is in the in the back end but if
you went to an so you have to develop it
the interface and stuff so you received
a code review you have pretty much as
much time as you think you need to solve
it and we receive that that we probably
just put it up on github we receive that
we take a look and then we may invite
you in for interviews or just say yes
sorry interviews I had I was in the UK
when I applied for some car I made I
think six interviews of a skype then
they flew me to blame and then I had six
interviews again so it takes forever I
admit that but it's just because we try
to make sure we are behind the right
people not only your address but we are
also right for you because some people
need a bit more structure than we can
offer what I've learned though in the
past is hi people and I was a consultant
before any for in a consulting company
your business is to sell people's time
so the way you scale is behind more
people and also this is a premium
company so premium company it's because
so they want to they want to hire people
who can look at the kinsale to clients
and be sure that guys going to be doing
a good job so they are quite strict as
well and what I've learned is that the
code review is probably the most
important stage on everything
unfortunately we sometimes have to
reject people that shouldn't have been
rejected and their modern but we're more
than happy for them to apply again but
we have to be absolutely sure that this
code is acceptable and then again this
is some code you spend whatever time you
had whatever time you ask for building
to show off right it's your time to just
deliver this guy something that's
brilliant something that's great we kind
of expect people to put a lot of effort
and not just hack some shit together
move across and if you can't like even
if you have time and you apply for a job
you can't get good right
yeah funny so this is based oh by the
way we don't really tell you which
language you should use soundcloud is
mostly Ruby shop I'm my background is
mostly Java i can though as a consultant
I've done everything but we are most a
Ruby shot but we have projects in Scala
wipers you can see and go I think we may
have projects enclosure we definitely
have a project in Haskell I found out
about last week and anyway we like
people who can write software well
sometimes hi Python people because
they're like yeah item will be they hate
each other but they love each other but
then again that's my graph so this is a
based on the code the challenges I've
reviewed and across my team a bit as
well so I've been in a SoundCloud only
for six months so that's then my
experience in the past six months I'm
just off probation and compilations to
me and this is a distribution across
languages right so Ruby Java JavaScript
see close roots color though I am pretty
sure those are the only languages i got
challenge challenge back home and
interesting the other day was reviewing
some not Jas code again and I was so
curious that I had to crawl my email
inbox and try to find what the patterns
are and i found something like this this
is not exact but it's very close to
reality which is so rad these people
didn't get invited to an interview Green
is like came in for an interview or at
least they received an invite to come
that doesn't mean they were high it just
we brought the guy in and had him
talking to people so if you look at
Ruby's too much half half hey if you
guys it's like a radio school kid he's
probably going to use shit and I'm not
really a big fan of Java I'd say it's
because solo like the number of
submissions in Java receive is not
really great but those who receive go
okay i'll skip javascript
see I've received a couple and it's just
I think with people who never done see
before but the whole these guys are so
hardcore and scalability yeah let's
build it in C and wasn't very good
closure in Scala now I'm completely
biased because I do like these two
languages but I think it's just because
people were cocky enough to send submit
also send challenge completions on those
languages so they kind of knew what they
were doing and no jess is something that
surprises me because JavaScript San okay
language and it's to so many of the
submissions of just rubbish is not good
is just code that I'd I'm not sure how
people wrote it and so but don't get me
wrong it sounds up it's the lane we are
hipsters doesn't really matter if you
ride a fixie doesn't really matter if
you wear funny clothes and funny glasses
everyone's hipster and at soundcloud we
have very geeky heap see's because if
you look this is something from our
mailing list we have a home of mailing
this but this is the one where we talk
about I think the description for this
list is anything sort are kind of
related to development so if I don't
think you could read but there's
something about implementing a
structural type system you Ruby there's
something about the new talk by this
color guy who said that bubble bites
rubbish and the conversation just goes
on and on and on forever so this is a
sphere we have we like languages like
different approaches we do have no J's
project it's not that we don't like we
both on your website you guys may have
seen we launched in private beta Monday
it's pretty much our JavaScript so it's
not that we don't like it it's just
we're not sure why the industry is all
these people who are talking to us have
a bit below the mark and here comes the
darkslides is it readable yeah okay coke
awesome so that was supposed to be an
animation that pops up after I made a
funny comment this is I try to obfuscate
and this is not from the sample we
received so i wouldnt expose someone
like this but this is a typical project
i see when i'm doing any JavaScript sled
installation ljs work these are kind of
fire kind of thing I get it's not oh
it's not functional it's just procedure
of gold and not good procedural code
it's no other kind of stuff that I want
people write in and say or a Pascal if
that was whatever you had to write and
why but why is this why this happened
why someone would get this language
which has so many different features and
its brand new platform with all these
asynccallback all this kind of stuff in
write code which cyclomatic complexity 2
billion because so many ifs and tries
and catches and everything what's going
on what I find what I think is that
again middle hipster culture yeah
nothing is any good if someone else
likes it and all these object oriented
books do this is not java at relax chill
out and let's forget about all this is
much simpler well the balls are we are
kind of throwing away the baby with the
bath tub so it's okay that you don't
want to I know you think that maybe the
best way to use Java generics it's not
relevant in JavaScript or Ruby or
whatever fair enough probably they're
not but that doesn't mean that there's
nothing that you can use this decades of
soft engineering practices in a lot of
computer science as well apply to those
techniques you we need to know what
extract in and out so what do we need
what can we use functional programming
is a passion of mine and even though i
don't think i've ever been into a big
functional programming perfect i'm
really to evade because of that i'm
really trying to figure out what's a
good way to write a program in a
functional level and functional not on
the functional language but in a
functional way and is to apply what i
believe is good from my object oriented
background it's like local evil cohesion
hopefully yadda yadda yadda
with JavaScript specifically I'm very
happy because the first functional
language I effort Rob Bowden was list
with countless and I'm one of those
listed in the closest kind of thing
these days are getting out more but I
really like it and you know there was
all this backlash from JavaScript or
JavaScript was lucky javascript was
there on the right time otherwise this
rubbish language would never make good
big time and this is a very long comment
by Brendan Eich who was the creator of
JavaScript complaining about people
saying that it's like that's not reality
now and he's I think over the past years
it's been really hurt because he had
like 15 days without javascript and he
did a very nice job for what we had but
one interesting thing about this
specific comment is quoted here it's
raining he says that he was quite
influenced by a book called a certain
interpretation of computer programs if
you haven't read it just to it and he
was pretty much higher to do scheme so
it's Kim's a diver dialect of list
there's two major dialects these days
Common Lisp and scheme and like it so
it's inspired by skin heavily and that's
actually true when you start looking at
that and if you look at scheme if it's
okay I see the relationship so now that
we know that it was inspired by scheme
and it's close enough maybe we can
recycle some of our old school knowledge
on how to build programs in scheme and
this kind of functional language and
apply to JavaScript so this book is
called how to design programs I have a
hard copy and I'm proud of it as you can
see with this rubbish picture but it's
available freely available online it's
pretty much one of the only books that
teach you how to write programs in an
object-oriented web sorry function away
you have both load of books about how to
do that for object-oriented languages
you do have a lot about procedural
programming you don't have anything but
these pretty much
and the book was talking about before
searching deputation of computer
programs to teach you about how to how
to create a program based on functions
the most amazing thing is that this
guy's really don't care about functions
that lets teaching you how to write a
program a good program using the tools
they had which is functions but anyway
this which you can definitely come read
it's one of the pages there's this way
they explain to you how to use functions
to abstract so you knowing a language
like Java C sharp C++ use classes those
abstractions in a functional programming
language you're pretty much aiming to
use functions as abstractions that's
your building block that's the kind of
stuff used a lot obviously just like in
a language like Ruby you have classes
you have objects they have meta classes
and all this crazy shit and then you
have blocks and they are kind of related
but there are different tools used in
different situations it's the same for
functional programming but across all
functional programming languages you're
going to see that the function should be
the core of what you're building it
should be or you yeah you're building
block the brakes you lay so here's the
and then thanks ok this example is key
don't don't worry too much about syntax
I made a presentation I have precision
finger the couple of months ago and I
decided to do enclosure with a lisp and
a fortune ahead to spend the whole time
of the presentation explaining
differences and I didn't get my point
across but in this case just don't worry
too much about that about what that's
doing so defined at x is defining a
function called ed which receives a
parameter X loco is like VAR in
javascript so it's like a local non
global variable and that defines again a
function called X at other which
receives why and that's the body of the
function lasting and then it returns
that function you created so the result
of these if you want if you are like me
and you love Emacs that's why we get so
you define you defined if they added no
sorry you evaluate that and then you
create an ad the function and then you
can
call it ok so that was complicated too
many parentheses but we can do exactly
the same in JavaScript so yay curly
brackets so pretty much that's a literal
one to one translation from this slide
before what you have here is a function
a receiving an X and this function
returns a function without a name which
receives y and then all this function
does is to add Y in X so further down
there's a variable other where we call
this function and put the resulting so
when you call at seven that will return
to us a function that takes one argument
and ads that are going to seven this is
what we call no not really but no really
so this is just a it's it's one of the
ways you do with higher order functions
in a in a functional programming
language and in some other languages
which are not purely functional
functions can be passed around like
there were classes so think of that if
this was say java Ruby I could easily
have a function which receives a class
as opposed to an object just receives
the class and there's something with it
and passes around you can open a class
and also our crazy stuff don't do it so
what this code is doing the end is just
sorry just calling so the first print
actually oh no hang on I do have to pick
up that's the result on Chrome so first
I create other bus trader as a result of
calling add passing seven so what I
received back is this so this is just
printing the contents of the faribault
adder and that's the contents right but
unfortunately chrome come to understand
that actually X was replaced by seven so
back booth back up there and x then y 0
x became watching the return line so
these is effectively 7 for this guy and
we know it's seven because when i call n
the function at a plus in 10 it will add
up with lat 7 NB 1017 so this is how
functional programs pretty much work and
this can help us a lot in JavaScript
because we can go old school sure no it
was just the example they had only thing
you could read all right yeah i probably
wouldn't write this thing altogether but
just obviously i'd just translating from
the book so going old school michel i'm
going to so have like 30 minutes and
i'll try to show three examples of how
this can help you write more less
spaghetti javascript so one thing these
passing functions around which is the
whole concept of functional programming
use a function just like you would use
an object in some other languages so i
hope if we can see that we have a
function called add user we see a lot of
these kind of stuff and ed user receives
a user and it has a variable that
database which just reconnect to some
database somewhere doesn't really matter
i then in execute on the DB the result
of us c co inserts so suppose i passed
in the user it will return insert into
users and a bunch of fellows so just
abstract out the actual database details
because the important thing is that we
have to do some connection handling and
deal with exceptions if they happen and
that's very cool but we working on
soundcloud there's always a ed track
method somewhere and that's the next one
so add track receives the track connects
to the database execute whatever the
result of this guy is in the database
and handles exceptions and do all this
kind of stuff so in a reasonably sized
JavaScript project that will be the case
like in 1 billion different places
now weighs many different ways of
dealing with that and by the way I'm not
saying that's the right way or that's
the only way i've been to code bases
where people use the object-oriented
javascript in a very good way at least I
could do stuff that so just the way I
prefer to write it so one of the first
thing we can do it's obvious you just we
sit down and attract you sketch out
what's the common bits around this guy
right so the con bits are the connection
to the database and the fact that we
execute something passing annulment so
and then we handle the database error so
I create a function called execute with
connection and this function receives an
argument and a function to execute so
it's a function that we receive a
function and execute that I could pass
whatever function in there because
javascript has funny typing rules we
have to read a call to see that exactly
something that receives two arguments it
must receive two arguments so after
we've done this we can then rewrite our
old functions making them receive these
two things and then just have the
execute line we could even in strip out
execute maybe and make it part of this
but anyway that's what that's the way we
want to keep so what we've done here is
to create these two functions as
something that don't know anything about
database connections well they don't
there is something as a database
connection but how do you get this
database connection no one knows and
also they don't have to handle errors
these functions are very close to be
what we call pure functions which are
actually Degas few functions but which
are much how much easier to test much
easier to reason about much easier to
read and wide so you have to read a book
because I only have 30 minutes but what
we have to do after this is just to call
execute with with connection passing add
user we passing the function is going to
be executed and then we pass it some
random guy
and we can also call execute with
connection passing in ed track and pass
it in some random track so what's going
to happen then is that it's going to
fall into this guy and add track and
end-user are going to replace function
to execute so when you do function to
execute parentheses which job in
javascript is invoke this function for
me here to execute the function to
define before so that way we don't have
we don't have all this repeated code
across we can just have one guy which
does that it's a bit like
aspect-oriented programming or what we
thought it would be like and then you're
just passing the function you can have
business videos of its kind of function
as long as they follow the protocol
which is it receives two things the
first one is the the database the divers
connection sorry so right cool so next
thing we are able to do so in JavaScript
to use closures a lot but we use them a
lot mostly to mimic object orientation
so a closure is a occlusions of value
defined within the scope and you carry
the scope with you when you pass
functions around so this function where
has access to whatever was in there when
it was defined it's a bit complicated
but hopefully it's going to get clear or
you may have some JavaScript experience
with the whole days involve that we do
so in this case what we have a lot is
something like this so someone is trying
hard to make the program oriented to
functions and not have a lot of state
across and having simpler pure functions
but then we end up with something like
that we have a we have a function called
write comment and there's one thing that
I think every time I've worked in a
high-profile website we had to take care
of these people abusing the website so
what we want to do is to make sure that
if from the same session the same
request a web request you made more than
three things then ya know us Pamela we
don't want you to get out of here
obviously this too simplistic but kind
of this stuff you have
do with every now and then so what this
function does then it receives a counter
some also and a text so it's the altar
of the comment and then is the text of
the comment itself any checks if the
count is higher than three if so just
raise an exception doesn't do anything
anymore otherwise it calls safe comment
passing in the Alpha and the text any
returns count plus one just so the next
situation you know how many times this
winter and what you see here is that we
accentuate the counter with zero that
would be like I know when you create a
session with the web HTTP session for
that user you accentuate that but every
time I'll call that function I have to
pass the culture in and make sure I'm
getting the counter back very important
if I miss one of these it's going to be
interesting I'm also passing the author
and the tax and as you can see i have no
consistency with my quotes which bad i
would reject this no code review so
after this you get this message saying
after all this i mean you get messy
executed too much too many actions I
can't go ahead so obviously this gets
complicated and we're trying to function
to simplify mmm not very sure that's the
case so things you can do is that we can
pretty much keep the right comment as it
is it's not bad it's okay what we need
to do is to add which these closures in
our favor so with this function this is
a function which receives an alpha and
returns a function that just cause write
comments passing the other person in
there and the counter so that's two
closures here one is the alpha because
that's you pass it in first and then you
this value is available to this function
we return at all times and we're not
going to change it it's it's definitely
the whatever the author name was is
going to be the same sorry and also the
counter so the counter we starting with
0 we get this guy with zero and we do
exactly the same
doing before but just within the
function now because this is a closure
what's going to happen is that that VAR
counter is going to be accessible to the
function at all times so whenever got a
function it can access them whatever is
inside the counter object with this we
can simplify our code of it and instead
of instead of having backtracking slides
instead of having that kind of stuff we
have to pass everything at all times I
can have this where I the first thing I
do is to make a customized function so I
call make right common function
fastening the Alpha that I'm going to
use I'm even calling this current user
rights comment because so this is a
function and I'm binding it to the
current user so i don't have to pass in
the current user every time i call it
anymore it's already bound and now so i
can just I can call this function we
return which that function over there
just fastening the text anyway we'll
know that it should well if you it will
be started the counter will be started
with zero and then it will know that it
has to increment out to replace the
counter with whatever the result of tech
I was so we simplified a lot the
interface of the function we actually
using its ok that our function that
actually does the work still needs all
three things and it's probably good
because that makes it pure easier to
test is it a reasonable but then this is
this is this is great because there you
can just pass this function route and
just do stuff for that comments
questions ha so that's the last example
I'm going to talk a bit more about
function that returns function that
returns functions I think we only go two
levels deep this time but trust me this
is crazy shit so we also see a lot of
this kind of stuff where we have a
method called delete user and the delete
user receives the current user the guy
who's performing the action of deleting
someone and the user they want to delete
and then what we do well we don't want
people randomly
licking other people that's probably bad
but we also want admins to be able to
delete those people so what we have is a
check just in the very very first line
of the function where it's like if the
user is trying to delete themselves it's
sad but yeah oh if the guys and add me
then okay keep going that's good out
otherwise just throw an error and log
and call the police so obviously we'll
have a lot of similarities again it's a
common protocol right so have activate
user which doing pretty much the reverse
operation but has the same restriction I
don't want people activating you know
someone tries to fake someone else's
email and try to activate the account
that's bad we don't want that it won't
have the same check and obviously what
happens is that so I call the function I
pass everyone blah blah blah got an
error when I was tiga who is not an
admin with Ranchin HP calçada who is
not done add me add me to pick a card
was okay pick a card pick a card was
okay same thing for activate user pretty
much the same they have the same
contract when it comes to non functional
requirements they do different video
they play different roles when business
rules come in but the whole check
everything around it logging
transactional behavior maybe it's all
the same and then how can function
programming helping help us with that so
again we can create a function returns a
function this time we have this function
called make authorization checking
function horrible name yes and it
receives a function to execute so this
guy will receive a function and build
all this if else logic around it and
invoke it only there and only if it was
supposed to be invoked so we received a
guy in a return a function which with
which receives current user and user to
modify these function we create on the
fly does the if check execute if it's
okay otherwise throws an error that
means that we can write our functions
like that we can just have this
very own yeah so this very simple
version and then again there's another
closure deck in someone pointed to me
current uses a closure because we don't
have to pass it anymore all everything
current user is needed for is handled by
the rocking hold that door code
performing the action doesn't care it
could be anyone so that's what we do and
then we can define safe action safe
activate user as a function and just
call the maker to its authorization lab
very long the name function with
activate user and then make
authorization checking function with
delete user and now we have a safe
delete user and a safe activated yep I
know it's Greenfield all right we the
rule of thumb for this is that we want
you to use as little dependencies as you
can so but if that doesn't mean you have
to build their own database you if you
think a database is required then yes by
all means and we never really projected
people for having dependencies we just
reject useless dependencies and there's
a lot of them
always have this example exceptions
because no just precious no no it's fine
it's just like it could be anything
right it could be the way you handle the
connection just just because i was
wearing these on a browser to test the
code but it could be whatever you you
and also for example in some Club we
have our have practices in we always log
to standard output and we always like
Gary to send it error because that's how
a blogging platform works so this kind
of code would be in that code that deals
with this they have on whole she
actually invite someone Google server
for taxes because then they can show the
closures but there are other
possibilities by we can
object orientation and JavaScript which
were probably more readable than this
one with ease sorry oh those deaths if
someone is trying to betray the road
it's probably about us so these two
things right I think I said before
that's not the way to boot JavaScript
code and object you into JavaScript code
can go very well as well but if you have
if you're having trouble trying to
understand this code written a
functional way which closes all the way
down I'd say is probably not very good
code I haven't seen an example where it
was good because maybe there is but I
haven't seen it but one thing though is
that if you decide to build it in a
functional way and you viewed it in a
functionary and the codes okay
functionally awesome if you try to
decide to go in an object-oriented way
edit build awesome if you mix them both
and you have no idea what you're doing
because he used function to use objects
like roll angle it's a bit different so
i'm not i'm not saying it has to be the
way or even that's more readable it's
more readable to me which had i probably
have a different background but it's
just that's one way of making sure you
get a dependencies corrective define I
like awesome always mm-hmm specified
call interface or something then you can
actually pass call the function which is
five but if you have like big objects
logic is probably easier to have life
class be the case you could hear a case
my point would only be that give
function program and try and because
people are building software's with
these kind of patents forever but as I
said it's not easy to find in literature
and fortress getting better now but did
they always deal with the kind of things
you may think I don't know about that
but it would you take care we do take
out everything consideration so we take
your background as well it sometimes
receive people who have only done java
in a bank for 10 years but it guys
really good at what he does it's not
good in websphere but he's good at
programming it just happens that he had
a salary never left so we look at this
guy a different perspective than we are
looking at the hacker who was working
for Heroku there's all these things but
the problem itself accessibility yes the
phone is really simple and but what
happens often is that we ask you to
extend it after
no there's only one problem bendik
programming languages whatever you want
assembly no please all right we're so
okay so when we get to this stage will
have the safe too late and safe add
functions which don't fit in this slide
we start looking at those like are those
even necessary is sure I keep those
functions you just drop them in and move
them away too I know just use the
activate and delete record maybe maybe
you're just the only reasons we had
these functions before was because we
needed a we need to do all this Jack and
now they're not necessary anymore it
could be the case maybe not maybe yes so
also saying now there is plenty to learn
from and every time someone talks about
the callback hell in nodejs is like
seriously geez is nothing you these we
know forever and those are the tools
people have used since forever to build
these kind of systems the biggest
problem as I was saying before is that
literature and stuff which oriented
toward software engineering as opposed
to use computer science a different
mathematics is not that easy to find so
this is just some books links in the in
the last slide that kind of teach you
different ways of doing these kind of
things and she is a closing thought it's
it's fun to learn something and it's
also learning can be used for evil a
friend of mine who is a in X hacker one
of the best max hackers I know he read
notes source code and he knows all our
lives so he came up with L load which is
an implementation of the concept of no
Jay no just running inside emacs and
this just makes no sense but it's
awesome he made it it's good it works
fantastic you can do inside your ID you
can run your own application
from awesome so yeah any more questions
well it's very likely that we'll
remember the person's name so it's it's
probably not good thing to ask me we can
ask him up yeah I don't know I but I
really am Billy keen to have people see
at least six months ya know well i'll be
at the pub I'm always a report so we can
consider this time cheers thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
