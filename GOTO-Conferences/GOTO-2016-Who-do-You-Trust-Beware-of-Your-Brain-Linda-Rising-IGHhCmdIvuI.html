United States of America I did not vote
for Donald Trump
it's interesting that this talk and a
panel that we're going to have tomorrow
or planned well before the results of
the election but I think they are
appropriate and in fact it's a little
scary about how appropriate they are so
this is a talk about stereotyping and
about judging other people and these
days I spend a lot of time talking about
cognitive neuroscience and behavioral
economics and I know that I don't have
time to get around and talk everywhere
and so I make the same offer wherever I
go which is if you think this was an
interesting talk and you can imagine
that there would have been someone
either a work colleague someone in your
family who might have benefited by being
here and you know I can't come to your
house or your church or your workplace
I'm incredibly old you probably notice
that already in fact you've already
began to stereotype me haven't you
so you know I'm closer to the end then
to the beginning and that means that I'm
gonna run out of time at some point to
give this talk and many others so you
will have to help me and to that end I
will give you the PowerPoint slides I
know that you can go on YouTube and see
versions of a lot of talks and I know
this conference will have this talk
available but I think you need the
PowerPoint and you can change it you
will own it and then you can give it so
that that message can reach a lot of
other people so there's the most
important information that you need is
my email address if I don't get to talk
to you that's a good place to go to ask
questions as well so send me some email
and I'll be happy to send you the
PowerPoint this is a picture of the
entrance to the Museum of Tolerance in
California and I'm not sure that you can
see it very well but it has two doors
the door on the right the green door
over the top is labeled unprejudiced the
red door the door on the left is labeled
prejudiced now it's a little bit of a
trick for the mind because if you go up
to the wrong door you'll find that the
doors won't open only one set of doors
actually leads into the museum and
that's the door on the left there are
cameras outside and lots of people of
various ilk have been seen pounding on
the doors saying let me in let me in
well the message is clear that we all
have to go through the red door we'll
all have to go through the door on the
left
because unfortunately we're all
prejudiced we all stereotype
so there's some of the message today
it's not going to be very enjoyable and
maybe I should begin with an apology I
like to talk about experiments I believe
we don't have enough science in our
decisions today and I especially like to
go back and look at the classics this is
an example of a classic experiment it
was done in the 1950s and it was done in
Oklahoma with some young children some
boys who were only 12 years old and in
the experiment they created two balanced
groups something we don't do in our
field we never say if we're interested
in agile software development or any new
technique why don't we do an experiment
a real experiment and create two
balanced groups and we'll have one group
do agile we'll have one group do what
we've always done and we'll actually
measure the results so that's exactly
what was done here to balance groups
twelve-year-old boys balanced means they
were essentially identical they were in
the same grade in school they were all
white they were all Protestant fairly
well developed from normal households
nobody came from anything that was too
dysfunctional although it's interesting
this experiment was done in Oklahoma
little us joke there was done in a Boy
Scout camp at a place called robbers
cave and the lead researchers last name
was sheriff so I don't know Sheriff
robbers whether there's any connection
the two groups didn't realize that the
other group was there they were
independent of each other and they were
taken out separately in two different
buses ready for phase one and in Phase
one they did well they did what boys do
when they go to camp they they went
swimming they went hiking they cooked
food out and made little campfires they
slept outside they looked at the stars
they just enjoyed being outside they had
a great time and they began to establish
their own identity each group came up
with a name one group said we are the
Rattlers and the other group said we're
the Eagles they created a flag they
wrote songs I had little slogans it's
kind of what we do in a little group we
begin to establish ourselves we begin to
bond we begin to form some pretty close
attachments to the people we hang out
with
still they didn't know there was another
group in the woods another group I was
going to be a surprise so toward the end
of the first week the camp counselors
who were really graduate students
research assistants began to make the
other group known they would get close
enough so the two groups could hear each
other they couldn't see each other yet
but they began to be aware that there
were other people around they could hear
them off in the distance they were
having fun and enjoying their time at
robbers cave and they immediately began
to talk about the other group as those
people they immediately began to label
even though they couldn't see him they
began to make racial slurs in English
that means they called people in that
other group niggers and they said I hope
those people don't come over to our
swimming pool I hope they don't come
over to our campsite I don't want to see
them on our trails because we know that
those people are not people we want to
have anything to do with those people
are not like us
now of course what the two groups didn't
know was these were balanced groups
these two groups were essentially
identical both twelve-year-old boys fly
Protestant having come from very similar
backgrounds they didn't know that it
already made up their minds that these
other people were different these other
people were to be denigrated and avoided
at all costs on the basis of what
information very little hardly any and
what's really disturbing in all the
research that's been done since this
time is that it shows we all do this
we're quick to form little groups and
once we do were quick to say our group
is better we've already seen that they
were joking but this is serious we all
do this we all think our group is better
and we begin to immediately talk about
the other groups they're not quite as
good as we are
all in Phase two the camp counselors
research assistants actually introduced
the two groups to one another and they
began to have some competition they said
we're going to have some baseball games
we're gonna have other sports and when
we do mmm there's gonna be a winner and
a loser we're gonna have some prizes
oh my we're we're doing out here -
aren't we we're a voting who's better
who didn't get as many votes and the
winners are always happy and they
celebrate and the losers well they know
that there must be something wrong with
that process because really we are
better we didn't happen to win that game
but we know we're better so this was
intentional it was meant to fuel that
already aggressive nature that the two
groups of boys were expressing toward
each other it was to make it worse well
the problem is aggression began to
emerge from just the interaction of
little twelve-year-old boys they began
to have Wars after one particular event
why the Rattlers flag was burned by the
Eagles in retaliation and then later on
the Rattlers launched a night raid and
they began to store up rocks weapons of
mass destruction
this was really getting serious we've
got open warfare here between two groups
of little boys children who are really
the same who have the same cultural
background they're ready to burn their
cabins to the ground over a baseball
game
well now the staff graduate students
were instructed to let's try to bring
them back together let's see if we can
think of ways to make peace and the
initial efforts were not so successful
they said well why don't we play some
non-competitive games we'll bring in
some movies we'll we'll watch those
movies together
we'll have fun we'll have fun together I
don't know how many of you have ever
been on those team-building exercises
where they haul you out into the woods
and and people take turns jumping
blindfold from a picnic table and that's
supposed to build trust
how did that work out for you was that
successful so the research is pretty
clear that does not work by the way in
case you didn't know and in fact it
really made things worse they were
eating together now watching movies and
having fun and instead right in the
middle they would have a big food fight
I don't know whether you have food
fights in Europe or not but in the
middle of a meal someone will just yell
food fight and you'll pick up your
mashed potatoes and throw them at the
person sitting across from you that's
how it works in case you want to get
that started here
well let's leave them throwing mashed
potatoes at each other and let's talk a
little bit about what the scientists had
to say then apparently this is a
hardwired tendency and that means that
at one time it had survival benefit a
lot of these hardwired biases and
tendencies that we have are there for
some reason that at a time in our
existence meant survival that at one
time we were supposed to gather in small
groups at one time we were supposed to
say everybody who's not in my group is a
bad person and so now we're stuck with
this behavior and the bad news is that
we all do it and we all do it all the
time
as soon as we meet anybody we begin to
put them in a little box and we label
that box and then depending upon how
severe that labeling is we might really
pound nails into the box to make sure
that that person doesn't escape I know
how that feels because when I came
through the border yesterday there was a
gentleman standing there and he was
looking at everybody who came through
and I heard him ask questions how are
you gonna be here and why are you here
are you here for business he asked a lot
of questions but not for me
I went up to him I gave him my passport
he looked at me and you could tell he
already had that box ready it said old
woman he stamped that past for it he
didn't ask me any questions
he just waved me on through now I was
happy about that on one hand but on the
other hand I thought he doesn't think I
can do anything I get that when I sit on
an exit row on an airplane the flight
attendant looks at me and then she
kneels down because she's not sure I can
see her she gets down right at eye level
and she speaks very slowly do you know
you're in an exit row yes I do
I know I'm in an exit can you lift 45
pounds yes I can my suitcase weighs 55
pounds
do you read English yes I read English
so I know she's done the very same thing
she put me in a box incompetent old lady
and she put a couple of nails in the top
of that box and she's not gonna let me
out and we all do that and we do it all
day
the survival benefit is that at one time
it was important we had to categorize
things we had to say this is good or
this is bad food danger people who made
mistakes in those categories did not
survive to produce us those who were
successful at categorization were the
ones who lived long enough to reproduce
and here we are today vast labelers of
everything especially each other when
Martin Luther King was assassinated in
1968 there was a third grade teacher in
Iowa who said how can I make my children
understand what happened here because
they've never even seen a black person
they have no idea what it feels like
discrimination they don't know what that
means how can I teach them so she came
up with a brilliant idea of going into
her class the next day to say you know
I've read some interesting research and
it told me that blue-eyed children are
smarter than brown eyed children so I'm
gonna divide the classroom I'm gonna put
the blue-eyed children over here and I'm
gonna pretty much spend my time with
them
the brown-eyed children well they're
nice we know that but I'll just give
them some coloring books I'll keep them
busy but I know they can't learn as well
oh and let's not play together when we
have recess blue-eyed children well you
stay together brown-eyed children well
you have to go play over on the other
side I don't want to see you mixing with
each other oh and just to be sure I made
these little collars and I want all the
brown-eyed children to wear those so we
all remember the brown-eyed children
they're just not as smart
I know you don't have time to read and
look at all the lengths not only in my
presentation but in everyone's but if
you do have time to watch this video
those children are now gathering as
adults
remembering what that was like and the
brown-eyed children say I remember how I
remember when she she put that collar
around my neck I felt stupid
so that's the bad thing about what we do
when we put those labels on people we
create the behavior that results from
those labels we make those people behave
we're creating reality by setting
expectations so if we think somebody is
stupid or incompetent or too old to
matter then that's what they become what
enormous power and we do it all day
every day to everybody we meet
constantly labeling who's smart and who
isn't who's got it and who doesn't and
that's especially bad if say you're a
manager I've never been a manager but I
did read a paper once that said you know
managers do this kind of labeling long
before they have ever seen any evidence
of performance they've already decided
who are the good guys and who are the
ones who are not gonna make it so I
wondered I know a lot of managers and
and I asked a friend of mine I said hey
Dave is this true I read this research
that says managers make up their mind so
quickly I mean is that possible
and he said well Linda well yeah you
know I guess maybe maybe we do but but
we're always right
of course they are of course they are as
soon as they've put that label as soon
as they put that collar around your neck
well that is what you're gonna become
that sets that expectation all right
I've got a video here I live in
Nashville Tennessee now so what we would
do at this point is we'd offer up a
prayer oh god I hope this video really
works
thank you God
thanks to the Carlsberg brewery who gave
me permission to use that film the first
time I showed it in a presentation a
gentleman came up to me afterwards with
tears in his eyes and he said you know I
ride a motorcycle he said but I'm afraid
to tell the people in my team because I
think they think about people who ride
motorcycles exactly the way the people
in this video thought about people who
ride motorcycles they've already put him
in a box and the label says bad boy we
don't want to have anything to do with
them we're fair we're very afraid we're
terrified well actually they looked mean
didn't they and isn't that enough if
they look me surely that means they are
mean surely that means they are bad
people so we know that's a bad thing
about doing that to other people but
here's the really bad news which is we
do that to ourselves and something I
care deeply about is that especially
women do this because we know how the
world thinks about women well you know
women are nice we don't mind having them
around for some things but really when
it comes to the hard stuff you know math
and science well you know women they're
nice people to teach us don't have it
that's just the way it is and what's
really bad is we buy into that and we do
that to ourselves not only women but
members of minority groups who are
stereotyped in any culture believe
subscribe to they let that stereotype
get in their way
this experiment has been done many times
where they've given someone who's in a
stereotyped group a really really
difficult test of some sort math for
instance and if they're reminded before
they take the test maybe it's just a
little box at the beginning that says
gender or race or ethnicity or maybe
it's a reminder a comment from the
person who's giving the test well you
know women don't usually do very well on
these advanced math tests all it takes
is a little tiny sliver of a reminder to
lower significantly the scores compared
to someone who doesn't have a reminder
they do very well just as well as those
who are not in the stereotype group we
can see this in video games when someone
is playing the role of an avatar who's a
member of a stereotyped group their
performance is measurably statistically
significantly less we buy into that and
we know that that changes our behavior I
heard Michael Hill say this once
I heard him say it a second time after I
was familiar with this research and I
finally got it he said the number one
rule for good management catch them
doing something right well they're okay
now that makes sense
because now that means it's the job of
management to go out and actively seek
good performance and what we know is if
that's the expectation
that's what they will see they will
create that in their own teams it's the
same for norms prime directive if you do
a retrospective and you begin by saying
what was a struggle for us all those
years I honestly believe that everyone
was doing the best job he or she could
it was hard it was hard to step up and
say that but now I know that if you do
it and you say that over and over that
sets expectations you become that team
you become those people who always do
their best and then finally I discovered
this paper Harvard Business Review is
going to charge you for it but I will
send it to you for free please don't say
anything to Harvard Business Review but
it's a result of experimental studies
that show the impact of managers belief
on the performance of employees if you
are a manager or you know a manager you
should definitely read that paper oh my
goodness I forgot those children are
still back there throwing mashed
potatoes and hot dogs at each other
let's go back and see if we can remedy
that because what the researchers
finally came up with was let's have some
project and the idea they came up with
was what if something happened to the
water supply of the camp what if we
discovered that water was no longer
coming in and now we're all that have to
find the problem we think it has
something to do with the pipe that
brings the water into the camp so we're
all going to have to spread out we're
gonna have to follow that pipe from the
point where it comes into the camp until
it delivers water to the kitchen let's
all get out there and see if we can find
what the problem is and so they did and
they
and they realized they had worked
together on something that was affecting
all of them and and there that there are
elements to this project that were very
effective in bringing these boys
together so they did another project
they said there's a big tree it's about
ready to fall down and if it does fall
down it's going to hit the roof of the
mess tent so it's going to take all of
us we're going to put ropes around the
tree trunk and we're going to try to
pull it off but we all have to do it we
all have to work together it takes all
of us and if we don't we're going to
lose the mess tent major impact
something we all care about and then a
trucks that brought in supplies got
stuck and they all had to get out and
push the truck after a series of
projects like that where they were all
impacted where they all had to work
together where it took everyone's effort
to address the real problem then there
were no Rattlers and eagles anymore it
was all about us we solve these problems
we worked together they were able to all
go home on the bus and they sang the
Rattler songs and the Eagle songs and
all the other songs they knew and and
they all lived happily ever after well
Linda it's a nice story but these little
boys they were all alike weren't they
they were all 12 year olds Protestant
white let's see what would happen is
let's really mix it up
so that experiment has been done over
and over and over again many times with
11 or 12 year old boys so I thought
these would be a good comparison robbers
cave and now let's look at this one this
was done in Beirut in 1963 and at that
time Lebanon was suffering from a lot of
conflict and aggression between two
religious groups the Christians and the
Muslims this experiment involved eight
Christians ten Muslims and these boys
had been raised in religious schools as
part of a pretty severe religious
culture religion was real and it was a
driving force in their lives so it's
probably no surprise that they went
through phase one sure they formed
identities they called themselves either
the blue ghosts or the red genies but
when things began to get a little
peasant
all of a sudden there was severe
aggression immediately three genies
threatened a ghost
with knives and the counselors said hold
it this has gone too far we better break
this up
ah so see Linda look if you're reading
this result and probably making the same
mistake that I am you're probably saying
to yourself we'll see Linda look
religion this is really severe it
divides people just like in the United
States right now we've got a big divide
right down the middle and we think
that's pretty severe we think there's
really no way around that we're gonna
probably move two knives next I have no
idea but you would be wrong because
that's not how the experiment was done
at all the experiment was done by
dividing up the boys we didn't just put
the Christians together and the Muslims
together we put half the Christians in
one group the other half and the other
and the same thing for the Muslims and
when the violence broke out it wasn't on
the basis of religion at all
it was the three genies and their ghost
victim who were Christians so the
amazing thing about all of this research
that was started by Sharif is that yes
we have this hardwired tendency we
divide people up but when we're together
in a collaborative group when we work
together in small teams that turns out
to be a much more powerful driver for
our decisions we develop those intense
loyalties by working together on
collaborative projects and it can in
this case override religion
other experiments have shown it can
override strong political beliefs strong
nationalistic beliefs we love to be
together in little teams and we love to
work on projects where we get a real
result by all contributing we love
collaboration so we've got these two
hardwired tendencies to divide and label
and we've also got this overwhelming
need to work together in a small
collaborative group we call it
cooperation the social scientists have
another name that we'll talk about and
what we know is it has these elements
but there's got to be a shared goal of
some kind something we all care about
and that throughout an organization if
this is part of a company all of us have
to feel that that we're working on some
kind of shared goal something we all
care about and when I started to read
the characteristics I thought I wonder
if this is what we care about an agile
we got all hung up on a lot of other
things that I don't think are especially
important maybe this is the essence
maybe it's this working together on
things we all care about where we all
feel that we're important the daily
stand up what did you do what did you do
what did you do my contribution to the
group was pairing where we talked to
each other about decisions that we agree
on the short time box iterations where
we say we all agree that we're going to
work toward that goal and we're not
going to let that deadline slide and
then we take time to look back and learn
together
so in the United States especially we
get confused we think everything is all
about liking people and being friends if
you can't go out afterwards and have a
beer with them well that must mean that
we don't get along and that's not true
so we need to separate those feelings
I've worked on a lot of very successful
teams and projects with people I did not
like it's got nothing to do with liking
the element that has to be there that we
care about is called respect and Trust
so now we'd have to have that debate
wouldn't we can you respect and trust
somebody you don't like so these are the
elements that are important everybody's
involved in whatever the project is
everybody's contribution is important
and I know that I can't do what I have
to do unless you do what you have to do
we're all in this together
out of that evolves that trust and
respect
the social scientists call this social
interdependence and they define it this
way team members share common goals each
person's outcomes affected by the
actions of others I understand I can
only make my goal if you make yours
we're all in this together and of course
what the social scientists have done
that we cannot or we don't seem to be
able to do is they can measure the
benefits of this kind of collaboration
and when they do they see an increase in
performance achievement both at the
individual level and at the team level
things become more positive less
dysfunctional lots of good attributes in
other words that can be measured I don't
want to leave you feeling really bad I
know I started out by saying I didn't
vote for Donald Trump and that kind of
makes me sick to my stomach right now so
I'm trying to get past that so this is a
story about World War one and at that
time across Europe there was a giant
trench miles and miles and miles across
many countries the trench was pretty
long but it wasn't very wide and the
troops on either side of that trench as
a result were so close to each other
that they could see they could see the
other side and they knew when supplies
came in and they knew when the wounded
and the dead were carried out in other
words they knew when the other side was
most vulnerable and so one of the things
that began to happen over the years that
troops spent buried in mud and blood and
water
he's broke out they didn't sit down at a
table they didn't sign any documents
they just began to not fire on the other
side at critical times since I know when
your food rations are coming in I won't
fire on you then since I know when
you're taking your wounded and your dead
out I won't take advantage of that and
you'll begin to see that and you'll do
the same for me because you know when I
am most vulnerable we begin to
collaborate
well wait a minute wait a minute Linda I
thought the very first thing on that
list that you just gave us I thought it
had something to do with shared goals
well wait a minute these are people who
are fighting to the death
what is the shared goal here
I think it's I just want to go home I
want to go home I don't want to be here
it wasn't my idea to be here I just want
to go home and that Holl felt that way
they didn't necessarily have to like
each other but they knew they they
shared that it's very strong feeling I
want to survive I want to see my family
again I I want to go home so I think a
lot of you know that I love animals well
actually you're animals
aren't you and I love research about
animals especially primates so this last
story is about some primate research
that was done to two kinds of monkeys
one the rhesus the rhesus monkeys are
very aggressive they don't get along at
all if anything happens they fight they
bite they scratch they scream they don't
get along there's another species of
monkeys called the stump tails because
they have no tails so that's an
appropriate name and they are
peace-loving and they love grooming so
some scientists wondered suppose we took
some of these when they were just babies
and we put them together I wonder what
would happen would the rhesus just tear
the stump tail babies to shreds or would
the stop tail babies somehow well
the rhesus babies a better way it was an
interesting experiment and what they
noticed was that immediately the stump
tails fell in love with the rhesus
monkeys because the rhesus monkeys have
long fluffy tail and since the stump
tails love to groom they start with the
tail and they would groom those tails
and the rhesus monkeys well we don't
know what they were thinking but we can
sort of imagine wow this is pretty cool
I kind of like having somebody groom my
tail wouldn't you the end result of the
experiment was the rhesus learned how to
groom they learned a better way and long
after the babies were separated the
rhesus kept those new I guess you could
call it a cultural practice that they
had learned a better way they had
learned not to be so aggressive they had
learned a little bit more about being
open there was a picture of stump tails
grooming I think it's reason for hope
I hope this hasn't been too bad for you
are you okay you're not too depressed
and I don't know if we have time for
questions maybe two minutes I'm not sure
if not thank you thanks for listening
okay if you have a question please come
forth to the microphone okay there's one
question yes where we go everything's
fine
and then I have another question that is
coming through the app I thought that
was a wonderful talk and actually far
more it was hopeful nothing you do
brilliant I just want to ask one
question about what if anything do you
think is the place of competition
between small groups oh the first part
was just that it was a wonderful talk so
you talked about he talks about groups
collaborating together and you've
alluded to competition and the
competition between those groups not
working out so well I just wonder what
what do you think is the role or is
there a place for competition in our
endeavors I don't think you can get rid
of it I think it's definitely a part of
how we are at least Western society is
very competitive and so it's not going
to disappear overnight
and it's just the same way for the
stereotyping there's nothing we can do
about that we're stuck with it what we
can do is be aware of the penalties of
that for instance I I once worked with a
company and in fact just recently doing
a retrospective and we spent half a day
on t-shirts because part of the people
on the team got a t-shirt for being on
the end the other people did not so they
were angry at not being included so I
think we have to be aware when we do
anything on a team is that going to set
up some kind of rivalry because it can
happen like that in many of these
experiments they've shown that people
will bond together and begin then to
fight with other teams on the basis of
something as little as a t-shirt or
where your social security number lies
or whether you overestimate it or
underestimated jelly beans in a jar I
mean we're just ready to go so we have
to be aware of that and we have to be
aware when we're running organizations
that if a decision is something that's
going to set people against each other
it will
oh I knows that not too hopeful is that
I think the most important thing is that
you're saying to be aware of it and then
if you're aware of it then you can
engage with it is being aware and also
that behavior drives attitude when we
make those decisions about other people
and we put them in the box and we put
the nail in the top of the box we think
it's because they have some set of
characteristics well those people are
when really we're making that up the
characteristics we attribute to the
people in the box are things we created
and that the people in the box are not
either homogeneous but many of them are
closer to us than they are to each other
and so we've also got to realize that
when we ascribe those characteristics to
those people that we are creating that
that list is something our brain created
we made it up
actually our brain is creating about
most of reality that we see anyway so
that's another talk yeah indeed this one
question through the app which says how
can we teach ourselves to not frame
stereotypes regarding us being a woman
in tech industry how can I abolish these
prejudices that I will do worse than men
okay so you can't these are hard-wired
tendencies there is absolutely nothing
you can do about it and the illusion
that you can walk out of here now and
say oh well Linda told me everything
there is to know about stereotyping
that's what other people do
no I feel like I said that many times is
we all do this and we do it to everybody
you're gonna spend two days now talking
to each other and while you're doing
labeling them categorizing them putting
them in boxes you can't help it it's
what you do but maybe you'll be a little
aware of it maybe you'll think about
what you're thinking that's not enough
but it's a start
so realizing how stuck we are and that
we all do it
even people who are graduate students
who study this full-time for a living
people who teach it say when they are
examined for stereotyped biases they are
just as severe as those of us who are on
the outside who don't study it 24/7
we're stuck with it there's nothing you
can do about it and maybe that should
raise awareness even more sorry
and Donald Trump is going to be in the
White House for four more years - so
you're stuck with it god help us are we
done yes thank you very much
