talk about the Lean Startup way today
and I would say in in very different
forms and ways and from different
backgrounds so but all very
inspirational for me at least and I'm
sure by the applause that from anyone
from a lot of other people okay so am
first question and I'd like to ask you
and Michael about this how would you
recommend recommend enterprises to get
started and where should you start as an
enterprise I mean how do you how do you
how do you take this so I've seen quite
a lot of enterprises starting working on
this and I think that the best way that
I can phrase the successful ones are the
ones that start with activities on the
top and in the middle and on the broad
kind of at the same time because you
need the support from top so the best
thing that I've seen was when I was at
at eBay we invited John Maeda to come
and one of the design icons of Silicon
Valley to come and talk to us about the
importance of design while the CEO was
on stage and bringing in Brian Chesky
the a PNP CEO who is also a designer and
tell that story in front of the full
leadership of the company that's a way
to start I've never seen anything as
effective as what we did there yeah so
seeing is believing and when you see
someone who tried this thing out then
then you you have the guts you know you
are motivated to and when you see your
CEO and and leadership inspired and when
they say this is what we need to do go
and do that for me and for us that's
that's when I called
can start to pivot hmm effectively yo T
have something to add there yeah I think
very much agree with that I I believe
that the the top layer and the middle
layer and also the folks that are
working day-to-day it's so crucial that
it's it's a culture shift on all three
levels and I've seen it work at
Starbucks I've seen it work at Nordstrom
and in particular what sponsorship does
for teams that are working with them is
they can create room and I think room is
what we need to be able to build
innovation and software in these large
enterprises it's the ability to sort of
be a little bit off the beaten path not
to have so much of the structure because
the reality is the customer defines that
for us and so when we were building some
of the MVP experiences around the
Starbucks app we actually had a sort of
satellite team where we were able to
have a sponsor our CTO at the time
Stephen Gillette who's at Google X now
he said to sort of go off and build this
and let's iterate and make sure that you
guys have the path the green light but
you have to be able to show me that
you're moving forward and so it took
that that collaboration between our
leadership and our team and then
ultimately when we started chipping
things people got excited because it was
new and changing so to me it really is
that balancing act between both both
levels otherwise one of them going
doesn't actually help the other and at
Nordstrom we have to always prove that
what we're doing actually has a business
revenue but certainly a customer impact
and so that's what we're doing there as
well glass you have something to write
here yeah I think I mean I totally agree
what where you see what it works the
best that is also what my experience is
from how to get traction however when
you look at there are traditional
companies there is actually a situation
in many companies today where middle
management and senior management they
haven't committed yet yeah and then and
then my my professional advice will be
to everyone don't wait on the lower
levels then you have to start on lower
levels to start learning to and generate
some traction so you actually can use
those
proof forms as you said to highlight
foot to middle and top management we are
doing great things because otherwise you
will always wait for the people above
you to get it and when they get it it
will be way too late in many cases so
that I think is it the only aspect I
would like to list you as went on I'm
waiting a little bit with involving you
- because you don't believe in surprises
can do this at all but that's fair
enough I believe but they can't make
backing out of it
exactly the magic magic okay so so
Michael what in your opinion what you
have seen so now we know how we should
start but what are the biggest
challenges you have seen you know like
top three challenges you see enterprises
when they want to do this they're
motivated and now what what is the
what's the problems so a lot of times I
see the lack of actual capable skilled
people in the organization so there's a
lot of people who've done like read
books and seen videos and maybe spent
one or two days on on courses but
they're not very good at it and so the
lack of skilled people so often what
what we've done and I've seen the last
year so is that we put in a mix of
highly capable doers and then mix them
in with the with the enterprise team so
that you actually get someone who gets
it
in the room or get enough of them so
that's the one thing to have enough
skilled people in the room and then that
the whole kind of permission that we
talked about before that you actually
you often get started without the
permission and you get that whole
political thing so you have to do a
little hide and seek and and and hide a
little away at times
that's the other one to make something
that you're actually allowed to start
showing and dare to show it it is
another is another thing I think those
two were the most important ones and
then maybe doing trying to reach too far
too quickly and not building something
that's small and still valuable
for the company as showcases so really
really keep it simple but valuable it's
the third one you said that Nordstrom
you had their bill to usability labs
just next to the sea level offices yes
that in their face so they could
actually see this is going on guys you
know so can you elaborate a little bit
on that what I mean you put it there for
a reason so it must be because of a
challenge what do you see the main
chalasis so one of the main challenges
is to recognize how the process even
works for our leadership so there again
being a retail company for a long time
even just the process of bringing
customers in and having them respond to
experiences was new for our leadership
and so the number one thing was
visibility the visibility that this was
something that we were doing and it was
in pursuit of the goals of the company
and I think because if you think about
being in a store and working in a store
you interact with customers every second
you know you're always trying to think
about that and as we kind of grow into
our roles you get sort of separate from
the customer over time and we we
certainly want to make sure that our
leadership recognizes that we're
thinking about this digital customer as
well as the customer in the store so the
the paradigm shift was really to try to
get the organization to see this as an
unlock for the future but also recognize
it's really what the company is all
about anyway so it was this nice moment
but I do think that the investment of
doing it and really showing like
bringing them along the way through it
was something that was an active part of
our principles of evangelizing what
we're trying to do so that was a
capability through the UX team that we
made our goal with our product team as
well like how do we bring in our
leadership to showcase these experiences
and teach them along the way and that
was how we sort of unlocked the
opportunity to go into the store and do
studies go in home and do studies and
that value became crucial and then to
all of our points up here is when you
start proving actual experiences that's
when the fodder kind of gets
it's better but we have our leadership
comes to the labs pretty regularly you
know every day but they know it's
happening and I think that just gives
them a sense like we are connecting with
our customer they are guiding the post
of where we're doing which is just what
we do in the store anyway so like
reuniting it with the guiding principles
of the company it helps quite a bit okay
as you put you're the only one who had
the notion chief digital officer on your
high tech I interpreted that as that's
kind of a signal for an organization
that they know now the digital change
has to happen can you a little bit more
about what you see out there and and how
many of these that you see you know what
is what's your view there yeah but you
know I think if I were if I would be a
little bit harsh I could actually say
when a company needs a chief digital
officer and the other executives have
failed
I've actually embracing new technology
as a part of their daily job because
what you see today in in many companies
is actually that CEOs are being brought
in to drive transformation over a signal
over some kind of period and that
actually means that that the existing
organization have had trouble of of
keeping up with what is happening in
their own industry and also in competing
industries and potentially actually
industries which a couple of years ago
weren't even competing with them
and that is why the CEO role in many
cases have developed quite quite rapidly
and linking this back also to the
hurdles and some of the challenges I can
also see out of experience that one of
the big challenges in getting this
thinking into existing organizations
it's actually profits that you earn a
lot of money on your existing products
and services so you issue you actually
become a little bit complacent around
that and also that the majority of your
executive time focuses on on keeping and
preserving those profits which to some
extent is absolutely right from a
shareholder value perspective but also
linking it back to to what I highlighted
this morning that is also about
the business side being able to be
bimodal keeping alive what you have
today and maximize profit and customer
value out of that but also making sure
you have the bandwidth internally to
build for the future and that is where
these type of techniques become
extremely valuable okay but today was
not in particularly about how you could
adopt Lean Startup enterprises so let's
go back to the roots a little bit and
talk about you know where it came from
and you Michael you didn't have anyone
to convince about which method to adopt
but maybe you can elaborate a little bit
about how you grew your organization
from just you to to where you are today
and the next 50 hires what kind of
people would that be you know maybe talk
a little bit about organization yeah
definitely and I think it's good point I
also had like the pleasure to talk to
some of the audience during the coffee
break now and and kind of got some of
the same Christians around that and I
think it's really important so so
initially you were definitely in a mode
where you just need like the UI guy and
then someone who can build the backend
and make everything put together and you
can do that more less garage way and
everything is simple and then we grew
the company to probably around 10 to 15
people adding sales some of the finance
functions and so on like you usually do
with companies and you kind of get to
the next step because now you want to be
more focused you can see first of all
you need to hard for some of the
products you have already you need to
add more people to that one you need to
ensure that the infrastructure runs more
professionally and so on and then you
probably have some new ideas you have
like this new thing coming for us it's
like a theorem coming in or it could be
like and you like for outline that you
want to build and how do you do that
because as soon as you go even for a
small company you go to the tech people
to the CTO and the tech guys there they
would immediately say to you yeah it's
certainly doable we have so much so long
list of priorities here and we kind of
if you need to pick that one you can't
do the other one and you can just feel
already even though we have an
organization of 20 people you can just
feel this this bottleneck and kind of
this this this you want to put
everything into one platform idea and
that's where we kind of decided on one
of the
products we were launching to say we're
doing this in another way so so right
now we had like everyone distributed we
had a team all over the world and it was
good and it's good for like our base
bassists basic technology that we built
that way and then we choose to have
product team and put them all in one
office and say now little bit other
culture you're going to do something
different you're essentially using all
the stuff the other guys are doing but
you are building on top of that so you
put you in one room and you do something
else now and that's kind of changing
some of the culture that way at the same
time we also typically pick one or two
of the people from the old culture and
put into that team and ensure that they
can cross pollinate things that way and
still have some of that there but no
restrictions around oh you need to use
this kind of platform and you need to do
it this way everything it should be Java
everything needs to be this and so on we
don't do this at all and then from that
team we kind of one of the one of the
individuals that he were able to say
okay we need to have something with a
theorem and that's I can do a prototype
for that one yeah knock yourself out
early weekend I need it and then we
could kind of have that product we did
that as a team by itself so now it's a
team by itself is still part of like the
basis layer but it's going to be built
in a different way so we don't have any
like ties into the corporate thing that
you need to do this and that and I think
that's really one of the important
things we try to do so so we Sin City
the only the only platform we have two
days are our socks that's the same words
and otherwise the rest of the platform
even the ite even like we have nothing
in common that way so people would sit
on Windows machines and other machines
we don't care if they had different
phones we don't care they get like ATS
how where they look deep in the eyes of
the security responsible and he tells
them what to do and what not to do but
how they do it it's up to them and we're
not going through to mess with that so
we really try to not build an IT culture
that's the same in the entire company
but just make room for spawning out fast
teams that do something fast and that
essentially becomes innovation on the
edge that way even though obvious to the
small company that's how and then you
asked about the next 50 50 hires and
again definitely building out on on that
new team that those going to build a
product there and then I see growing the
company adopting the number of people to
around
Caruso will be an effort we need to add
much more like of these staff functions
and so on and make all that layer much
more solid in different ways so we will
see that who like HR people and so on
and we haven't had that today so that
means I'm all the things that you don't
have a title for and I kind of look
forward to not have to be the bottleneck
there okay I also know that you don't
have one office for everyone sits in no
so let's all talk a little bit about
that you know the physical organization
or something of an organization that
needs to be very innovative very fast
going and you might know how do you see
the the ideal set up there yeah so so
also I think that it's very hard to put
everyone on one room especially if you
start growing so I think that when you
are at a 10 10 person company still
works fine but very soon you you run out
of talent and in that place or you need
to be other places so I think that
finding a way that enables you to do
that let each team get empowered to do
things on their own and they they have a
sandbox that that works really well for
them and they can good walk work fast
it's important and then you need to
build some kind of connective tissue
throughout the organization that that
talks about how do we manifest our
values and and how do we how do we build
on each other's learnings so that you
don't end up like a sleeper cells okay
really a welfare where people don't even
know who who their colleagues are so I
still believe in this digital age that
physical meetups in in kind of between
team members is important and that's why
I think that these Sprint's are so
important because it's highly valuable
time and it's super expensive for the
company but you really need to go there
and have the eye level and and and get
the full collaboration started up
physical and then you can go and
and do your thing on the distance with
that and any views on okay if you had to
choose between not choose between but
you can either have everyone sitting at
their own desk maybe at home you know
because you have a philosophy we hire
the best and the best is not in one
place so we hire them where they are and
we assume they don't want to move okay
as opposed to let's hire them in the
same city yeah and having one office
where they might come sometimes or not
or at least we have these meetings I
mean what is you what would you ideal
way of doing this if you we're going to
drive a startup and it well I I just
would never do a startup that consists
of people that sit all over the place
it's so hard to make people to create a
shared culture if you are not kind of
physically connected but of course you
need to be able to accommodate to
specialists that are so scarce that you
will have to fire them no matter where
but but but it's it's super important
that they're together especially in the
startup you form the culture of the
company and if the culture is formed
being absence we don't we don't we don't
care then then it's really hard to get
to get to there later so it's very
critical to get the culture right from
the beginning because now that comes
from the corporate guy and this is
really interesting yeah so essentially
from the beginning I was sitting
together at all
so so we met of course and I knew Jana
already and we've been like underthrown
and different channels for a long time
so I think that we're kind of even
though I'm too old to claim that I'll
still feel like millennial generation
that way and would say that well if I
look at my kids today they are not
together so you could say like how can
you have friends when you're not
together and that's kind of what I
typically see so when I was a kid I was
playing and you know our road if you're
playing football and other stuff we
write meet and sit together and do
something more nerdy and so on and and
what they do today they're online and
they're together
so this mode of thinking and this mode
of working you can actually build
culture and the people that they meet
when they meet they actually have the
same culture can see immediately so you
kind of build a culture that way and we
did that from the beginning so everyone
was distributed we had like this
philosophy that we won and then one guy
who lived in Copenhagen he asked me I
can't have an office in the city how
well you can they can get an office then
if you want that then we can sit there
together and it's fine and then we sat
like two people in one office and now we
are like seven eight people in that
office but they're all like in different
teams we still together but I still feel
that the connection just the spiritual
connection and when we all of us meet
you can just see that we hired the same
people so they're like it culture is
really really the same so I think you
can actually build culture even though
you're remote especially today and I
would say that looking at the younger
generation today that's what they're
doing all of them and then I think
there's one funny thing so when when I
get this question typically and how can
you do this how can you manage people
that way I typically say have you ever
tried to go into a balloon full of
developers they are all virtual they are
not there they sit with headphones on
and through screens in front of them and
the communicator was slack even though
in the same room because it works better
and they kind of can stay in the zone
and what's important for them is silence
or kind of the zone and that's cool and
I want to respect that so it means for
me it's not and I did that I creating as
well we had one guy driving in from from
Mountain View every day and I told him
stop doing that you don't need to be in
the office you can stay at home I know
how you Sydney you can do things much
better that way and you could just stay
there instead of going to San Francisco
and if we're fine so I think you can do
it I think when you you
the challenge is typically having a lot
of people in one spot and then the
satellites and satellite becomes second
second second great citizens and you
don't really want that to happen so you
kind of need to say in one team the
disability team is here and that's fine
but otherwise I think you can actually
build it right off it it also depends
what you want your culture to be able to
do because body we were doing these I
mean doing co-creation sessions and
teaming up and going to to see and
empathize with customers it's just hard
to do at home in front of you so we we
have we have a
yeah how about that so we definitely
need a need but most of the time we
don't so you know typically they do like
a team set up the launcher project let's
eat together three days then they're
back home again and then three months
later they're having it again
so yeah sure okay us and and I will
bring the the large cooperation hat on
on these type of aspect because it has
two dimensions I mean number one when
you're doing these type of techniques in
a large organization sometimes you
actually need to move people out instead
of moving them in yeah so actually
taking them from the large corporate
facilities and officers and moving them
to new areas where for example you have
a number of startup factories and so on
so that they get energized around the
new thinking because that that's a
infusion of new type of culture at the
same time when you bring in new people
in many cases from startups or from
other type of industries then it's they
know what to do around these techniques
and so on however then it's important
for them to get a notion about the
culture and the leadership in the
organization they try to impact because
otherwise there will always be electrons
moving in the wrong direction and and
that will not be held for long-term vice
so those are also two two aspects of
this location aspect with regards to
getting traction now many enterprises
they actually make these off-site
companies where they they hire for that
for these organizations and take them
out of the normal surroundings and and I
participated a couple of weeks ago you
know for one of the big companies here
in in in Denmark and and actually they
have now a separate house of course I
call it silicon house across the street
and and the first sign you see there
when you get in now you're entering into
a process free zone pretty sure the
coffee is better there right no but they
have a lot of Cola I I think that I
actually want a little bit for that
further like especially for the
enterprises I've seen a lot of times
where enterprises they try in in a kind
of a in an attempt to kind of respect
their culture they create a zone
they kind of put it there and
immediately you get this not invented
here ivory tower that those people over
there think they're better than us and
and and it's just really really very
very strong tension and I would only say
to it
as a part of a project and a way to go
forward to something that's more
integrated because it's really really
not not very accommodating for the
culture the fascinating part around
around this organization for
confidential reason I will not mention
the name however the interesting part is
that the ownership structure around this
organization have never bothered one
single minute around digital or IT
solutions for this organization but once
now this house was created you have 10
ish people from the outside sitting
there finish people from the internal
organization both IT digital and
business sitting there all of a sudden
two of the main shareholders wanted to
come and visit them and see what they
were doing so all of a sudden you get
true traction on top level in order to
understand what did you tell a new type
of solutions will do for them so that it
was that actually catalyst for actually
management change in that organization
but I totally agree with you over time
that's also part of a project then right
absolutely a process you say we have a
process step that's about sponsorship
and senior level engagement and creating
a showcase for that it can be super
valuable getting someone to kind of
employ employ them over there and for a
while
works fine and but but year 2 and year 3
it's not so rosy as year 1 I was just
kind of make a note on that I was
working on Microsoft I can't remember
the year but it was the year that Xbox
Live launched and I was an Xbox and to
your point they put us all in a separate
campus because Microsoft you know is
known for servers and all the technology
but was it known for gaming and it also
was a draw for talent right so that's
the other part of it is that creating
that environment of like a startup
separate physically from the larger
location made us all feel like we were
part of a start-up within the company
which was really into
sting and it drew a lot more talent to
it right and then like you said there
was a connection from the sponsorship
level at the top but there was a lot of
freedom to go ahead I think the
challenge and I don't I wasn't there
when it kind of got pulled back in
that's the challenge is how do you take
everything you learned in that group
shipping things really fast doing
virtual experiences that you can do in
gaming and pull that in so that's where
the opportunity is but we've done that
at Starbucks we're trying to do some of
those things at Nordstrom as well we're
lucky at Nordstrom because most of our
team is physically close by but again to
your point do you actually go by the
talent or the city to me it's talent it
always has to be about the talent and so
we're trying to figure out ways to make
it much more effective where people are
in different locations and to your point
I think when you actually start with a
vision and you have a set of guiding
principles around your culture and you
infuse that with the people you hire
that's what you need those culture
cultural advisors and that would be
obviously yourself but then you have a
cute few of those connectors that can
sort of go into that dev room and just
be like okay guys we you know are you
back on our three pieces of our mission
and that's how you kind of invigorate
the culture that's what we try to do at
least okay so let's let's stick around
the startups where it all started so
class maybe you will begin with your
experience I know you haven't done a
start of yourself but you have a lot of
experience in Europe Union if you had a
startup idea how would you go about it I
mean what is the top five things you
would you would make sure to do right
yeah and an order I mean since I'm more
over of a corporate guy and having
facilitate that those start-up ideas in
a large organization and in in that
aspect what I have seen working is
actually to try initially at least to
ring-fence some of those people in order
for them to get in enough space to be
able to flourish because if you don't
give them space and try to get their
idea into the traditional corporate
thinking about return on investment
business cases I mean it's dead before
it's even
left the drawing board so that I think
is ring-fencing is that the number one
aspect the other aspect is also to
actually see does it have a link to your
existing type of services or is it a
free idea that eventually will be a spin
out there is also something to consider
quite early because if there is a strong
linkage to what you're doing today then
you also need to plan how to integrate
it at some point into your existing
services or product and similar and then
I think also you the third aspect use
that as a platform to drive engagement
around the organization a great place to
be getting fantastic talent to be part
of those type of of all events because
that is also an opportunity to promote
people both internally to be part of
those initiatives but also a great
magnet to attract talent from the
outside into what people might actually
perceive to be a little bit of of boring
industries those are our three aspects
from my side
so Michael besides sense of urgency and
and I guess that comes with not having
that you know you don't have too many
resources and you know that you have
competitors out there
so can you name like a handful of other
things you would do if you had to start
a start-up today yeah so I think that
that again I would definitely do a lot
of things exactly the same way I think
it's it's really a matter about about
about you need to get the right people
talented people that can kind of work
more or less by themselves and
understand the vision of the company
quite well I think that again the sense
of urgency I think there's some
something around culture and Europe and
culture and us and it's definitely good
to have that injection from us either
from the west coast from the east coast
and if you don't really have that in the
company you easily get into a mode where
you just want to like build something
and can't get acquired instead of aiming
for something that's a little bit higher
than that so I think that's really
important to really get it that mindset
and and find that drive and ensure that
you aim high all the time so I think
that's really interesting I think also
when you kind of look
the setup for for the enterprise's and
now we like talking starters but still
if you look at the enterprise's and and
why you need to separate these things
out some extent is that you're looking
at completely different organizations so
the one organization might be like have
a huge return of like a huge revenue but
they might only be growing like 3% year
a year and the other they have like a
ridiculously small revenue but they're
growing 3x every year and and this means
that when you're talking revenue growth
in the small company the Laurent's like
current guys you're talking billions
okay what do you do five thousand
dollars what do you mean this is not a
success it's like ridiculous but when
they're doing that they know that next
year it's going to be three times as
much any in like four years it's hundred
times as much so it means that it
suddenly becomes very meaningful to talk
about a contractor five thousand to five
thousand dollars because that might
actually be very big in in a few years
and the big corporate they're like
thinking about huge numbers but small
small growth and I think that's kind of
these cultures you can't really put them
in the same room they need to be split
apart otherwise they would just cash so
I've been a part of a lot of different
startup like experiments in enterprises
and what has been effective is really
you know again figuring out what is the
problem from a customer perspective
we're trying to solve I think a lot of
the things that have failed that I've
been a part of have no connection back
to the actual user so that's one thing
in in the enterprise opportunity I've
been lucky because a lot of these again
have been separated I mean not separated
so far that you aren't connected to the
mothership but separated enough that you
have funding you have sponsorship and
you have the ability to fail so I'm not
going to admit that when we first
launched the Starbucks app we launched a
perfectly you know fine piece of
software it had a lot of kinks issues
and our customers communicated about
what those issues were but we had some
room because we recognized that it was
something new that we'd never done
before and it was because our leader was
actually very technically
savvy and understood that this was a new
market for us to jump into and to your
point about like it starts off really
small a lot of the assumptions and
hypotheses that we had about it in the
beginning completely were wrong right
and so in order for us to fail quickly
we had to test it the challenge we were
testing it in the live world there was
no usability testing it was like ship it
out and everybody is going to basically
tell you with a previews and downloads
and things like that so for me it's
really about the customer value in the
promise and then taking that and and
having the ability to market it and put
it into the hands of the customer and
like the organization being open to the
fact that you're gonna have these herbs
and flows I've certainly had the calls
from the leaders saying hey this is you
know making news this is not the right
approach and then you always have to be
able to say well these are this is our
guiding principles is what we need to go
after but it takes some amount of
tenacity and the ability to have people
around you that will sponsor you through
those challenging moments and I think to
your point which i think is excellent
and that is also about an important
leadership skills in this journey and
that is actually to set the expectations
early on for senior leaders what now
will happen once we release this because
in many if you look larger enterprises
then you have a standard for quality
feedback or or product aspects which in
in a startup environment or when you
launch new stuff in the lean thinking
way then you will not have the same
principles and that is important to
communicate so people are aware of what
we might see when we now launch this I'd
also like to add so completely agree I'd
like to add just a couple of
observations so I've been kind of
following sponsoring doing a kind of
advisory for for experience for for
several startups lately and and this
summer I'm supporting this fin tech
company and I don't two things that I
think is important to bring in the first
one is that this story of what this
product is and what it wants to be in
the world is extremely important to
phrase in a way that everyone around the
people actually are able to talk it and
also share it so I'm currently kind of
directing his little video that we're
having a studio make even though it's
such a small little company so that's
the first one storytelling to get to
figure out what we had what the hell
we're doing and to get people to start
walking in the same direction especially
when they're so few the second one is to
become profitable or to start to make
profits way before you actually think
you're ready so that you start to to to
do this the the MVP is not something
that's far away in the distance you have
to figure out what are ways that we
could actually start to convert just a
little bit because otherwise you spend
all your funding money in a dream and
then the reality just hits you like like
like a hammer so so figuring out what a
ways that we could get profitable and
and and definitely talk about the five
thousand dollars and even five hundred
because you have to celebrate every time
you make money as a start-up no matter
what how little it is yeah and I think
that's really a good point around
profitability not profitability but kind
of making profit and I think that that's
really if you at least if you're in the
b2b segment if you can ensure that your
customers are always paying they never
get a free demo they're always paying
even like it's ridiculous small amount
but they actually had to put in their
credit card or they actually had to do
something there it means that for them
they actually testing your product with
their money and actually want something
back and those who you give it for free
if it's not interesting they're just not
testing it they're just like out there
you're not getting any feedback and the
other one should get feedback even sure
it's a good feedback that's kind of
tells you that that was not the thing
you should do and I think that's
actually very important so always ensure
a good profit
somehow I also learned from from a good
friend and successful entrepreneur that
he said you really need to charge you
your clients as quickly as possible
because in that way when you really need
to charge them bigger money then you are
already through the procurement process
that can take six months or a year so as
long as it just pay a thousand dollars
you know that there is
there's a path made for you okay so so
you Michael and you can add in you if
you dare about investors I mean because
I know you have been very thoughtful
about what kind of investors you could
bring in at different times and also how
much you would expect from these
different kind of investors can you kind
of take us through this business angels
the seed round the ABC you know yeah
what it means to a startup yeah so I
think first of all well unless you now
I'm kind of from this background that
means that typically you don't have
you're not used to save up money and
that means that you need a picture like
business angel in join us
you used to save up money at least for
your kids education you might take some
of that and you start up and so on so
you have that like that opportunity
we're not be that catered that way in
Denmark and I think that's probably
wrong but again so you need money from
business angels that's kind of how you
get ensure that you can still pay your
mortgage and you can still kind of
survive in a reasonable way the first
like year or so or how long I'm gonna
last I think the next next step you're
going into is kind of the seed money and
when you get into the seed money stage
you definitely you want to show that you
have actually built a product ideally
you want to have a revenue because that
could kind of get you further in that
process and then I think until you get
the seed money everything is extremely
much fringe it's just you just really
need to survive for the next day you'll
be like this where you don't get paid
I'll be like all kind of funny scenarios
to get things done as soon as you have
the seed money you need to kind of say
this amount of funds need to gather
somewhere it actually needs to
professionalize everything you need to
ensure your honor really paid and so on
and actually have a health things
professional eyes that way in terms of
investors I think that in in the seed
round the most important thing there is
probably that you find someone that can
kind of help you in the a round as well
kind of help you in terms of follow-on
money that might sometimes be be
interesting as well but also you need
you need to find someone with some
connections and a drive and
also I think what we found in our seed
investor 0.9 they're like you're a
software service company and they're
like extremely tough on the KPIs and
that means that you like have the KPIs
you need to go for this one you kind of
measure yourself all the time and that's
bit extremely helpful I think so that's
really been some of the the kind of
culture we got back from those and now
that we are about to close an AAA round
we more or less loop for for investors
that can that that really have a sense
of what's the pulse of the world who can
kind of bring us like way further ahead
and actually have the right mindset
around the table people who have built
huge billion-dollar companies before
that actually know how this process
works and been there from the very
beginning and I think that's where we
are blamed right now and and I think
that's really a very interesting step
and it's also going to be a lot of more
work of course but that's just how it is
and I think that's really interesting
the next step there so I think that's
really the next part and again you could
go for something else as something else
we could definitely do that as well in
our company you could just find money
anywhere and you wouldn't get kind of
that push in the back you wouldn't be
strapped to a record rocket afterwards
you would kind of just be able to do it
from revenue and grow a little bit
slower and that would be all fine but
again we come from a mission we actually
want to move somewhere and that's why I
want to go there fast
any comments from you regarding
investors had a gardener or at Volvo did
you also act as investors and what did
you think about that I mean no I mean in
the corporate life you have a you have
it a little bit different because you
can actually say you have investors you
have a Vista but but in the corporate
life they provide facilities they
provide salaries and that structure you
talk about you actually get it from them
yeah so you potentially actually need to
treat them in a little bit of a similar
way yeah except for one thing that you
miss out on in the in the enterprise
world and I think that's kind of
important as well and it might be the
reason for the magic and that's the
ownership because none of the people in
in enterprise actually have ownership
like real ownership it's actually to my
product even like 1% or 5% of 50 percent
or whatever it's not really there such a
job and and that's where sometimes the
it becomes more important than the
actual work like that's where you have
like the good containers and so on but
at the end of the day you really want to
motivate people by some kind of
ownership and I think that that's also
where I think that the magic is part of
the startup is like you have ownership
is your baby you kind of want to make it
grow because it's yours and that's
that's really the important side I think
so that's where it gets different in
terms of enterprise and that is also
what what you see in research that many
companies today that really find
something go also out in JV structures
yeah just to get that drive and momentum
that that has also been important in my
professional life but equally what we
see in Gartner that many organizations
when they find that a little bit blurry
section go out find external investors
because then you get two totally
different traction totally yeah I'd also
like so so coming from this from the
lean UX side I'd just like to add one
one thing that basically you need to be
able to speak to the investor in
language that they understand and what I
find really important is to be able to
phrase the problem so instead of only
talking to investors about all the
solutions that you have in this world
which very often happens in in
especially in the tech industry I've had
experiences with saying well let's let's
try to phrase and get really a strong
about the problem and the customer and
then try to sell an infatuation of who
those what those problems the customers
have and if they can if we couldn't
create a premise that there's they are
investing in the solution in solving the
problem rather than the solution that
you came came about I think you have a
more healthy startup like a start with
that response of that yeah and at the
same time you also enable them to invest
in your competitor because they believe
in light the problem now and that's kind
of we've seen that as well so that's
it's a danger but at the same time I
could show it agree that's what you need
to do okay we have five minutes left
thank you all for your participation and
and inside so far do we have any
questions from the audience we have a
question from the app yeah
yes it reads incentive plans powerpoints
and loads of middle management afraid of
losing their stakeholder ticket often
sends innovation workshops to deaf /dev
/ known very common in huge legacy
industries what concrete drastic actions
do you recommend for these places once
more let's repeat the question the
question was incentive plans PowerPoint
and loads of middle management afraid of
losing their stakeholder ticket often
sends innovation workshops to no very
common in huge legacy industries what
concrete drastic actions do you
recommend for these places no but I
think it actually links back to what I
said earlier on when you have industries
which are hugely successful and earning
huge profit in their normal business and
then all of a sudden you actually try to
to convey into something new that will
be your big cash flow and profit
generated for the future that mix is
troublesome absolutely what I've seen
and what what I know that our research
shows is actually organizations that
split it out for example in having both
product organizations that actually move
into taking products into your graphical
depth dimension and then new global
services organization that actually
being measured differently so you
actually get the matrix organization but
still catered in the same organization
but then managed very differently and
there are very good examples of
industries managing and companies
managing like that one fantastic company
who is truly generating a lot of profit
and customer satisfaction on classical
products is a company called as a ploy
and actually in Denmark for example ruko
is one of those brands where they are
handling both very very classical
products and then on a global scale
truly software based products and by
splitting it out like that they are able
to handle both so I think that that is a
few of those examples
at least I also heard that maybe this
was a case of if you have a frustration
in the company where you are now and you
want to work with something and you
don't really think it's done in the
right way then there's always the
opportunity to take it to another place
you know maybe you should make a
start-up about that there is always an
opportunity either you execute or you
would a q8 yeah well I can also say that
something as simple as figuring out how
to get the story to kind of permeate I
remember one we did a we did a workshop
in a super conservative company and and
I had this okay they're not really ready
for us but let's figure out what to do
so we made these big roll-ups and and
and they taped customers expressing
their actual problems and I put it on
repeat and we put it into the goddess
Prada at the the reception next to the
canteen and we just had it run there for
a while and make make some work for us
because we need to we needed to get some
of that customer sensitivity back into
the game to change the arts a little bit
so there are things you can do you just
have to be a little creative about it
yeah okay
final question good we also exactly used
up all our time so thank you all for
coming and thank you for your insights
