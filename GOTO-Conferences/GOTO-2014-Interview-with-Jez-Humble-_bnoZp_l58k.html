today I have the pleasure to interview
the Istanbul the author of continuous
integration and now being enterprise yes
and I'm I know Corey and part of the pc
so I've been acting pardon inviting you
to this conference and I enjoyed your
talk yesterday thank you immensely and
also look forward to reading your book
but I also like to talk about other
conferences so you've started a new
conferences called flow come that's
right so we did it last year kind of
relatively small scale and people seem
to really like it so yeah we're doing it
again co-production between thoughts and
trifle and yeah we've just got off the
call where we've confirmed all the
speakers so we've got some really
fabulous high-profile people coming so
toasty notes include Mary and Tom
Bachmann dick and Marty Kagan who always
never gives talks so we're very lucky to
have him and we have a number of other
great people who come through rcmp as
well so it's a very exciting program I
can't wait I'm really looking for to it
and how come that flow corners now why
not ten years ago or 10 years from now
that's an excellent question i wish i
had done it 10 years ago but
unfortunately still working on the
secrets time travel but it i think what
we've seen in the last few years is just
the ivory emphasis on the fact that in
order to move fast at high quality and
produce great products and services you
need really tight effective
collaboration between everyone involved
in the process and ux developers product
people testers operations and continuous
delivery as part of that but continuous
delivery the capability to release fast
in a low-risk way enables the product
people to actually get much faster
feedback on what's actually valuable
what
is really care about and that is an
amazingly powerful capability that's a
competitive advantage for businesses and
so the conference really is about well
how do you harness this competitive
advantage to be able to get fast
feedback on what your users care about
and what they love and use that to build
really fabulous products and services
and that's very good for for the
managers and the marketing people but is
it also good for the developers well I
mean my experience has been that when
you talk to people who've done this it's
fabulously empowering and exciting the
ability to make a change push it out see
people actually use the code you've
written pretty quickly and then be able
to react to that it's just so exciting
from a development in engineering point
of view whereas you know as opposed to
the kind of old way of doing things
where you write some code and then weeks
or maybe months later it goes into
production you know even I've worked on
projects where the code hasn't gone into
production until after I've be moved to
a different project you know that's
that's miserable so it's instant
gratification yeah this is like when you
want to lose weight if if you eat a cake
it doesn't show on till a few days after
but if you eat a cake and you can
actually measure it right after may be
right yes if your bunny just pop
straight out you can see actually this
is going to be really bad for my beach
holiday maybe you would no not eat the
cake so let's continuous integration
much much like continuous integration
yes like instant cake yes exactly yeah
and I you pointed out some very good
examples from the Google development
yesterday in your talk and then they do
they do it massively yeah well
continuous integration of google and
people worry about whether continued
integration scales and of course the
answer is that continuous integration is
the only process that actually scales
google has more than 10,000 developers
worldwide they have an enormous perforce
repository everybody works of trunk in
that person respond tree they build
everything of trunk everything goes out
from bills that come up trunk people do
not work in longely feature branches and
I think you know that that can be
surprising for people who think that CI
is only the small teams in fact feature
branches don't scale so yeah but what's
the cost because I do consultancy in
and then login in different smaller and
bigger companies and they all want to do
continuous integration automated tests
and stuff like that but they find it so
hard to get started yeah and so how do
you get started with it with an old
company we're here we are the testers
wind developers with the option it's
hard and there's no silver bullet I
think the mistake people make is to say
we're going to do everything in one year
and you know try and change everything
and of course that doesn't work I think
what you have to do is find some one
particular protein service which is high
value and where the people are
enthusiastic about trying out something
new and where they're capable of doing
something new and experiment there and
get something working there and
gradually roll out from the organization
that's the way that I've seen can it can
it be effective but if people are
interested all they're not capable then
you're going to find it tough and then
also if testing is outsourced tour
operations is outsourced that's really
hard as well so you need to focus on
being able to have those people
collaborate very effectively which means
them being in the same place yeah yeah
so one final question in 2017 well you
what we are with continuous integration
I hope I am on my island in Hawaii
because I don't need to be talking about
anymore because everyone's doing it well
then I think we should think thank you
very much Jess I'm glad you could come
Maxim having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
