math for a ad tech company which is
involved in helping like fortune 500
companies by digital media so trying to
think like the best way to describe this
you go to a website there's like this
banner ad slot shows up at the top right
everyone loves those that actually is
determined on and calculated in real
time there's an auction we have like
about 40 milliseconds to decide do we
want to partake in that auction do you
want to actually buy that that
impression and it happens about two and
a half million times the second globally
and so because of that we have to make a
lot of very quick decisions very rapidly
we have to analyze a lot of data so that
like individual impression costs like
maybe a penny or like a hundredth of a
penny or so but the campaigns that these
companies are running or I don't know
like 10 million dollars a year or 50
million dollars a year and typically
they accrue to like I want to sell more
of this product and so backing that goal
of like selling more of this product
into I'm gonna buy this particular slot
because it's like the right time to buy
this ad slot is what we're good at it's
what we do really well so like I
mentioned two and a half million
requests per second about ninety-nine
point nine two percent of that
percentile is under forty milliseconds
we do about a hundred twenty terabytes
of data analysis every single day and
this happens across nine different data
centers plus cloud stuff and we do this
in a lot of a lot of different languages
I think you know Scala might be the one
that we've pushed hardest and invested
hardest on in the most recent history
but we also have plenty of C++ a lot of
go which I'll talk about
talk about in a second Python Ruby Perl
PHP and I know I'm missing more this
slide is only so long so yeah so talks
really about two things specifically how
does go help media math perform and how
do we make go perform so a little bit of
a little bit of both so start with the
first thing a little bit of context in
2012
we had one giant API monolith
so everything we do has API everything
comes with an API we are really big
believers in like the platform vision
and our API stack which you know is that
kind of black box everything below it
used to be one large API and that worked
out really well for some time but we've
been going through about sixty percent
year-over-year growth so when I started
went at Mia's acquired back in December
of 2012 I think we're about 120 people
and we're now about 650 people and along
the way we made six technology
acquisitions and thirteen new product
lines and so I love that there was a
Conway's law talk because I strongly
believe it's like a real thing and so we
needed a way to solve for this from an
organizational perspective to actually
support the rapid growth that we were
undergoing I think I think it was said
yesterday but like I really do believe
like a migration to so is more about an
organizational solution to a technical
problem than like a technical solution
itself so here we are 2015 it's a little
bit less monolith II right so we did a
lot of the decomposition work and we've
moved a lot of things from that monolith
into you know a little bit more of a
service or an Amara model and we've got
a quite a number of micro services today
if you want a primer on that I would
really recommend watching Rebecca
Parsons talk from yesterday I think that
was a really solid introduction in that
and I especially if you heard the guy in
the back cackling about like what you
shouldn't do that was probably me
because we like did all of those things
that you shouldn't do and have been
learning so basically in the process of
solving for those problems we created
like a whole new set of problems right
so I love this guy because he's grumpy
I'm grumpy
so it basically turned our like already
complex system again mentioned nine
datacenters plus cloud plus all this
data already complex system into an even
more complex system
it made the dependencies and the failure
scenario is even more complicated and
even more
tricky to manage and and because of that
you know has created this burden on our
engineers to think about these things on
an you know even more granular basis
than they have before the yet to be
decoupled services again like going
through that transition process you have
to go through the effort of actually
decoupling and decomposing things if
it's not quite there but your teams have
already done this kind of dispersion
managing that codebase across multiple
different teams is a giant pain in the
ass which were I think still kind of
trying to solve service discovery is now
like actually a first-class problem
right so with new services coming out
the new versions coming up and you know
there might be 30 40 50 I think some of
you guys probably familiar with the
Netflix chord chart of like 200 300
different services all talking to each
other without like that being handled in
an automated way you kind of go insane
right I think media math actually couple
Ops people in here who are living some
of that pain right now
managing environments is really painful
so you know we have this belief in
automation that I I want to test my
thing against something that's real
instead of just some shell and so that
means I need my thing and I need your
thing and I need them to live in an
isolated environment so I can test my
thing against your thing without the
automation to prop those two things up
what do you do right you have to manage
this all manually that's kind of a pain
and then it introduces like a whole slew
of distributed systems problems because
you've just created a surface area for a
ton of extra inconsistency so if you
don't really focus on tools automation
might be screwed so my opinion go
actually makes it pretty easy to solve
some of these problems and there's a few
few different reasons for that
so first ones relatively simple it's
easy to create services from scratch now
I know we just said that having more
services kind of create some of these
problems but as it turns out like you
can also create services specifically to
solve these problems and because it's
such a simple language there is a very
low mental footprint the first service
that I wrote and go I think I took it
took me maybe a weekend to both learn
the language and build a proof of
concept like a meaningful one
and I think that's a very common feeling
I feel like there are a couple people
nodding like that's that's something
that I really kind of latched onto early
on it in compiles super quickly to a
static binary so there are two parts of
that that are really important one if
you have ever been spoiled by a you know
interpret language it's really nice to
be able to hit save and like see the
result really quickly you can do that
with go you can add a commit or a hook
right post save hook on your IDE and
have it rebuild the thing because it
takes I don't know a second or two to
build your binary and then you can copy
said binary from your machine to
production if you wanted to or staging
if you wanted to or whatever because
it's just a binary there's no JVM
there's no dependencies or nothing it's
just the static binary it has built-in
concurrency constructs so this is
definitely not unique to the language
there are other languages that have a
lot of us too but you know it has go
routines and has channels go routines
which allow you to run functions
concurrently and channels which allow
you to pass messages between them and
we'll talk a little bit about the magic
in that but that's something that kind
of helps helps make it a little easier
to not worry about the problem of like
how am I going to get these to go
routines or whatever to talk or how am I
gonna get my concurrency to work without
introducing all these you know failure
scenarios instead I can just you know
take advantage of the language construct
to solve that problem for me and then
finally it has an awesome stay in the
library so the awesome standard library
when I say it's awesome it's really
awesome in a lot of cases if you're
trying to build something from scratch
you may not actually need any dependence
any third-party dependencies at all
now just depends on how ambitious you
are but I kind of cherry picked a few
different examples of some of the things
that I use on a regular basis so like
the net package so net HCP and and so on
and so forth it's awesome it's actually
a really good example of idiomatic go
and there's it's I think it's extremely
trivial to create a HTTP server just
excuse me on top of that encoding JSON
right tons of tons of encoding not just
JSON but you know
any other formats that are baked into
that system operating system handling
you know sink and sink atomic all of
your string and byte manipulation
functionality compression functionality
and and the plenty of you know crypto
packages out there are again really easy
to create something from scratch using
just what comes out of the box but if
that's not you know doesn't solve your
problem on its own and you don't want to
be as ambitious there's actually a
relatively vibrant community currently
that has you know spawned a lot of
different libraries and tools and those
are you know around the use cases of
service discovery and container
management and configuration management
consensus and gossip algorithms and
native databases distributing caches and
monitoring tools and I don't know like
20 web frameworks performance testing
that she would take tracing etc like a
lot of those problems that mention early
on about like these are the things these
are the problems that I've now created
by moving to a bunch of micro services
there are tools in go and a community
around solving exactly those things next
thing is actually the tool chain is
great
I could probably end on this slide like
I could just say that this is the best
thing and then we could end and then go
have beer or something
go funked is awesome like i don't know
how to state this i want this in every
single language like go func is the
coolest thing ever
how many of you guys have seen this
commit right obviously I am the most
productive developer in the world and
all I've done here is changed your
spaces for tabs because tabs are
definitely better than spaces and if you
disagree with me you're wrong but what's
cool about this is I never have to have
this argument again ever because the
language specification actually defines
the format and there's a tool to enforce
it right so we never have to talk about
this if you want space as always that's
cool you do that just at the end of your
you know post save hook hit go funked
done problem solved it rewrites your
code you know has it actually line up
with the specification now I don't have
to have this argument ever again it's
just not productive you know next
awesome tool chain tool go test
so it's probably extremely common
everyone in this room if you haven't
said this you should probably start
saying this more often the beginning of
every development project someone goes
okay how are we going to test this thing
go comes with a framework baked in to
solve that problem and it comes with you
know unit tests and it comes with
performing tests so here's a code
example that is definitely almost
falling off the page
so it's really kind of stupid and basic
so kind of bear with me I have three
functions one plus one equals three
awesome two plus two equals four all
right that one's cool and then you know
add some mints together over here I have
my test so one plus one actually should
be too
cool and then four plus three plus two
plus one should be ten awesome so I'm
gonna run my baked in Tess and I get you
know with with with a coverage profile
so obviously one plus one should
actually be two so that's my failure
message and I missed that second
function two plus two I didn't do that
so coverage missed the coverage and then
if I actually go to the go tool that
helps me you know dump an HTML file that
shows me these things it will show me
the code path colored that's not covered
that's kind of if T next awesome tool
chain is the race detector so mention
some of those concurrency constructs
those are really nifty but if you're not
careful you can actually create
deadlocks and race conditions and the
race flag is available in go test go
build go run and it will just cause a
panic when it detects that there's a
race condition do this please in your
code if you use these things it's really
important to do this and then finally go
vet go vet is it's interesting because
it's like a heuristic that helps show it
tells you when you may have used
something wrong right so if you have
like a JSON tag and you you know use it
incorrectly or if you have printf and
you have mismatched placeholders like it
will tell you those things that the
compiler won't already catch and
actually the compiler catches so many
things that you know this is just kind
of a nice nice add-on so I don't know
like for me where this kind of all boils
down to is it just feels really
productive right the language gets out
of the way and for me maybe I mean it's
just a personal thing I know there are
people from media math at this room that
would in this room which would disagree
with this and that's totally cool but I
like the constraints I don't mind
constraints the constraints plus the
tools make me feel more productive and
it lets me focus on the thing that I
actually care the most about which is
shipping a good product and we have
right so in 2013 we had no-go things and
in 2015 we have like infinitely more go
things so if you wanted to draw this
line out it would have looked a lot like
a hockey stick and if there are any VC
in the room I'm definitely taking checks
because traction so how fast is go
actually this is like my favorite part
of the sock because I'm gonna try to
piss everybody off in the room equally I
have cherry-picked in the next four
slides a bunch of benchmarks that show
how go is faster than your favorite
language actually some of our favorite
languages doesn't really prove anything
other than I can google things so yeah
all right so go versus C++ it's like
about as fast I think you know some here
bolded faster than C++ that's cool the
rest I think it's like order of
magnitude the same yeah awesome all
right
oh cool
Ruby yeah we love Ruby we're huge huge
users of Ruby just destroys Ruby I mean
take a look at that 16 versus $7.99 man
I don't even know what those numbers are
but it's a lot different
go vs. purl so so we actually we really
love pearl like we love pearls so much
we go to Pearl conferences we give pearl
talks we're actually going to Yap sea
this year to talk about how we're moving
from Pearl to go so that may be a little
weird but also like substantially faster
okay so I'm at a Java conference so I
have to talk about Java or at least
there feels like there's a lot of Java
here I really hope that like guilty and
anyone from Oracle is not in the room
because don't call me on this but if you
can see go is also order of magnitude as
fast or slightly faster than Java
awesome
and node yeah node this is my favorite
meeting this benchmark because it is a
clear and obvious representation of real
work that's done in node which is
otherwise known it's bubble sort so yeah
just as a side note Ryan doll who built
node and TJ Holloway Chuck who built
everything else in node both switch to
go so saying but seriously though go is
actually pretty fast as I mentioned we
have like a 21 23 ish services in it
here are a few that I kind of cherry
picked for this talk DCs is the dynamic
creative service it's like this thing
that that takes add requests and
automatically generates the creative
together and we've you know landed on 95
percent latency under 10 milliseconds on
two boxes per datacenter handling live
bitter traffic
this is relief really good because it's
cheap to run rollerskates is this it's
like a one tiny VM per pop that's
handling all production impression
metrics on five dimensions rolled up in
three different time buckets I guess
super cheap off go handles all of the
traffic for this thing it's the
authorization service one millisecond 95
percentile two boxes per pop
just trivial Plex is actually a it's a
it's a multiplexer web request
multiplexer currently doing a little
over a hundred thousand requests in
bounds per node and it's almost
completely kernel bound all with
extremely little effort none of these
projects took I think like the base took
a week two weeks to build I think the
reason this matters both from a
Productivity perspective and a
performance perspective is that any
response in your distribute system
across your micro-services that's
cobbled together from multiple different
services it's only as fast as your
slowest link right so here's the request
it took 112 milliseconds 94 milliseconds
of that was spent in this one function
you got to make sure that your critical
path is fast right if it's not whole
thing to be slow and this is common
right by the way this tool is called
Zipkin if you're not familiar with it
it's Twitter's distribute tracing
framework if you want to get it crap now
I'm forgetting the name of the tool
anyway it's possible to get your go data
into Zipkin as well all right so we've
talked a lot about how go is the fastest
thing on earth how do we get it there
pretty simple well so the first one is
go tests and testing B so I talked about
how go test has you know performance
testing testing B is that thing it does
loop based iterative performance tests
and it's baked into go tests so you can
actually run these performance tests as
part of your test suite as part of your
pre-commit lifecycle as part of
integration tests as part of whatever
stage of testing that you want to
introduce it in here's an example of me
running this function of a nachi
function b and x which is part of the
testing B and it took five hundred nano
SEC's prop cool next awesome tool also
part of the tool chain P prop so thank
you google for this P prop is the
sampling profiler comes with
visualization which you're seeing right
now and also a fair amount of
command-line tools I
actually spend more time than committing
tools and I haven't that's pretty graph
also useful though it tells you
basically how much time is being spent
in what part of your code it can also
tell you where you're allocating which
is important for garbage collection and
it's just generally very useful for
understanding what your code is actually
doing right so use this if you want to
understand where your hot code paths are
or where you're spending most your time
user time and that way you have to guess
less that's cool go is a garbage
collected language it's young right it's
not as not as old as Java has a lot to
learn from Java and from the JVM in that
sense but it's still garbage collected
in the garbage collection isn't quite
great yet so avoid creating garbage if
you don't want to deal with garbage
collection definitely do this after your
code is written right don't do it early
otherwise premature optimization that
sort of thing but the previous slide
p-per off it will tell you those
allocations it will tell you where the
GC is coming from you can definitely use
it to tune away some of the unnecessary
allocations if there are some the other
great thing is that go has a 6-month
release cycle and they spend a lot of
time focusing on performance and
toolchain and garbage collection
I believe 1.5 is going to introduce
concurrent collections so like the
really heavy stop the world collection
will be I think a little bit less
impactful we yet to actually see that
played out but you know hopefully it's
it's there okay go next procs so we
talked a little about go routines and
channels and how there are concurrency
primitives baked in the language but
what about parallelism go max procs is a
setting that basically lets you tune the
number of operating system threads your
code runs on so initially you go oh cool
set that to 18 8 or 16 or 32 or how many
you know physical CPUs your box size of
cores your box house but in many cases
all that does is increases contention
test before you set don't just run blind
thing that I randomly ran into did the
other day was setting go max procs to
one doesn't actually stop the operating
system from running across multiple
cores that makes sense but I was a
little confused while I was paging
everything randomly it's possible okay
next thing channel is like magic so I
think I've talked a little about
channels go routines have actually
showed you guys example of this so this
is an example of both this is my main
function it's a really dumb dumb
function so echo is echo is a function
that basically takes a channel listens
on the channel whenever it receives a
string on the channel echoes the channel
or the string so over here I'm creating
that as a go routine which is a fake
effectively saying run this function
concurrently and then I'm sending on the
channel these messages so these messages
are just strings
hence the Chan string it's the type of
the channel and so I'm sending it
waiting a second sending it waiting a
second this is all it is it's an awesome
construct it's really handy but
unfortunately it's not actually magic
there's still a mutex lock so just
consider that every time you use it
again if you tuned up go max procs
you're just in some cases you might not
even realize that you're increasing
contention because more things will be
contending on that lock yeah all right
so empty interfaces so empty interfaces
are interfaces without methods which is
kind of another way of saying match
against all types any sure if your
function argument specifies an empty
interface then it will accept any type
and that's at the expense of performance
right so here's an example of some
everything of any type here's an example
of some just intz and because runtime
type type checking is slow you get this
ridiculous difference here I don't know
it was like 60 times it slow again don't
worry about this until after your codes
done yeah defer super super convenient
so this is a keyword that effectively
lets you say I'm going to close these
file buffers or allocators or you know
channels or whatever when I'm done with
the function I don't have to worry about
doing it manually you know if I didn't
do this I have to put it in all these of
different places where you know error
handling is done here and maybe at the
end of the function and so on and so
forth I don't have to do that now I can
just do it when all right rather I can
let go decide one to do it based on the
unwinding of the stack of course this is
also slow because now what I'm doing is
I'm telling go to keep track of another
thing to unwind as part of the stack so
you know I think this is telling but
maybe in the case of your application
this might be more telling eighteen
megabytes per second versus six
megabytes per second of throughput again
just depends on what you're doing and
then finally GCC go
so go is not only an implementation of
language there's also a specification of
language so they have targeted the
compilation of the language also against
GCC so you can build go code with GCC
and this is good because it gets used
you know support for some of those more
powerful optimizations you know oh three
and whatever you get out of GCC could be
good for CPU bound workloads you might
want to use this we tried it we didn't
get a lot out of it and we actually also
wasted a fair amount of time trying to
figure out why so I don't know might be
good for you I wouldn't run there I
would start with the code but if you're
you know wondering if can I get just
that last 1% or 2% it might be worth
trying okay so I'd be remiss to talk
about this without actually talking
about some of the things we don't like
about go
I personally am okay with some of these
things but I know that us like media
math as a whole some of us struggle with
these things and that's totally cool I
think you know no language
perfect obviously so the first first
thing that I think rubs a lot of people
the wrong way is it's extremely
opinionated I think the quote that I've
read a million times over is like it
seems to like ignore completely the last
20 years of computer science okay cool I
get it I understand and specifically the
the to really the one that comes up is
the limited type system which is I think
just another way of saying no generics
so that's kind of a pain yeah we'll just
leave there also doesn't have exceptions
so the way that you're the idiomatic way
of handling errors is effectively
multiple return statements so your
return will have like the first or the
second whatever the first few arguments
will be what you actually expect the
last one will be the error case you can
do that and go it's very common and you
have panic too but I think a lot of
people probably prefer exception
handling and catching and throwing and
so on and so forth
third thing I think that gets people a
lot is this notion of idiomatic go it's
basically the idea that all go code
should be like articulate yet concise
provide precise comments have a simple
API and be readable I know like none of
that is controversial in any way and the
standard library is actually a great
source of truth for what is idiomatic go
but the problem with this notion that I
have is it's very subjective and so
because it's so easy for people to grasp
the language and like just go running
with it it has created some extremely
interesting pull requests conversation
in our company where you have like 50
comments of you know existential
arguments over whether this is the right
way to do things or what's idiomatic or
what did the go developers really mean
when they said that and yeah I I
struggle with that one because I
completely understand why
you would want to do it and I also don't
know a nest way to lead a new go
developer to the answer other than lead
and practice and look at the ghost
source it's not you know super fancy
dependency management so go being
developed primarily at Google those guys
have their own massive dependency
management solution and have almost
deferred dependency management to the
community I think I've read maybe four
or five comments by Andrew Girard and
Rob Pike and Khoa basically saying like
that's a community problem you guys can
solve it for yourself but what that
really means is like the import
statements I think you guys may have
seen in some of the comments or some of
the code examples earlier there you have
no way of saying a package is pinned to
this particular commit and that's a pain
because you know in order to pin it to a
/ - a commit you have to ensure that
you're have that commit in your local go
path which is just another way of saying
ven during is the best way to do things
and if that feels like we've gone back
to 90s it probably is because we've gone
back to 90s so I think a very very no
issue and then finally garbage
collection yeah it is what it is right
so if you need more granular control
over your performance over your latency
maybe don't use go I don't know I don't
need access to machine primitives we do
all this at an incredible scale and we
you know still seem to be doing okay by
just using the mechanisms and methods
that I've mentioned before but just
something to be aware of again java's a
GC language as well so I think we
probably all feel this pain in some some
way or another I think that's it for me
I'd love to take questions hope this is
helpful
