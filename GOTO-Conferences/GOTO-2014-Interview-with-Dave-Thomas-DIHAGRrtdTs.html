talk Dave Thomas with Ruby elixir Dave
Thomas and I believe it or not this is
only the second chance we've actually
been to Bennett the same conference
together so the last time was was it
2002 something like that some my old
oopsla conference yeah back that's right
so so Dave just finished a great talk on
elixir and refreshingly it didn't do
Fibonacci or how to use tax or you know
some trivial thing did a nice nice
little example and gave a great feeling
of elixir so God some so it's quite
something to transition over from from
ruby and well see I've been doing oo
programming since 1980 something maybe
even before that action and recently the
last 15 years be primarily ruby and
that's still after a while I mean ruby
is nice it keeps surprising me it keeps
giving me new things but at the same
time it's the same language everything
and clearly the world is changing around
us so clearly the world is becoming
functionals becoming concurrent and I
just couldn't find a language that I
felt comfortable with basically teaching
myself and possibly teaching other
people the kind of basics that would get
me out of that rut I keep kept trying
function languages and I kept ending up
writing 00 code and functional languages
you know so it licks it gives me that it
lets me break away so what I'm trying to
do is retrain my brain to think in this
kind of world of micro processes and
functional and immutable data and trying
to learn how to do that to try to
rebuild the reflexes that are kind of
like second nature now in the other
world oh nice thing is early i'm such a
fantastic base because you basically
everything quickly becomes concurrent
and so you you don't actually build up
anything large you write it what do you
mean there's another process running
here that actually is one of the
attractions because when you do a JVM
based functional language there's always
that escape route you know and so it's
very easy to fall back on always whereas
here you're basically here you're out
there and so you have the same kind of
design
to use horribly overused word that you'd
have inner line and that's I really
enjoy that now so I think it's really
interesting so wanted some of the things
about elixir for those from the airline
community is it does it make some
extensions like macros which are you
know some people say hygienic macros is
though that makes them clean other or
purist go macros don't have a sound
semantics so there's some issues there
but they give you a lot of flexibility
in it yeah and I think some of the
people that decry elixir capabilities
like macros are the people that have
spent the last 20 years learning how to
do without them in a way I mean if you
look at like an airline Jen server if
you read the documentation how to do it
the first thing is Oh take this hundred
lines of code and cut and paste it into
your empty file and now fill in the
details and people are kinda like proud
that they've been through the walls
there that they've done all that stuff
and you don't have to do that when
you've got macros and particularly the
way elixir does macros it gives you a
lot of control so it's not the Wild West
it's not like meta programming and say
Ruby where you're changing the core you
know which I don't particularly
objective and all that people do but in
a lick sir I've had totaled scoop
control so for example if I want to I
can say on this particular function call
I want to apply a change in the
semantics for just these parameters and
then take it away again so I have a lot
of control over how my macros work and
therefore I don't really worry about you
know the hide uniqueness or not of those
members what about the you know airline
single assignment and look sir oh is
that that's a big thing okay so a long
single assignment basically says that
you're not signing to a variable what
you're doing is you're binding a
variable to a value a bit like you do
when you're driving a mathematical
expression so if you say AE equals one
you're not really saying a sign 128 in
algebra what you're just saying is that
a and one have the same value and so our
line takes that approach and enforces it
it looks but then if you look at our
line code you'll find that
you cannot you take data structures then
if you want to add say three things to a
dictionary you're going to say you know
create a new dictionary store that in
depth then you're going to add some into
its ship to store the results in depth
one and then get to then dick three so
you have all these variables with
numbers at the end of them to show
somehow a generational thing in a lick
sir she says just basically said let's
get rid of that we're going to allow you
to reassign a variable so I'm going to
say dict equals this tickle served it
yourself now underneath the covers it's
still running on your language machine
and you're under pressure machine only
supports single assignment so he's doing
all that automatic renaming for us so it
still has all the same semantics that
you get with around but without all the
inconvenience of all using our crazy
intermediate variables that people have
to create people who object to it I
think probably missed the point of
variables in that the variable is not
the data the variable is just a binding
to that data the data is still immutable
whether we're in Erlang or they're an
elixir it's just we can change the
binding to it and that's no different to
making a function call so I don't I
don't see how people can object to it so
one last question since we have a
limited time when's the new release of
the language coming out and the book who
knows it's both so this has been a trial
by fire for me because I said I really
like to lick sir and just I said you
don't want to write a book about it now
this was a year ago because I'm just
ripping it and revving and revving it so
i said no i really want to show people
is so i have been rewriting the book
basically at every point release as the
syntax is changed mercifully all the big
changes are behind us right now we're
doing some library tidying some release
management so I'm expecting to see a
elixir 10 please sometimes was the end
of the summer great which probably means
December but sometime round about that
and the book will be out the same day as
far as I'm concerned because I just want
to get a little done right let's great
break great to have you here thanks a
lot for your great talk look forward to
seeing it
good to see you again okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
