knew about software development
all the way back from the 1950s and 60s
and why is it that we never paid
attention to all the data that we had
for example when was the IBM 360 project
in the 1960s Fred Brooks led it he wrote
a book called the mythical man-month
and in there he said he articulated
Brooks law Brooks saw I said you add
more people to a late project and it
gets later and basically the fundamental
dynamic is as project size gets bigger
the productivity per developer goes down
the other thing we have lots of data on
now is that as you as projects become
late and you put people under pressure
and they start to work more hours then
they start to build in more defects they
lose creativity and all of a sudden it
costs more it's slower they work more
hours than they actually slow down by
working more hours you can actually
measure that happening
so clearly software is a hard problem it
doesn't scale the way we've thought
about it what are some of the other hard
problems there's a law called Zips law
that says software is unpredictable
because the surveys show that over half
some people say more than 80% today of
requirements change while you're
developing the software but
traditionally we have this idea that we
have to build this big plan up front
before we start right to get get the
customer to buy the project we have to
have the big plan and the money and the
time and then they pay but then 80% of
that plan changes so 80% of the cost of
developing the plan was complete waste
and even worse in order to avoid scope
creep from changes we set up change
control boards that try to prevent the
change and then we deliver the project
at the end with the original
requirements and the customer says
that's not what we wanted and this is
causing companies to go out of business
big companies for example I worked with
BellSouth in Atlanta and they had they
were the biggest part of AT&amp;amp;T when it
broke up they had some of the best
engineers out of Bell Labs they could
deliver a perfect project every time on
budget on features on time
their projects were usually about two
years ten to 20 million dollar projects
and when they invited me down to Italy
and I said well why you're talking to me
you can deliver a perfect waterfall
project every time they said the
customers are saying we don't want what
you delivered and when we say that you
suck when you sign up on that for that
two years ago here's your signature on
the specification the customers saying
well our business requirements changed
well we didn't really know what we
wanted and they said it used to not be
so much of a problem but now some of the
customers are refusing to pay and I said
how often do you have this problem they
said they said a hundred percent of the
time I said what you deliver a perfect
project a hundred percent of the time
and a hundred percent of the time the
customers don't like it and many of them
are refusing to pay I said you're gonna
have you're gonna go out of business if
you know if you don't stop doing that
has anybody tried to Google BellSouth
lately it only took them about a year to
disappear it's too late when that
problem is happening a half percent of
the time game over now when we discuss
this problem with process experts back
in the early days when we were thinking
about scrum we talked we were told the
leading process experts in the world
we're at DuPont chemical corporations
and they were hired by DuPont to stop
the chemical plants from exploding after
Bhopal so Ken shui ver my partner went
down and talked with them and they said
well you know what we found when we came
into the chemical industry we found they
had two times the proper to types of
processes they had what we call
predictive processes you could run them
like an assembly line you every step of
the way you knew what was going to
happen very little deviation and for
that you want a predictive control
system
but there are other problems in a
chemical plant where you put chemicals
in a vat the vat bubbles and boils and
if you don't watch that VAT the whole
chemical plant could blow up so you need
a different control system they said an
empirical control system in every case
of an exploding chemical plant they
found that somebody applied a predictive
control system to an empirical process
now they asked us what is the waterfall
traditional project management what kind
of control system is that it's a
predictive control system what kind of
processes software development was 65%
of the requirements change it's an
empirical process therefore projects
explode
how many explode if it's over 80 if it's
over 2 million euro the number is 82% a
project's explode half of those are
complete failures 40% or so the other
40% are over budget
like the CIO of o2 in Germany asked me
recently he said you know my problem is
I just finished another 100 million euro
project
it cost me 270 million euro and it was
two weeks late can scrum fix that two
years late I'm sorry two years late and
the answer is scrum is designed to fix
that what are these some of the other
fundamentals of laws of software there's
a law called Humphries laws anybody
heard of Humphries law it says the user
never knows what they want until they
see working software
so the only way to find out what they
want is actually produce some working
software give it to them and see if they
like it and then they're not going to
like it and then you then you keep on
fixing it until they do like it so all
of this we knew even back in the late
1950s some of the biggest IBM projects
in the late 50s were done with iterative
development so I came out of a
background that wasn't software I was a
fighter pilot for 11 years and I flew
100 missions over North Vietnam and the
interesting thing about North Vietnam it
was the most heavily defended airspace
in the history of aerial warfare so as
soon as you cross the border you were
being shot at by it with everything in I
aircrafts and missiles you name it
whatever they had they were shooting it
at you and it was all the latest
equipment from the Russians and the
Chinese they were testing out everything
and so half the people I flew with got
shot down so my strategy was as soon as
I cross the border I went into an
evasive maneuver because a lot of the a
lot of what they were shooting at you
you couldn't see in the daytime at
nighttime you could see the tracers but
in the daytime you couldn't see it so
you had to assume that if you weren't
evading you were got it a bullet was
going to hit you and during that evasive
maneuver I would wind up over the target
at the right time I was in
reconnaissance so I had to take a
picture of a target and a lot of the
guys didn't do that evasive Ness and
there they're still dead and buried in
North Vietnam someplace ok so I came
back and I and years after was asked to
come into a big Bank to help with
software projects because I was an
expert in certain technologies that I I
spent 11 years in the medical school as
a medical professor and to do the
mathematical modeling the kind of
supercomputer mathematically we were
doing of the human cell we were using
technologies that were very interesting
to big banks
so they asked me to come take a look at
at the bank and the particular bank was
running a hundred fifty banks all over
North America so big operation they said
come on in you know at the medical
school you guys have all the knowledge
and no money but over the bank we have
all the money but we don't know what
we're doing so the perfect perfect
marriage and and that then they made an
offer that my wife couldn't refuse and I
wound up at the bank so here I am a
fighter pilot and medicals professor and
I look at what these guys are doing
hundreds of COBOL programmers were
building banking software just like in
Zurich anybody in the banks in here yeah
you got that do you have cold will still
have COBOL programmers yeah I noticed
their project we're always we're always
late are your projects late too well
ours were always late and when they were
late the management would get really
upset because sometimes they would be
fired privately and they would put
pressure on the developers they make
them work late they make them art nights
make the work weekends they'd send them
on death marches I heard today that you
can actually do that at Zurich they said
they sent people on death marches in
Zurich here maybe not your bank but
there's some banks here where they're
doing this but no matter how much
pressure they put on the developers they
were always later not earlier now I look
at that coming from the medical school
background and looking at project
development as a system and I realized
it was in a this lateness and this
pressure was a stable state of a system
and everything that management was doing
was keeping it stuck in this very
unpleasant stable state and so I thought
about that and I said you know what we
really want is a state where projects
are always early developers always
having fun managers always getting there
bonuses customers are always excited
about the product and happy so what
would it put take to take that system
and move it to that state and could you
create a stable state where that was
true well the first thing we had to do
is we had really good data out of Bell
Labs and it showed that hundreds of
companies every dot is a company and it
showed that productivity depended on
communications the communication
interactions on the team was the driver
productivity and Bell Labs it came up
come up with a measurement called
communication saturation they could
actually measure that the communication
and the team and if that was at a
hundred percent
everybody knew everything they needed to
know all the time but they saw that
actually looked more like this most of
the companies were in this range where
communication was saturation was twenty
percent and they saw that was because
you know this is about they saw that the
number of specialized roles in the
organization was what determined
communication saturation the curve
looked like this so around 30 27 to 30
roles was kind of the sweet spot for
most of the companies and that was 20
percent and in this point if you look at
for example Microsoft Windows they were
getting two function points per
developer month or about a thousand
lines of C++ code per year per developer
but they had a data point over here
we're actually up here it was about 80
to 90 percent was the highest data point
and they were getting a hundred and four
function points per developer month or
about a thousand lines of C++ code per
week per developer so eight people on
this team were worth four hundred people
at Microsoft now because of that Mike
Bell Labs completely eliminated titles
on the team they said everybody is going
to be a member of technical staff so
when I was hired into a company to build
tools for big customers and the tools
were building object-oriented systems
and they needed a process to go with
them the first thing I said is we got to
do exactly what Bell Labs did we got to
get rid of all titles so I said to all
the developers take all your business
cards and throw them in the wastebasket
we're only gonna have members of
technical staff and then they said well
what are we going to put on our resume
now we're going to get another job
what are we going to talk to the
customers about so I said make up
whatever business card you want as long
as the team agrees that it reflects what
you're doing and you can put it on your
resume and show it to the customers just
don't bring it to work and they could
they found they could have much more
creative titles than human resources
that come come up with so it actually
played to their benefit they could get
better jobs with their better titles
I've been fortunate that I've always
been hired in as as a CTO vice president
of engineering whatever so if management
hires that me yet I say this is the way
it's going to be and it if it's not that
way fire me because I'm not um I know
what the data is at Bell Labs and and
we're not going to have this Ness
that you have in your other teams
otherwise I'm leaving I'm out of here in
this particular setting and the first
scrum team the CEO asked me to come in
to launch a new technology and he said
Jeff we have we have 10 people that
could be VP engineering so but we we
don't have anybody that can actually we
need a new product set for this whole
company and it needs to be done in six
months we just bought a new compiler
company that has the underpinnings the
the base tooling but a whole new set of
products need to be built on top of that
we need a unit we'd like you to come in
and take our best people and deliver
that product the company will do
whatever it was like I was a chief
engineer at Toyota or something the
company will do whatever it takes to
make that happen so I had complete free
rein now I have to say in a later
company where I had about 600 developers
I would in and I said we're all going to
scrum and I got all the managers
together it was a group at least as big
as this and I said we're all going to
scrum so the first thing we need to do
is take all our business cards and throw
them in the wastebasket
now all you managers now forget about
that it's over we're going to have teams
and we're going to have team leaders
you're going to be on a team and you're
going to be a team leader I want we're
going to spend a whole day on this and
we're going to figure out what are the
teams in this company which team are you
on and which team you leading by the end
of the day we had that structure and we
started
two weeks later the most senior guy a
vice president who thought he should
have had my job okay to me and he said
Jeff he was he had he owned our biggest
site in Boston hundreds of developers
came to me said Jeff you know back three
weeks ago when I was a manager I had
time to do all this budgeting and
performance appraisals and paperwork but
now that I'm a leader of all these teams
I had to spend all my time out there in
front of the people you know setting the
vision and guiding the way you know
getting them on board I have no time for
all this paperwork anymore and I said
well who was leading the people back
when you were a manager and he said I
don't know I guess nobody likes it well
thank God you finally have a leader okay
so that was the difference managers
become leaders in a scrum company so now
that we had no roles we went to work and
we started in addition to building the
product we started to review the entire
literature on project management
productivity hundreds of the papers I
knew we were going to have at least a
thousand documents that we had carefully
studied before we could take it to the
next level on about the 300 paper we met
reread a paper by two Japanese Harvard
Business School professors and they had
looked the best project teams in the
world that companies like Honda Fuji
Xerox 3m not software all building
products consumer products cars and they
noticed that the best teams in the world
all looked to them like rugby teams and
particularly the scrum formation in
rugby and they described how it worked
they were all doing everything all
together a little bit of requirements
and testing documentation and
implementation and the goal would be
let's get a new prototype of a car that
works in ninety days because everybody
has to do every
and they called that style of project
management they said scrum now our team
wanted a formal model you know that was
based on best management theory to build
what we were building and we looked at
that we said that is exactly it and so
the whole team said ok we're gonna form
as a scrum team they said okay what
would we call the team leader and the
team decided we'll call the scrum master
so now we had a team and a scrum master
what's that
yes you know it was basically I was
guiding this whole thing I was as the
chief engineer I had the final decision
on everything but I involved the team
and everything so it was a collaborative
effort so now we have the team and we
had a scrum master and we went to work
we knew we wanted to do things in short
cycles the first cycle which we began to
call sprints that's again that that's
team came up with that idea was a month
long we knew it had to be a month or
less and so we started spinning and at
the end of the first month we had a demo
we knew we we implemented a process or a
practice out of the MIT Media Lab
because I had run a company on the MIT
campus and hired many people out of the
Media Lab and they had a practice called
demo or die every three weeks you had to
demo really cool stuff or they killed
your project so I said we need that here
I know how it works these guys are
really good it will help us a lot so at
the end of the first month we had a demo
and it crashed
now we fixed it and we actually then
deployed it to consultants because even
the first month the tooling did a lot of
coal generation that was helpful to our
consulting practice and so they were
more than interested in actually testing
it out and world real project so I said
to the team you know we need practice
demos so let's do a demo every Friday
I'll invite some of my engineering
friends from companies in the area some
experts and you know development coding
testing they'll come in and we'll have a
lunch Friday you know brown bag lunch
and you could do a devil for them just
to practice so the first Friday they did
the demo and it crashed again and they
were so embarrassed I knew if they did
this in front of their peers and they
had bugs that it would be so embarrassed
that that would never happen again so
the next Friday sure enough they come in
it works perfectly but then the guys
from the other companies look at what
they've built and they've said haven't
you looked at how Microsoft does that or
how Borland does that the way you
implement that it really looks bad in
fact it sucks and at the end of that
demo when our our engineer friends left
they all put their heads on the table
and they said we don't know if we can do
any more demos it's too hard and too
painful and I said to them you know you
can be just another development team
always being late always having software
that's not good enough always never
having enough software always under
pressure or you could be a great team
but to be a great team you're gonna have
to hear the feedback from the great
people that build good product so which
is it
and they thought for a bit they said
we'll do one more demo good thing they
decided that now in the meantime we had
read this paper and we realized in this
this was the second month February 1994
we read this paper and we realized that
this Borland team the reason it was so
fast and the reason communication
saturation was so high was because of a
daily meeting and we said we really need
to have a daily meeting to get really
high performance and so in the second
sprint we implemented a daily meeting
you know we already had you know the
daily meeting we implemented we already
had a sprint review and the first sprint
review included a retrospective wasn't a
separate meeting yet we already had a
sprint planning meeting to plan for the
sprint but we introduced this daily
meeting and at Borland it was usually at
least an hour and we didn't like that we
thought it took too much time we kept on
getting it shorter and shorter until we
had it where it is today 15 minutes and
we knew the information that needed to
be shared to produce performance we kind
of got that working by the end of the
second sprint pretty good demo at the
end of the second spread we started into
the third sprint we planned a normal
months of work and we were done in a
week and everybody said what happened
and it was all driven by this daily
meeting and what happened in the daily
meetings is that people would say I want
to work on this task and the team would
say oh wait a minute you know for the
team to go fast you need to work on
something else that's gonna slow you
down that's gonna slow the team down
might be good for you but
it's not for the team and so the
developer would say well okay I'll work
with this and try to get this story done
it'll help the team get done faster and
then the chief would say well how are
you going to do it and the developer
would explain how he's going to do it
and one of the teammates would say well
I've already implemented a lot of that
the code I'm working on let's pair after
this meeting and instead of taking two
days we'll get it done in an hour so all
these two day tasks were collapsing into
an hour's work and we're done in a week
we had gone hyper productive will at 400
percent of the previous month now as
soon as that happened I knew we had four
months to deliver we're week into the
fourth month now instead of having you
know a little over three months of work
left I knew we could do the same amount
of work in a week I had 12 13 14 weeks I
had 14 equivalent Sprint's left of
features that I could ship and I said we
need to get somebody out of product
marketing and get him out in the market
really fast to figure out what's the
competition doing what are the customers
want how are we going to add order that
feature list because I don't have enough
time to be out there at least half my
time and the other half of my time to be
explaining to you guys exactly what the
customers are saying so I went to the I
went to product marketing I said to the
VP of Marketing I need your best guy I
know who he is Don Roeder given to me I
want him to be what is now known as the
product order for scrum he is going to
own the backlog and I said Don you have
the business plan for this product I
want to know how much revenue it's going
to generate I want you to know what
features are going to generate that
revenue when it hits the market I want a
computer world PC week all the IT
magazines to say this is the best
product they've ever
in this market space and Don proceeded
to do that and he was successful so we
then had the three roles that we have in
scrum today and we had the three
meetings that are part of scrum today
now this is actually split into two
meetings it's also really important in
scrum today to do some product grooving
getting the product backlog ready before
you go into sprint planning at the same
time we were doing all this we went
after the reporting mm-hmm because at
the beginning of this project I talked
to the CEO of the company and I said you
expect a new product set at six months
and I bet you expect a plan for me right
now he said yes I do and I said I bet
you expect to expect a Gantt chart he
said yes I said how many Gantt charts
have you seen that have been correct and
he said in 25 years of software
development I've never seen a Gantt
chart that's correct and I said well I'd
be really stupid to give you another
wrong Gantt chart wouldn't I and he said
well what are you going to give me and I
said how about if I give you working
software at the end of every sprint
you'll be able to sit down and use the
product try it out and you can validate
for yourself every step of the way how
far we are and he said well that would
certainly be better than a wrong Gantt
chart and I said well in return for that
I need you not to bother the team during
the spread and he was a guy that liked
to run in and mess with the team and he
looked unhappy with that hmm and I said
you know if you do that we'll never beat
this six-month target but I said at the
end of every month when you look at that
software you can change everything if
you want at Sprint boundaries
and he thought about that for a minute
he said okay let's do that so off we
went on implementing scrum so I was
giving him working software but to get
that working software I had a product
backlog that was owned by the product
owner at the sprint planning meeting we
would break out a sprint backlog and
then I needed a measure so these were
our artifacts I needed a measure of how
well the sprint was working now because
of my fighter pilot background I noticed
that on these big projects that I'd work
with people had a lot of trouble landing
on a landing a project on target that
would always overshoot and it reminded
me of training new fighter pilots they
come around trying to land that fighter
aircraft and all of a sudden they'd be
high on the glide path and all they'd be
why to land the plane halfway down the
runway and if it was wet or icy you
could slide right off the end of the
runway and if that happened to be twice
in an f4 fortunately I had a tail look
and I caught a chain at the end of the
runway both times otherwise I would have
been into the water into the trees into
the buildings it's always bad at the end
of the runway so I thought about okay
what do you need to land an airplane
well you need to know is here speed you
need to know it's altitude you need to
know its rate of descent you need to
know the angle of attack because as
you're slowing down coming in for a
landing you're pulling that nose up and
you can create a lot of drag and at a
certain point it takes more power to go
slower and the same thing is true of
software projects so you have to really
watch that angle of attack you might
have a crosswind
you know things trying to interfere so
you you have to really understand the
the you know the heading that you're
pointing on that aircraft so that's at
least five things that all have to be
adjusted every second as you're going
down that glide path so I said that the
team you know you need to see the glide
path you need to know how high you are
off the end of the runway how fast
you're going what your rate of descent
is what your direction is that's a
product backlog all of these things in
order to nail that and we're going to
get rid of every other reporting and
we're going to make this visible to
everybody so anybody wants to see the
state of the project they could walk by
the board and they can see all this then
we never have to waste our time in any
more reports because the reports have
always been wrong anyway bad Gantt
charts now people can come and look at
the real deal the real thing to see the
real state and that became scrum as we
know it today
trying to remember why that that just
sort of appeared it was kind of the
backlog of work we had to do stuff that
was stacked up that we needed to to do
well here's another thing that we made a
decision very early on is that in scrum
we never start anything new if we have
something new we take a one-week sprint
and we create a piece of code that's old
then we enhance it
everything is maintenance so we said
we're not going to have this thing where
other people maintain stuff you put it
out there and then other people have to
deal with all the dirty laundry that
just encourages the developers to put
bad code out there you know one of the
developers to eat their own dog food
they put bad dog food out there then
they have to eat their own dog food so
everything and we didn't want
maintenance programmers to be different
than new development so everything is
maintenance everybody has the same job
title and everybody's doing maintenance
now the focus is on not you but the team
being great and when the team is great
it's just like a sports team if you're
on one of those great teams you never
forget it when this when this team was
acquired and the company was moving some
of our about half of our staff did not
want to move and they were in my office
crying saying I'll be searching for a
team like this for the rest of my life
I'm concerned that I never will find it
again
today is everywhere
okay next
okay yeah some nonsense of being
effective
only use from the relative an
environment like FDA or just let it okay
that's augmentation
okay dependency between stories
as their thing because having enough
questions
one more yeah we work with multiple
brushes or Pat looks so multiple
projects or maybe one egg a variable
project of one one one team okay
everybody we have multiple projects
wanting our minds from requires a more
size of Swing haven't returned with the
duration by Angie change from with
everybody is environments who is doing
water goes Christmas projects have to
choose from the FDA okay so I just have
the time the duration is friends
countries be four weeks till my parents
will not change
okay some years ago I was CTO what is
now G healthcare and some of our
projects had to be FDA certified and
everything had been converted to scrum
so the first thing I said is you're not
going to insert FDI into the scrum
directly we're going to take the FDA
expert and we're going to have that
person work with the product
and they're going to put in the backlog
what the requirements are rep da and
make that part of the definition of done
at the end of the Sprint and the team
will figure out how to how to do that
what the team figured out is that they
were building features every sprint and
fully complete features tested features
and so they really eat needed to only
document those features that were built
and tested for the FDA to give
traceability for those features and they
were running six breaths for a new
project a new product and so they only
need to do a six of the work at the end
of every sprint the documentation and at
the end of the six prints it was just
like toe to bills documentation for a
new car it incrementally grows until the
car is ready and then it ships
immediately a Toyota and so the
documentation is accurate to the date
that car shipped now I measured the cost
of that and it cost us five percent of
project cost in overhead for FDA
documentation and previous projects had
cost at least twice as much so we we
eliminated 95% of the overhead of FDA
and we got true traceability now I have
consulted for big medical device
companies who write 600 page specs and I
have told them I said you're 6 on a page
spec is not updated for all the changes
that occur in the next year to a
development I know that you know that
right everybody shakes their head yes
right that means you are committing
fraud this is your a potentially
criminally liable in the best case
you're proposing a patient safety hazard
by producing non-traceable documentation
and telling the FDA it is
so if you're going to do software
development like that today
I recommend you get a good lawyer
because if you're sued and they come
after me as an expert witness you are
going to lose big time
so today I'm telling people it's
criminal to do waterfall for medical
devices criminal activity for which they
could be sued for fraud and held liable
for the death of patients and if they
want to do that go ahead but I don't
want to have anything to do with them
I don't want to be stuck in a lawsuit
that's FDA certification now real way
one of the most interesting project in
Europe was the ZB is doing the
Netherlands Railway scheduling system
scheduling system to railroads are hard
design-wise that it's complex it's a
complicated thing to do the scheduling
so they get hired multiple waterfall
teams they spend over 8 million euro and
nothing worked so they brought CBN's and
did scrum and they did a very high
performing scrum that was actually one
of the first distributed scrums where
half of the teams were in India in half
of the Netherlands and in a year or two
they delivered the completely new code
they delivered it complete for 2 million
euro and the quality was better their
definition of done every sprint was the
railroad ran it on their real servers
pre-production servers declared that it
passed all acceptance tests well they
got no credit for anything ok so in
terms of speed and quality it's one of
the fastest and highest quality projects
I've seen if there's a paper written on
it in I Triple E digital library so I
I'd pull that out and show it to the
railroad the other thing that was really
important to me is I've train the people
that worked for Lockheed on the latest
generation of fighters and they were
using scrum to build all the software
that runs the cockpit the heads-up
display and so I was really interested
in from a fighter pilots point of view
because many pilots are killed because
you know a switches in the wrong place
and the cockpit something bad happens
and they make a mistake and we had a
rule of thumb you had to kill five
pilots before they would fix a switch
that's the way it worked
so I was really interested in okay how
is the look and feel and the
relationship with the pilot by doing
scrum for that software they said much
better you get a much better user
experience with scrum the second thing
that pile is concerned about is defects
incredibly less defects you know
Microsoft is for for Microsoft
development tools they've reduced the
defects by ninety percent by using scrum
the three thousand people defects are
down ninety percent so you get much
higher quality much better fit to the
user experience with it with a
well-executed scrum because you're
constantly getting the end-user feedback
as you're building it and if you're
forcing a strong definition of done at
the end of every sprint you're getting
much higher quality product so you know
in any mission-critical thing I think
you'll get a better result with scrum
particularly that has humans interacting
with the product
yeah well I mean the first thing is the
best thing to do always is to write a
job description what kind of a person do
you want and I think of the scrum master
is kind of a cross between the soccer
coach and the soccer team captain so who
do you want to be the soccer team
captain somebody that has experience
somebody that has the confidence of the
team somebody that will speak for the
team we'll watch out for the team the
team trusts them yeah yes it's a
emotional thing emotional thing and then
the coach part you want somebody that's
knowledgeable about the process and can
help them you know execute the play well
so I mean you can write a job
description for that and then you ought
to post it and see who is interested
typically when you set up a team like
lots of times you just pull a team
together you know who you don't know
who's gonna be the scrum master you just
say okay you know who's the best fit for
scrum master often the team will know
right away then you can try that if it
works well fine if it doesn't try
someone else it is good to get someone
that's a stable scrum master it's like
you know if you're going into the World
Cup you don't want to change the cap to
the soccer team that could cause you the
game cost you the game so you have to
watch about that but you can do some
experiment to get the right guy just
like you would do on a soccer team the
product owner is more challenging for
people because that needs someone that
knows the business domain and actually
knows requirements and actually can work
directly with the engineers and take
their responsibilities strategically and
revenue wise for the product so that's a
big job
and there are very few people that have
a lot of experience with that today but
there are people that have relevant
experience and who are interested in
growing into that job and so you really
want to find someone like that now it's
interesting in our in our I work with a
venture capital group we have 14
investments doing scrum and the
investors have decided they like the
Steve Jobs model of product owner the
CEO is the chief product owner now the
CEO doesn't have time to do all the work
so you have to build a team around the
CEO that you know comes up with the
ideas maybe comes up with some
prototypes maybe and and those ideas are
bounced off there's some great articles
written on how Steve Jobs particularly
the iPad how the iPad how the iPod was
created there's an article in Wired
magazine that shows exactly what
happened who they hired to build the
prototypes when they met with Jobs what
he said how he selected what the iPod
would be what features he took off the
iPod all of that and what how that's how
the product team worked worked with him
as chief product owner to get that thing
in place very fascinating so our
investors feel that if the CEO is not
the chief product owner they're at a
competitive disadvantage in the market
for software products but they know they
need to build a product team around the
prata CEO to do a lot of the work and
get the backlog ready for the for the
team so that's for a product company for
a consulting company which there are
many more and you're very often when you
go into an engagement the engagement
leader becomes the product owner because
we find most of the time even though
we'd like the customer be the product
owner they don't know enough about how
to do requirements there are political
issues in prioritization they may not be
able to deal with and you as a
consultancy have got to
good backlog you've got to have it
prioritized and you've got to have
somebody own that and make decisions and
that's usually you as the consultant who
is leading that project so we see many
people who have been project leaders and
consultancies becoming the product owner
managing the customer the backlog and
then bringing in scrum masters around
teams to actually do the execution that
actually turns out to be a more powerful
implementation form than the project
leader historical project leader style
is a much weaker strategy to go in and
engage that customer delivery because he
gets the horsepower of those scrum
masters behind him
that's a that's a fun one okay
Percy you sit down with the customer
I talked a lot of CIOs and I say well
how is it going for you how are your
projects going when you're outsourcing
you know getting a third-party vendor
you're doing fixed price projects you
know they're all coming in on time and
budget the answer is always no so then I
ask them well requirements change right
they say yeah and I said I bet the
consultants chargeable a lot of money
when they change in fact I was at the
Pentagon recently briefing that nine
task force that have been mandated by
contrast Congress to move everything to
iterative incremental development I said
to them those Beltway bandits their job
is to bleed you dry would change
requests and every person in the room
said yes so then I say to the CIO okay a
five million euro project I bet it cost
you seven million and they always say to
me no not seven ten the average cost
overrun is a hundred percent so then I
say well you know with an agile approach
to the fixed price contract we could
give you all that change for free we
could we could guarantee the five
million euro project comes in at five
million euro why would you ever go to
with one of those waterfall consultants
are going to charge her for stuff you
could get for free and they always say I
wouldn't if I could find someone who
would guarantee it would stay at five
million euro and so then I say well
here's how it works
you know in scrum we build the product
backlog and over time we build the
highest priority highest value things
first
what we know is that 80% of the value is
in 20% of the requirements and we know
that 65% of requirements are never or
rarely used that's that's the worldwide
average and that gives us a lot of
flexibility the other thing we know in
scrum is that you could change the
backlog anytime you want as long as
that's a sprint at a sprint boundary so
say as CIO all of a sudden you've got
this new thing that's top priority and
all of a sudden you want to insert it
right here all you have to do is go to
the lowest of the low priorities that
will never be used anyway and throw it
away equal amount of work we're doing
you a favor by getting you to throw away
junk and that gives you the change for
free I can tell you the buzz in Paris
right now with the CIOs they have no
idea what agile is but they've heard you
get changed for free and they want it
yeah free stuff they went free yeah yeah
the I did a I helped a consultancy with
thousands of consultants do a marketing
study the CEO decided that this along
with what we call money for nothing
would be a strategic initiative that
they would execute just to disrupt the
big inning and consulting houses but
before they could do it they had to do a
marketing study of how many clients
could actually use this and so we had
CIO dinners in New York and Boston not
know I'm sorry New York and London and
what we found was about a third of the
CIOs were ready to act on this
immediately and these were people like
Deutsche Bank t-mobile a third of them
wanted a sales call right away to talk
about it they wanted to understand it
better and about a third of them would
like your client they said our
organization is so screwed up we could
never execute this but a third of market
ready to go this way is more than enough
to be really successful
well the last time I talked to the
consultancy they had executed about 20
of these on two of them they had some
problems but that wasn't any worse than
their waterfall projects in both cases
the problem was bad estimation on their
part or bad product backlog because they
didn't have a good product owner and
they were providing the product owners
so in both cases they felt the day it
screwed up that they were able to deal
with a customer side of it now it may
have been that they clear carefully
selected the customers because they said
you know this is not for everybody
in fact they charge a 30% premium over
waterfall to do these projects the way
they protect themselves with this they
say if you don't throw away as much as
you add its time and materials just like
we always did it
so they manage the risk that way
but I can tell you there's a lot of CIOs
out there that are hiring extension
consultants by the hundreds it looks
great when they sign the contract and
then they get all these kids just out of
school they charge a big consulting
dollars they're really slow and they're
fed up okay so they're like what'd they
do ask for they say we want a pilot a
short pilot you know two to three months
where we work with a team we learn the
estimation practice we see the velocity
of the team and we feel comfortable that
we'll ready to pay for that velocity and
then we want to pay the velocity of that
team and if that team slows down the
vendor eats the cost now a good vendor
knows that in general they will actually
increase velocity as they learn more
about the business so unless they are
really bad at executing that they'll
actually make more money by increasing
velocity but you do have to be able to
estimate I mean there's no magic in this
you have to be able to estimate you have
to get a backlog right if you can't do
that and waterfall then you're probably
going to have trouble with scrum what
systematics engineer software
engineering in Denmark found is as we
talked about today I think you were in
the class today right is that they can
estimate five projects for the cost of
estimating one in waterfall because the
agile techniques are so fast they get as
good or better estimates and they can
actually implement as we discussed today
at half the price of waterfall and this
is CMI maturity level five company that
can do a perfect waterfall so it's not a
problem doing waterfall
it's just they know what it costs to do
both ways
from the customer's point of view okay
for a customer to engage in a scrum
project they're going to be certain
requirements like the customer is gonna
have to work with the client to build
the backlog they're gonna have to show
up at every sprint review and look at
the software and say whether they like
it or not if they're not willing to do
that then nobody's going to execute a
scrum project with them because they
know that that will cause problems so
systematic will revert to waterfall
you're clearly a waterfall client and
you will pay twice as much it's still
competitive with other waterfowl vendors
we're still as same price or cheaper
than the other vendors it's just the
waterfall price if you want the scrum
price here's what you have to do and it
cost half as much and you have 40
percent fuel bucks
it's your choice the day the day you
stop following the requirements it
reverts to waterfall and you pay twice
as much so they don't have any problems
with their customers or really have
problems I mean the customer knows
whether what they're signing up for and
they have to do certain things and they
do it to get half price and they find
that they get a much better fit by
getting the customer involved like that
the customers are happier and the
developers liked it better the
developers happier they can better
develop a retention so
okay yeah so that we can spend a whole
day talking about fixed price projects
but we only have a few minutes well I
don't think bankers are any different
than anybody else that nobody wants to
change now what I find with most of the
companies I work with particularly the
larger ones I usually get to work all
the way from the senior management down
to the engineering team so I I'm engaged
at all levels and I typically find that
if the management is engaged in wanting
to go agile the senior management has
made a decision that to gain a
competitive advantage they need to be
agile know if that hasn't happened to
your bank then why you try to implement
scrum it's just going to be a big
headache if they don't want to get any
better they just want to do the same old
thing then the best thing to do is to go
find another bank that gets agile
because the other bank that gets agile
is gonna start taking market share away
from that company that doesn't want to
get agile that's what's going to happen
and you don't want to be in a losing
company anyway yeah I mean course that's
where scrub started everything was
bottom-up so now this is guerrilla scrum
so now you got to think differently okay
you're a guerrilla operation in hostile
territory so what you gotta go do is go
in there get scrum going under the
covers you know get a good high spirited
team and everyone sort of you pop up and
deliver them great software and then you
die for cover before anybody realizes
what's happened and if you're good
enough at that over time somebody gets
attention at a high enough level and
said no these guys are doing something
over here that really works
I can't get anything out of these
volleyball teams you know so then you've
got a sponsor so as we talked about
today what you want is a senior level
sponsor you want a godfather because
once you have a godfather nobody's gonna
mess with you what happens if somebody
messes with a Godfather's team bad
things happen
now then you can start planning a much
wider implementation the biggest problem
is middle management they are concerned
about their departments their job their
role they don't have the incentive to
change even if the senior management is
desperate to change you know the middle
management is like okay what's my job
going to be maybe we'll have less middle
managers they're very open about that at
big European companies we don't want to
change because there may be what fewer
management jobs well I tell them well
maybe you'll be totally out of business
you know tell it the bank's don't have
so much that problem but the telecom
companies they could be bankrupt a big
telecom company can go under I've worked
with two really huge telecom companies
that are gone and so what I tell them
that you know if you don't do this
you're gonna be bankrupt like these
other guys and hear that here they are
and here's what they did and here's why
they're dead they believe me and so the
senior management is called in gear the
problem is the middle management is not
so sure that their jobs are going to go
away yet so now you have to work with
them say okay you got to place your bet
for those people that will be flexible
and lead change there will always be a
job for those that won't be you may be
riding on the Titanic
you got to place your bets
what's that yeah that's the problem the
big banks of Zurich you know the
government's gonna bail them out right
they're never there too big to fail like
some of the ones in the US but I can
tell you there's a lot of politicians in
the US that are looking to cut banks
down to a size where they can fail just
like Lehman Brothers there's a lot of
political people are really angry in the
United States really angry they call
them the banksters they stole a third of
our retirement funds already and they
may go after the rest that's the average
Americans point of view of a bank right
now we've got to do something about the
banksters so let's see if we can put
that into political action we'll see
it's very hard because it's a resolving
door between the government and the
banks for every congressman there are
five bank lobbyists so if I'm a
congressman every day I got five bankers
at my door demanding I vote for their
bill that's how bad it is in the United
States but I can tell you the American
people are going to start demonstrating
in the streets about this all you have
to do is foreclose in enough houses
so there's a little bit of fear in some
of the banksters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
