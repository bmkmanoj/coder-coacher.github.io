my strategy for making talks is to just
figure out which of the voices in my
head I'm going to stay out loud and kind
of tease apart some threads and put them
together and then I have this I have
this habit of getting like six hours
worth of material and then trying to
cram it into into 40 minutes or whatever
we have so we're just going to let it
ride we're gonna have some fun who's
ready to have some fun good fun all day
who learn anything so they talked about
learning doesn't talk about change who's
never changed any behaviors this is
alternative title chop wood carry water
has anyone ever had to carry water is
anyone ever had to live without indoor
plumbing
yeah and chop chop some firewood
not camping like for extended periods
anyone ever have an outhouse so these
are the agenda I want you to read it
really fast and hold me to it
I've used this agenda before so we're
living in a world where more and more of
the world becomes constantly connected
to the totality of human knowledge who
has a super computer in their pocket the
pocket holds computer faster than all
the computing power on the planet was
born pretty much everyone in this room
has that and it's connected to a
high-speed network that has literally
pretty much everything that anyone has
ever grown done about anything available
at the touch of a button I push your
button I'll get a car I push a button I
get food why why I need to chop wood or
carry water so I'm going to dense that
we faced insurmountable opportunity they
aspect of human performance experience
that can be transformed by software will
be I believe this I feel this I live
this I experience this so we have even
even denser insurmountable opportunity
to transform human experience so this is
a short version and if you if you think
you got everything from the next three
slides you could leave so I'm going to
argue you're going to build a software
company we're going to lose it someone
who is you're going to continuously
DevOps micro services or at least if
someone who is and last but not least
you're building a learning organization
or losing to someone who is there's lots
of DevOps talks feel like 10 pandas
vomiting rainbows who doesn't want that
so I said I'm gonna introduce myself
mrs. Williger true this but also I think
it's important to have context so I've
been doing some kind of venture funded
startup thing since about 2004 I've been
involved in puppet which brought me into
orbits with chef and a bunch of other
projects I've done little big scale
projects with little puppet chef I
dabble danceable and salt I did a bunch
of work on OpenStack I'm also did some
work on cloud stack you know pretty big
and highly publicized projects now I
work on Cloud Foundry and also in orbit
with some of the other tools like docker
and kubernetes the rest of it this is
the flag for the most excellent software
development methodology of all time
artisanal retro-futurism cross with team
scale anarcho-syndicalism which i know
you all know and love and if you don't
you should go watch the talk by Brian
Mayer because it's amazing I wrote a
book about web operations for our Reilly
I'm sort of an emeritus organiser of
DevOps days but I guess I might I might
be reborn as a more active organizer and
I've also been part of the core loss any
community for a long time so
just to kind of put in perspective I
feel like I had a very privileged
front-row seat from a DeVos perspective
to kind of watch the internet be built
to watch the you know the evolution of
these tools and the cloud computing and
the processes that go along with them to
be successful and right now I work for
pivotal which they pay all my expense
reports and I I click on things from
Ridgid make sense reports - that's
pretty cool and then this probably the
most important slide here because this
is my twitter handle which is the
fastest way to get my attention and also
i'm such a narcissist I made a logo for
myself so that's my personal data so so
you need that you know that and just so
you this is to help you because I might
look different next time you see me so
these are all pictures of me in the last
five years with my twitter handle and my
logo so if you see will idea in the wild
he could look like that don't be afraid
I'm safe I also have done a number of
talks on related topics to what we're
going to hear today and I'm available
for weddings and bar mitzvahs so if they
have wanted by so my CDs I got some of
my hotel room alright so back Aaron
wants the DevOps right we want to ride
this DevOps rainbow-like and we actually
heard had to talk to this room perlier
ride the rainbow I also heard questions
from the audience like what is what is
DevOps something like there's a lot of
it inquiry
there's a lot of confusion about what
this word means and some of that's by
design some of that is by design because
one of the things that the early sort of
organizing core group of DevOps
conversations around is was watching the
agile evolution where things got
codified maybe too early or people were
we're really fixated on on these details
of processes that were provably not
working right at least that's my opinion
so what is DevOps I don't know either
I know I see it I also know you know
based on my bank account and being able
to pay my for my kids to eat their lot
have been very good to me but very very
privileged to have the opportunity to
see what I did work on what I did and
stand in front of you and talk about
this stuff right now so with that we're
going to go we're gonna have story time
with with Andrew where where are we and
how do we get here and I'm not sure I'm
going to answer what DevOps is by the
end of the thing but I'm gonna tell you
what means to me in very concrete terms
and I'm also going to hopefully give you
some things that you could think about
so this is a infographic from a blog
post on O'Reilly radar from 2007 and the
argument of this blog post it was
written by Jesse Robbins who is the
founder of the velocity conference and a
founder of chef and he had come from
working at Amazon so he'd run he'd run
Amazon's comms infrastructure and the
argument in the blog post and what this
infographic is trying to capture is this
notion that there's this traditional way
to do operations and then there's this
new secret sauce way and that in the
traditional way that the hours that are
spent doing work we all call toil have
some scale as the same number of servers
go up as the scale goes up you do more
work on the other one you have a scale
but it's it's much lower right this the
the amount of work that's required to
manage things that a certain scale is
much lower and this is before DevOps is
a word but I really think this captures
what people are trying to accomplish or
what people are hoping to accomplish
when they say that word and I this is
that that slides literally ten years old
and this is another thing I said for 10
years and I used to say this about
puppet and now I say about other things
but you can either easily manage complex
systems of scale dun-dun-dun or you
can't
and I've been saying that literally for
ten years and I don't know if it's
getting any better based on what I see
some people doing but it's sure getting
shinier newer and shinier this is what
DevOps means to me this is a blog post I
wrote in 2010 so this is seven years ago
on a blog that I don't update either
anymore that was a comment someone made
I used to blog now I basically subtweet
on Twitter so so in 2010 when you know
DevOps were starting to have a little
momentum and conversation I said that
developers and operations can should
work together who has a problem with
that statement anyone no system
administration is evolving to look more
and more like software development so in
a world where I have an API that I can
use to provision systems I have an API
Veck easy to configure systems I have an
API that I can use to monitor systems
like can hook up to my logging analytics
all this stuff API driven all the tasks
that used to be run running you know do
it five is H from my home directory is
now an API and that looks suspiciously
like software development and that that
trend has only continues and and and
really accelerated since 2010 and last
but not least and I actually think this
is the most important point this is what
I feel is the is the thing that gives
you superpowers is that this is evolving
as a global community sharing solutions
so I said this in 2010 if this is true
or more true now but the fact that you
can go on to these IRC channels these
slack channels and you can have
conversations with people that are
building things with these tools they're
solving these problems with each other
helping each other right and I'm going
to come back to this notion of
communities of practice later but this
this is very powerful and I might be
pretty smart person and you might be a
pretty smart person but if you can ask
me questions about something I'm an
expert in or I can ask you about things
you're an expert in then we're both
smarter together
right so this is another thing I'm very
fond of and I'm going to come back to
this I actually there's some some things
here I think are gold mine that we're
not exploring that I'm going to
I put in as the directors cut some
information I'm kind of playing around
my head I think hopefully be valuable or
thought-provoking the the five pillars
of DevOps right and and people when they
first said they said cams but I don't
like saying cams like realistic Calmes
so I like to add lean in the middle but
it's basically this idea that DevOps
encompasses more than just some set of
tools it's more than just the culture
it's all these things together right so
culture automation lean metrics and
sharing I'm going to come back to that a
little bit so we'll leave it for now but
again this general thing I want to pound
into your head and I believe it's true
and I feel this is true and I live it
every day is that we're optimizing human
performance experience operating
software that's what DevOps means to me
and we're doing that with software so
we're optimizing the operation of
software with software and with humans
right these social technical systems
pandas vomiting rainbows right every
wants this well actually here's what
they really want
scalability availability reliability
operability usability all for free
thought change anything and security and
some other entities and ill-at-ease
whatever you could pile on and then
there's a trick I like to use to make a
point I just keep saying that making the
same words bigger without changing
anything I've literally had this
conversation people pay me a lot of
money as a consultant to go into their
organization analyze what they're doing
take whatever information I had the
context that I have the tools that I had
the process that I understood the
processes they had and give them what I
thought was reasonable path forward if
they wanted the DevOps and they're like
well what can we do without change
anything good luck
just pay me so here's the warning get up
this heart I think there's there's
there's people and some of them are my
friends if you want to opera deli
there's this Golden Age of DevOps right
and I get this all sudden you know
there's like this this romanticized
notion of being able to automate servers
and it's amazing and we're all gonna
we're going to love each other and
there's pandas vomiting rainbows no it
always sucked it literally always sucked
it was hard there's mud and blood
everywhere
this is a picture of me this is a
picture of me after I wrote that blog
post trying to build and operate a
massive Opus a cluster and it sucked for
a lot of reasons that we won't go into
all today but just trust me it was
painful
they would never do that yeah fine this
is the headline from a lot of OpenStack
deployments that I saw other people do
me maybe you know this guy they going to
work there sorry so what I came to
realize watching this evolve is that the
same tools the same advice drastically
different results like I can go into
groups that look very similar on face
relatively similar size maybe even
similar businesses you give them the
same tools you give the same advice you
turn your back on them and you come back
and once like this is amazing this pad
is vomiting rainbows and other people
like this is terrible it's not any
better and and it's like well he didn't
change anything so what did you expect
this is the divergence because I just
like to use every excuse to talk about
math people like talked about the
butterfly effect and chaotic behavior
but what does chaotic behavior actually
this is an image of a Lorenz attractor
which is a very simple system of the
differential equations that creates this
this pathing a chaotic system by
definition music if you have two points
are close to each other at certain time
that they can be arbitrarily far apart
at a later time and it's very hard for
us humans to think reasonably about
these sort of nonlinear chaotic systems
and also the motion of the system there
repeats itself and I just thought this
picture looked really cool when I
searched for them and I'm also going to
come back to this notion of five things
for five pillars but that is a that's a
edging of a Bernice equation which I
think is beautiful and elegant so back
to the story automate all the things
this was me I had I have my my DevOps
tool set and I can automate anything you
gave me a thing I can automate it
guaranteed what I came to realize
especially after the picture I showed
you earlier with a little bit of mine on
my face that what how and why you ought
to me is as important as that you do
that the act of automation itself is
probably a missed opportunity to
revisiting why those things even exist
or thinking about how those things
deploy monitor I feel like there's this
evolution there's some of these themes
and talks earlier that touched on
aspects of this but I feel like cloud
native software kind of a new way to do
it the software should basically deploy
itself the software should basically
monitor itself now you're not adding
automation you're not adding miring in
this ad hoc fashion after the fact it's
all part of the same system it's thought
from first principles so so automation
this is automation right this automation
is that automation yes that is non
automation that's a manual process this
this is automation
right and I built that before both
phases of it and I'm sure I'm sure some
of you are about to do this and then
you're like oh let's just put it in a
container and we're like like put some
schedulers and we'll drop it on some
stuff and it's going to work great and
if Tetris has taught me anything it's
the heirs pile up and accomplishments
disappear and that I didn't really get
that far from that so why don't people
change does anyone know what a Pareto
inefficient Nash equilibrium is yeah
whoo I really wish everyone did so we
can have more conversations about it
because it's how I roll so I'll tell you
what they are
Fredo inefficient is it's an idea from
economics that a change can benefit if
it's Pareto inefficient it means you
could change something that will benefit
someone and no one loses all right so
not a zero-sum situation you can make
something better and nothing worse
there's some some change that will do
that but in Nash equilibrium by
definition this is from game theory is
that no one will change because you're
at a point in the game play where no one
no one feels that there's a strategy
that would would you two laterally be
better you have to get to collaborate or
the rules of the game have to change to
get out of it
so my blog post I talked about evolution
and I do think it's evolving I think
it's evolving even more rapidly since
2010 but let's talk about evolution for
a second so evolution it turns out
doesn't really come in this this gradual
incremental fashion and if you look at
the the fossil record then the fossil
record reflects the these rapid changes
in in the organisms dynamic you know
explosion of organisms and then long
long periods millions of years of
stability with little or no change to
the
to life and most of these rapid changes
nearly all these rap changes essentially
are are correlated with some big change
in the environment you know meteors or
ice ages or this kind of stuff so
evolution in the fossil record comes in
sudden jumps and extinction events who
wants to die so what if this represents
to me in a certain sense is is that
these these evolutionary things these
organisms in aggregate are stuck playing
the game with a strategy they can't
change to to the new strategy they can't
adopt or adapt to to the new environment
so let's talk about organisms a little
more now I'm going to make this make
sense hopefully by then let's talk about
some cells so you notice - cell at the
level of a cell that there's a lot of
discrete structures who's had biology
class so these these are eukaryotic
cells it's literally the same cell in
every living creature so all the same
structures all the same things from a
single-cell organism up to the most
complex organisms and we're one of the
more complex organisms but but but still
remember that that that same pattern of
structure is the same through all the
different areas um's and in humans
there's all these separate systems that
we've organized that we've identified as
humans one of my one of my professors
his specialty is his biology he actually
would argue there's 23 systems but
that's a that's a longer lecture but but
what's important here is that these are
systems of systems that have functions
that are important you can't really take
away one of those systems without the
organism dying who thinks you should
care down silos I actually don't think
you should now that not that you should
have silos but what you should think
about is the system right because I get
in conversations where people
have heard or read a blog post or
something and they're like well we need
to tear down all the silos and we need
to put everyone in one big pile and
everyone's going to do everything and I
never thought that and I've never seen
that work and if you think about
organism then an undifferentiated mass
of cells is a tumor right you need to
have these systems so that doesn't mean
that the heart doesn't signal the lungs
that doesn't mean that the endocrine
system doesn't have an impact on your
digestion but doesn't but it also
doesn't mean that they're all one big
pile of cells that are undifferentiated
so this can this notion of a community
community of practice how many people
consider themselves a developer how many
people consider themselves operations
how many people consider themselves a
businessperson do you go to conferences
for developers DC developers how many
people have tribal affinity with a
certain set of programming tools or
language who's a Java developer there's
a ruby developer who's a JavaScript
developer right so this is this is like
a much longer topic but everything in
tech everything in human existence is
driven by fashion and tribalism more
than almost any other factor right so we
we have this tribal signaling in our
community of practice it's like you know
when people say certain things or they
can have conversation about certain
things that they're one of you they're
one of our trial there's language around
rails there's ring language around you
know data science and we constantly are
exchanging these tribal signals so in
the community of practice and this goes
back to this notion of global sharing
then you'd expect a high level of
ability and then who has this this kind
of configuration in their organization
you have developers on one side of a
wall and then you have operations on the
other side of the wall and there's a lot
of confusion in the middle and everyone
soil you know someone from dev throws
something over the wall and it lands on
someone from Austin and they're mad you
don't do that
it's amazing what kind of problems you
can solve if you just make desert where
pagers but that's another longer topic
that given that length already so what
I've seen people doing you know going
back to the silo notion is there like a
lowing ideas we got to tear down this
silo and so we're going to tear down the
silo and then and then we're going to
we're going to fill it with a new silo
whoo pandas don't do that I heard people
arguing all you could do that as a
transition it's like I'm still bitter
from when I was five years old and they
told me I couldn't take the square root
of negative one like just just teach
people how to do it right so this and
this is simplified obviously just
remember security is always on the
bottom what you actually want is each of
these as a fully functioning system
that's a community of practice in its
own right that has a high level of
competence and understanding in their
domain but then but then also acts as a
community of interest for the mission
that you're trying to accomplish
who who thinks that you can successfully
DevOps microservices without some
alignment coordination between operators
and developers yeah no one okay so the
other lesson I learned this early or
another lesson the scale breaks
everything everything there's no there's
no successful startup that I've ever
seen they didn't have to rewrite major
aspects of their of their architecture
as they scaled and it's a good problem
to have but there's space shifts that
that force you to do this you can
literally won't work so I want to talk
about that in terms of physical systems
and maybe we could take the analogy back
to its organization so this is an ant
I can live 50 times my own bodyweight
right
and there's a bunch of things about ants
they're interesting right ants have
exoskeletons ants
process oxygen through pores in their
exoskeleton they have a bunch of
internal systems their musculature is
connecting to the to the exoskeleton to
move things around there's big big
cavities you know relative to the to the
shape of exoskeleton where all the
organs are in the thorax and abdomen
cool cool story ant this is an elephant
elephants also have a bunch of
interesting things that they do they
spend a lot of time eating they also
don't have an exoskeleton in fact they
proportional to their size they have
much thicker bones than in literally any
other living creature and why is that
well why can't have an elephant sized
ant the problem problems actually
physics so this is the this square cube
law and what it what it means and this
is this is intuitive once you start to
think about it is that when you you
scale a physical object the new surface
area it's proportional to the square of
that scale and the new volume is
proportional to the cube of the of the
scale right and there's a bunch of
physical qualities about strength and
structure that that are a result of this
so muscles have strength proportional to
their cross-sectional area which is is
it as N squared but the volume is n
cubed so that that means that you have a
problem if you make an elephant size ant
that's one of the many things so if you
did try to make an elephant size and if
you anatomically were able to somehow
construct this thing then it would
require hurricane-strength winds to get
enough oxygen through the pores in its
exoskeleton to how
hope of metabolizing the the things that
needs and it would die as soon as they
tried to move right so lots and lots of
discussions in this in this DevOps
conversation sound like I can lift 50
times my body weight and what's the
organizational equivalent of the cube
square law I don't know either but I
know scale breaks everything so are
there any examples of scale DevOps of
scale well here's one Google happens to
have more computers than anyone probably
more computer than everyone else put
together
possibly and I'm not saying Google is
the best every possible thing there's
certainly some things I would critique
your question but they did happen to
write a book and so that gives us a nice
reference and Google stands as existence
proof that Google could exist right
conveniently so here's a little homework
that you didn't know you're going to
help work read the first three chapters
from the principles of the sre book
embracing risk service level objectives
in one of you toil and if that's enough
read the bonus chapter from the
management chapter about communication
collaboration it's going to take you 20
minutes of your life you won't regret it
and I feel like this is this is gold and
being able to reframe some of your
thinking in terms of this the practices
there's about 20 chapters worth of
practices and they're interesting their
own right and sort of like as an
anthropological survey of how Google
sees itself but lots of them won't apply
to you unless you're working at Google
so you can skip those two later till
you're interested in but go read these
because this will change your life and
what are you the service level
objectives very few people so I was
basically having convulsions in the
keynote when people are talking about
event-driven architecture and there's no
conversation around the actual service
level objective there's no conversation
around what that can deliver there's no
conversation around how that scales and
how it fails all these
wize are sort of buried in this thing
all we want adventure in architecture
well why and what does they actually
give you what promises can it keep for
you and what are you trading off and
there's conversations are happening they
always happen in little circles of
people building the Internet there's
people that have these kind of
architectural principles and
conversations but it's we didn't have a
good language for it and I think that
the framing and sre book around service
level objectives and service level
indicators gives us a really nice
language to start having those
discussions and it also gets you out of
basically gets you out of this blame
pointy finger thing where you could just
say okay it's the air budget we all
agreed on it we agreed as obviously
agreed as we created out in the business
and it's dispassionate it's like if
you're below your air budget you could
deploy all the time if you exceed your
air budget you can't deploy till you fix
your garbage the other thing that's
becomes clear if you read this book is
Google's changed so much there's so many
anecdotes about what they've done and
how they've changed based on the things
that happen to them along the way and
I'm going to argue and I will argue it
argued lots of stuff all the time but if
you if you learn something if you think
you learn something but you didn't
change your behavior then you're just
deluding yourself you're just collecting
trivia it's just information to you
right this is really easy to see if
you're talking about something like
playing music or playing chess or
playing any any game you either can
perform better or you can't right and
sometimes you're going to go through a
dip I don't know if anyone's ever tried
to retool their their golf swing or
their basketball shot but if you don't
change your behavior you're not learning
right so these are aqueducts these
changed everything there was a time when
human beings and there's still still
place where this is true have to carry
water right it's a big deal it's a
life-changing thing when you can get
mechanisms to filter water in certain
populations still to this day and and
and yet we do that scale right we have
build the infrastructure we've solved
this problem at
so we could go worry about other things
like Twitter whoops and this similar
progression with all these other tools
that humans build right this is the same
progression that's happening with our
with our tools around DevOps and cloud
and the rest of it it's evolving as we
learn and as the scale the pressure of
the scale forces us to it to get better
so how do we change does anyone familiar
with the the metaphor of seeing a loop
and double loop learning a couple people
so this is one of the things I think
it's a little bit worrisome when you see
people talking about you'll measure this
do this and and here's your process
right and you get in this loop and
you're going to check against the
process and so you're going to be able
to to adjust towards that metric and
you're going to optimize that metric and
that keeps you on a certain curve right
but it doesn't allow you to necessarily
get off that curve so this is what
there's a quote from one of my my
friends so you read it anyway for you
but I've literally seen this in there's
cartoons and there's other funny
metaphors where you know people are
literally pushing the square block of
stone and someone's like hey I got a
wheel and they're like no I'm too busy
I'm too busy getting work done like okay
good job so the idea of double loop
learning is that you have this this
primary loop where work gets done real
work happens chopping what happens
caring water happens and they have this
larger loop where you rethink your
assumptions about about water and wood
right and I like to have quotes from
different people this is one of my
favorite people if I had an hour to
solve a problem I spend 55 minutes
thinking about the problem and five
minutes thinking about the solutions so
going back to this notion of change and
also this notion that you can give
groups of people the same tools and the
same ideas about process and they'll get
very different results what I've come to
believe
very strongly is this this change this
difference is in their level of
organizational learning how can that
organization change their behavior given
new information how can you as an
individual change your behavior given
the information there's a there's
another talk I did a while ago that has
a little more depth on each of these but
these is a model that I found in
academia the seven dimensions of
organizational learning and there's a
survey that lets you do self assessments
on this and most of those questions and
I I didn't make them focus here today
can be reversed to be actionable so
it'll ask you a question like in my
organization the you know people are
encouraged to be part of the dialogue
regardless of rank and that's the
question you're supposed to rate one to
ten so it seems pretty easy to reverse
that and say in my organization I'm
going to make it so everyone
participates regardless of their rank in
the hierarchy so like I said if I had an
hour I just give you talk about or you
just learning the the learning
organization is one has the capacity and
great people and structures in order to
move toward continuous learning and
change learning is part of the process
getting better at your job is part of
the process it's not about coming and
doing the the single loop to drive the
one metric it's about what do we do why
do we do it how do we do it better and
this is this is from saying you this is
the the notion of kind of these two
domains so you have the domain of
enduring change where we're like
philosophically things happen the the
model happens that double loop happens
and then you have the the domain of
action where wood and water get get
chopped right and this this model and if
you want to read the the fifth
discipline it's from that book but being
able to take things from I feel like
when you go to a conference and you see
all these ideas then you're expanding
your awareness your sensibilities and
then it's on you maybe your attitudes
beliefs whatever it's on you to take
that home and use it to chop wood better
if you don't you didn't learn if you
don't change that behavior didn't learn
anything and then this is this is the
illustrate how this actually has to
happen
every level of the organization so
there's lots of stuff that you as an
individual with domain expertise both
with the technology use and with the
business that you're part of are
uniquely qualified to have intuitive
improvements to see things that can be
changed that no one else could see and
that starts the level of individual and
then the organization itself needs ways
to feed that through the group up to the
larger organization
it's not always easy especially when you
got you know decades of calcified
notions of how we do things so this is
this is the directors cup and chill
because I think this is an interesting
model I've been playing around in my
head so does anyone know what this is
this is this is the the five elements
from Chinese medicine or Eastern
medicine so the the top is fire and then
air and then metal and then water and
then wood I'm in a circle and the notion
in in this system is basically that
these things have a destructive cycle in
a constructive cycle and they reinforce
each other and they and they they're
kind of detrimental to each other if
they're out of balance and so all of
this medicine is basically like
detecting or doing metrics on different
aspects of where you had deficiencies
and then figuring out ways to try to
balance it out and that spawns a bunch
of stuff about diet and acupuncture and
all the rest of it and the reason I set
that up is first let me show you in a
minute but first I'm going to show you
this because I just thought was
hilarious this is someone getting their
their key rebalance with some
acupuncture so I wash over you so
earlier I talked about this notion of
the five five pillars so culture
automation and lean metrics and sharing
and and I really feel like it's hard to
talk about each of them in isolation
because they really reinforce each other
or they or they don't or they kind of
destroy each other and then also just
because I thought was funny and it had
five stages I think this is very
important to understand and especially
especially in the enterprise where
see lots of people adopt things and then
and then fail miserably and then declare
victory yeah so this this is something
I'm working on in my head but I think I
think there's some meaningful things
here where basically each of the five
pillars kind of have have their own
level of metrics and how they
interconnect and you might be you might
be better at automation but you have a
pathological culture or you might be you
know measuring more things but like if
anyone ever automated a lot of stuff to
not improve their monitoring yeah that's
pretty fun right that ends well this is
this isn't on this talk but the they
have this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of
reliability in this re book this is
pyramid that starts with the bottom
layer is monitoring fix monitoring right
if you don't if you don't have good
monitoring and how do you know what
anything did how you know that anything
had changed in anything so being able to
take each of these things in an
interconnected way and connect them back
together I think that's one of the
conversations that's missing it's very
it's very easy for and and I think we
see these talks and all the DevOps days
and all the velocities like a talk we'll
talk about one aspect of metrics
monitoring but it doesn't connect back
to how that changes culture right you
you will have a very very hard time in a
sharing culture where information is
ambient and you're also pathological
like it's very very hard to do that so
as you as you change how you share then
it's going to drive your your culture to
be generative right but but some of
these things will actually make the
other things like more difficult right
so for example if you have someone who's
very very adept at automation and you
you get this continuous automation out
of their great work but they haven't
actually shared that information they
haven't they haven't made that available
that understanding available to the rest
of the organization then you probably
didn't raise the level of everyone's
game like you probably got this
incremental
local Optima from that person's work
from the benefit of that but you didn't
you didn't really that get that much
closer to the to the why and the how for
for the mission that you're on so we'll
come to the home stretch so can DevOps
continues to literary microservices
these are all buzzwords everyone's
saying them like they're in these talks
all day long and I argue this is really
one phenomenon this is a single
phenomenon you can't you can't
continuously deliver micro services if
you didn't solve deployment if you
didn't solve Maura it's like all
connected I'll reinforce to each other
so my advice to you is continuously
DevOps micro services or die trying' and
that you can see the patterns that other
people have have taken it doesn't mean
that it's perfect for your context but
there are there are examples there are
good examples where they've driven down
this operational cost and driven up the
reliability right so don't don't seek to
follow in the footsteps of the Y's
secret base thought so don't seek DevOps
continuously read containers
microservices seek awesome try and make
things better right I want things to be
better because then it's better for me
to principles are more important that
practices are more important tools if
you understand the principles the
practices will be obvious and you can
build the tools that you need if you
just focus on tools you're going to have
a hard time mindset is greater than
skillset is greater than toolset adapt
is greater than adopt Y is greater than
what the problem isn't technical the
problem isn't people the problem is
social technical and we have to solve
them both together you have to solve all
five points of the star together and
we're all part of that system so in
conclusion the game is changing there's
lots of options extinction is one DevOps
is not as confusing as some people make
it you haven't learned anything until
you change your behavior there are good
examples and changes our opportunity
and then I told you I like quotes and I
have a couple more every tenth to make
software easy and safe will result in
humiliation and disaster in the original
he says war but I think it's fitting and
I promise to call the action so called
action question everything don't limit
yourself with labels don't think oh I'm
off some dev whatever they you have a
world full of things you can mine for
information find the why the what will
follow get mud on your hands you have to
chop some wood you have to carry some
water but don't let the mud on your
hands stop you from learning play to win
and know that you can win so what
happens next
change and it's not the strongest of the
species that survives nor the most
intelligent that survives is the one
that is most adaptable to change there
is no evidence Darwin ever said this but
it's often quoted so you get to choose
your adventure you could take you want
to know or you don't want to know that's
the end thank you
I'm Andrew and I'm not here to answer
question I'm here to have conversations
and last but not least pivotal taste
from you comes so 5:30
I could take questions for a moment
conversations if you will okay fantastic
thank you first let's just give it up
for Andrew and if somebody does launch a
heckle and her into the mic I would be
happy to bring it over to you and let
you do so I see a smile in Brianna I'm
just going to put the mic in front of
you I love you Andrew I think the the
only comment I have is your Tacoma
Sherman quote could be simplified
simplify any attempt to build software
will just result in humiliation and
disaster does that I love it Oh
rebellions are built on hope mark okay
see this is the end of the day and I'm
just kind of you know punch-drunk so I'm
just going to may bring the mic over to
people and make them talk so I just want
to say my favorite thing that's been
happening lately when I see Andrew talk
is there's one slide that is something
I've said not not that you took it from
me but I'm like I've been saying that -
that's super validation so I think like
when you're talking about sort of those
transitional teams yeah that's something
that you feel like you lose the battle
on that one but I actually really like
how you framed it in terms of that it's
not just this bridge team it's actually
a wider part of the organisms that that
really resonated to me and I'm going to
be stealing it like crazy good job
everything is Creative Commons share and
share alike it's all yours so if you
were to bet what would be the next
concept that's going to be ruling soft
development three years from now
similar to DevOps what would be the next
you know what would be the new concept
that we will be looking at so I think
there's a danger you know and this goes
back to some other things I did around
martial arts I've just kind of collect
buzzwords and techniques I don't think
DevOps ever really ends right I don't
think agile ever really ends it just
expands our understanding our
capabilities expand
but one thing I do think and I've given
I've given some other talks about this
and I think that this will well this
will be more and more clear as people
get more capabilities around automation
and I touched on it a little bit here is
that the notion of architecture and the
notion of sort of these cloud native
patterns that that enforce their own
behavior that that make doing the right
thing the easy thing for the developer
are going to be a bigger deal than than
the automation tooling right so so this
with respect to the scalability
reliability security if I can if I can
provide those those components this is
actually in some sense from the Google
sre book as well is that the Google sres
while they have love operational
responsibilities are largely the
architects and there's conversations in
my circle of friends where we have these
kind of architectural understandings
mostly from the scar tissue from doing
it wrong but as the community of
practice grows wider and we start to
face some of these same scalability
problems because the one of the things
always happens in in organizations is
whoever's the loudest ends up making
decisions and a lot of times or
whoever's closest to the decision and
hides it from other people and so I've
seen a lot of times where people are
arguing about a detail around
architecture and there's no real way to
to solve it because it's just your
opinion man it's just your opinion and
you don't have good metrics you don't
have good patterns but no one's really
talking about the scalability the fail
failure characteristics and the rest of
that stuff and as we get more and more
of us building these things that are
bigger and more reliable then we're
going to we're going to have to solve it
we're gonna be forced to solve it and
just just one bit of context that that's
embedded in is that Google couldn't have
solved this any other way these are like
they're our winni and evolution of how
they got to you know all these patterns
that you see the cloud native patterns
are very similar across the
organizations and they evolve from the
pressure to evolve and as these projects
from other startups or enterprises like
if you just start doing some napkin math
about even modest IOT deployments the
type of data that those will generate
these are
raise of sensors the timescale data that
you're going to be generating what you
need to ingest what you need to index
and hopefully you want to do that with
some reliability you're going to need to
be able to solve these problems if
you're doing that the old way with ITIL
and ServiceNow you're done good luck
I love to talk so we we have that I'll
end here talk to you oh thank you you
know we have the joke about the DevOps
silo replacing the wall of confusion and
while we laughed that actually happens
quite happens all the time
yeah do you have any thoughts or ideas
I'm like what it is about the enterprise
that sort of keeps reinforcing this sort
of siloed behavior even when we're
explicitly trying to destroy it so I
think there's two things that are
happening one is that there's we
basically manage our work in 2017 with
systems of management that were designed
for managing ditch-diggers and factory
workers right and when you get to these
creative software projects where
creativity and intelligence are a
competitive advantage then then that's a
disadvantage managing things that way
and so there's there's a lot of legacy
process there's a lot of legacy
management mindset that that's creating
some of that and then the second thing
is that there are there are vendors and
there's consultants who are more than
willing to pander to that that
propensity right and so that just sort
of reinforces that kind of thing but if
it's really Darwinian if it's what I
what I say and what I believe then then
there will be extinction events as well
well this is fantastic as always Andrew
thank you so much for coming I hope i
disappoint you you you never disappoint
me and this was fantastic so thank you
all so much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
