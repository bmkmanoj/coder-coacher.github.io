working at Microsoft on JavaScript
engine and JavaScript editor that's why
when when they asked me to come to this
conference they asked me to talk about
CSS because nobody else wanted to it
seems and this is what I really want to
talk about today that as a web developer
that I've been for 20 years now it's
always quite bizarre how CSS versus
JavaScript is this constant battle that
we're having here and I wanted to remind
you today about a few things that CSS
has caught up with that might be
interesting for you to use and to
actually stop belittling it there are so
many things where you like every time
just to talk about CSS there's this
Family Guy animated gif with like Kim
trying to get D jealousy up and I go
it's everything is so hard and so tough
to do in CSS and I get kind of tired of
this because this bickering that we do
between different fractions of our
market doesn't help anybody in essence
we have to build things for users and
what we use to get there is what made us
effective but it's also good for the end
user so yesterday night I went here and
I first of all realized in Netherlands
you get South Park studios which is cool
because in England we don't get it
why I don't know but also on Netflix you
had this civil war kept America movie
and I already got bored with that on the
plane so I thought I might get bored
with it at home again and see what it's
about if it's even better or if it's
just if it just was me not liking it and
I still got bored by it because the
problem with a movie like that is that
Marvel introduced 10,000 characters that
they all want to make an extra movie
from and then all of a sudden it was too
many and we didn't remember anymore who
was who and what was going on so they're
like hey let's make a movie where they
all discontent with each other and then
they fight with each other at an airport
and you kill all kind of airplanes and
delay my flight and do all kind of
things together and I the whole fight
was boring his toast because they were
all matched they all had the same powers
they all had the same thing they were
friends they were all working together I
knew there's not going to be like kept
America cutting of ironmans had to go
like ha ha ha there you go you know
because it was a PG 12 movie as well
and I was just like what is all this
aggression for if there's no end point
to it and this is exactly what I feel
when we're talking about JavaScript or
CSS or whatever other thing we do to get
something on to the screen because all
of those have powers that are different
to the other technologies and all of
them should be used to their best use
case rather than just because using it
so CSS seems to be confusing for
programmers and that has been since we
invented it I mean I did 1997 I look the
first time like why do we do this
bgcolor thing and table layouts what can
we do and back then it was like make
your websites faster with CSS because
the look and feel is only in one file
that can be cached by the browser and
we're like oh this is so cool and people
then like five years later you still
think this is cool what the this is
really nothing that's going on what we
do is look what I can do will react but
I love to tweet the other day where
she's like can these two groups yes is
so easy it's not even coding CSS is so
hard we need to replace it with
JavaScript please talk to each other and
this is sometimes the same group because
we look at CSS as developers and we find
the syntax weird like exclamation mark
important means it is important as a
JavaScript developer I'm always stumble
over that one it's kind of odd
everything is a string everything is
basically a declaration and I'm just
standing there what's going on and then
we do what every developer does we
change stuff and seeing what happens and
we mess things around and CSS and when
the display doesn't control it properly
then we actually say the language is
terrible and should be replaced by
something useful like for example OpenGL
I love that when I open shell show me
and then you get like the triangle with
the colors there and a lot of times
every time I talk to people that come
from higher level programming games
programming on the web they're like why
can't I use GL for that and I'm like
because you don't know the operating
system you don't know the processor you
don't know where this thing is going to
run so something like CSS is much more
forgiving and much more sensible an
environment that is undefined but it's
kind of weird for us to do that because
we don't want to give that control away
and this is what the whole fight is
about controlling the environment
controlling the display so if you think
about it CSS is fault-tolerant and this
is like everything on the web HT
Malus fault-tolerant if you do something
wrong in a CSS file the parser skips
that line and says like well let's look
at another one I don't care if you do a
JavaScript error in one of them the
JavaScript processes I don't play with
you anymore I'm going to go and go in a
corner now and not talk to you so CSS
and HTML is meant to allow the publisher
is meant to allow the person writing it
to make mistakes without the end-user
being punished and as a developer that
always feels weird because we want to
know at least why or get some
console.log or some test actress what
happened but CSS is kind of silent when
it fails we just know it failed and
that's about it
so it can be confusing for developers
that want to control everything but it's
actually great for people who think okay
if I made a mistake it's not my end
users that have to suffer from it it's
my job to find out what's going on and
that's why I use a proper editor you
have CSS linting in the editor as well
and you have insights of even hovering
telling you what these things mean I use
Visual Studio code because I'm part of
that team and I'll work on that and we
even have a nice extension now that
tells you when you run over CSS which
browser supported instead of having to
look it up every single time on the web
and this is what we think we should be
going to we should be starting more
about limiting than debugging before we
write stupid code why go through all
that and then find the error let's
prevent us from writing the error in the
first place much like we have we have
like resources in something like a word
so basically every time you write a word
wrong you get a squiggly underline this
is what we should be doing for coding
more as well javascript is not fault
tolerant that can be disastrous that's
why you get these webpages that are
empty that's why you get endless
spinners on the web that's why a website
tells you oh you're not on Chrome you're
not on a MacBook Pro sorry no internet
for you and this is not what the web is
about this is not what the web was meant
to be and let's not start with the UK
government trying to censor it that's a
different story about it I can talk
about that for hours as well so in CSS
you apply your styles and you hope it
worked this is actually all you have and
this is kind of cool because it's up to
the end-user to see something that makes
sense so your CSS should never be in the
way of K and you
we had a big problem here CSS prefixes
out of a button we had out of a sudden
we had buttons with white text and white
background because the background was a
WebKit gradient that only works on the
first iPhone so there were buttons by
the dozens on the internet only by the
hundred thousands on the internet that
were completely unusable for somebody
not having an iPhone because the
developer was too lazy to just define a
background color and then overwrite it
with a gradient only when the browser
supports it and this is what you should
be thinking about CSS all the time it's
an enhancement to a user interface so if
you do layout with CSS and the thing
stacks up in a sensible order when the
CSS could not be executed or is not
supported by that browser great you've
done nothing wrong you build an
interface you build a sensible interface
you didn't build something that is
perfect for everybody because that
doesn't work I always compare it with
escalators versus lifts escalators when
they break down they're great because
they're stairs you can still go to the
other level it takes more effort but
you're not stopped from getting to the
other level on a lift you stand in a
room that is broken with five people you
don't want to be in
so escalators are there to accelerate
our way to or something that's my
favorite at the airport when you've got
the the walkways and people stand on
them and they're like these things are
meant to make you move faster not to
make you move get out of my way right
now that might be just mean in
JavaScript however you control the
styling and you can and should verify
that it worked as soon as you make a
luan interface and you make it dependent
on JavaScript it's up to you to make it
available for people it's up to you to
understand what to do when something
goes wrong and it's not telling the user
to please download another browser
because that's what we did in 1996
that's why we have malware on a lot of
computers right now because people
didn't get rid of those old computers
and those old browsers that everybody
had to use now CSS means embracing the
squishiness of the web I love that term
by Brad frost where it's like everything
is squishy you have no idea about the
resolution you've know about the pixel
density and so on and so forth I'm
actually listing this right now so here
are the things that are beyond your
control on the web and there's nothing
you can do about that you can stomp your
foot you can
get very angry you can tell your users
that they're idiots but it's not a good
business idea so the browser's of your
users are not in your control
every time you silico people should just
upgrade go on holiday and go to a
holiday like reception and try to print
out your tickets on a Mac from 2003 that
hasn't been changed since then you have
a better computer at home but you don't
have it with me with you in older
Android phones you've got a shitty
browser that you couldn't remove or
could replace with something else there
are environments where you cannot
control the browser and you cannot tell
people to use a developer browser ever
that's like 0.0 point 0.2 percent of the
market the resolution the pixel death
the color settings of the devices you
don't know that either their connection
reliability and speed like oh it looks
great in our office and then you try it
on a 3G phone and you're like oh I just
waited 50 seconds which nobody does on a
mobile phone three seconds is all you
have then people will either punch their
phone or tell you that I'm going to use
the competitor the connectivity
restrictive Ness resources may be
blocked like it main does ad blockers
but also on mobile on Cheaper mobile
connections in England they might
actually minify your JavaScript without
telling you the mobile phone provider
does that and the CSS provider does that
as well so your code gets changed by a
man-in-the-middle without you having a
chance to change anything about that
their font size and some needs like I'm
getting older as well I need bigger font
so you cannot tell me like 12 pixels is
enough especially not when I'm Chinese
and the lettering is like this big this
doesn't work the availability of
resources on their machines for your
product is too CPU already burning this
is happening all the time people like oh
this computer your website is so slow
while they're actually running some
WebGL renderer and like all kind of
conversions in the background the amount
of text content and image sizes in your
product because we always build these
great things that look great and then we
give it to a content management system
and people write like three teasers and
put like James Joyce's Ulysses in a
headline and like upload BMPs and these
kind of things because they haven't been
trained because we think maintenance is
done by people that should not get paid
much which is why they break all our
products all the time so in CSS it's the
job of the browser to perform well use
GPU
resources and skip functionality so a
CSS animation that isn't smooth gets cut
off by the browser and then is not an
animation just goes to the end of the
animation your own JavaScript animation
for example it's your job to test for
support to ensure that rendering
painting and reflows fast and to keep
your animation in think you have more
control but you have much more
responsibility as well and this is not a
responsibility we can go away from we
can not tell you our users should be
upgrading it should be better there
we're delivery service we get paid a lot
of money to do this so when somebody
whines about our end users not having
the right browser and I'm like what are
you getting paid for you're not getting
paid to be more effective you're getting
paid to actually build something that
works so people click on ads so people
buy things so people pay our wages so
our job is to build interfaces that work
so why do we constantly underestimate
CSS and overvalue the benefits of
JavaScript I have no idea minor model
might be might be historical thing I
don't know it is that in the olden days
browsers we're also technical term
and they basically didn't follow a
standard there was no standard that they
could follow and they competed with each
other on making things only for our
browser and these things never went away
so these things are still on the web and
people still do support them although
they should not anymore Internet
Explorer is dead and basically good
riddance
don't give it anything it's for it can't
swallow given HTML look at the basic CSS
to display something on top of each
other if the main use case of your
website works in those all browsers
people are happy don't give internet
explorer 6 users beautiful interfaces it
just confuses them they're not used to
beauty they're not used to to
interactivity they're just they like
their drop boxes and their radio buttons
and hope that when something clicks
something happens all the internal
systems we have to use in Microsoft for
starters so CSS had a bumpy history it
initially was very limited and was just
there to replace things like background
color and font elements and like table
layouts and our lines and centers at hrs
and all the things that are graphical
and HTML which would have never
and then we have patchy browser support
and very odd errors without debugging
options debugging back then was put an
alert on everything and hope you find
some information out of it
we didn't have developer tools like we
have nowadays we had a massive champion
functionality when iPhone became a thing
in Apple called the shots when Apple
said like html5 is the future and here's
all the cool stuff that WebKit can do in
CSS cool I was really excited I was
really pissed off as well because it
wasn't standardized but it was
everything only for WebKit so when we
released edge when I was part of that
team we had to put a lot of bugs of
other browsers in a new browser not to
break the web because developers relied
on on experimental functionality when
something had a CSS prefix you got no
control over that
that company completely changed to look
and feel and functionality of that and
you have to keep up that's why it's
called experimental in experiments
people die sometimes we don't pixel
should get shifted around but it's still
a weird thing to rely on and lots of
problems with browser walls around
prefixes so oh we have this you should
use our browser or browser does that you
should use our browser and luckily
enough all browser makers grew up about
this and we realize that killing each
other is not going to happen browsers
are not important nobody makes money
with the browser have you ever paid for
a browser ok opera was a browser you had
to pay for sometimes like an ad blocking
browser on a mobile phone people would
pay for but browsers are a means to an
end to bring services to end-users
chrome is not by Google because they
want to sell a browser it's for you to
use Google services and get search
results and they get money for showing
search results it's a way for you to use
services of Google much like edge is set
for Microsoft much like Safari is that
for Apple browsers are there to display
content so it doesn't matter what what
you think is the best one people will
probably use the one that comes with
their machine and no none other they
don't even know what the browser is up
until now recently there was no layout
modules so packed we just use tax by
positioning and absolute positioning or
floating and that was always a very
confusing point for people who are not
graphically inclined and absolute
positioning was easy but absolutely
terrible because soon as you change the
font size and you didn't use EMS
everything overlaid each other and you
could
use the interface any longer so our
solution was always to patch with
JavaScript because in JavaScript we had
to control we never had in CSS
I can read out how wide the browser is I
can even read out what font size was
used
I can read out the color I can use
generated content I can use all things
to know what's happening and JavaScript
has this wonderful if statement well
it's like if it worked then show it if
not do something about it and CSS this
if statements always implied for the
browser by us so we created HTML we
applied styling and we did all kind of
fixes with all the polyfills that like
when one browser had functionality and
the others didn't we put the polyfill
into all of them had the functionality
but we never took the polyfill out when
these browser cease to exist or even be
here being supported that's why we have
lots of lots of JavaScript on the web
that's unnecessary
but CSS has been going leaps and bounds
in the last few months and years and a
lot of times we just gave up on it
because we just see this common
denominator of the specter of IE 9 and
everything else is not usable yet so
evergreen browsers are a thing and
they're a very important thing something
like something like want to cry and
ransomware shows me that we have to keep
our software up-to-date all the time
because the bad guys are faster in
abusing it than we are in apply it in
supporting it browser tooling gives
detailed insights I mean I get heap
analysis I get stack traces I get
everything in browsers nowadays I know
why something is slow I know why
something wasn't applied support is well
documented can I use dot com is your
friend this is a really really amazing
website that shows you which browser
supports what and why it doesn't support
it and what the errors are and where to
pitch that people should complain it
should fix it so don't go on Twitter and
say like oh this browser is terrible the
other one is better go to these bug
references go file a bug go upload a bug
go upload a system because that's what
our engineers are sitting of all browser
makers support channels and bug tracking
is available for almost all browsers I'm
saying almost all browsers I'm not
mentioning names but Apple we have pre
processes like sass and less which have
turned up the heat to innovate the spec
faster most CSS people that are already
excited about CSS when
- laughs s quite some time ago because
you had mixed sense you had variables
you had all kind of really cool stuff
happening in there and much like jQuery
made us revisit and rethink what
JavaScript can do nowadays these
preprocessors made us rethink what CSS
can do as well on friday dell CSS stay
here actually in in amsterdam so there's
lots of good information coming out
there approaches like oo CSS body called
sullivan anatomic design by brad brad
frost allowed with more maintainability
of different components as well to make
CSS more maintainable in a large scale
rather than like a lot of repetition a
lot of problematic things that CSS was
there because it's really easy to write
a lot of CSS that doesn't get applied
and there's lots of tooling going around
that one now so I just want to list a
few amazing things that CSS can do now
and that you should consider using and
even if you don't consider using it know
that it exists and partner with somebody
who likes you SS and likes doing layouts
a biggest the biggest critic that I was
find with CSS is that everybody
complains about it because we're asked
to do it just say no plus say hey I'm a
database administrator I'm like a
full-stack developer what the hell
should I have to do with CSS this is
something an interface person that cares
about interfaces and knows users and
knows browsers should do we have if you
get fired
Microsoft is hiring you know like we
have nothing to lose right now but we
try to take on all the jobs that are not
ours to do so why should you give
yourself that grief that you don't want
to play with simple things like
calculated CSS values you've probably
heard about this or put your hand up if
you haven't that it would be interesting
to see it's say for example you have an
input box where you want to have the
input box too full to fill the whole
thing and and also have some padding
around and you also have some padding
around is always the issue with that
isn't it so what you normally did was
like a width of 98% and then you hope
the 1% is enough but as percentage is
always off the parent element if the
parent element has no space anymore
there's no padding at all in there so
what you do instead is you do a width of
calc
100% - 1 a.m. 1 a.m. is one character so
you calculate what does 100% of that box
- 1 a.m. on which is 0.5 a.m. on each
side
what's red what what is the width of
that render that browser you don't have
to think about it you don't have to know
what that is the same way when you need
6 boxes next to each other you do a calc
100% divided by 6 of course you could do
that in your head or like put like lots
of lots of things in there but think of
the maintainer if the next maintainer
needs 8 elements in there he has to
change the number 8 not do the math in
their head again 100 percent divided by
8 means so calculations in CSS are the
first thing that went in there that made
see us as much more dynamic because
originally was never dynamic it was just
applied and that was it you cannot
change it in CSS itself these are
supported all over the shop except for
Opera Mini because Opera Mini is a is a
streaming browser that takes your HTML
CSS and JavaScript bundles it up into
one string and sends it down to the
browser this is actually ed to the end
users phone this is in countries where
connectivity is really really expensive
really really bad or if you're unrolling
and you must basically want to do that
so there's no way in Opera Mini to do
something after the page has been
rendered that's why all of these things
are not supported media queries are
another big thing that has been around
for ages now what media queries allow
you to do is apply different CSS
according to things that are happening
on the screen so if in this case if it's
a max width of 600 pixels then actually
don't display that sidebar element
because you only want to display it in a
law in a lower in a lower image in a
smaller smaller viewport you can do that
on link elements you could do that in
the styles itself and you can do things
like if it's portrait if it's landscape
if it's handheld if it's print these add
support are these add media queries are
very very powerful to only do things
when a certain thing is matched it can
get quite hard to maintain but we're
going to come back to that later because
there's a clever way of doing it but
they've been supported for ages in every
single browser so don't just try to read
out in JavaScript how wide the screen is
use a media
for that because it's much more reliable
and there's not a browser that doesn't
support it except for i IE 10 is dead as
well so it's all good there's also a
sister property in javascript for that
called match media which i don't see
people using a lot so the problem is CSS
media queries is that even if you have
like okay you got 12 images in there
saying like if it's 2000 pixels show
that image if it's for the pixel show
that and so on and so forth that the
browser loads all of them and then only
displays one of them if you use match
media in JavaScript instead and then
create the image and and replace a
smaller image with it then you don't
have that problem but again this is a
this is a way we should use a picture
element in HTML instead because we have
those right now but this is an example
to make sure that things only get loaded
when they need to and you have something
smaller that gets replaced by something
prettier media queries with match media
are an interesting thing as well
generated content is something that we
keep under estimating and it's a very
strange one because originally I looked
at the HTML document the HTML is in
there and CSS didn't do anything with it
it just added colors it added form so
that it made it look differently but
didn't change the content of the element
itself but sometimes you want content
that is not in the HTML and that it's
just a nice to have or a pretty thing to
do that you want don't want to type all
the time and this what generated content
comes in so an example here is these cue
elements where you want to have the
quotes in the beginning and the end so
there's a blue one and a red one don't
succeed in screen but it's just like you
do cue before and cue after and you
create the content that way so what that
one gives you is a styling handle to do
something extra on that element that
only makes sense in a styling
environment but has no value a blind
user doesn't care if that's a blue or a
red quote as long as they know that it
is a quote and they know that by using
the cue element whereas like you don't
want to maintain that in JavaScript you
don't want to maintain that in the HTML
with a span with the with the carries in
it because they're unnecessary they're
only necessary when it's a visual thing
to display and people use that for all
kind of wild things there's a great
website called a sea
a single dip calm and they do these kind
of things these are all one diff element
using CSS gradients using drop shadows
using all kind of stuff in CSS and
generated content around them so you can
create really really complex visual
things without having to change your
HTML without using any JavaScript at all
if you have somebody in CSS who knows
their stuff and these are nice to see
sometimes they're really horrible to
actually in terms of complexity when you
start scrolling the screen and stuff so
these are nice to show people the power
of them but use them sparingly because
you don't want to have like an image of
like an extra one and every paragraph or
something like that again support it all
over the browser the browser front yes
there's no excuse not to use generated
content when it makes sense because
these are things that are visually nice
to have why should they be maintained in
a content management system why should
they be maintained in JavaScript oh
that's such a shame
okay here we go ooh animations and
transitions and you know where I'm going
with this these are powerful don't use
them too much don't get too excited
about all the cool things you can do
with animations cause they're expensive
not in terms of dollars but in Friends
of CPU power and GPU power and they're
also very distracting so somebody with a
learning disability for example with
blinking and animating and rotating
things but be impossible for them to to
use your content and you don't want to
be too frivolous with it as well because
if you gotta cutesy animation that
something Falls when something goes
wrong if I see that for the tenth time I
start not trusting your company anymore
about its thing you take at the pace
rather than helping me so animations and
transitions have been a defined in the
standard for quite a while and my
favorite is transitions because just by
having a transition of transform one
second nine thirteen here you make
everything smoother so the demo that I
feel that I wrote at like eight years
ago or something instead I did a did a
little element that when you click
somewhere on the page it puts a ball
there and when you click again to it it
moves smoothly from one to the other
because of that transition I could have
done that in JavaScript but I didn't
need to just by putting a transition on
something it goes
from one way into the other and if the
browser doesn't support it it just goes
to the end of that animation nobody gets
hurt
and nobody has to load a lot of
JavaScript and actually do a for loop
and changing and re rendering and
refreshing and repainting every - every
time because that runs on the GPU by the
browser picked for you
animations is the same thing you have an
animation duration animation names and
you have keyframes where in the simplest
way you do like a from tutu but you can
do like a zero percent one percent two
percent and so on and so forth
this always drives me nuts because
there's a JavaScript developer I always
want to put a colon after the from or
the - but it's not the CSS syntax so
that's one thing that are but fair
enough I'm just don't have a life
animations are pretty amazingly
supported and they're actually doing
their job well there's also a web
animation API in JavaScript if you want
to have frames per second control if you
want to have keyframe control if you
want to remove and add keyframes
accordingly but again this means you're
responsible to make that thing work in
this case the browser jumps through
hoops bends over backwards and bakes
your cookie to actually make this
animation happen and you don't have to
worry about it because if it doesn't
happen it still is not in the way of the
end user whereas if your JavaScript
animation in the for loop gets slow and
eats up all the resources you have a
half-finished animation you never want
to see a half-finished animation on the
web they're supported everywhere again
intercept for Opera Mini because of the
reasons that I said before the
interesting thing about animations and
transitions is that the interaction with
JavaScript is via events so it fires
events while it's actually before it's
happening while it's happening and after
it's happening so you can you can do
like you can chain animations that way
or it can react on animation when
something was finished I wrote a few
games that just use that that basic was
like one big event handler that just
listened to the end of an animation
because at the end of the animation you
hear you get the name of the animation
and which element was animated so that
way you can easily sync your animations
and create a new one by applying a class
to a parent element for example
viewport units are a super nice thing to
think about and the biggest problem we
have with typography on the web is that
things need to be readable but screens
might be completely different size and
we don't know what the size of the
screen is so viewport units are new you
newish units in CSS that are not pixels
that are not EMS but they're actually
called V W and V H so a viewport width
is a percentage of the full viewport
width 480 pixel wide screen 10 V W is 10
percent or 48 pixels the difference
between 10 percent and 10 V W is that
percentage is the percentage of the
parent element V W is the percentage of
the window so if I now have a div inside
a div inside a div inside a div where I
do a 10% it becomes 10 percent 10
percent of 10 percent 10 percent of
tempers and it gets smaller and smaller
the more you nested whereas a VW will
always stay no matter how nested your
HTML elements are in this page viewport
height is the same for the viewport
height of the browser and viewport as
many things as the viewport as the
document height does the browser hide so
viewport is basically what's visible in
the screen right now so that way you can
use these things to do like sticky
footer sticky headers navigation such
that they're always wide enough to
actually see things then this viewport
minimum which is a percentage of the
viewport width or height whichever is
smaller and so for example 10 V pin is
10% of the current viewport width in
portrait or 10 percent of view port
heiden landscape so you don't want to do
different layouts for that you just use
V bin you use V Max for the other way
around so percentage of the viewport
width or height whichever is larger what
you can do with this is like really
really simple a typography that's
readable so again you use the calcutta
explained up front where you say like
font size calc 16 pixels plus 1 VW so
your font will always be 16 pixels no
matter what the resolution is plus
what's extra available so on bigger
screens that will be bigger on smaller
screens it will be smaller which means
the length of the sentence stays the
same
which is how we
as humans you then do a line height
where you have like the vertical measure
as well and then you probably want to do
something like at one point 2 a.m. and 3
BW for an h1 and if it gets too big if
the X VDD website is really huge then
stop it at 50 pixels because you don't
want to have a 3,000 or in this case a
3,000 by 2,000 resolution but a 400
pixel header that's just far too much
space use just for the headline so what
it looks like in a browser is like if
you resize the browser the font always
stays readable no matter what the screen
is in this case we didn't limit the
length of it so that sentence length is
not the thing but you can see like it's
not becoming too big it's not becoming
too small it always stays readable and
it's a very simple way of doing that
rather than having to do that in
JavaScript or whatever we try to do in
the past a quick thing about this every
CSS developer and every JavaScript
developer keeps doing this we keep
resizing our screens to watch our
different like media queries being
applied we shift things around nobody
ever does that so if there's problems in
between the different sizes while they
are changing don't care and users have a
resolution and they don't resize their
browsers all the time and see and so
they can break it only developers and QA
people do that so make sure that the
thing works in a certain state but the
in-betweens are not that important so
when people do media queries with like
500 break up breakpoints this is
actually not helping anybody make it as
simple as possible the less code we put
on a web the better viewport units are
supported in all browsers Edge has the
problem that v min and v max is not
supported yet please go and complain to
us about this that we fixed that it's in
the making but we need more people to do
it that's a general thing if you think's
if you see something not supported
complain complain complain or even
better use it use it in production show
us how your website is terrible because
we're not supporting it so the more we
actually get real use cases of the web
rather than like oh this should be
because the other browser
the more we actually can put engineers
out and actually get them onto the job
we also a software company like Google
is also a software company so far is a
software company we have a limited
amount of resources we don't have a
cloning machine for developers we
actually have to apply make developers
do things that are important
now flexbox talking about flexible boxes
god an Xbox is basically what you always
wanted CSS to do and you never come you
never wanted to understand this is what
we did with layout tables so you can do
almost everything in a horizontal or
vertical display of of an element so in
this case there's a massive Divya or
it's actually the body and you can do
like align these things to the left to
the top to the bottom to put the space
in between them put the space around
them align them all to the left align
them all the things change their order
so the order they were in HTML does not
mean necessarily the order that they're
being displayed on the on the page my
personal blog does that for my header up
there I mean I have my picture in the
middle of it and detects around it but
in HTML its first my picture and then
the text so the order for a blind user
makes total sense for a visual user they
get a nice interface when there's enough
space on the screen and if not it just
falls back to a list of links again so
flexbox is the thing to use if you want
to actually align things in a certain
view port or if you want to align things
in a certain other element it's the
better replacement for absolute
positioning in a relatively position
element we had before there's a great
game if you want to play with it if you
want to learn how to order that's one
manner that I do teaching for children
flexbox logging is called you basically
change the code around to jump to put
the frogs on to these lily pads so you
learn the syntax of flexbox that way
there's a great talk by a local hero Zoe
Zoe Gillenwater she two years ago she
actually spoke at Smashing Kampf about
this that's her on Twitter where she
actually shows how booking.com is using
flexbox and back tenon was my room I God
use flexbox already nowadays they don't
even bother anymore saying it but she
also shows how
it folds back to sensible interface and
when flexbox not supported rather than
jumping through hoops and doing all kind
of positioning flexbox is again
supported by all browsers except for ie
and that's done now if you want to go
even Wilder CSS grid CSS grid is a is
the coolest thing right now in CSS
because every talk every conference is
about CSS grid I thought about talking
about CSS grid exclusively today here
but then again I thought it might bore
people if we only talk about one thing
CSS grid is much like flexbox insofar
that you define a grid in your page and
then you position elements around it but
it is so flexible it's incredible what
you can do with it you can name the
lines you can change the order of the
grid elements around you can shift
things in them so instead of me going
through lots of syntax and showing you
what it's done there's a great resource
called grid by example which gives you
copy and paste layouts if you want to
use CSS grid and it also gives you video
tutorials what they mean and how they
function and how they interactively
change around so it if light defines
what the fr unit means what a repeat
notation is and so on and so forth the
notation can look a bit daunting but
once you got a head around it it's
actually incredibly powerful and if you
don't want to learn it fine just
understand that this is there you don't
need a CSS grid system like 960 CSS or
whatever others we had out there because
browsers support that now again there's
a game as well if you want to learn it
called CSS grid garden where you have to
move the water to water the carrots and
that's pretty amazing as well - great
talks - look about that I mean I'm
pushing stalks here because I get this
stuff recorded I spend time writing my
talks all this is for free on the
web use it use these things to teach
yourself new things rather than asking
your boss to go to a CSS grid training
these things are available download the
videos sit down in the office with a
coffee and cookies watch one of those
talks with your colleagues and then
discuss how you can use it in production
why not so CSS grid layout by Rachel
Andrews she's been banging on about CSS
grid layout since four five six seven
eight years now and nobody believed her
but now we have it
and real art direction for the web by
Jen Simmons from Mozilla as well that is
another great talk to learn about the
power of the grid the interesting thing
about CSS grid is it was a it was a
Microsoft specification it was actually
first supported in ie8 I think and as it
was Microsoft nobody liked it grid
layout works everywhere it's it's still
prefixed in in some of the older II's an
edge but again we're working on that
because we actually have a few bugs in
the standard committee that need to be
fixed first disappointing here is
Android Browser and I have to look that
up I don't know why that is but this is
really bad like this kind of stuff I
don't want to have so why is there a
flex box and a grid they'd seem to be
doing the same thing right you align
something along a grid well
flex box was designed for layout in one
dimension either a row or column grid is
meant to be in two dimensions so you can
position things everywhere whereas like
flex box is there to layout one element
according to what you say it should be
doing so grid should use flexbox for its
integrates as well so that's not a bad
idea they don't work to date their work
together they don't work against each
other now CSS custom properties is the
last thing that I want to talk about and
they're the really really cool thing
that finally isn't CSS as well when
people started using sass instead of CSS
they wanted variables they wanted to
define a company color and then use use
company color and not know what the
company color is because if it changes
every two months I have to do a search
and replace and all my CSS I have to
find the things that is not fun to do so
what custom properties do is allow you
to do a - - first color and then you
call it with var - - first color that
could be any CSS or any Content that is
a valid way of defining something in CSS
that you can start reusing and one
powerful thing to think about in this
case is like you saw calc before what if
I want to calculate on a calculation
I cannot nest calc in CSS because that's
not what a CSS syntax is meant to do but
I can use variables for that so I can
say with a is 100 pixels and with B is
the calculation of VAR a - with
of the width a divided by two with C is
a calculation of the of the width B
divided by two and then you set the
width to R with C so you can nest a
calculations using custom properties but
that's only the tip of the iceberg
custom properties really really make a
lot of sense in CSS because they allow
you to name things that you weren't able
to name before and to reuse things
across your CSS that you don't want to
have the same way in ten different
places that's like bad coding so if you
want to learn everything about that one
layer Beru gave an incredible talk CSS
rables of our subtitle where she goes
through all the things gives you like
ten takeaways she wrote a big blog post
about it as well so for example in this
case I've got a gutter of two pixels on
the root element and in a section I say
like margin gutter so that gives me two
pixel margin around all the section
elements but if the min width of
thousand is then the gutter should be
ten pixels so you can really find those
variables and overwrite them inside a
media query inside a calc inside all the
if statement II things that we have in
CSS so that's a very powerful way to
define something and reuse it rather
than like knowing the value all the time
they're well supported in in all
browsers ie 11 doesn't do them at all
and I actually don't know what the edge
problem is right now but I wouldn't be
worrying about it too much they will go
away as well I have to look that up CSS
feature queries are a thing that is
basic and if statement for CSS so you
can do a if add supports animation name
test then we know the browser supports
animations and we can start defining the
key frames so that way you never have
keyframes that are just unnecessary in
your CSS in this case and you make sure
that all the things are supported right
now you can also do a not supported so
you add support not is then the things
that the browser doesn't do so you give
a fallback for the browsers that are
worse but this is kind of crazy because
you're actually building for the past
you're building for a thing that is
becoming your maintenance job rather
than the browser makers
making sure that their browser support
these things feature query supporter in
all browsers but ie because there's no
new features for ie anyways now we
talked about CSS and JavaScript so like
why do I use one or the other I always
think it's a very very powerful thing to
make them work with each other
javascript is there for me to interact
for a to to react to what people have
done to my page or to react what data
came in what things have been loaded and
CSS is there then to define the
interface that gets rendered in the
browser without me not having to know
how the browser handles it so of course
the old school was JavaScript CS as an
HTML all have to do different things and
when you work in a space like a react
component when you work in a space that
is a modular environment and this is all
out of the window I mean you're already
relying on a on client side routing
you're already relying on an interface
that gets built not the way HTML was
meant to be built so in the case of in
the case of modules you have a button
that needs to have its JavaScript its
CSS and HTML only for that button cuz
you want to reuse it across the page
without other styles bleeding into it
and this is not where CSS is excelling
there's standards coming we've been
trying it it's not really that easy but
when you look at like web components and
you look at componentized systems like
react or angular it does this under the
hood so I'm not saying that CSS can
solve everything but I think when it
comes to page layouts when it comes to
document when it comes to full
applications rather than module driven
applications where you know it CSS and
JavaScript working together really
really does the job and you use CSS when
you can using the things that I just
showed you don't read out inner inner
width of a browser anymore you don't
need this we've got lots of CSS to deal
with that kind of issue if you need to
communicate with CSS consider changing
custom properties because you can change
them on the fly
and if that's not an option apply
classes to parent elements using class
lists with class lists now not class
name anymore that's very powerful as
well and as a very last resort you can
also the style directly but this is a
very very bad way of interact
with the browser and is actually in most
cases intercepting the browsers
rendering so again from that talk
elements target property value - - who
gets the property from inline style get
computed style get property value gets
it from wherever and you can set a
variable on the inline style with
JavaScript as well so what can you do
with this is so powerful you can do all
the things that JavaScript can do that
CSS cannot do and give it to your CSS to
do something with an example that she
has in that talk is that you have a
mouse move and on the mouse movement
gives me the mouse X and mouse Y and
creates a custom property in CSS so in
any CSS I can now position things at the
mouse pointer without having to do that
in JavaScript any longer which we used
to do since the HTML days so this
functionality becomes available to CSS
and my CSS just us the rendering for me
and this was impossible to do before we
had custom properties so if you do like
like a translate X - - Mouse X VAR ax -
- Mouse X and translate Y - - miles Y
you actually position the thing where
the mouse is right now and every time
the browser everytime the mouse gets
moved this custom property gets updated
and CSS renderer does the job for you
every style change has consequences
though so if you start messing around
with styles not the custom properties
but like with high position blah the
browser needs to do something it has a
great website called CSS triggers by
Paul Lewis and drummer from Google that
did all the research for you to say like
what gets affected by which thing so
make sure that when you wonder why why
your interface is really really slow
that's a great resource to tell you
what's happening under the hood and by
the browser is actually starting to
start the fan and gets annoyed with you
so CSS is much more reliable than it
used to be and in the CSS in the w3c
specifications any of them is defined as
users over authors over implementers
over specifiers over theoretical purity
so what comes at the end of your end
user is what needs to be bulletproof
so if CSS can take a lot of pain away
from you consider using CSS rather than
having the full control over the
interface
javascript because then you also have
full responsibility our users user
interfaces that are smooth reliable and
don't kill their batteries that's the
biggest issue in mobile so consider
Sears as a bit more you can be lazy and
you can build on the work of the
community there's a huge community
around CSS discussing fixing building
things for you there's a lot of stuff
that you can use which I've done here to
a degree as well because here's a few
super inspiring and highly active CSS
folk if you want to know what's going on
and see is that here's a list of people
that I follow and I will write them up
in a blog post as well that inspired me
a lot to give this talk so there's Chris
Collier who does CSS tricks calm it's
basically the best website right now to
find out what's going on in the bleeding
edge world of CSS application not
standards but how to actually use CSS
Rachele andrew is simply goddess of CSS
grids on a two-door does a lot of math
animations with CSS only they're not
really that useful but they're really
really pretty and show you the power of
what CSS can do in animations can do we
love Anna because her stuff is so brutal
to the browser that we actually we're
testing our CSS engines against it to
make them faster so that's a very very
nice her code plan is really really
exciting to look at Iria darydary know
chrome is a newcomer she actually does
that bits of code blog where there's
lots of very simple explanations of new
stuff that's happening in CSS and also
in JavaScript so a Gillenwater has said
before that the best talks on flex box
and she's local here in amsterdam brad
frost dusty does the atomic design stuff
rachel neighbors is a colleague of mine
she's actually here today and speaks at
on friday
she's an animation expert CSS animations
and web animations unik robert
talked a lot about about blend modes of
CSS and filters of CSS and also lately a
lot about UJS and doing graphical
animations in CSS layer roux is
basically as i said she she always takes
one CSS thing and makes a one-hour talk
out of it that that analyzes it to the
nth degree and explains to you how to
use it she can get very strong with
people one day when they communicate
with her about like why's that thing I
should be using
but her talks are really really
informative and really exciting to
listen to she's a researcher for MIT so
she's very thorough in her research
about her stuff sorrow Sweden is a
developer from Lebanon and she did the
layout for a smashing home for the newer
Smashing Magazine for that million kids
they have a lot of talks about all the
details that they put in there and all
the things how they make it work very
flexibly very accessible that's the
exciting person to follow as well
Sarah Dresner is is again a writer for
CSS Twix and she's been around for quite
a while as a developer that you see is
always in a way that is very scaling to
all kind of users and all kind of
products and Jen Simmons is working
Mozilla and she talks a lot about art
design on the web using all kind of new
technologies so as a lot of people to
follow interest listen in on they always
send cool stuff around so think about
that when you're thinking about CSS and
that's all I got time for so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
