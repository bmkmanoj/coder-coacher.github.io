speak louder if I'm not speaking loud
enough let me know that if you fall
asleep let me know so what I'm going to
do is is called the challenge of change
if you read my introduction this is what
we're going to be kind of referring to
i'm going to give you just i might as
well let you know okay i'm not an IT
person so this is my presentation it's
very basic it's very simple and even may
even have a mistake or two but I'm not
an IT guy so where I started was I do
work with computers i worked with
computers at for about 15 years and it's
not just writing letters i do a kind of
a training it's called biofeedback and i
do brain mapping and it uses computers
and i started 15 years ago and then
trying to install the stuff 15 years ago
we stayed up all night and I had an IT
guy in so i have i have a taste of it
where I really got involved in this area
of IT and was a couple of years ago I
did a pilot project that's my claim to
fame i did a pilot project at Google and
that's where i got involved in the eye
gel when I walked into google and i saw
guys walking around in t-shirts and
shorts and floppies and stuff and had
they had smiles on their faces I thought
it was so cool it was like a breath of
fresh air to me and I had to know more
and so what i did was i think it was
about a year and a half ago i decided
i'm going to i'm going to start an
organization called new because i have
to learn about this new stuff i have to
learn about this scrum stuff and the
Kanban stuff and all these terms I had
to learn about this stuff so I met with
a couple of other guys another guy who
was an IT fellow and we started this
organization and then I met somebody who
was also an IT scrum guy Peter Stevens
and we started talking and and Peter he
invited me to this thing called he was
going to meet with a bunch of people and
it was called Stokes and stoves and talk
about all kinds of stuff about i.t stuff
and that's where I ended up so it's been
it's it's been learning a lot I've read
a gazillion books and it's been a quite
a journey and just last week I was up in
tolland at the less 2012 conference it
was a it was another IT conference and
we had some fantastic speakers there
just blew me away and I'm looking
forward to the change that's happening
now in the business world we're going
from the old waterfall approach command
and control over to a new approach and I
think it's exciting and we have to keep
it going what we're going to be talking
about in some way today is perspectives
now some of you may be heard this story
I guess it was some time ago I was with
my wife in a restaurant and there was a
woman in the restaurant and and I happen
to notice our look at her my wife
noticed and the woman was doing a lot of
drinking and my wife said John who is
she I said well she's an old girlfriend
of mine and when we broke up she hasn't
stopped drinking since and my wife said
well that's funny I heard that she has
to stop drinking because she's been
celebrating for the whole time so it's
it's about perspectives that's what I
want to talk about it's about a state of
mind and how we look at things now what
I want to ask you and you can be pre
honest here has anybody gone to work
let's say having the flu
anybody been sick when they've gone to
work Oh only a few have gone to work
sick okay all right come on stick up
your hands let's relax oh there you go
look at everybody's gone to work sick
okay has anybody gone to work hungover
Wow now we're really getting honest has
anybody gone to work or have to have to
work with somebody they really don't
like hmm has anybody have to work with
the opposite gender and have a
difficulty understanding them well that
was everybody was careful not answer
where do I go on here let me see what
else have we got has anybody had to work
with an old guy or a young guy and they
just don't seem to get it there you go
we got the old guys the young guys I
thought what the young guys really be
sticking up their hands what I'm trying
to say to you is that we're all
different we all have different
perspectives the way we look at things
we all have different minds we're all
different and I just wonder how do we
survive how do we survive when we have
so many differences we go into an office
and we have so many differences I just
don't understand how can we survive how
do we produce things how do we get along
it's amazing that we get week we
accomplished what we do in the past how
was done was as we talked about command
and control the old the old way was do
what you're told we go into the work and
everybody does what they're told I even
worked it in the office and they were
saying you don't bring your problems to
work we all do but you just go to work
and that
what you do but today it's changed we're
having a shift going on and we have
models we've created models on how to
deal with the differences we have all
kinds of models then we have models like
scrum and what they're doing is that
they're helping people to organize to
work together but we're not only
changing the way we work we're changing
the way we live and that's what's going
on right now it's a whole shift it's not
just work it's the way we live I have
that on my business card so when I made
changes it's affected my life it's a
mentality it's a state of mind we're
changing our minds as we work someplace
else and as a result we're changing our
perspectives no has anybody said oh he's
in his comfort zone he's not changing or
has anybody said that about you boy
everybody can say that everybody okay
all right nobody's ever said that he's
in a comfort zone I know I have in the
past oh he's in his comfort zone now
that's very judgmental as far as I'm
concerned and and I heard in the
conference when we're up in tolland
people started talking about patterns
and that's what it's all about it's not
about it's not like I decide and I'm in
a really a mess and I say I'm in a mess
I'm really in a pile of here and
I'm going to stay here it's comfortable
for me I'd love to be here I love to be
in this mess
the brain pattern it's a state of mind
we're there it's developed okay so if i
go back to all those questions i asked
you it has nothing to do with people
coming into work and having to want to
be in that situation that's the way they
are and that's what we need to begin to
learn to do is start accepting people
for what they are now my question to you
is can we change the patterns now what
are patterns now I work with the brain
and I've been working with the brain for
15 years I'm not any smarter but anyways
I work with the brain for 15 years and
what I do know is we that we have
patterns and what these patterns are is
neurons their pathways and they develop
you ever heard hardwired our brains are
hard-wired and can we change these
patterns can we exactly it's very
difficult well yes we can do it
so what I want to talk to you today is
what I want to do is I want to
depersonalized the situation I want to
depersonalized and saying instead of
saying somebody is in the comfort zone I
can say oh he's got a specific brain
pattern I get away from judging i start
to understand you see I've got to work
with people we have to understand so
what I want to do is that we need to
understand this thing up here sometimes
we just think it just happens people are
the way they are you know but we have
our brains function a certain way and
what we have isn't then I work with the
brain and I do this thing called brain
maps and I look at being patterns and
then I sometimes change them so what we
have is I put it I cannot put electrode
here okay and that's what that's what I
see it just measures and it's measuring
right here my brain when it's
functioning thinking it's producing a
brain wave right there now what's what's
made up in that isn't as a variety of
brainwaves okay and I'll show you what
type of brain frequencies we can produce
we can produce a delta and delta is this
it measured for to hurt anybody
understand the tricity ever better Stan
electricity the waves go like that
that's frequency so there's four of
those within a measured period of time
and when somebody has a lot of Delta and
their eyes are open they're basically
they can be asleep with their eyes open
I'm sure you've seen some people like
that it's like hello anybody home theta
theta is this issue of concentration and
you've heard of people having
concentration issues and we try to help
them to be more focused or some people
when they meditate they go into there
they go into their theta they try to get
deep they're still kind of awake though
alpha everybody's heard of alpha there's
alfa romeo those alpha this and there's
alpha that and that measuring 8 to 11
relax reflective open
and awareness beta twelve to eighteen
now that's the concentration one and in
what we learned a long time ago there's
a strip across the head if you're
concentrating you're producing these
frequencies here and then this high beta
I got it I got a you know pretty cold
there 19 to 40 that's the high alert
anxious busy are you know those type of
guys you know they're really full of
anxiety and you can't stop the can't
stop the keg go to sleep so what happens
when you are in your high bid and I want
to take a look at the two the two high
beta and this what when is called
parasympathetic and alpha so I want to
tell you about the lion I want you to
imagine the lion in Africa and he's
sitting underneath the tree but his eyes
are open and he's looking on then a
gazelle his lunch goes walking by and
he's up and he's going after that
gizelle he grabs the Gazelle wrestles
him down starts eating it and then he
goes back underneath the tree again well
he's done he's gone from his alpha very
open and very aware and then he's gone
into his beta very focused doing the
task he's focused then here's the task
going back into his elf again what a
wonderful ability that this guy has he
can turn it on and turn it off at will
that cats are fantastic they fert they
did the first brain research using cats
they're wonderful so I want you to take
whoops back I told you I'm not IT down
here I want you to have a look at this
area down here what happens when
somebody is in this high beta it's a
high beta state they become very narrow
they have a narrow perspective
narrowly focused their detailed they're
busy they're negative they're fearful
there are aggressive so nowadays I don't
look at somebody and say boy he's a jerk
all right or he is comfort comfort zone
or whatever I don't judge them anymore I
can be open and I can see I get away
from judgment then the other side that's
the objective is open clear flexible
we're positive calm caring isn't that a
nice state to be in wouldn't you like to
be in that okay so can we change our
patterns what I'm going to show you and
I do a brain mapping and what we do is
we take a cap and we put it on and we
put there's 19 or 21 electrodes and then
we can take a picture of your brain and
it comes out and i'll show you how it
comes out it's really cool now the
psychological and medical business use
it to say this is what's wrong and they
try and find what's wrong the brain well
what I like to do it i like to look at
and say okay this is where i can improve
what can I fix and you can do that so
what we're going to see is a brain the
brain map of a war vet now what's really
important here is this part here it's
called the hide the high data and that's
that's that PTSD everybody ever hear of
PTSD post-traumatic stress syndrome okay
if you heard of that all right post your
message so this is what this person had
right here post traumatic stress
syndrome this is the way they work well
full of anxiety then they did some
training and some work and so on and you
can see this is the same person great
down here the high beta is gone ok this
is what school this is what's fantastic
this is what I love is that you can
change this person changed we're not
stuck this is not it you're just not who
you are and that's it you have the
ability to chain
I think that's the key that you've got
to grab on to there's no excuse you can
change so we can change our brain
patterns remember brain patterns are
what we call brain States or
personalities or whatever we can change
the patterns cool Oh anybody have any
ideas how we can do this wakey wakey
learn meditation good one exactly yeah
exactly yeah change your behavior but
how do you do that make other
experiences yeah how do you do that you
know there's there's how we say you know
this is what I was I've been spent two
and a half days in conferences and I
hear people saying this is what you
should be doing this is the way you
should be and I hear you know brain
conferences and all kinds of stuff how
great it would be but I'm saying okay
but how do you change week you know you
know that the states would bring you
anger and fearful then you're focused on
the fact that you are change
behavior then you can control yourself
well is it sorry but the the the wrong
word that you've used is control I don't
want to get too deep into this the
problem is controlled because when you
try to force something you become
focused on it you make it worse than
what it is he was talking about
meditation and it's a good process it's
very good and that's what we'll get to a
little bit later but that's kind of part
the answer what you commit to there you
go Jeff wake up this is it this is the
answer right there commit to a model
like scrum that's what it's all about
you see we are affected by our
environment okay so we get involved with
a model so we go to work we're affected
by our environment and you change you
you change your pattern you have two
issues here we are affected by our
environment and we have to learn to take
our lives into our hands and be able to
affect ourselves it's very simple
extremely simple now what I want to do
is get back to the working model here so
single tasking model rest task rest time
is not important here so we have rest
task rest pretty cool huh life would be
so simple by the way this is my model I
designed that all by myself
I'm so proud of that and you can see at
the bottom its copywriter to boy oh boy
now what are the states of mind during a
task so we're going to look at frequency
and then we're going to look at the time
and the rest period when that lying was
underneath the tree the rest period was
in the Alpha the beta is when somebody's
on task we're focused but in a very nice
state very focused doing their job and
then we have that uh hi bata that's the
killer that's that high anxiety stuff
and that's what a lot of people and that
is a major major problem today in
Western societies especial United States
anxiety it's a major problem people are
can't turn off at night they can't go to
sleep you know they wake up late I think
some of you might be aware of that you
know the problem though is the
multitasking and they have found that
multitasking is not good and this is why
jeez here I go again that was the stuff
I wanted to show you so cool you see
here what we're doing is we're doing the
multitasking in a high anxiety state
time and without any breaks it's
constant and what happens is and that's
what we have burnout that's what we have
rust out that's when we it just we can't
take it anymore so we have to learn how
we need to be able to to be able to stop
so we have crasher burnout and the mind
just sort of says up finished can't take
it anymore so the best thing is is to
have multitasking model with rest and
that's mine to copyright
did John stiff okay so rest task task
rest task so I'm getting some place here
really okay bear with me now I created a
model called self-sustainability way
back when when I was learning all about
agile and stuff I was talking to a guy
and he was a professor in forestry and I
was talking to him at the time about
sustainability and he's a John nobody
knows what sustainability means he's he
is did I used to work with people to try
and get them to stay on task to be
sustainable to sustain their attention
he said no John it's wrong forests
whatever need time they need brakes okay
to heal to re-energize we all need that
the forest need that the world needs
that and that's what's happening we're
not getting that so then I start
thinking I said well I just this agile
stuff they talk about retrospectives
that's pretty cool so they have times
where they kind of turn off and so
self-sustainability and I thought well
Jesus self-sustainability what I need to
do is learn because I'm focusing on the
person we need to take our lives in into
our own hands so when we are in a scrum
team we got to stop waiting for the
other person and stop blaming the other
person we have to take on that
responsibility self I need to look at
myself as a very valuable resource each
person and that scrum team is a valuable
resource and you have to realize that
about yourself and you have to learn how
to take care of yourself or else you
will burn out you will crap out
guaranteed so this is self this is again
my model self-sustainability it's mine
mine mine see so what are the benefits
and of these rest periods okay you will
re-energize you will heal you will rest
you will have awareness and the ability
to be retrospective to be reflective
because when you're down in that state
that bottom state and they're
retrospectives you have clarity you will
be able to look back when you're down on
that rest state you look back on the
previous work and the task with a
different perspective that's what's so
cool it's a brain pattern so I'm
changing I'm being flexible of my brain
pattern I'm changing from a high to a
lower brain pattern and then it changes
my perspective and you will be aware of
what part you played your responsibility
you will be able to look at yourself
when you are in that high focus narrowly
focused you cannot see anything your
focus like this you cannot see anything
outside you can't even look at yourself
as a result you will understand what the
other person needs and that's a key you
need to know what the other person needs
you need to change your open you need to
be open if you are a product owner and
you've got a narrow state of mind we're
talking about vision we've got to open
that up you will also improve your
ability to respond appropriately instead
of giving a very quick nasty response or
an impatient response you can learn how
to respond better communicate better and
you will change your patterns that's
your state of mind and thus your
perspective that's the deal
so multi tasking retrospective sprint
retrospective sprint retrospective it's
so cool these guys that put together
this agile stuff we're really on the
ball they were smart guys they're
talking about doing a retrospective here
when you're down the retrospective you
can look back at your task so I had love
these arrows here okay agile that's my
that's my interpretation so my focus a
lot has been on the retrospective that's
my focus and I've got mini or maxi what
you can do is you can do many
retrospectives you can take time during
the day and do a mini retrospective you
can do it 30 seconds turn off relax
change your brain pattern change your
state you will change your perspective
at the very beginning you may have to
practice more so you can practice learn
how to do it and the key issue in
retrospectives is is that we stay in the
busy state of mind what we're trying to
do is get away from the busy state of
mind so what do we want to do what's the
whole objective of this we want to
change your brain patterns that's the
goal that's simple we want to break the
patterns and that's what we're doing now
with with scrump we're changing the
pattern of business and how we replace
the old patterns with new patterns it's
so simple you know it really is and how
again how
it's through practice that's it when you
want to learn how to do something new
you gotta practice and you gotta
practice in your practice when you learn
how to play tennis or you want to be a
great tennis player if you want to be a
great musician you've got to practice
until you become the best and this is
what you're going to have to do at work
now we practice we train so scrum what
state of mind or pattern gets in the way
of being a great scrum product owner
anybody got any answers the Alpha
doesn't kill in the state no the biggest
state yeah but what what what is it what
what projects what prevents me from
being a great product owner what is what
is the objective okay you go exactly
exactly give a reward up okay that's the
point what state of mind or pattern gets
in the way of being a great scrum master
tell me I don't know I just only read up
on the product owner somebody tell me
what gets in the way of being a great
scrum master clink answer what do you
think what would you think somebody
already came upon it he all he did was
answer once and he got the answer
anybody have an idea what would come
what would prevent you if you're
becoming a great scrum master
exactly yeah yeahs it yeah okay what
would be the state about the pattern
that gets the way of being part of the
team what what would get in the way what
kind of pattern what is it what is it
we've already had some answers it's a
patterns it's our patterns it's the way
we think it's how we look at things go
ahead Oh wonderful exactly here right so
what does the product owner need to do
what kind of a pattern what kind of a
state of mind does he need to be in
what's what's what's he doing what's
what starts with v starts with v we
would have his main things he's got to
do that's the word we r / sentences i
read in the manual about being a product
owner vision right
is your way agree okay boy I tell you
okay what is the part he needs to be in
a state of mind it's a pattern because
he's got to create the vision if he is
in a negative narrow state of mind he's
not going to be able to create that
vision so it's before if you imagine in
the old days and the other and product
product managers there was a little bit
more of this doing and giving
regulations in the command of the
control right that's a more narrow state
of mind now we got to be we're changing
we're changing the whole thing we're
going over to an open state of mind
where we've got to practice being alpha
we've got to open up our we got to open
up our vision that is an alpha State all
right I'm not suggesting that we have to
walk around like we're smoking grass all
the time what I'm suggesting is that we
open up our vision we have to see we
have to be aware of what the customer
wants we want we have to yell and then
would then we have to go and convey it
we have to create the stories so as a
product owner I have to be a type of
person so I'm having to change I'm going
to have to change and if I change to
that type of person that is open and
flexible is it not going to affect my
whole life I can't be just this open
flexible guy working then go home and be
a real son of a gun can I or vice versa
I can't be a son of a gun to come to
work and be nice at home and you know
and then go I'm going to have to change
the way I live make sense ok so it's
what you're doing is you're getting
involved here with this whole new way of
life so the vision
now I love this ball it's my favorite
quote is from a friend of mine at at
Google and I was talking about some
stuff he had to change and stuff like
this dis what we're talking about he
says John I know what I have to do but I
just don't do it that's the crunch you
know there are things that I have to do
I do kind of like a meditation I hate
using that word meditation because it
makes me look like a monk or something
you know what I do is I do brain calming
alright get up in the morning and I'm
you know the white hair I'm a little bit
older now yeah and I bladder doesn't
work so well so i get up at five o'clock
the morning so then on my eyes are like
this and I hot cheese then I start
thinking so I sit down I do some
breeding stuff and I calm right down and
it's so cool and it's amazing out
sometimes what happens is all of a
sudden everything becomes so clear and
i'm sitting down and I'm writing I'm
going up and down i read get a piece of
paper and write then i go back i sit
down do I have to get back up again the
ideas are just a flowing it's so cool
and it's how I relate to people it
everything it's amazing though but so
I'll go back to sleep and sometimes I
say oh I'll I'll remember it tomorrow
morning you know it's okay then I go
back to bed i have a sleep and I wake up
in the morning I'm kind of going what
was that I can't remember what it is so
I have to write down but that's because
by time I to get from the morning my
wife is up she's nagging at me a little
bit and I get in my defensive mode you
know I'm in a different state of mind
you know more narrowly focused and I've
left that I've left that open focus
alright so sometimes what I have to do
is when she's negative me I kind of go
to another room goal you know but it's
all about relationships you know it but
it's about me taking my life into my
hands so what does it take to get
motivated what does it take you can go
in and get take a course and you can
become a scrum master you can become a
product owner but you got to get
motivated you just can't you just don't
come in
the course and all of a sudden you're a
great product owner it's a change of
life you're going to have to learn what
does it take it all takes a supportive
environment and that's what you get with
scrum that's a whole I did you get
support from the environment and the
other side is to trade off you give it
back but I don't think about what I'm
going to get I don't want to touch that
but look we need some structure and some
guides now when I come home from work at
night I have my keys and I put the keys
on a hook if I don't put the keys on the
hook I lose them about you get up in the
morn you can't find your keys so I have
a hook I need the hook you see I'm not
perfect I'm a human being I'm very
imperfect so I need some structure and
guidance in my life now I complain a
little bit about my wife but she gives
me some guidance sometimes and she tells
me kind of keeps me on the road so this
is what we need to do with scrum we need
guidance I need some I need some
structure it's nice but sure we have the
open and self organizing stuff but I
really do need some guidance so as a
product owner this is what I'm going to
be doing I need to give people guidance
I need to be in that state of mind I
need to have that brain pattern and what
we're doing is we're getting a trail
that's the whole idea it's so cool about
the team it were all helping each other
and commitment you need to make that
commitment you just don't go in and say
okay well I'm going to do it a little
bit of it you know if you're going to
become a product owner become a good
product owner do whatever it takes
to become a good product owner it's you
don't wait for somebody to say that you
take the course and then I I know all
that stuff it's living it it's making
that commitment so when I change my life
I made the changes I made a commitment
but if I there was times when I didn't
make the commitment I said I'll do a
little bit of this and I'll be like I
didn't go anywhere I bumbled along for a
long time and I finally said okay I'll
do it their way hmm and then when I did
it worked now there's all kinds of
models you know there's the can down
there scrum there's all kinds of them
all you need to do is make a commitment
to one of the models and work it and
it'll work for you and I'm not doing
this too and think in promoting scrum so
that I can be called back and do a
speech again what I'm doing is that I
believe this make a commitment to
something you're in here with scrum it's
cool huh courage I mentioned in the in
our announcement it was courage it takes
huge courage to change big time because
in that process in that learning process
i'm also going to have to look at myself
and say hmm what did i do wrong we go
back to the retrospective so cool these
guys really had it done they make this
opportunity where we can start looking
back on the mistakes that we've made
rather than just sort of looking forward
and being afraid of mistakes we have to
look back at our mistakes that's the
only way we're going to learn you hear
this all the time but it's so important
though they've incorporated that into
into this agile this you know this
retrospective it's so cool time
we have to be nice to ourselves one of
the reasons why Google hired me and they
liked what I was doing was I presented
to them a program I didn't say you're
going to come and learn about this stuff
and you're going to be this type of a
person in a weekend workshop what they
were finding they were doing work
weekend workshops and by Wednesday
people were forgetting old stuff so
there's all kinds of coaches like me who
are out there doing all kinds of working
working shops making all kinds of money
because people are hopping around from
course of course of course of course of
course of course of course not
committing and making all kinds of money
now so what I did was I presented a
program would takes time because what
we're doing is we're changing brain
patterns we're becoming new type of
people right and sometimes I say
changing my brain patterns is like
almost growing a new thumb right it's
not them it's not a mind or something
magical that happens we have connections
than neurons there's billions of them
but they have connections violinist
they've studied their brains right and
they have found that they're strong very
strong different type of brain right
there because we're our writers
responsible for a lot of ice road so
they were very strong in this area they
had practiced and they had exercised as
part of the brain but it takes time yogi
guys I mean they're so cool they can
control their bodies flat it took time
I'm not going to get to become a yogi
and I don't want to be I just want to
change myself a little bit but time and
desire now one of the problems in our
society today and I have all these
people come to me and they're talking
about they sit down well they say John I
have to I need to I need to do this I
have to do that I need to do this and I
say just a minute what do you want to do
and I get a blank stare you know I don't
know about you I went to university
because I kind of had to it was kind of
nice to have that piece of paper and say
I've got a you know I've got an
education and I got
ba and stuff like that now I was talking
with my colleague who got a business
degree and he says we do not talk to
each other sometime we said are you
using your degree no he said are you
using your degree no we were using our
degrees but we went to school because it
was something we have to do and today
and it's the same thing in our lives all
i have to i need to i have to end and l
cheese and that's what anxiety is a book
that's what we go to bed we think in the
night I have you know what about desire
what do you want if you want to be a
product owner it's a 12 it's so cool
isn't it and then if I want to do
something it becomes easy very very easy
but if it's a half two and I need to man
it's tough so what do we got here what's
next the tools now how do we change and
that's he talked about how do we change
how are we going to change ourselves so
I mentioned you know we can become we
have we surround ourselves with the
right people were affected by our
environment but there's other tools such
as meditation there's other tools such
as prayer there's other there's all
kinds of tools that you can use to help
yourself to become better product owners
better scrum masters there's all kinds
of tools you make use of those tools I
have a tool and I do the neurofeedback
and the biofeedback I to put a plug in
for myself okay and so I just I help
people to become more calm and more
focused I can help I can put people very
quickly into a state of mind is through
practices through training it's
non-invasive and it's just to practice
if you want to do it you can do it on
your own through yoga you can do it
through through meditation or you can do
many retrospectives but it's practicing
those mini retrospectives because then
you'll be in a state of mind as a
product owner you'll be able to create
the vision you will create that alpha so
see what else now what I wanted to do is
I'm putting a plug in for the stove
satellite very quickly the stove stove
is a new thing and that's why I got
involved with the stoves thing was we
were saying we're going to be working
differently that was the whole idea so
it's a whole umbrella of Stokes people
and we meet every so often to talk about
doing business better so I thought I'd
mentioned that to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
