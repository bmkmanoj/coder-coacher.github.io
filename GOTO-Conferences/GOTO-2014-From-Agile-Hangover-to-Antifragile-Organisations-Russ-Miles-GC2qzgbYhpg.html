even though the bond pie last night left
its mark I think it's fair to say how
you were feeling did anyone go to the
bomb party last night everyone go yeah
put your hand up you in put your hand up
if you regret how much of those cheap
martinis your head good morning okay so
on a serious note just to kick off not
really related to the subject to the
talk I just like to point out that
there's a talk later on today by geet
but I think most people should attend
because this industry this world is
played by a certain epidemic that we
don't recognize and I myself has
suffered very very deeply with this and
that that would be basically anything
related to depression and anxiety so
there's a talk later on about depression
which which actually has a positive note
that you definitely should attend if you
get a chance ok so what do I do for a
living I am a chief scientist which
means that people think I'm responsible
and actually in my head I'm this guy
seriously or iron man it varies
depending on how cool I feel but
normally I'm just this guy so my job is
to do the fun stuff I've started several
companies and I enjoy starting companies
but I know when I'm not no longer useful
to those companies so I become chief
scientist as opposed to the CEO it's
that point at which you you start to
really hate excel and numbers then you
become a to scientists because you just
really can't bother with the rest of it
and so i'ma chief scientist now
simplicity itself and that means I get
to play with cool stuff and it means you
know on a Friday evening in Copenhagen I
get a chance to code and go that's how
cool I am okay so just to start with a
little story I guess he noticed how in
films when someone walks into a scene
they walk in through the door they
forget what they were going to say and
just walk out again good
and yet we do that all the time right so
you get up off the couch and you go I
there was a reason I got up off the
couch there was definitely something I
was supposed to be doing and it was
important at the time and yet I can't
remember it at all that is common in
human nature but you'll never see a
agile evangelist forget why you should
do something there's always an answer in
a book somewhere or one of their books
usually you know the answer is on page
34 and you should do this there's a
recipe for everything and I feel that
this talk if anything else should
actually make you feel a little bit more
like dory and make you feel that
actually the answer isn't out there and
I'm going to have to think for myself
okay so a slight confession to begin
with I am a recovering agile astir I
have been for many years now and I'm
loving the first stage is so big keep
walking pretty pretty really upsetting
the guy of the camera there I'm a
recovering agile lista in the sense that
for many years I was one of those guys
that would tell you to do XY and Z and
everything will be better and
unfortunately what I found more often
than not is that what I was saying was
entirely wrong or in some sense didn't
treat the context well and that I
pondered this as chief scientist I can
ponder a lot so my ponderings went along
the lines of why am I telling people to
do these things when I don't really know
myself and there's an urge to know right
so if anyone has ever been it's been a
consultant in the room who label
themselves as a consultant okay those
confessional type things as a consultant
you're you're urged to know the answer
more often than you actually know it and
as you can by the way that days my
definition of consultant versus coach a
coach will help you find the answer
where as a consultant just says it's X
do it and that's what you pay them for
and so for many years I was
I to tell people the answer was X when
it was probably X with a number of
Delta's along the way so that's my
confession I don't always have the
answer and when I work with companies
now there the interesting thing is I
don't usually have the answer yet until
I meet you okay so what is the agile
hanger who've huh now the actual
hangover has been and it's particularly
pertinent and the the agile hangover is
not what you may have heard of in the
past there's a lot of craftsmen out
there that use the agile hangover as a
phrase that then leads to why you should
do crafts which might well be correct
but for you but yeah I don't know if
it's correct for you so my point is that
you know the agile hangover is something
I'm noticing more and more in different
organizations and it's a feeling that
comes through right so there's a there's
a almost desperation it's a desperation
that's been led by the factor on this
edge okay they're desperate to know what
next where should I put my foot next and
I particularly liked this picture
because I don't know where your foot
sure go next elegantly speaking you know
you could you could easily put a foot
anywhere and it would be wrong there's a
lot of companies have spent a lot of
money on becoming agile in some sense
and now they're wondering why and so
this talk is a little bit about that
okay so why have we done this why have
we got here where do we go next and
hopefully I'll give you a few tools to
go forward with beyond the cliff okay
but to do that I need to tell your story
I need to tell you what I started from
and this is this is that I'm not told
this story before on stage ok this is
what poppin last week ok thank him but
I've not told it before in front of a
camera so back in the day right I used
to work on these horrific machines I was
basically software developing for blinky
lights if it could blink I probably
wrote it now writing this software was
fairly straightforward
even in that exact in that in that
context are we managed to screw up
beautifully several times I worked on
this machine here is a Calder that's
British engineering by the way not just
English but British engineering we built
these machines that machine that that
doesn't give you an idea of the size the
thing right so that the last week I said
it's a size of the room I was in that
would be a light this week but
essentially it be probably the size of
this stage and the idea of this machine
was it is a batch processor so it would
run all night and you send your photos
in film that's how old I am you'd send
your film in overnight and you trust
them to to process it on one of these
beasts but this beast had certain
problems right so one of the problems it
had was that the motor that drove all
that film through it like 10,000 films
will go through Idzik the moto warmed up
all right the oil in it will get warmer
and therefore the motor will run faster
so I wrote a piece of software that
equally had to be encased in such a
machine ultimately if you ever open mon
these things be a tiny little computer
at the bottom and then I'd be like loads
of space and then this really massive
stainless steel box around it and the
ideas machine would be the software
anyway was to keep that motor running
right you know readjust its speed so
that your film didn't go through the
bath at the incorrect speed which is
really important to you because
otherwise you get those I don't know if
you get me in Denmark be in certainly UK
we used to get these little stickers
that said that you know it used to be
quite sarcastic it would say you screwed
up you took a rut bad photo but we did
our best to make it okay but maybe you
should go and get some schooling on this
and that's what he was saying it was
very patronizing and we get these
stickers now in truth what those
stickers are really saying is app but
when we processed it we screwed up we
didn't do the right thing and I know
this because when we first turned this
machine I worked on when we first turned
it on
it was supposed to control the motor
which it did but it slowed it down quite
considerably and and effectively over
dev't about 10,000 sets of films and
they all got a little sticker and said
maybe you should take better photos that
was a confession that's my fault so
welcome these machines was interesting
in the sense that when I was working
with the company was first of all it's
working with a psychopath anyway I
lovely guy called Darren who I think he
made a living from hurting me was the
way it worked and essentially there was
no version control there was absolutely
no process whatsoever there was utter
chaos and they even to the point where
we managed to destroy a circuit board
because we didn't know if the machine
was on or off when someone unplugged the
circuit board I've never seen of arc of
electricity so impressive as someone
ripping a circuit board out as no idea
so we were going through a version of
hell and what I didn't realize which
retrospect has given me right so I can
look at this and go actually I was
learning what the industry was learning
this was chaos this is utter pain this
was essentially a crisis in microcosm I
was doing everything that everyone else
was doing wrong all the time and so I
did what any professional software
developer will do in this position I
moved on I changed my job yeah you don't
fixed you don't fix the problem you move
on it's like a lot of us do right so we
create some software that everyone else
calls legacy after we left so I moved on
and I moved on to a different type of
device right so I'd work with these big
blinky light boxes and I thought what I
want to do is work with more impressive
big blinky light boxes so I started
working on fast jets and which is a bit
of a jump career-wise I don't think
there's many pilots that would be
impressed with my choice of junk to go
from photo processing machines too fast
yet but it was fun right
and that's actually one of the ones i
worked on it's the f-16 and it's got the
pot underneath is is one of the things I
worked on and if occasionally it worked
what it would do is record lots of
imagery as this fast yet did its fastjet
thing and at some point someone might
look at that imagery and then I realized
they captured far too much imagery that
if they actually human watched it then
they want to kill themselves so what
happened was it kind of retro grated to
can we detect objects like a tank can we
did I think back then it was like can we
detect the Scud launch or something and
and it was fun and when i joined this
next job i was looking for a certain set
of characteristics I'll be honest
because I come from the chaos and I
wanted to know that I was going to a
better thing and when I went for an
interview this is kind of the the guy i
met not Mourinho but essentially the
same look I walked into my interview and
he basically this guy turned around and
said we know how to do software and I
thought wow brilliant bromine this is 16
years ago I'm sitting there going
fantastic and if he did if he was right
can you imagine what this industry is
gone the roots this has gotten down
we're still trying to figure out what we
do he knew back then he was if he was
right um and he definitely believed he
was right and it we do we know we know I
did this right so we have we do nine
month projects that sounded good to me
everything I've worked on before was
basically continuous delivery in the
sense that we continuously delivered
what people didn't want and he said you
know nine months and then we drop and
they every time on time to budget oh
we're good and then came that the punch
and I was naive enough not to know ought
to smell a rat in this case right he
turn around and said actually eight
months is spent
designing or not just designing right
this is early days in a wonderful
scenario where we had this thing called
rational rose I can tell by the sniggers
that people have met this beast I was an
early beta tester for it and I
apologized her that too because I don't
know what I was testing I was just doing
something that someone else told me to
do and we were trying to design our
software with diagrams and essentially
what the guy was saying is literally you
spend basically eight months drawing
diagrams and then after and we do this
because very smart people have told us
to write there's an incredibly smart
they're geniuses out there right on a
mountaintop I always envisioned them on
the mountaintop if it was a Grady boots
he looks like he should be on a
mountaintop the these people were out
there and they were they were going to
tell us how to do it and so this was my
first introduction to dogma and people
know the right answer and I don't and I
ok so there's these amazing people and
the story continued in this interview
with this guy he basically said what
happens is we do eight months of design
because these guys tell us to do so and
then and literally I kid you not the
physicality of what he did next was
interesting what he did was he said then
we just write the code and he's
basically just grinding the gears on a
music box so the monkeys can write some
code and that was how his vision
envisioned that was perfection eight
months of thinking designing because the
smart people told us to do that and then
one month of just write the code come on
this the easy part of me and so I
listened and I believed and I became
very caught up in what this guy was
saying and I wanted an answer anyway I
think like most of us in the industry we
really wanted an answer and it was
better than before okay there wasn't
people managing to cause massive
lightning strike
by ripping things out of machines
because i didn't know machines on and
that you know we didn't lose as much
code what I did realize also is that
most of the time we didn't ship anything
either I think in the eight years I
spent in this organization we shipped
something probably three of three times
which for anyone's math is not every
nine months and but you know it was
better than before because I felt a good
safety net around me and so like every
professional software developer I did
the right thing I moved on because I'd
heard this is cool thing out there I
thought I heard others were were smart
they were there were other smart people
beyond the three amigos there was
someone else that was also equally
clever and there was a whole group of
them brilliant so there was his
manifesto that I believed in that was
good I still do it's a great set of
things to live by when you're writing
software and exploring problem domains
and I wanted to be part of a company
that was doing that but when I joined
other companies that were doing this
what I realized it is an awful lot of
arguments around process there were
these strange discussions of are you can
burn or are you scrum or are you
something else and therefore not agile
anymore and I found that fascinating
because everyone seemed to forget what
we were actually doing which was
building stuff and actually trying to
ship it and maybe I was naive you know
maybe I'd still got this you know
strange I know past experience from
being in the chaos and actually
delivering software the people wanted
even if it didn't work but I realize we
were fighting over strange oddities we
were fighting over how to organize the
work that we were doing but we were
being sold it in a very different way
who has been sold agile on the basis of
hyper productive teams you behave
awesome hands got thank you very much
being lost it's the hyper thing right if
you look at the definition of hyper it's
not usually considered a good thing it's
a system but stressing itself out to the
point where it might just collapse okay
so hyper usually it's an indication you
want to turn it down so hyper
productivity was one thing everyone was
sold different things no process that
I'm aware of actually does this produces
speed okay speed comes to the people
involved in the process and so we were
sold a really good line on the basis of
some fantastic values in the manifesto
and some fantastic principles we also
did a wonderful job as we do in this
industry right so we don't go away we
don't think about stuff what we do is we
steal we go and find someone else who's
done something similar and go oh yeah
thats related to our thing and then we
go and make up these terms or use these
terms in a sort of jargon specific way
and I'm guilty of this as well say that
that honestly what you don't know about
work you know work in progress whip in
doing whip whip is the thing how did you
know what we buy into that because we
definitely want a right answer and so we
stolen whip from other places and it's a
good thing they're gonna be wrong but
was still messing around I think a
little bit with the process we got
without focusing on what happens and so
what happened next right so in the agile
scheme of things and I'm guilty this
fundamentally is money was introduced
lots of money masses about if you don't
know who this is I do apologize it's a
very British joke this one this this guy
was one of the comedians very first
early characters and he really didn't do
much I didn't say he had lots of money
and it was 80 s so lots of money was
considered a good thing so yeah we spent
thunderous amounts of money on changing
our process and changing you know the
mechanics of how we ship things without
realizing that there's one thing we
should be spending money on but where
not and I'll get to that in a pair okay
so wherever there's thunderous amounts
of money being spent there are
consultants and I was one of those when
consultants turn up all coaches they're
very similar-looking breed the what we
do is we turn up and we go I've got the
answer but on that smart I'm gonna have
to explain it to you slowly over the
next few months whilst you continue to
pay my day rate and so in the agile
terms this is what leads us towards the
hangover is that we actually spent a
huge amount of money and time our own
consultants and coaches to make
ourselves better and it got a little bit
better we felt a little bit good okay we
felt that we've done something and
actually we have we've come a heck of a
long way so this this slide set this
talk could be considered a little bit
negative without me going back and
telling you how bad things were in the
beginning and so things were better but
that leads me to where we are now and I
work with a lot of companies where
they've they feel better about what
they're doing but they want to know
what's next and it's a little bit of a
depressing answer for consultants
because i'm not sure they'll ever come
from a specific individual or anyone who
has a platform of a stage actually so
we're on this cliff edge and what we
need to realize is a fundamental law of
software development and it's a little
uncomfortable because it actually flies
against our philosophical underpinnings
and software particularly our
philosophical underpinnings and the
basis of everything we do as as geeks as
a geek myself we believe we know what
we're doing and that's wrong so the
first law of software development I
believe should be we don't know what
we're doing haven't got a clue honestly
whenever someone says and I've been
there where someone says we're going to
build another one of those but with a
few changes
last part of the sentence is critical
okay we don't know what we're doing we
have no clue we are going to discover
explore the answer with you
collaboratively but whenever someone
approaches a software development
department or team or IT or whatever
they want to label things as they all
often approached it with do this thing
and the answer is we don't know how to
do it yet we can make plans and we
should make plans but we don't know what
we're doing and if we can accept that it
fundamentally moves are thinking into a
different direction it actually takes us
back to what agile was supposed to be
about which is adaptability we don't
know what we're doing so we're gonna
have to figure it out if we make a plan
yeah it's going to change and so in fact
we don't know what we're doing it's a
good thing we know that everyone in
software development knows we don't know
what we're doing and you know they feel
kind of comfortable in saying it might
be like something with it before but we
really don't know and we're going to
explore it okay so when you take that
message what happens is all the money
being spent on different ways of working
and processes it behind it becomes it
puts it in at least a place you can
understand it you can go people are
arguing and fighting over how we work by
in essence what we're trying to do is
deal with the fact that we are exploring
a system that we don't know yet and all
of these ways of working are essentially
giving us a comfort buffer against this
fact this uncomfortable fact that we
don't know what we're doing yet okay so
other factors in the story of the agile
hangover we meant it in a few mentions
of this yesterday but I want to just
bring it to the head is this idea of
introversion now into introverted or not
or the spectrum of introversion towards
extraversion
is a gross summary of character traits
pretty well proven particular in
psychology where a lot of things aren't
proven has anyone read Freud oh my god
he's making that stuff up with me but
yeah you've got introversion to
extraversion which is fairly proven
scientifically and the idea here is we
are least made up of an industry where
fifty percent people are introverted in
some sense and so just a quick poll and
please don't be embarrassed it's not a
problem if you are introverted because I
am you raise your hands if you believe
yourself to be introverted in some sense
Hey look at that as good as good that
you're aware most the speakers are by
the way which is ironic thank you think
we're introverted we stand on this
spotlight and these spotlights are
pretty bright too we stand here and we
do you know how I get through doing
cooks as an introvert not just the
sufficient amount of alcohol that
consumed last night the the fact is I'm
talking to one person yes there's a lot
of people out there and you've managed
to achieve a wonderful scatter graph
around the room but there's lots of
people out there but i don't i don't
know you're there i'm talking to one
person i'm talking to you sir or I'm
talking to you man I'm talking to one
because introverts loved ones one
conversations we're rubbish in pies and
the interesting thing is that most of
the agile practices where I see people
are complaining about this agile
hangover situation the agile practices
fight against introversion they assume
that everything is done collaboratively
intervention feds don't want that
introverts really like to go and work on
the problem themselves and then come
back and possibly talk through a
mediator to give you the answer so I've
worked with a lot of teams where they've
got a problem person not a team player
he's not doing the right thing sorry
it's just not one of us I and I've
actually heard the horrible phrase I
don't think he's going to make it so
look it's gonna die
I he won't die I'm gonna guarantee this
a grant find a job but you know he's a
very smart person we love this guy but
when it comes to the HR thing he's not
on board and almost bar none it comes
down to that this person is an introvert
and wants to go and think about problems
alone and then come and bring find some
mechanism to bring some answers back and
I just would like us to realize this
that you know the dogma and the
authorities in some respect would have
us believe that the right way to
approach agile development is all team
based and it's not we work in an
industry where essentially what we're
doing is an intellectual endeavor all
right that makes us feel good about it
okay where I think therefore I am okay
this is what we do and actually what
we're doing is research and development
not just development but research and
development now if you don't understand
that a number of your people are
introverts the way they explore a
problem space the way I explore a
problem space is not always
collaboratively so a quick straw poll
where do you think software development
happens you know is it does it happen
when someone's typing or does it happen
elsewhere for me it happens in the
shower which is not a collaborative
experience usually if they're very very
rarely would be but you know it's not
it's not the place where you expect your
team to turn up in a shower or going for
a walk quietly on my own this has put me
in conflict with a number of employers
where essentially what they would like
me to do is just like write code if
you're not writing code what the hell
are you doing I'm thinking that's what
we do is we think about stuff and then
we come back with some answers and yeah
that now we've got this these practices
that say what you should be doing is a
whiteboard and with a pen in your hand
and collaborating introverts aren't
going to do that much either they'll do
it I'll do it I'm happy I'm very visual
thinker so I'm happy to draw the
introversion doesn't mean shy it just
means that I do my best
work alone and I'll do my best work when
I'm relaxed and not putting energy into
something so an introvert essentially as
someone who's bringing energy into a
situation like this where they feel
uncomfortable and if you need a recipe
to detect introversion it's very simple
yesterday there was a book mention
called quiet amazingly good book
definitely reader the interesting part
of that for me anywhere to take away
from that was that we had this culture
that extraversion is good introversion
is bad and actually it's not it's not
like that so we shouldn't be looking to
change introverts into extroverts that's
like telling someone who is homosexual
just what yourself out okay into that
deep right it's not a choice it's not a
choice to be introverted it's deep deep
down and you ain't going to change it so
when we're looking at a different
practices we've got a nice suits with
the agile hangover is that we need to
look at these different practices that
we're employing and see how much we're
hurting people with these practices and
the biggest pain that I've seen out
there for introverts is the culture that
suggests we should always be pair
programming ok I'm going to sacrifice a
lamb now pair programming who does pair
programming at work there's a few people
that do I'm unfortunate enough to work
in have worked in an organization where
you have to pay a programming to touch
the code that's how dogmatic it is if
you're not working with someone else
then don't touch the problem with that
is that an introvert will find that
exhausting to pair program because
that's ongoing communication with
another and it's okay it's it's fairly
boxed as a as an introvert that test i
was talking about if you go to a party
if you instinctively try to have 11
conversations you try to gravitate out
of the room a little bit that means
you're probably on the scale towards
introversion if an extrovert what you do
is try to gather
if you're gaining energy from lots of
people coming together in pair
programming we do have one-to-one
conversations but it's still quite
stressful so if you're one of those
people like myself that finds pair
programming a little bit uncomfortable
for extended durations that's not wrong
either so anyone who mandates pair
programming is the only way to go is
hurting people that's hurting fifty
percent in these fifty percent workers
it's probably hurting about seventy
percent of the speakers ok so just
dogmatically applying these things
doesn't work there's another culture
that I see in the agile hangover style
organizations and this works at the
project management level and it's the
culture of keyboard clacking okay so who
here's a project manager or works pretty
much guiding a project let's call it
that right great you have probably the
best network of people in your
organization without a doubt okay the
team doesn't want it you've got it so
you're very valuable forget where
everything else says project manager I
spoke to an individual who shall remain
nameless about six months ago and he
said the one mistake we made when we
adopted agility in some sense was to
basically take our project managers and
shoot them we just killed off this role
we killed off these people who cared
about things very deeply and he said the
biggest mistake because what we did was
kill a network of friends these people
knew how to go into a meeting with other
people and defend the project we then
put the team doing this and the team
went and did it and my goodness I've
never seen such blood in the water so
keyboard clacking though is a disease
I've seen amongst a lot of organizations
and is this idea if you're you're not
working unless you can hear pair up you
know hitting the keyboard working with
the keyboard I might be preaching to the
converted working with a keyboard that's
not where software development happens
that's an output
that's a last stage concern and there
are people out there that I've met that
if you're not at the keyboard doing
something then what the hell are you
doing what are you doing that's that's
different cool okay I'm getting getting
a reminder of time and I need to speed
up the other one is it related to it is
that we now have a culture where we
encourage keyboard ballet has anyone
seen this but I trying to pair with
someone and I have no idea what he just
did or she just did seriously it's like
the change is made what what happened
honestly I didn't see a screen yet I get
the same experience when I watch people
really experience for an IDE okay there
babe spent a lot of their life getting
really good with the ID what do you do
what did you just do because I haven't
got a clue and I'm the navigator you
know that's like being a navigator on a
ship where the ship has just gone
through several oceans and I haven't got
a clue how it got there and so this idea
of keyboard ballet is also pervasive in
our industry that you should ok that's a
previous correction I thought literally
didn't mean the guy at eight minutes now
I've 18 ok that feels better your
project managers really do i actually
have 25 ok the other thing i noticed in
that y'all hang over and I had to tell a
story to get this across and then I
apologize if anyone's ever seen me speak
before because I have told the story of
fair bit is that we forget what we're
building needs to be as adaptable as we
are so I'm going to ask you to trust me
which is a bit of a step this morning
but if you could just trust me for a
moment and close your eyes I can't get
to your fine honestly I'd have to run to
get here just close your eyes trust the
person you'll sink next to it ok it's
sprint ten and you're feeling good
oh you're feeling better than good
you're feeling brilliant you walk in the
morning you've done the right thing the
software is looking beautiful the
process is glorious and you sit there
and like anyone does in a stand up right
anyone set any sensible individual and
stand up we'll sit down so you sit down
and you're in your stand-up and you
after you've got the you know inevitable
status updates out of the way the next
step is usually one of okay so how we
doing what we blocking today that sort
of thing so you're feeling good and
everyone around you is feeling good and
then what happens is the one thing we
all dread the product owner or whoever
made significant decisions about what
you're doing next turns around and says
that one phrase you've been dreading
which is we want one small change and at
that point you go through several
emotions very powerful emotions the
motion emotions include first anger how
dare you tell me that things are going
to change no we plan this two weeks come
on we know what we're doing you want
things to change I hate you I if you're
in scrum you've got a mechanism to deal
with this you can beat them up by saying
well can't sort of sprint will cancel it
and you're the problem the next the next
emotion is more interesting in some
respects it's guilt okay we're guilty
because deep down we know we're supposed
to be agile software developers and
agility for those there's no what it's
all about is about embracing change and
this was a change
and we're not embracing it in fact we're
going to try and use it to beat someone
up so how agile are we really we embrace
change doesn't seem to be the thing
what's actually hanging around in the
background that's him picking us through
these emotions is the elephant in the
stand up I couldn't get people actually
standing up but it works for me the
elephant to stand up is rich Hickey with
tight the coin it is all the software
that you wrote yesterday that's in
conflict with today or at least in
conflict with that phrase one small
change and it's not that the small
change isn't small right so you should
be looking in this case it's not you
know it's not an education job right
you're not turning around and going
actually it's a big change in fact what
you're looking at is it really should be
a small change I know it should be a
small change but it's not and so we have
phrases for this to deal with the
elephant to stand up what we do is we
lie yep we lie see if anyone and I won't
ask you put your hands up because this
is kind of a crime but um are we need to
do couple of months of refactoring or at
least a few weeks what we're actually
turning around to this change it we're
saying we need to redesign there is no
refactoring that takes more than 10
minutes but there's redesign that takes
a lot longer because we need to redesign
because the world has changed and but
redesign sounds like we made a mistake
so redesign isn't easy to admit to we
have another phrase for it we need to
pay back some technical debt I love that
phrase because it's basically turning
around to the person who's asked for a
change in saying it's your fault that we
aren't right I just want to make you
realize that so you're going to pay us
back you're not going to get anything
for the next 2-3 weeks but you know now
aware of the fact you may just make a
mistake you push this too hard therefore
now you need to pay it back so technical
debt refactoring or often use
cloaks for a fact that we built the
software in such a way that is now in
conflict reality and this is because our
software hasn't kept up with a dirty in
these agile hangover organizations the
software is struggling it's creaking and
it's creaking because we're platonic in
our thinking okay the reason I pull up
later it's easy to criticize Plato
because he's not a light now they don't
think is always that beam remarkable the
lovely thing about Plato is that he had
this idea of the perfect form there's
perfection out there and we're striving
towards it every project that is planned
is bought into the Platonic form that
there is the right answer and that we
are aiming for it in true softwares
nothing like that we that there is no
perfect form we don't know what we're
aiming for comes back that thing we
don't know what we're doing we're gonna
figure it out Plato would have
definitely been against that he would
not have been a very pragmatic
individual i'll skip Heraclitus because
it just gets it's just the extension of
the point but because we don't know what
we're doing the Platonic form isn't work
now the waterfall method these idea
review do something you do something
everything goes great in sequence is
brought into Plato okay this idea that
we know what we're doing we're going the
right direction and we might just attach
but we know we can / o doing and we
don't have a clue what we're doing so
what we need to do is adopt a different
philosophy when it comes to software
development and that philosophy
underpins agility I think it's a tragedy
that it's not mentioned more than it
should you know as much as it should be
which is stoicism we should be reacting
is anyone doing on those seneca the
younger there philosopher oh wow ok if
you don't read his stuff it's quite good
seneca's favorite my favorite phrase of
sin occurs is that we don't know the
next day is not promised you
which is pretty depressing as a basis
for a philosophy but the next day is not
promised you in fact I won't even
promise you the next hour we don't know
what's going to happen this is
fundamental to software development when
we know its research and development
because we don't know what's going to
happen next and our software needs to
appreciate that we don't know what's
going to happen next so how many people
are won't ask you to raise your hands
but when you're working with software
how many people recognize at least think
I don't know what's going to happen next
okay i'm not saying over design it so
that we can appreciate every change that
comes along but we don't know how this
thing's going to be changed we really
don't know so we need to think about our
software in such a way that appreciates
we don't know what's going to happen
next okay so at this point in my career
going better story I was looking for any
answer literally any answer and what I
found was what we don't need to get out
of the agile hangover is another
manifesto we don't need another
revolution we don't need another set of
values we have perfectly good values and
principles but we do need to remind
ourselves that we should be stoics we
don't know what's going to happen next
and we should get out of this practice
of believing that everything we do right
now is going to be right forever so I'm
kind of popularized online because I
basically say no no absolutely not we
don't need another manifesto we don't we
don't need I met seriously a manifest no
but where is I Savior okay in the past I
had the three amigos then I had these
incredibly smart people though into a
ski resort the wrong time of year and
came up with something there was always
these geniuses out there that would tell
us what to do I wasn't life good it's
nice when people tell us what to do for
two reasons we get an answer and we get
a blame it's beautiful so where's the
answers going to come from now I have to
pick on people and unfortunately some of
these people
here in fact neither am I so they can't
beat me up but is he arms are gonna come
from who knows this guy hey who's he
come on shutout and down the mine north
right is he honest gonna come from dan
probably not I mean technically some
good answers will but some good ideas
will more than anything else but
probably won't come from dan sorry Dan
um will come from this guy Oh who's this
till now days Wow yeah we've got a few
who is it oh cool Bob right is he asking
to come from him there will be lots of
answers it's quite opinionated about
those answers but no your answer won't
come from him at all in fact technically
it won't come from anyone at the
conference that's speaking your answer
won't what we need to get our heads
around is that anyone on a stage is only
giving you deacons decontextualized
information okay we're giving you some
ideas that we've experienced that were
useful in other contexts and so the
answer isn't even going to come from me
and you should never trust a guy on a
Harley anyway all right and now that is
the bike that's waiting for me when I
get home as well but no you know it's
not anything to come from me what I
trying to help you do is look at
everything that comes your way and
rationalize about it think about it see
how it contextually sits with your world
so with this philosophical start point
of being stoic everything you've heard
in this conference reevaluate and see
does it approached my context because no
one on stage knows your context at all I
haven't got a clue I'd love to find out
that I haven't got a clue
so it's not going to come from us and we
are sorry about that but what remedies
could we offer right so this would be a
pretty poor presentation if all I did
was say sorry we haven't actually what
we're doing good luck there we were on
that offer some sort of medicine to this
and the medicine really could be summed
as being thing I particularly love this
philosopher Bertrand Russell here
awesome philosophy haven't read
philosophy at all then try and read
something here oh and when you wake up
it'll be great his point though was that
we need to think more and I think that's
the message for the industry is that no
one knows your context no one knows
people involved is a complex system it's
chaotic I anything I say on stage or
anything anyone else is on stage will
lead you towards a hangover or some form
it's going to lead you towards we you
know if you take this as Rho to go do it
it might work or it might not and every
book the server and I've got my
brother-in-law Adam right terrific man
he believes what he reads and so does
our industry do you know how easy it is
to write something I've written three
books one of them in UML I'm sorry but
and one of them was actually for sale
out there she's great um but the you
know when you write a book in fact if
you look in that book i'm gonna do
myself a disservice now but in that book
it's a bit of a date you know it took a
very complicated algorithm for figuring
out story points don't use it that's
ridiculous but we had to come up with
something a time it's a long time ago
the same with everything be very dubious
of what you read be very dubious of what
you hear on stage we don't have the
answers we have ideas and we should be
more honest about telling you that do
not respect my authority I'm on stage
because I can deal with it and I got
invited and I'm partially on stage
because I got told to be here oh and I
got woken up about ten so but don't
expect my authority
I don't know what your situation is I
don't i could give you suggestions but
please don't just do it I'm you're
discovering your situation your context
I don't even know where to start with it
so respecting my authority is probably
not the right place to begin very much
be aggressive against dogma if someone
tells you it's the answer it's the right
answer it's not usually it's probably
dubious at best so baby slightly
frightened of evangelists that tell you
absolutely it's the best thing ever oh
my god if you're not doing that you're
not this awesome a zhing okay this by
the way this guy if you don't know he is
he single handedly destroyed the music
industry in the UK he's working on the
US which is a beautiful thing
essentially anyone who is glazed up and
really really passionate just calm and
down Bertrand Russell would sit there
and his big armchair and go let's talk
about this we should do that more okay
you have the answers not us your context
is king if you're not in an organization
that is in some sense agile or adaptable
the customer needs it will be eventually
because it will need to compete and
innovate you can't force these things a
lot of people go into organizations and
I've worked with people who consider
themselves to be disruptive I'm a
disruptor they drop in and they go boom
and everything changes well actually
what happens is boom it's like throwing
a rock into a pond boom lots ripples and
eventually calms down everything as bad
way it was so it change happens really
slowly and only you know what is the
right change for your company for your
team for your environment and the
downside is that thinking is really hard
okay unfortunately answers not going to
come from a book ideas my answers don't
that requires you to think an awful lot
and we are lucky because we work in
industry where we are intellectuals that
used to be a criticism by the way
intellectual was a phrase made up for
someone that basically wasn't doing yeah
was not involved in industry properly
intellectual used to be a game okay so
we'll gets us across what gets has
passed this hangover what gets us past
the agile hangover a set of principles
things I want you to consider going to
go through these quickly first one is
anti fragility you haven't read anything
on aunty fragility please do you'll have
to get past a lot of verbiage there's a
lot of stuff written about this anti
fragility is kind of pragmatic stoicism
it says we don't know what we're doing
we need to build systems that not just
embrace change but thrive on it we want
to change organic systems already like
this right so anyone here has not been
to the gym for a year knows what I'm
talking about after not going to the gym
for a year muscles don't look so good
right they need stress they need to be
stressed modern life doesn't stress our
muscles much so the gym helps with that
essentially our systems and our software
should be the same and it's on a
spectrum okay we all know what fragile
software looks like anyone don't update
the windows and then rebooted and gone
please please please please please stop
it that's fragility robustness it's
usually along the lines of you know or I
ask people in the UK what's the first
thing you do when you get a new
broadband connection with a ping google
or they ping BBC what they're saying is
we trust those systems to be more robust
than our own hardware and so that's
robust but that's not the end game the
yen game is anti frigidity because in
anti fragile software and processes we
want change we want new ideas bring it
on because every new idea will improve
what we're doing or could improve but we
need a way of navigating
not any hard here is we need stress okay
whether it's human system or a software
system and there was a slight change
there by the way doesn't really matter
it's the same principles so drop dogma
it lacks context you have the context
you are the smartest people in this room
about your problem space easily okay
anyone on stage has no idea where the
dumbest people in the room when it comes
to your problem you can make this happen
let's give you some tools to do so
because thinking's hard right okay so
the first thing you need to think about
is what questions are we going to answer
what we need what any tool to do two
things it should give us answers and it
should ask questions okay it should for
drive us towards questions one of the
ones that I particularly love is impact
mapping it's a very simple tool if you
haven't encountered it please go and
look at it it's a tool for helping you
build roadmaps rather than roads what it
does is identify options it identify
ways of getting to a goal if anyone's
been in project management where it's
gone you know when you build the chart
and go right this this this this win
that's not going to happen that is the
opposite of what we actually need to do
we need to explore where we're going so
impact mapping is an alternative for
steering where we need to go the other
one that to leave you with is it real
options if you haven't looked at real
options a great book called commitment
it's a graphic novel do not let that put
you off it's a brilliant book what it's
trying to help you do is do what traders
do and yeah okay traders have got a bad
rep recently but essentially what
they're doing is understanding that
every choice we make is based on options
available at time the options we've
identified and we're going to balance it
and we're going to look at at some point
we can't make the decision anymore
because it's gone but we know in this
window that we can make a decision and
it might not be that we make the
decision at the end we should make it
somewhere in the middle
so that's part of the game but we also
need to steer the ship through difficult
waters systems thinking is another tool
that people don't apply anywhere near it
enough the thing about systems thinking
is every change you do to an
organization or a team or even the code
has secondary problems right tertiary
problems systems thinking helps you
understand how that all glues together
so if you're not applying systems
thinking enough then what you're doing
is tampering with the system the
difference between changing a system and
tampering these systems thinking can
evidence the other one if you haven't
encountered this than you should i'm
going to be quite quick through this i
apologize but the slides will be online
shop the idea here is that depending on
the characteristics of what you're
working with it'll have entirely
different ways of approaching it there's
no good just applying dogma to a system
that is chaotic for example where we
can't see cause and effect at all and
that's that characteristic that you need
to consider when you consume change okay
beating the elephant is the other thing
so we can manufacture our process to be
more be more agile rigging and in thrive
on change but if I software can't keep
up the thing we build can't keep up then
we're screwed and I found that there was
no tool for this any industry that I've
encountered an out so I created one
which is called a life preserver the
life preserver is purely a thinking tool
for your software it's a way of
organizing your components and it
basically has a very simple premise
which is think about change how
decoupled should things be where should
they sit it's based upon the hexagonal
architectural approach anyway but in
fact it's just a very proactive even
collaborative even your introverts it
works tool for thinking through these
things so of course I encourage you to
look at that too
the other things that are out there that
are important at the moment and the
reasons they're important are this idea
of micro services and reactive software
as well these things exist beyond the
obvious characteristics that you see are
these things the important thing to take
away is they're trying to help us build
systems that thrive on change that's the
game the next ten years is about
thriving on change and letting our
software do that too and that's where
the reactive type thing sets to it's all
about thriving unchanged this great
other local and secondary benefits but
the ultimate goal is we want to thrive
on change okay so to take away there's
not going to be yet another Authority no
one's going to tell you the right way on
stage no one's going to tell you that
this is the absolute golden goal it's
not going to happen it's your system
it's your software only you can change
it okay what we're doing is throwing out
ideas contextualizing potential ideas
antique fragility is a different
principle it's a different way of
viewing the world is different way of
dealing with your software it's
different way of dealing with your
people so aunty fragility for me is the
next thing after agility in fact it's
almost a reminder of what we were aiming
for I know are plenty of tools but
there's one thing to leave you with why
should we care why should we bother with
this the reason you should care beyond
more than anything else and the reason i
work with certain organizations that do
care is they are scared to death of
organizations that have got this already
okay envy is a beautiful thing and they
envy something they don't call aunty
fragility they envy innovation because
those that innervate are going to win
and it doesn't matter how big your
organization is it might be a very large
organization Microsoft that is
struggling with innovation and change we
may all be part of organizations to have
this challenge so the reason we do this
when we're talking to the business
people please don't go to the business
people and say what we needs anti
fragility hey hon take it they're not
going to be interested term that we need
innovation they're on their own board we
need innovate faster we need to try
things out more we need to scale things
out more that's the selling point and so
thank you very much for your time I put
has got a little bit over of course like
most authors I've got a book but it's
about auntie fragility and organizations
and software and I will write more soon
so if you fancy that as that's wonderful
thank you for your time thank you for
this venue and I hope you have a great
rest of the conference through the lens
of rationality and Angie fragility you
know your context you're the experts
we're just throwing out ideas thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
