me here else I got lots of invite
Francis and there's actually several
competing for my attention this week but
I know said that last year there was
some kind of survey of who they wanted
to have in Chicago this year and I was
somewhere near the top of this survey so
we can't you can't turn down that kind
of sort of prior approval or something
whatever it is but so that that's why
I'm here
I I thought that had been Chicago for a
while and this is a go-to series of
conferences or an excellent excellent
conference series of upbeat it was in
Aarhus a few years ago I'll be there
again in this year so anyway we're going
to talk about today is the how to the
sort of the the nature of innovation and
the the reasons why we use innovation to
go fast and go go and scale things and
then some of the examples and then get a
bit more of other than sort of
explaining why this matters also talk
about how you get there some some more
practical things so I've got a whole
hour so I've got quality slides and then
hopefully I'll make it through this so
what have I been doing the last few
years and this kind of my instant
summary I've been out there baffling
late adopters as a service I've been out
doing conference presentations and
mostly sort of to sort of people go over
the years people got slightly less
confused but definitely what Netflix was
doing was baffling to what most
enterprises were doing and and over the
years this change so the reactions to my
talks 2009 Netflix started going to
cloud we started a few things running in
the back end we weren't actually running
any public facing things but we were
getting our feet wet and we decided this
looked like it might work and then we
said we were going to move all of
Netflix to cloud everyone said we were
completely crazy and even believe we we
were actually doing that you know
thought we were just making stuff up and
then during 2010 that it moved on I
started doing some presentations in 2009
early 2010 and in 2010 we were doing
they'd agreed we were actually trying to
do it but basically assumed that it
wouldn't work and we'd be
back in the data center pretty quickly
you know tell between our legs now sorry
that was a bad idea but for the
beginning of 2010 there were actually
nothing none of the customer-facing
stuff was running in the cloud and
Netflix and we're the first piece went
up in January and then bye-bye December
all of the customer-facing website and
most of the API calls were actually
being served out of the cloud so during
2010 we moved or everything to the cloud
and so after that they said well okay I
guess it is working but it only works
for these weird unicorns like Netflix
and it's totally irrelevant to anything
that anyone else has ever done or ever
will do or you're unique so that's when
I adopted the cloudy corn as my mascot
you know have a little unicorn kind of
cloud thing it's a guy in Denver that
makes made that little icon that I use
on my Twitter feed and I have a t-shirt
of it as well so during 2011 we had the
front end you know the customer facing
stuff but it was still backing back
ending into the data center and this is
what most people call hybrid cloud and
there are people that think that hybrid
cloud is the endpoint and it's a happy
place to end up Netflix thinks of it as
something like Roman riding which is a
Roman riding is a rodeo trick where you
have two horses and you're standing on
the horses with one foot on each saddle
holding a pair of reins in one hand hair
reins in the other hand jumping through
hoops of fire and doing tricks right and
the only thing connecting the horses is
your legs right and if the horses decide
to do this you're you know you land on
the ground and a pile of dirt and
uncomfortable a very uncomfortable
manner so what a lot of outages in that
in that time period were caused by the
data center in the cloud not quite being
in sync or going or losing the
connection or but something that mostly
the date center broke the cloud occasion
in the cloud broke itself but almost all
the outages that actually happened were
caused by life trying to run hybrid
clouds so there's my kind of warning if
somebody thinks that hybrid cloud is a
good idea
go worry about how you're going to make
that work reliably so the what actually
happened during 2011 is Netflix moved
its back-end from the system of record
from being Oracle and the data center to
being Cassandra in the cloud prior to
that there is insane Polly bee
and so at that point pretty much
everything is now owned in the cloud and
there were backups happening and what's
going on in the data center is sort of
an appendage still a few things running
there so you know we kept going I kept
doing more and more talks at conferences
and people were going okay I think
actually this does look useful but the
gap from where we are to what you're
doing is just too big right okay that
looks nice it has all these nice
features it scales it's highly available
it's got agile development but it's you
know you're baffling later doctors right
they can't figure out how to get there
so during 2012 Netflix started open
sourcing stuff seriously and like Dave
said with I think over 40 projects 42
projects something like that right now
and they have done a few more in the
last few weeks and so as I went out what
I found was that people were studied I
started running to people that were
using the Netflix code so during 2013
I'd be going out doing similar kinds of
presentations but half the audience were
actually using some Netflix coding how
many people here are using something
from the Netflix codebase so we got a
few well thanks for that and it sort of
moved on to okay we can see some aspects
of this are the next generation of
applications and we're trying to
understand it and there are other people
simultaneously coming up with other
architectures so it wasn't just that
people were adopting what Netflix did
but some of the concepts I'm the cloud
native concept started to become common
in other areas so there's now several
different ways of doing this the Netflix
open source code really helped bridge
that gap so what I learned from my time
at Netflix one of them is that the whole
architecture of what Netflix does as a
business is oriented around speed so
Netflix you know seven years ago when I
joined Netflix it is a it was a tiny
company roughly a billion dollars in
revenue and it was competing with some
of the biggest industries and the
biggest players in the market and when
you're tiny the only thing you can do is
dodge faster right so the faster they
could move at the phones and the more
they could confuse the competition
and nor agile they were the more able
they were to actually disrupt things and
they've been extremely successful at
doing that I still think that I look
sometimes at what's near startups come
to talking to startups nowadays a lot
and they say we're going to develop this
thing and we're going to put three
engineers on it and it's going to take a
year and I look at it and going I'm sure
something at Netflix built that you know
one guy built that in three months
there's an incredibly productive
development model at Netflix we're
ridiculously large amounts of stuff are
built by a very small number of people a
very short time time span I've never
seen anything be built here so you know
somebody to do something to get done
sooner than you expected it would happen
and that never happens it's software
right so what they do is to get there is
basically take all the friction out of
product development and you do that with
a high trust low process with no
handoffs between teams and I'll talk
more about that later and you need a
culture that does that a freedom and
responsibility culture which is
basically also you can think of it as a
high trust culture and then the other
thing is to aggressively get rid of
anything that isn't cord is an
innovative and that is becoming
commoditized so that's you know don't do
your own undifferentiated heavy lifting
don't build your own data centers it's a
big distraction somebody also do it for
you and then from an architecture point
of view rather than trying to impose
architecture on everything else of chief
architects after opening up somewhere in
2010 I became chief architect the idea
was to use simple map patterns and
automate them with tooling so you
document the paths that work you don't
prevent people from inventing new paths
so there's a little bit about creating a
path of least resistance for the top but
you buy automation and tooling but not
constraining everybody to follow it so
it's kind of a carrot rather than a
stick approach and they're finally
moving to self-service cloud took a
whole bunch of things that used to be
impossible and made them into made just
made them instant and you can deploy an
enormous Li large infrastructure for
experimental purposes for a weekend and
there's some things that you just could
never even think about doing in in a
data center based environment I need 200
terabytes of SSD who can get that
in 20 minutes I mean if you have a big
enough AWS account limit anybody can get
it in 20 minutes right maybe you know
you have to be able to get enough
instances but that's really all it comes
down to so this this is so what's going
on is is Netflix and a whole bunch of
other interesting leading companies like
Twitter and Facebook and Google are all
on this leading edge curve and a lot of
enterprises are falling a bit behind so
this is kind of what this looks like
this is simon wadley's simon wordly
diagram so there's the adoption of cloud
and rest of world and I'm on this green
line and the rest of the world is on
this they have no ignore ignore ignore
no no I said no damn it
oh no and then oh I had to cover up the
word and but what's happened now is that
everyone the rest of the enterprise is
actually we're in this now point where I
say now we're somewhere in this point
now where Enterprise is now rapidly
converging and this gap between the
early adopters and the end the incumbent
so this is the sort of disruptive people
are on this green line tracking it and
the incumbents are on this this red near
the orange line there
so this is really interesting and the
gap here is what's what became
interesting to me so as everyone else
suddenly starts trying to catch up it
became what I basically decided to do
decided was that by leaving Netflix I
could go out and engage with all of
these large enterprises and work with
all the companies which are adopt which
are exploiting this gap right so I'm
talking to SAS companies and enterprise
IT companies that are trying to figure
out how to help Enterprise make this
change and there is a huge change going
on in Enterprise IT right now as they
retool for continuous delivery and cloud
and DevOps and all of these kinds of
things so that's kind of what I'm up to
and why I'm why I'm you know left
Netflix to go work for for a battery
ventures so I'm gonna talk a bit about
the nature of innovation and what we're
really talking about here is speed and
what are you trying to speed up we're
trying to speed up the innovation what
do you mean by innovation
so innovation is really about having new
ideas and that new idea you want to turn
it into a new product so there's
products on the on the you know the the
incumbent make new products all the time
and disruptors make all the products all
the time so so what's the difference
what is the difference between a
disruptive new product and something
coming out of you know the incumbent the
old world but it really comes down to
these the assumptions you're making
they're making different assumptions
about what is going on in the world and
then they're optimizing their business
model for those assumptions and the
problem is is this is a really good
quote isn't what you don't know that
gives you trouble it's what you know
that ain't so so what the incumbents are
doing is they're Optima they're making
an assumption that is no longer true and
they're optimizing their business model
for it maybe it used to be true when
they originally made the assumption then
they built a business model they
optimized around it and they've been
going down that path ever since and the
trick here is that if you spot something
that that everyone thinks is true that
isn't true anymore then you can disrupt
them now how do incumbents really really
drive their business what they do is
they follow the dollars I say it's fine
we still own 90% of this market these
disruptors are only ten percent we're
fine right the trouble is that dollars
are lagging indicator of market what
happens if the replacement technology is
is ten percent of the cost
right now you're in a 50-50 markets
point when you still own ninety percent
of the dollars right but as that as or
if the replacement cost is it's open
source maybe it's free right how do you
measure replacing a multi-billion dollar
market with something that's free by
looking at the dollars you just see the
dollars magically shrinking until
there's nothing left there's no market
to adopt so what you're looking for is
the disruptors on finding something that
used to be expensive right and then you
learn to waste that expensive thing that
used to be expensive to save money on
something else that other people can't
do so quite often you're wasting some of
it what used to be an expensive resource
to save yourself time in somewhere else
so I'll give you some examples to make
this a bit clearer and one of them is
really
the example solid-state disk solid-state
disk replacing as replacing regular
disks you know decades of research into
storage subsystems all of those academic
papers on elevator seeks and you know be
trees and all of these layouts on disk
are basically to get around the fact
that there are bits of metal moving
around and spinning rest right head
movement and spinning us and it's you
know decades and decades and decades of
research into everything optimized
around you know old-style discs where
random reads are horribly expensive
because you have to move metal to
actually get there but on solid-state
this random reads are basically free you
can do as many of them as you possibly
want but updates are expensive and so
what you actually want to do in in the
new world is you've got this world where
random reads are free immutable rights
are low cost but updates are expensive
so you end up wanting to build something
that's more of a log merge file system
and there's some research into this but
almost all this technology we're using
is not built for this new world there's
also been some changes in packaging so
if you think about a solid-state disk
packaging first of all they just put it
in something that looked like a disk so
you can ask what you have in your
old-style laptops and the original solid
state disks they came with this
interfaces on them and then people said
well you know we don't really need that
disk interface we can jam it on a PCI
card and put it on the i/o bus and now
again why actually you know you can just
stick it on a dim car to put it in the
memory and one of the you know I didn't
used to worry about hardware for the
last few years because I was a Netflix
and they don't care about hardware but
battery actually is this is actually a
battery investment is this memory
channel so now you get a memory dim with
a few hundred gigabytes of solid-state
disk on it and the memory bandwidth into
this is ridiculously high in it's so
fast and it's so low and the cost is low
and and you know you're just using
unused memory slots that you would
normally put Ram in you're putting
putting solid-state disk in them so this
is just moving closer and closer and you
can't get a piece of you know a physical
disk and stick it in a memory slot
that's not
happen right right so this is a
technology couldn't do so what happens
when you'd bring solid-state disk into
into this world so there's a couple of
different ways the traditional storage
architecture looks something like this
you've got your business logic some kind
of master slave database with some sort
of replication between them a fabrics
and fabric Network Ethernet whatever and
a bunch of storage rows with disks and
maybe a tape drive off at the site so
that's traditional and you're putting
solid state disks in the bottom instead
of spinning rusts the new model though
the kind of thing that netflix is
running on with Cassandra
they're just nodes and the memories in
the nodes I mean I don't really care how
the memory got into the nodes whether
it's you know dims or disks it doesn't
matter but you I don't know you just get
these things from AWS and they have disk
in them and they have lots of SSD we do
backups to cloud objects store so I
don't even you know don't even know
where that is but you know you can sort
of spread these things around it's very
cheap so I don't need tapes either so
well what's going on here on the left
you get people like pure storage
disrupting EMC by optimizing their whole
business model around solid-state disk
so that is actually quite interesting
because it's they're able to do things
by by optimizing solid state disks in
and they're disrupting that piece of the
storage industry if you look at the
right there's no sand management
software there's no storage management
software there's no sign admins no DBAs
there's a whole stack of people and
management tools and technologies and
there's a multi-billion dollar business
in the stacks on the left and the right
there's I got an instance from AWS I ran
some open source software on it yeah the
admin on the right is a you know Java
distributed systems developer who
understands how Cassandra works okay
there is no other admin ops people
they're here to keep Cassandra running
you probably need some people that just
dedicated to keep updating and things
but they still need to be Java
distributed systems people rather than
sign admins
the thing on the right contains no
revenue at all for the traditional
software vendors I did this at a storage
industry conference and there were a few
white faces in the audience it's
disrupting an entire industry and you
know the thousands of instances running
at Netflix like this that replaced what
used to be no big data center with
Oracle and sands and stuff like that so
but they probably say yeah but maybe it
doesn't scale well no it does scale it
scales beyondblue de Chris and I'm gonna
show how that works
Cassandra scalability I ran a whole
bunch of benchmarks over the years it
scales up it scales linearly in the
benchmarks and in production if you want
more capacity is double the size of the
cluster you get double the storage and
double the throughput it's very very
linear Netflix runs 288 nodes there are
peat other people in production running
hundreds of nodes it's just you know
that's known to work it's in common use
there are a few people running thousand
node clusters and there is testing going
on in the scale in the thousand to ten
thousand range I was talking to the data
stacks guys and patrick McFadden and he
said they are actively going to test
10,000 node Cassandra clusters because
they have customers that want to do that
and have no idea what they would want to
do that but but it's okay so that's
thousands to ten thousands of nodes well
x what is a node let's ghost look at
what we could build this out of so let's
see the high end the highest end current
AWS incidence and some of you may know
this but they come up this think of the
I to 8x large it's got six point four
terabytes of SSD and it does over
300,000 I ops that's one node right it's
already kind of pretty good I think so
let's do a hundred of those well that's
30 million I ops and 640 turrets that's
ludicrous I think and then it's just do
a thousand nodes is plaid basically so
there we go we go to plat here light
speed ridiculous speed ludicrous speed
we go to plaid the Spaceballs reference
for those of you that haven't been
watching movies for the last 20 years
and so it's just is crazy you couldn't
possibly need that much capacity so I
think I think we've got Cassandra is
disrupting things here
it's got this new global distribution
you've got high availability you've got
or the ridiculous scalability so so that
that's an interesting sort of example of
how solid state disks and open source
software disrupting a whole industry and
the residence use still assuming that
you need have to hire storage admins to
look after these things and have San
fabrics sets the cooked product
development now and I think who here has
a product development process yeah so
why do you have a process here what is
the assumption you're making I think
you're assuming that you have a process
to prevent problems from happening right
and the more and the more problems you
have the more process you will have and
you keep going around that loop until
you become a really big company where
you can't get anything done because you
have so much process but that it
prevents problems happening so this is
kind of what product development looks
like you have a business need so you
spend weeks documenting it then there's
an approval process that takes weeks and
then you go and argue with hardware
vendors for a few weeks and then you
write software for weeks or months or
whatever and then you'd start deploying
it and that takes a while and then
customers eventually say it sucks and
this is about you know nine months later
or something like that so we want to
speed this up because you don't want to
find out a year after you built some
started building something that your
idea sucks you want you want to be able
to speed this up so let's let's put some
infrastructure-as-a-service in here and
replace these first these two steps with
a with an infrastructure cloud so it's a
bit quicker now so now your your process
looks like this you got a product
manager a development team QA team ops
deploy team in business analytics so
you've kind of got rid of that
facilities management and hardware
ordering stage and your process looks a
bit like this oh yeah so it's a bit
better and you can get all the art your
hardware from basically off a public
cloud to private clouds they just put up
some examples here to give the idea of
what what I'm talking about all right
so that makes sense but it still takes
they're still taking months to get stuff
done or maybe weeks maybe you've sped it
up two weeks it's still a fairly slow so
a lot of people are just happy that they
got this far so let's see if we can
speed it up a bit more and replace this
software provisioning piece in the
middle here with the platform so we put
a pass cloud in there we take out this
chunk and now we have a product manager
talking to a developer who deploys their
own code to production somehow using the
platform and then the bi team measure
what happened and fed it back so now you
going a little bit quicker and there's
lots of possible platforms here I've got
a few things you might recognize
continuity's are sort of a Hadoop based
platform and so the rest of these are
mostly just a standard development
platforms so now you can get around this
loop but you're no longer doing any
entire product you're not sort of
gathering together the work of a hundred
developers and every two weeks and
making this massive mega bundle which QA
beat into shape and then finally the
train goes and you stick your code in
and then you find it's broken and back
it all out because one piece of it was
broken instead what you're doing is
feature by feature everyone's deploying
a feature at a time independently and
that sounds a bit more chaotic and we'll
talk a bit about that as well but what
we've got now is we can get around this
in a few days and you can turn around an
entire product idea to get the feature
into production in maybe a week into end
and if it's just a fix or something like
that you can probably get stuff out the
same day because there is there's no
handoffs left in here so but it turns
out a lot of people build the same
products over and over again
particularly internal apps for business
right how many people run have payroll
every company has payroll okay so years
ago like ADP and people like that and
just did payroll as a service so now
everyone uses ADP or companies like that
so it's not a new idea that you would
want to just have a standard business
app but that's really what SAS is so
think think of infrastructure as a
service as ops people no longer having
to talk to facilities people and
hardware vendors right so you've just
cut out that whole area but you still
have ops people running your cloud once
you get a platform the ops people have
been replaced by an API well they're
still there but they're behind an API
right from the from a developer's point
of view they call the API and it doesn't
really matter whether it's an internal
or an external API the ops is happening
behind that API so it's ops people no
longer having to have meetings with with
developers not having to have meetings
with ops is platform now if you have
business people that don't have to have
meetings with developers that SAS so
let's replace the the whole development
bit with some SAS kind of thing and now
you've got a GUI builder and/or
configuration tool and there's your
product and if you've got a link wrong
or you don't like the color or it
doesn't do what you want you push some
buttons and you know ten seconds later
it changed or whatever so there's a few
people in this area there's lots of them
Salesforce have a lot of optimization
there's a there's a platform they have
for building apps that's like this as
mendax in this sort of it's some kind of
building internal apps there's platform
for building big data apps that
enterprise web be up later do something
similar to this and then there's all of
those actual apps that actually do
things were you just configuring it and
just just pretty much every app now is
delivered as SAS
yeah if I look at the battery portfolio
90% of them are SAS but the the loop now
it takes seconds to change something so
what's actually happening here is that
over and over again we're reducing the
cost and the size and the risk of the
change and were able to increase the
rate of the change so that that's the
trick so what does this look like if
you're doing continuous delivery on
cloud we're trying to get around this
ODA loop to start with we're trying to
observe something so we'll call this the
innovation piece right we see a land
grab opportunity we're going to take
over the world so Netflix is just taking
over country by country by country or
you're you've got a competitor you saw a
competitor do something you want to
respond to that or some yeah you see
three or four bug reports that sound
kind of similar
maybe there's a customer pain point it's
the next thing you want to do is some
analysis you want to go dig out from the
logs all the customers that have that
same error all right and that made that
so
the key point here and they call this
Big Data that the difference between big
data analytics and the old-style
business intelligence is the old bi side
was about okay there's a report I know
I'm going to need every week and it
needs to be accurate so I will spend
months crafting that report and
validating it and then I know how much I
sold last week right your weekly sales
report is a bi report that has to be
accurate and you know you're going to
need that what I'm talking about here is
rummaging around in log files that no
one's ever looked at before crossing
together or can't neo combine it
together all kinds of data sources and
so the speed at which you can answer a
question that you've never asked before
is what matters in Big Nate to Big Data
so think of it as how quickly can I get
to an answer for something I've never
asked before and hopefully the developer
of themselves is enabled to go and make
that ask that question or maybe with the
help of a of an analyst then you're
going to plan the response you're gonna
just do it because you're you just have
api's and you're a developer and then
you're going to share that share that
you're doing it because you want to just
hide away and do things we have to share
but you're not asking for permission so
this is part of the culture of freedom
and Trust that you need to go fast and
you can get blocked up on this on this
level and what will look a bit about
DevOps in the next next few slides
now finally using cloud to incrementally
deploy one feature at a time you're
doing automatic deploy the way Netflix
currently works they check code into the
repo that code if it works will
automatically any production everywhere
in the world over the next day or two it
just flows out goes through some
automatic testing canary signature
analysis and that's it right there is no
push process it's I checked this code in
if I put code in the repo it's because I
think it's going it's safe to put it in
production right that's the mindset and
they have most of their large teams
using that model now they specifically
decided not to have the email are you
sure check box thing in there right and
I got some questions about this from
from Andrew Spica yesterday on Twitter
so I thought I'd put a slide in to just
be really clear here what you're doing
is launching code usually behind an a/b
test or behind a feature flag so it's a
non-destructive and and so
you're adding code into the system but
you're not removing the code that's
already there this makes it incredibly
safe to put stuff in production because
you have this immutable code pattern so
you don't change anything when you add
and add and you add new code you add a
new instance running the new code the
old instance is still there so the old
codes in service so the old traffic and
the customers are mostly going through
the old code so the fact that you put
new code into production didn't take
anything away it doesn't cause bugs the
only impacts anybody that gets to see
the new code but it's behind an a/b test
or a feature flag or a version flag okay
so you launch your new service as your
brand-new experiment your and you put
yourself in the a/b test cell for it and
then you keep revving the feat the
version of that with your code pushes
until it looks like it works well enough
to point your QA or some other people or
some internal test users at it maybe the
product manager ends up going to say
yeah that new feature looks like it
works okay and everyone's happy it works
and then you allocate a bunch of people
into a cohort into that test cell and
then they start working on it and you've
got another cohort of users in the
regular a previous experience and you
evaluate whether it's better or worse
than before and then eventually you shut
down the old version and switch everyone
into the new version so you to make the
feature to fall and then eventually you
know much later you you remove all the
old code you shut down the old instances
and you remove the test that you know
redirected everyone into because it's
become embedded so it's incredibly safe
to push to production you everyone's
creating their own little features and
each of these features if you do it
right I mean if you put these features
in one big monolithic block of code it's
a little bit more scary but if you have
microservices you're really creating a
lot of isolation so the disruptor here
is continuous delivery and getting this
right means you can run incredibly
quickly and you can innovate incredibly
quickly and you can learn and you can
get customer feedback in a statistically
significant way in in weeks rather than
spending years or months or quarters or
whatever to to find things out ok let's
let's think about developers and
operations here
and you know the assumption that most
people make is that you know devs do one
thing ops to another thing they're
different and you know you have to Kate
there's a sort of real reasons why you
keep a barrier between them and that's
because developers make code and
operations run code but the trouble is
the developers are grumbling because it
takes them weeks to get a VM alright
that's I've heard this from some of the
biggest customer companies in the world
they have the biggest IT budgets in the
world and they should be able to get
that have the best service and they have
some of the worst service it takes 60 to
90 days to get a VM from firing the
ticket because of all the handoffs well
what we're talking about here is making
operations into a self-service API for
those developers now the Ops guys are
still there building the platform
running it building these API sand
you're operating something but it's a
mixture of internal API is external API
is so there's still stuff to be done in
operations still a massive amount of
innovation there but the boundary
between development operations becomes
an API which means it can be automated
and developers are now running their own
code in production that means developers
are on call ok and you're giving them
freedom but you're also giving
responsibility but now you have
incentives to be responsible because you
don't want to be woken up at 3:00 a.m.
and there's a there's a fundamental
difference here between what happens is
if you give a a production process to a
bunch of ops people they will automate
that process that makes sense right well
they give it that same process to a
bunch of developers they will remove
that process they will automate it out
of existence says I don't see what I can
just if I change my app and I build some
automation on here and in that process
it just collapses to nothing I've seen
that over and over again that's the
difference you get I mean you I'm Kara
I'm sort of over characterizing the
between ops and dev and they're a lot of
people somewhere in between our
experience of both but that's kind of
the caricature mindset right instead of
automating a process remove you know
streamline it remove it shrink it but
shrink it out but what you tend to
reduce then particularly if they're
there are people making money at some
step in that process you know you've got
a product in that process or some you
know you're using a product that but the
people that sell products always want to
increase revenue for their prod
so they want them to automate more and
more of the process whereas developers
will design out entire classes of
products and that's what you saw with my
Cassandra example earlier the developers
designed out all of the operations and
storage management stack completely
that's a clear example
so you think yeah but developers are
going to keep screwing up and so you'll
have lots of outages so they'll go
running to the ops people to fix it well
it turns out the developers there's
actually less downtime in this because
the developers build code that doesn't
break and the developers that can't
figure that out eventually kind of get
to go work somewhere else where they
can't hurt things then you hire people
that can figure this out and it becomes
a self-selecting thing and and if some
of this comes down to having the right
incentives in the system and I have been
having in externalities and problems
with that so there's this this is this
is an old idea but instead of having an
airbag in a car which makes everyone
drive too fast and get into accidents
because you feel safe because you're
surrounded by airbags if you put a
six-inch steel spike in the middle of
the steering wheel on everybody's car if
we won there would actually be fewer
accidents on the road because ever all
be so careful right so think of the fact
that your code is in production and
you're got you're on the page of duty as
every developer having that six-inch
steel spike that says if I hit and push
on this code I could get that call this
weekend when I want to be out hiking
with my family right so I'm going to
think twice about whether that but if
you've got an ops guy are throw it over
the wall he'll get the call this weekend
you know if probably if you know how to
fix it so so you end up with a higher
quality production because of the
automation and because of the the peril
involved in doing it is actually you've
tightened this feedback loop so people
say so you're you're avoiding creation
of these externalities and then you
think well yeah but you're spending all
this time doing it but it turns out that
that weekly meeting you have all that
daily meeting you have depending on how
fast you're going to go to explain to
the Ops guys how your code works and
mostly it just works but you still have
to have the meeting in case it broke
okay this is the current state of nice
code that in production yeah
you've got to have that regular meeting
if you don't have that meeting because
you're doing it yourself you just saved
a lot of time and it turns out that you
you spend more time explaining to
operations how your code works then you
spend on call fixing it so yeah you
still get woken up occasionally to fix
it but it's it actually works better
this way so this is this is a little bit
counterintuitive again you know there's
everything you know is wrong kind of
kind of thought that that you can have
developers operating stuff in production
and it is more reliable and it is less
time for them to do it and which that's
that's the experience we got at Netflix
now you still have to get there and
we'll talk a bit about that
so upses devops is a reorg right it's
like we all the devil's people keep
telling you if you created a DevOps team
you're making it worse it's a reorg it's
not a new team to hire and one of the
problems here is that that's a big
cultural problem so this is really the
ultimate underlying disruptor building a
high trust culture and getting the sort
of DevOps model in place that's
something that's very difficult I saw a
tweet yesterday where somebody said is
DevOps ready for the enterprise so they
didn't think DevOps was ready for the
enterprise and says no no that's
backwards yeah there's a bunch of
enterprises that aren't ready for DevOps
and they're the ones being disrupted by
the enterprises that are figuring out
how to do DevOps right if your
enterprise or what your organization is
capable of this kind of cultural
disruption you will be the early adopter
the leading innovator because you can go
so much faster and whoever isn't able to
do it is going to be left behind and
that is why you're seeing enterprises
now trying to adopt DevOps because they
see that as you know agility is a
competitive advantage is what's driving
them and you're hearing this more and
more now that agility is important if
you go to any but any any CIO and say or
any organization say would you like your
products your software products to take
longer to get out no nobody wants them
to take longer would you like them to be
quicker yes ok so this is how you make
them much quicker so it's what you know
that ain't so is the problem and you
know and you keep running on these old
assumptions and eventually
be clear from as long as you haven't
looked down you don't actually fall into
the canyon like like Wiley coyote so how
do you avoid that
first of all these assumptions that
you're making make sure they're explicit
think really hard about the assumptions
you're making and then think about the
trends in those assumptions is this is
this thing that is currently expensive
is it gradually getting cheaper is it
getting cheaper is it suddenly going to
get you is it about to be replaced by
some technology that obsoletes it think
about that the other thing is if you're
a vendor listen to people who aren't
your customers right you know if you're
a big database vendor yeah my database
customers are all buying my database
that's great what about all the people
that you never hear from because they're
not buying your product you need to
understand why they're not buying a
product what they're doing instead and
then you can understand how quickly
you're being disrupted developer
adoption is a leading indicator of a
product mover of an innovation and
dollar spend is a leak lagging indicator
so if you if you hear people saying the
market is Blair and we're okay because
of the dollars they're following a
lagging indicator if somebody says you
know hey look at some docker or
something which has this great developer
ecosystem and you know look at how many
committers they have on their project
that's a leading indicator that that
tells you that that's going to be
something but the dollars in docker
right no tiny but in terms of is it
significant as a leading indicator I
think it is and then you've got to look
at the evolution things that were
leading edge products become services
and then they become utilities and they
become less and less interesting push
them out stop doing them concentrate on
the innovation stage unless I mean if
there are companies who opt whose
business is to optimize a utility I mean
you still need those companies but
they're less interesting from product
development you know product well from
the point of view and then you have to
reorganize your teams for the speed of
execution and that usually means
creating a sort of a vertically
integrated teams Amazon call this the
two pizza team that owns everything
about a product you've got the product
manager in there you own your own data
sources you have a high trust
small team that is able to go and build
something and everything outside that
team is a sort of accessed via an API
which is sort of untrusted you kind of
you know you can't and the internet
works like is if you're building a
typical application you know like a
mobile app it probably depends on tens
of different API is from across the
internet my better Google Maps in it a
few monitoring things some some you know
you know crash tracking apps and things
like this so they're all these API s and
those api's are all built by teams that
you don't control they're all vendors or
they're all things that you consume so a
lot of people now are used to building
this idea where I have my trusted team
that's building a thing and then there's
this untrusted API driven world out
there that's changing asynchronously and
I just have to deal with the fact that
every now and again there's a new
version of some API and it'll happen
asynchronously to what I want to do so
what you're doing here is creating a
bounded context from domain driven
design ideas that it lets you deal with
what you want to do so now I've got a
bit more time gonna talk about how we
get there so first thing is how far you
know how far how crazy does this sound
right if this if this is you know
crossing the chasm problem then you
really need to start with the Phoenix
project so this is a quote I gave them
which is on the back of the book so if
you're new decking alligators and you're
trying to drain the swamp and get this
book and give it to all of the
executives and try and get them to
understand it's a novel it's really a
horror story about development that's
it's about everything yeah the first
half of the book is incredibly
depressing as stuff goes more and more
and more wrong and everyone will say all
that happened at where I worked all that
happened where I work that's so it's
full of that kind of stuff but thanks
for the miracle of DevOps and Kanban and
no fluffy pink unicorns and things like
that it gradually gets better and it's
got a happy ending of course but but you
will recognize everything everything in
here and once you're out of the swamp
it's good to hear that JS is here with
the book so if you if you think you're
out of the swamp and you're just trying
to figure out how to speed everything up
then I think Lane Enterprises is a very
very significant book we're going to be
talking about this book a lot this year
I've had access to some of the early
versions of this just just proofreading
it and things like that I think it's
going to be a very key book it's you
know it's out of the whole lien series
and people have been doing lean
analytics and lean startups now the
enterprise's are trying to figure out
how to do this - okay so you're out of
the swamp you've got some ideas which
Ben did you go to to buy your stuff you
know where do you get all your code from
to go build this stuff well it's it's
all open source right yeah you can buy
support from vendors but you know you're
really the almost everything we do now
almost everything that Netflix does
comes from github and companies I'm
talking to the technology they're basing
on is the most advanced scalable and
stable code you can get is open source
code and those products you used to buy
from big vendors they don't scale very
well and when they break it takes
forever to get them to patch it and all
those kinds of problems and they cost a
lot of money so you just got rid of your
procurement cycle that's nice and fast
you can fix it yourself you can extend
it yourself you can join a community to
help something and then also on github
is where you find your developers so you
know if you want to go and hire the best
people for a particular project you go
and see who's the committee's on that
project who are the people working who
are whose active you can see that
publicly because you can see who's
forked it who's putting fixes in and it
becomes a recruiting tool and that means
that developers are incented to
contribute back to projects because that
rate makes them more valuable and this
is tricky because if you're a company
and you have your developers maybe you
don't want them to become more valuable
because then they'll leave but also if
you actually are active yourself on
github as a company you start attracting
the best developers and there are many
cases where where Netflix has acquired
some of the top developers in the field
because it's got a very strong github
presence in a very strong open source
place so if you only or a major
contributor to an interesting project
you want to go work somewhere where that
that is going to be supported and then
you can go look at you know the highest
end you know you end up sort of for the
projects that are most critical you end
up sort of getting the code like the
Apache
level people and then you can see who's
really using stuff and you know like if
you look at a cassandra for example I
think they're now free of the Apache
committers are now work at Apple so
that's probably one of the biggest users
of Cassandra right now but they don't
like talking about what they do but they
can't not talk about the fact that they
have three Apache committers on stuff so
that's that leaks out so you're building
this extensible platform you created an
ecosystem around it there's lots of
benefits here it's very agile but the
other thing is when you're open sourcing
your own code you're you can can try and
control it a lot but really what you're
trying to do is ubiquity is worth more
than control so apache license is the
one that the all-in netflix stuff is
apache license or that everything they
consumes is apache license everything
they generate it's a this permissive
license is really important too okay so
you can go and get hub so what are you
where you get which pages should you go
I get hub wish you go look for stuff
well let's we've taught a lot about
Netflix so there's the 40-plus projects
that do stuff this built this is
basically a highly available cloud
native platform based around stateless
microservices immutable code instant
rollback all the kinds of technologies
I've been talking about but also in
automatic deployments order scale
capacity distributed around the world
and this denormalized single denormalize
data store so we can go find those
projects but you're going to get
technical indigestion trying to keep up
with the tech block it's it's really
hard work to just keep up with the stuff
that they keep putting out there and and
as I was trying to get people to
understand what Netflix was doing that
was actually the biggest problem they
think it's just too much of of it so
you're hitching yourself tour to a
runaway train or something I know it's
that if you decide to get on this one
you'd better already be able to go fast
because this whole thing is moving
incredibly quickly it's not a nice
stable release that's going to sit there
for a year for you to base on so that's
that's kind of the good and the bad of
it
so I mentioned micro services a few
times so I'm going to try and define
micro services and it is you know what's
the turn three
that and service-oriented architecture
which has been around for a while and I
think that the two key things here one
is that it's a loosely coupled SOA SOA
with all those wisdom things and soap
and all that stuff was tightly coupled
and you ended up doing this sort of
global enterprise architecture based on
SOA where everything was centrally
controlled and managed so what we want
to do here is have a loosely coupled
architecture based on rest calls mostly
and use bounded context and by a bounded
context I mean that everything you need
to know is bounded here you can
understand everything about this domain
and that is the micro service right you
don't really need to understand much
about everything else that's going on as
long as you're you understand who's
consuming your service and what it
depends upon you've got this context and
that's a key concept from domain driven
design which some of you probably read
the book on that so what happens when
you do that and let's try and compare
scaling these these models so in a
monolithic model if you want to get some
code out you basically need to get on
the train you sort of buy a train ticket
you can only have so many people at a
time on a train microservices everyone
has their own build they're all leaving
asynchronously instead of having
everyone running this monolith you just
no need to run your own bit so your your
your your context your bounded context
is smaller than needing to understand
what's going on in the bigger one
there's no waiting there's no meeting so
it's quicker you don't have to
coordinate for a product release it's an
API call to base there's a timeline
service at Netflix and every time you do
a push it up entry is made into this
timeline so if everything just breaks
you go look at the timeline who just
changed something okay go back and
revert that last change it's very fast
but it's it assumed it isn't everyone
coordinate and pay a lot of attention
we're just about to make change it's it
assumes that there isn't going to be a
problem you don't need to learn the
deploy process you check code in and it
flows to production your instead of
copying code to existing servers and
replacing the old code which means that
you really have to roll forward you
still have all the old code running you
can have as many concurrent versions as
you want which is also why you don't
want to have to
explain the state of your system to the
Ops people because it's too complicated
you have all these different but over
the old version that version this ones
in test this one if the traffic's being
routed through them in this complicated
way I know how it works and if you call
me at 3:00 a.m. I will make the right
change to fix it right that's what
matters and you can roll back forward
back in seconds and you know these to be
that done was when you gave your code to
QA and then you know we've moved on a
bit now done is when it's running in
production is what people people
typically think now but then this model
done is when you remove your code from
production when that line of code is no
longer running anywhere in the world
you're done if you have some of your
code running you own it right so you're
not done and to see that your incentive
to remove old stuff from production in
case it breaks right so that that's
that's another incentive the correct way
back into the developers right because
they're not done and while it's still
running so how are we separating these
concerns and and how do you structure it
so Conway's law says that the code will
follow the the code will follow the
communication structure of the
organization so let's set up a
communication structure within the
organization that reflects the code we
want to build let's turn that backwards
so you don't try and fight Conway's law
you you basically use it as a lever so
you own your own service groups you own
your own back end stores you create a
team and you say you can own you can
build anything you want within that team
and that team will go and create that
and then the communication network
between teams will be the API calls
between them so the size mount lines of
code in a micro service doesn't really
matter a lot of the Netflix ones are
sort of 30 gigabyte ram we're on a
single VM they're pretty huge really but
they do one thing there's a single verb
it's its own build so you don't have
this trunk conflict you can build out of
all versions of things new versions of
things you're not trying to manage
within one monolithic thing how many
versions of the same code can you have
it's it's a problem whereas if you have
lots of copies of the code you can have
different versions of things you need
some kind of container and then you know
you can use the Tomcat Java container
baked into an ami is what Netflix uses
nowadays a lot of people are actually
trying to merge
with the Netflix OSS and the other
things it's a nice container doesn't
really matter as long as you have some
kind of container that's moving this
code around that becomes relatively
immutable within that container and
you're building stateless business logic
so you can so it's a field of capital
kind of field of servers and for few of
them die you can just replace them so
you may have heard of the capital vs.
pets analogy if your machines have
individual names and you care if they're
alive or not
it's a pet right if it's a field of
things and if a few of them die you just
replace them and you don't care as long
as you still have some in the field
they're cattle right so think of it like
that
and even the stateful data layer can be
ephemeral Netflix uses chaos monkey to
kill its Cassander instances
continuously to prove that they are
report Ematic alehrer placing themselves
to prove that they can so it is a
totally managed system where the the
discs within those machines those
stateful instances are being deleted
along with the data just be really clear
on that and as soon as you delete it
there's three copies so the new one
comes up and it sucks the data from the
other two and ten minutes or half an
hour depending on how much data is on it
later
they they they're back running again
fully triple redundant but they can run
on two out of three at any time so what
does the development of key texture look
like well there's this problem that if
people there's this argument you get
over where there should be client
libraries for an API and if you start
with a raw protocol you'll find the
first thing that happened to somebody
will write some code that talks to it
and then that will become a client
library which they will share with their
friends and you have this slightly
broken client library that doesn't
really understand your service that gets
adopted by everybody else and then
eventually someone tries to give it back
to you to maintain and that that will
happen is I've seen that happen
everywhere I get the knowing nods in the
audience yet so you have to control your
API and control the client libraries and
yes you might have to write it in a few
different languages but there is an
immense strategic advantage from doing
that one of the things one of the
reasons MongoDB is incredibly successful
is that they have a very good set of
client libraries for a very low wide
range of platforms I gave an extremely
strong start in the market and it makes
them very productive for develop
so that is a huge strength and sort of
looking at that from from the cassandra'
point of view Casandra sort of easier to
deploy and manage at scale but its
client libraries story was a whole bunch
of mixed up open-source stuff and they
didn't control those clients and that
was a one of the things that slowed down
cassandra in the early days they're both
kind of you know trying to fit you know
because MongoDB is working on scaling
better and cassandra is working on
getting better client libraries and
they're sort of all gradually coming
back into line but but that you can see
so strategically it's very important to
control that if you're trying to do
these fine grow these services that call
lots of other services you eventually
realize you can't just read have
blocking calls to them you have to be
multi-threaded and the the whole
observable model reactive model using
observable is a very clean way of doing
that's really becoming popular now I
know it spend more time talking about it
but go look at that go look at Bend
Christensen's papers presentations are
from Netflix and there's a lot of
research and lot of interesting things
happening there now and then when a
service breaks you've got to be
resilient to it so you know I gave
release it to the API team at Netflix
about three years ago and they went and
implemented circuit breakers and
bulkheads and and hysterics and then
eventually at a conference I introduced
them to Michael Nygaard and said we've
built all this stuff and it's all yeah
finally right so we've got those ideas
in code that you can just go download
and use and a lot of people are now
starting to adopt those ideas much more
explicitly so those work really well and
the Netflix stuff is very very organized
around sort of cloud-based dynamic
dynamic stuff if you're more data center
based and you're building your own
infrastructure then my sauce is looking
good and a lot of the stuff that's
happening out of Twitter is very
interesting so they're using Apache
mezzos and they they have their own sort
of micro services model based on finagle
and Zipkin okay a few more minutes so I
mean I'm running out of time so data
stores I've talked a bit about this
there's you always end up building a
data access layer Netflix built a
prototype one called stash which has my
sequel and Cassandra behind it but it
turns it into an HTTP
and you can go add mod that it's
pluggable you can add more in there if
you're worried about cap and consistency
and most people have been taught that
their transactions be atomic and all
that stuff first thing you should do is
go and read the Jepsen series of most
databases or systems that you're
probably using have been tortured to
death by by Kyle you should go read how
he tortured them and what they really do
and don't do and then you know this is
this kind of speaking as a physicist
there are laws of physics and speed of
light and everything there is actually
no such thing as a coherent consistent
as a consistent distributed system so
you should get over it and and if you
want to be available just work out work
out how to avoid needing consistency
because it isn't really there anyway you
just think you have it and if that's why
you have outages right or a lot of the
outages so then there's a couple more
things great you've got all this stuff
you want to go build it and then you go
to management go yeah we want to build
this and then but the product manager
wants you to best spend all your time
building new features so how do you do
with that
so there's some strategies here for
dealing with product managers and
there's the the carrot strategy is we're
gonna be able to build stuff for your
quicker with micro services oh yeah that
sounds good all right so go and do it
right no but we're not gonna implement
this feature until we finish building
our micro service based system right so
for Netflix that was actually the move
to cloud was one of those stick ones
which says the old database that they
hold code base was not internationalized
it only did English the product managers
wanted to do rest of world and Spanish
and French and all these other languages
and says we are only implementing that
in the cloud in the new system so the
cloud-based Cassandra based system is
the only version of Netflix that
understands localization languages the
old DVD data center code only
understands English so this idiom if you
want to do the rest of the world you've
got to let us go and do this cloud thing
and then the shiny object was like okay
don't worry about being a ps3 user
interfaces instead of the website while
we're moving the website was actually
what happened at Netflix but that's the
shiny object strategy like don't worry
about you get it there's a section of
this code where I need to get stopped
changing it so I can move it go worry
about some other piece of the code and
Khan
and trade on changing that and then
we'll get to that later and we'll flip
back and forth so that's kind of the
shiny thing all right I've got that I
did a presentation a few weeks ago at
monitor Armour and I've just got some
summary stuff here from that so I'll go
through this pretty quickly problems
with monitoring this stuff high rate of
change the ephemeral configurations this
machine only exists for a few hours how
do you monitor it for happening my
graphs want to do for weeks so how do I
have a little how do I a granade
everything properly complex calling
patterns you're trying to track
everything and how many of these service
micro services do you have anyway so
here's a graph of what happens when you
convert to micro services from Gilt
Groupe they they're on a 450 and heading
upwards and this was earlier this year
Netflix has over 600 you end up with
these what's your architecture diagram
well this is actually from that same
gilt presentation and this actually only
shows 12 of their services this is what
the Netflix architecture diagram looks
like in the system a talk from Twitter
from cuke on London showing their
architecture diagram and I call these
the Deathstar and that the real the real
gilt groupe one with 450 would look
exactly the same so all architecture
diagrams turn into a circle of illegible
icons with lines between them and you
have to go and figure this out and you
have to stop needing to draw that okay
and it changes continuously as well so
there is no sort of version of this but
time you've yeah you have to go build
some tooling to do this and Twitter seem
to have built some interesting tooling
for it and that's kind of one of those
d3 code graphs or something there's a
few tools that attempt to visualize it
app dynamics instruments the JVM and the
headers and you start doing HTTP
injection with tags and things so
there's some interesting techniques
there boundary and cloud weaver have
some other approaches for kind of doing
this at the network layer or you can
instrument your own things and the
Netflix pass is instrumented with
transaction tags that in every request
and sub tags so you can actually go and
construct this yourself and when you do
it sort of built into the platform you
get some better scalability
characteristics some other implications
changes are smaller but they're more
frequent
individual change is going to be broken
you want to you're flipping these
feature flags back and forth so instant
detection matters so how fast can you
tell and I have some slides here on that
if you're monitoring minute by minute
something broke it takes you a couple of
minutes before your agent on the machine
even notices and then it sends it to the
monitoring system and then it gets
processed and then eventually you get
one point on a graph that's above the
line you go ah maybe there's something
wrong but you need several of them
before you're triggering and alert
otherwise you get alerts all the time
so maybe like eight to ten minutes later
you realize that something's not quite
right
and all you did was turn on a feature
right so what didn't mean that sorry
turn the feature back off so if it takes
you 10 20 minutes to tell that you
actually did fix it it's working you
know 10 minutes to tell you broke it
another 10 decide to say to figure out
you fixed it it's bad if it takes you
seconds to do that probably people
wouldn't even notice you if you can do
stuff in less than a browser timeout it
works pretty well so let's do that again
except monitoring by the second so it
broke at the same time we measured it in
a second we saw it as high in a second
it got to the monitoring system a second
later we saw it it looks pretty bad and
we're going to go fix it oops sorry too
far so you know in a few seconds you can
see it you flip it back a few seconds
later you know you fixed it so it's very
important that you have ways to get out
the systems directly when you're
flipping these feature flags on enough
so hysteresis that has this thing and
called turbine which lets you aggregate
the traffic from lots of different
systems and do these one second update
graphs that show you which circuit
breakers are flipped on enough and that
is your browser is connected directly
over a continue it's just sending JSON
over a socket it's a probably call that
forgotten the technology name but
basically you can connect directly to
one service and turbine is an aggregator
that grabs an entire herd of services
and aggregated into a single flow so you
can see what's happening that level but
there's no in
immediate system in this only there's no
collection in this system it just
basically gives you you know 10 to 10 to
30 seconds of history of what's going on
and you can see at the bottom there you
know if it's the difference in a good
and a bad so bookmark now what is it
it's a circuit breaker flips and it goes
read and things about there's a couple
of products out there that also do
seconds and this is the SAS service that
collects data from your machines on a
one-second interval and aggregates them
and shows you what's going on so you
could use those as well so it's
certainly possible to build a back-end
service I don't know any open source
tools right now that do one second level
aggregation and passing on through
because it's actually a pretty hard
problem it took bound really long time
to build their back-end that can do this
and it's it's an interesting just
figuring out how boundary works is
actually an interesting good thing to go
look so what I'm basically saying here
is your the the latency from something
happening to you seeing it needs to be
less than you say 10 seconds that's kind
of because if you're a developer and you
push the button and it kind of looks
okay because you know to push the button
I'm going to wait 10 minutes let's go
get a cup of coffee and then meanwhile
it broke and you just added another cup
of getting cup of coffee latency to your
outage if you if it happens you'll sit
there wait 10 seconds okay that looks
good I'm fine right you want to be in
that you want to be able to capture the
attention span for a change like that
alright so I'm basically done this is my
summary from the beginning this is what
I learnt at Netflix and hopefully
communicated some of that here and just
to summarize it really boil it down to
two things a lot of this is really about
the old old old thing separation of
concerns making sure that you can move
fast because your concerns are separated
and then bounded context so you don't
blow your brain up trying to understand
too much stuff at once right so that
bounded context is really important so
you know go read the domain driven
design book or the Wikipedia page on
that to figure out more details on it
but those two concepts applied give you
real speed so that's basically it and
that's my you know I don't have time for
questions but your there's lots and lots
of slide decks like this one I will turn
on on SlideShare when I could sit down
in a minute before actually just sitting
there and I've got some real torts
coming up
thanks / thanks it
