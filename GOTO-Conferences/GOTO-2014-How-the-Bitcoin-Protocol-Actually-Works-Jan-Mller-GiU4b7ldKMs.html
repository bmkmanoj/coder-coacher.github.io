Bitcoin protocol actually works so my
name is Jan Miller I'm working for a
company called mycelium in Austria out
of Denmark and we are making Android
apps and other interesting stuff for
sending and receiving Bitcoin but that's
not what I want to talk about today
today I want to talk about how the
Bitcoin protocol actually works so so
this talk is not about the political
environment around Bitcoin or economics
it's not about how you buy and sell and
speculate in Bitcoin is more about how
the Bitcoin protocol actually works so
into the technical stuff this is where I
belong so this talk is pretty compacted
because kind of the first three times
you think you understand Bitcoin you are
probably wrong it is really complicated
and I'm trying to you know put that into
like 45 minutes and you know my hope is
that you know after this presentation
you will only think like two more times
that you are you understand it and you
know so okay so but let's start with the
beginning so how did actually start well
in November 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto
published a white paper to a amazing
list about cryptography and now that
meeting lists a lot of crypto stuff was
discussed and you know one of the things
that have kind of eluded them for a long
time is you know how can you actually
make something that is totally
decentralized and at the same time is
the payment system without any you know
central authorities and things like that
so this has kind of been the holy grail
for many years and along comes this guy
nobody heard of him before and he said
that well here's the solution and you
know it was not really received well
because people they said that come on
you know this nobody cannot just come
along and solve this right but he did
and it took some time like three months
later he made an implementation an
open-source implementation that
everybody could look into and the
network started at that point
now an interesting thing is that nobody
knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is it can be
a man or woman or group of people nobody
knows he has remained anonymous since
the very beginning and sometime in 2010
he disappeared we haven't heard from him
ever more so and that's kind of also a
little bit interesting so but the thing
is that at that point in time enough
people had jumped onto this open source
project and had involved it and he was
not really needed anymore and he may
have had some reasons for being
anonymous because bitcoin is a very
disruptive technology it will if it
really succeeds it will probably
redefine the way we think think money
and a lot of other factors so but this
is there it is ok so but what is Bitcoin
then well bitcoin is the name of a
protocol a peer-to-peer protocol that
governs the rules of the network so all
the nodes in the network they add her to
these rules and enforce them ok VidCon
is also a unit of account so just like
you have a euro Danish kroner our World
of Warcraft gold coins it's something
that you can I can have like 10 bitcoins
and I can you know give them to somebody
else it's a unit of account and you know
the giving coins or somebody else is
what makes Bitcoin a payment system also
so it's a system that allows people to
send value between accounts ok so well
don't we have something like this
already and well to some extent we do so
if we look at common digital payment
systems we have like in Denmark we have
10 court internationally we have visa or
in World of Warcraft we have gold coins
and you know with all these systems
that's on some properties I selected a
few here like you can't increase the
money supply at will so I cannot produce
more Danish kroner in my den court and
it's simply not part of the rules right
I cannot double spend so if I have a bag
of gold coins in World of Warcraft
I cannot both buy a shield and then a
sword for this
bag of coins and another thing
transactions is URIs vid URIs of ability
is that I cannot undo enter that
transaction so once I bought the sword
I cannot kind of go back unless I make
an agreement with the guy who I bought
it from and so so this is what we have
in common digital payment system and you
know it works pretty well except that
and here I've put emphasis on on you
because you can increase the money
supply dwell but somebody can because
these certain systems are centralized so
somebody at the Danish national bank can
start the printing press and you know
produce more money hours or World of
Warcraft they can say well all of a
sudden all the monsters give like 2x the
amount of gold and then all of a sudden
bid rules they change so I can do
counterfeiting but the system can
because it's centralized and the same
thing with double spending so I can
spend the same money twice but others in
the system can like in for instance the
Danish banks they can if I give them a
thousand Kroners they can then lend out
900 Chronos to two different people
based on my money is called fractional
reserve banking and it happens all the
time and it's part of how we increase
the money supply in in Denmark and many
other countries and at the same time
transactions are irreversible with a
Visa card but if I'm a merchant and
somebody comes and buys a pair of shoe
from me then you know if it turns out
that this credit card was stolen then
visa they can reverse the transaction
and take the money right out of my bank
account so that's not really that great
so if we compare this to to Bitcoin and
look at the properties of Bitcoin well
then we also have no counterfeiting but
nobody nobody can increase the money
supply at will there's no central server
that governs the rules it's all
distributed so you just can't do that
another thing transactions are really
irreversible nobody can undo a
transaction and you should take that
with a grain of salt because at the very
tip of things funny stuff happens but we
will get into that and also double
spending so nobody can spend the same
value twice it's just not
possible okay so basically bit consoles
at least two things at least those are
the ones I want to focus on here so it
eliminates trust in the central
authority there is no central place that
kind of is the truth of all things it's
the network so you trust the rules of a
protocol and they are enforced by
mathematics and cryptography another
thing is that bit consoles the
distribution of funds problem because if
you make a new currency who should have
all the value in the very beginning so
if if Satoshi Nakamoto had all the
bitcoins in the beginning and he could
then kind of choose to dish them out
randomly or by some other means well
then you have a centralized system so
how do you create a system that does
this in a decentralized way that
everybody can trust so this is what it's
all about so let's start with the funds
distribution so the way it works in in
Bitcoin is that every ten minutes since
the beginning of the network a random
node in the network receives a reward
okay sounds sounds good and and that
reward started at at 50 bitcoins and
half every four years so okay so but how
does it really work then because how can
you enforce these things how can you
make sure that in a system where nobody
trusts each other that you can make
something happen about every 10 minutes
so and if you actually look at it this
these two rules give a funny
distribution here so in the very
beginning two thousand nine zero
bitcoins existed and then gradually
every 10 minutes 50 bitcoins came into
existence and that continued for the
four first years and we reach about here
and half of the money is now in
circulation so random notes and network
received 50 bitcoins and we have now
distributed the money randomly kind of
and we will get much more into that and
then you know the next 25% of the
monetary value is added over the next
four years and so forth and as you can
see this graph converges on 21 million
sometime in
out here in 2,140 and at that point
there's no more current distribution and
it's kind of over so so this raises some
questions so first of all 21 million
what you know are the only 21 million
coins yes there's never going to exist
more than 21 million that's the maximum
but how does it work like we have 6 7
billion people in the world so they
cannot really all participate in this
well a Bitcoin can be split into very
small fractions like 1 Bitcoin can be
100 million small tiny pieces so 0.001
Bitcoin is what I can send into the
network so that's not really a problem
so but but how are these rules then
enforced and and to understand that we
need to introduce the big invention in
Bitcoin the thing that is at the very
core the thing that didn't exist before
2008 so the new new thing that we have
and this is the blockchain so the
blockchain is a database which contains
all the transactions that ever occurred
in the Bitcoin network and it's like a
public ledger where you can see
everything that happened so all the
nodes in the network they have a full
copy of that blockchain and they keep it
up to date gradually as it increases and
verifies that everything is sound and
some notes in the network if they extend
the blockchain and they're called miners
and we will get a lot more into that
okay so blockchain well just like you
know the name suggests it's a chain of
blocks or a linked list if you will so
basically the blockchain contains a
bunch of blocks and they all point to
the apparent which eventually points at
the Genesis block the very first block
that was a part of the software that was
released and the Genesis block actually
contains the title of a newspaper from
the date that it was issued so to make
sure that it you know didn't exist
before so you can think of the
blockchain as a big accounting book you
know where you have debit and credit
between accounts you know red and black
numbers go
back and forth and every page in that
big accounting book is a block and
anybody can try to add a page to that
block and that's actually what happens
roughly every 10 minutes so anybody can
go ahead and try to do that but it's
computationally hard to do so in
cryptography that's something which is
called a proof-of-work so to do this you
have to prove that you have done a
substantial amount of work because
otherwise it's too easy and we will have
too many blocks so so this is the
problem we want to solve how to make new
blocks appear every 10 minutes on
average so to understand that we need to
go a little bit into cryptography and
introduce Shan 256 so it's commonly used
cryptographically secure one-way hash
function and basically it takes any size
of input and produces exactly 32 bytes
and those 32 bytes are practically
speaking random so if you flip one bit
in the input then you get a totally
different randomly distributed output so
here's an example like if you take
sha-256 of goto then you get you know
this blob there and if you take sha 256
F to go then you get an entirely
different block and the the important
property of that function is that given
any output you cannot calculate the
input that's computationally unfeasible
unless you know the input of course
first so it cannot go back all right so
so this function is used when you want
to mine blocks so how to create a new
block well at any given time we have
like from block 0 to block n where n is
like the tip of the blockchain if you
want to create a new block then you
create both a header and a payload so
the header contains a bunch of fields
and the payload contains the actual
transactions and we will get a lot more
into that later so the first thing to
note here is that the header contains
this previous block hash so it contains
a reference to the parent transaction
that you want to build on top
so in this case we calculate the hash of
the latest block and put it into our our
block header and then we calculate the
hash of our of our of our own header
which is basically just you know sha-256
twice on the header so you hash on those
80 bytes and you're kind of done but
that's a small cat here because this is
trivially easy running Shan 256 you can
do that you know millions of times a
second on computer so that's a catch
here the the block hash must be below
the target difficulty so in essence this
means that at any point in time the
network has decided what the current
difficulty of the network is and the
block hash when you regard it as an
integer it must be below a certain
number so here's an example here we have
block 320 1511 which was mined last week
and the block hash is this number and
and you can notice here that there's a
bunch of series in the beginning so this
is basically there are 64 0 bits in the
beginning of this hash value and because
see a 256 produces a totally random
output and it takes really many attempts
to to get to that hash value so
basically what you do is you create the
header then you notice in the header
there's a nonce field you put in a
random value then you calculate the hash
of those 80 bytes and if it's below the
target yeah we found a block and we can
collect our reward if we didn't then we
go back to 2 and and this happens a lot
of times so last week when I made those
slides the network had a hash rate of
about 250 million Giga hashes a second
so 1 Giga hash is 1 billion hashes a
second so 250 million billion hashes a
second was enough to create this block
in 10 minutes and that's law so my my
computer at home with 4 cores can do
like 2 Giga hashes a second so it's a
it's
so so basically by having the the right
difficulty the network can ensure that
on average it takes 10 minutes to find a
solution to this to this puzzle and
that's the proof of work that Bitcoin
uses so so for this real work well then
you know we cannot have the difficulty
to be a constant because noes are you
know entering the the network and
exiting the network and some are some of
those nodes are mining and some of them
are not it's not everybody who is
looking for these these puzzles and
therefore the difficulty adapts over
time so the way it works is that you see
there the red line here this this stack
hasting is basically the difficulty
observed over time so what the network
does is that every 2016 blocks which is
roughly 14 days it looks at how long
time did it take to calculate all the
all the blocks all those 2016 blocks how
long time did it take and if it was too
fast then we increase the difficulty if
it was too easy then we decrease the
difficulty and every node in the in the
network calculates this difficulty
simultaneously and reaches a result and
this is what we do for the next 14 days
so basically the difficulty arises and
and declines over time and and this is
the way that we ensure that blocks are
found roughly every 10 minutes
sometimes it takes a second sometimes it
takes an hour but on average 10 minutes
so so now that I found this let's say
that I found this solution to this block
okay and and now I want to send it out
into the network so what happens is that
all the notes that are mining they are
then trying to look for the next block
and then they have serve a solution and
there's one rule in the network which is
that the longest chain wins
so basically when they see a result that
and they can verify that it works then
they immediately discard whatever work
they were doing because they want to be
part of the longest chain because if
you're working on a shorter chain then
you don't get this reward so the reward
is only for the winners and and the
winners take it all
so so since that can be more than one
solution to a block because it's
basically just a random value that is
below a number that can be places where
you have Forks where you have two
solutions that appear at the same time
and if you have take a look at this
simplified version of a network where
you have you know a bunch of nodes and
they let's just assume for simplicity
that they are connected to the immediate
neighbors so if the guy down here finds
the solution then and he sends it out
well then it takes some time for it to
propagate in the network and this is
something it takes maybe you know
seconds or I don't know half a minute
for everybody to see it but that's
actually a long time when when you have
new blocks every 10 minutes so what
happens if if a guy in the other corner
of the network finds the solution at the
same time so then you get something like
this well we have two different kind of
futures part of the network so saw this
block up at the top first and another
part of network so the block at the top
at the bottom and so and basically you
don't really know which chain is going
to be the longest but since you want the
reward you want to work at the thing
that you think is going to be the
longest chain so basically you just
start working on the first block that
you see and then hope for the best so
this kind of scenario happens pretty
often like a few times every day or
something so so what happens well you
basically have you know then then
everich separating two camps and they
are all trying to beat each other and
eventually one of the one of the chains
will have a new solution and they will
now have a longer chain and everybody
who have serves this will immediately
stop working on this this other fork and
then jump on to this problem because
there's an incentive to do so
because if you don't well then you will
have to first solve this block and then
the next one before the reward takes in
so so this is a very condensed way of
explaining Bitcoin mining and explaining
current distribution there's a little
bit more to Bitcoin mining when we get
into transactions we will talk about
that in a minute but this is basically
how funds are distributed in the Bitcoin
network you can choose to go ahead and
do this if you want and you could choose
not to I've never personally mind well I
think I mined for a few hours at the
very beginning and then I figured out
that you have to be very good with
screwdrivers and and stuff like that and
I'm not so I decided making software
instead okay so this is distribution of
funds and now we move into how you make
these transactions which is what it's
all about
so in Bitcoin we use public private key
cryptography so basically just like with
when you go to an HTTPS site then we use
RSA and then we verify that the guy
we're talking to is actually the one we
want to talk to and then we use yeah our
say instead of Bitcoin elliptic curves
which vidcon uses the reason why Bitcoin
uses elliptic curves is because they are
the signatures are shorter so the
blockchain will grow less when we have
shorter proofs so in in Bitcoin private
keys are 32 bytes and you can compute
your public key from a private key using
elliptic curve math and there's no
encryption in Bitcoin many people they
say are cryptography must be encryption
but it isn't it's just signing and
verification of signatures okay so these
private keys are very fundamental when
you send transactions but we have to
introduce one more thing which is
Bitcoin addresses so a Bitcoin address
is just like a bank account I can have
some value in an address and I can send
value from an address to another account
they look like some gibberish just like
you know bank bank accounts do in there
in the real world and you can calculate
them from a public key so by doing two
hash operations on a public key you end
up with a Bitcoin address so you can
have as many as you like and basically
because private keys are just random
numbers and believe me 32 bytes of
randomness is a huge
huge number so there's enough for
everybody for in the entire an eternity
so we can have as many private keys as
you want which means you can have as
many Bitcoin addresses as you want and
and nobody really knows who owns which
account so all the transactions in the
network are public everybody can see
them but nobody knows who owns what
money if you have many addresses so so
if there's some degree of being
anonymous in the Bitcoin network but
it's not perfectly anonymous light-like
hashes okay so basically value is moved
between addresses using transactions all
right so let's take a look at
transactions so this is a little bit
simplified a transaction is has a bunch
of inputs and outputs it's just you know
a stream of bytes with a an interesting
encoding so in this example I have three
different inputs and two different
outputs so what happens here is that I
send five Bitcoin from one address and
three Bitcoin from another address and
for Bitcoin for my third address and
they're sent them to two different
addresses so I have my my inputs and my
outputs and this is basically what it
looks like a transaction also has a hash
which is basically sha-256 of the raw
transaction data and this gives you a
unique ID of a transaction
so let's but let's that's more to it so
let's build it up a little bit slowly so
let's say that I want to send ten
Bitcoin to tools sitting right there
so what would I do well I start by
creating my my transaction here with one
output those are the ten bitcoins that I
want to send to tolls and I also add his
Bitcoin address to this record very nice
then I need to have some funding I need
I cannot just you know send money out of
nothing so I need some some inputs from
previous transactions that are sent to
me so I look in the blockchain for
transactions that send something some
value to my addresses and I find these
three
so so at some point somebody sends five
Bitcoin to one of my addresses and then
also maybe a Bitcoin to somebody else
and same here
three bitcoins to one of my addresses it
doesn't have to be the same and then for
Bitcoin so now I have collected funding
for my transaction and if you add it
together you get something like 12
Bitcoin is my input and then I have ten
Bitcoin as as output so in in Bitcoin
you cannot spend some of these outputs
partially you have to spend it all so
basically now I have you know a
difference of two Bitcoin between my
inputs and my outputs so in order to to
fix that I add a second output which
basically sends the remaining two
bitcoins back to myself and that sounds
a little bit odd but it's just like when
you go to go through the bakery and buy
a bread so I have a 50 kroner bill in my
pocket and the bread costs 30 kronor so
I get some money back so I get these 20
kronor spec and it's actually the same
thing that happens here so I send 10
bitcoins to tolls and then I send to
back to myself and eventually I can
spent those two bitcoins in a
transaction later on so one one more
thing here is that if if it was totally
for free to send transactions in the
Bitcoin network then anybody could spam
it with transactions that just sends you
money to yourself you can you know make
hundreds of millions of those
transactions
so therefore the Safi system building
which basically means that I can leave a
small goodie to the miners of the
network and make them give my
transaction priority so the way it works
is that if I subtract a tiny tiny bit
from this output to myself then there's
a difference between input and output
and that difference is the fee that I
pay the miner so in this scenario I have
zero pawns uses your one Bitcoin it's a
very tiny amount but it's something that
the miner can see and and and can then
choose to include my transaction in a
block
and and and we will get back to fees in
a minute the thing is that I'm trying to
explain three different things at the
same time and it only really makes sense
when you get it all okay so before I'm
done I need to prove that I own those
coins so what I do is that I take my the
private key that belongs to this Bitcoin
address that received those five coins
earlier I take that private key and then
I sign the entire transaction and put
the signature and the public key into
the into the input and of course yeah
the input also has a reference to the
tie to the transaction that it draws
funds from and I do that for every input
and once I'm done I then broadcast this
transaction into the network and just
like with with the blocks it then slowly
propagates to all the nodes in the
network and it can take a little time
but eventually all the nodes will see it
and and that process is basically called
transaction reading so when a node
receives a transaction from some other
peer it funny music so basically what it
does is that it verifies that it is
sound so all the signatures are they
okay all the inputs that this
transaction is spending are they really
on spent and verifies that you don't you
know that the outputs this is no larger
that in the inputs and that's a bunch of
rules there once it has done this it
sends it on to it's all it's all the
peers eventually all the nodes will will
see this transaction and they have kind
of a pool of unconfirmed transactions so
these are transactions that that they
have seen in the network but they don't
really know in which they're not really
yeah we call it confirm they're not kind
of nobody really trust them until
they're really confirmed in the
blockchain because the blockchain gives
you an ordering over time of of events
that have happened basically so
so the miner when we go back to the
miner now the guy who who got this
reward for creating these blocks well he
has this payload section down here and
basically he can pick and choose any
transaction that he wants from from this
pool and put it into the block when he
does that he calculates what is called
the merkel route a macaroon is basically
a binary tree of sha-256 hashes which
ended up ends up in a 32 byte value just
like the blog hash so basically he makes
a choice of transactions that he wants
to confirm he calculates this motor
route and puts it into the header and
then he started start you know doing
hashing and then finding a solution to
this proof-of-work algorithm and at some
point he would be done and he we
broadcast the entire thing to all the
other nodes and everybody will now
recognize that well
this transaction that I sent to two
Tauruses is among those down here and
now it has been confirmed by one miner
and it's put into the block the first
block so and that's a good thing because
then towles has some belief in that you
know that this transaction is actually
his but the thing is that there can be
folks in the network and and we saw that
earlier with when we talk about
distribution of funds so let's just
revisit it
so once why we have these folks so
basically there exists two alternate
futures one where my transaction has
been confirmed and one where it hasn't
and basically what happens now because
that kind of two different scenarios
once an area is that I'm an evil guy and
I want to cheat at all and I can do that
maybe by sending out two transactions
one which sends tolls the money and
another one that sends it to me so I can
in secret create two transactions send
it out to everybody in the network and
and half of the network will believe
that one is the actual transaction and
another half will believe that the other
one is the right one so in that scenario
it really is a race of you know who puts
it into a block first right
so tools cannot be really sure what
happens another scenario is that I'm not
really trying trying to cheat I just
want you know to be honest and send him
some some money but we have this Fork
anyway so in that scenario my
transaction will be in two different in
two different blocks and that is
happening actually all several times a
day that that the network forks but the
transactions are well if it's not
included in one block then a minor might
make put up may put it in the block
later on so there could be a reason why
this - said that well I don't want to
include yen's transaction because he put
a very low fee and you know I don't want
in freeriders but then another minor
eventually can pick it up and put it
into a block so and this is roughly how
it works
and that's um yeah and that the more
details to it but but this is kind of
the the depth that we can reach but but
let me go back to the properties that I
talked about earlier because how does
this system solve those properties so we
talk first about counterfeiting that
nobody can increase the money supply it
will and and that's almost correct so
basically you can only in create money
by solving this mathematical puzzle
right and and and to do that you have to
prove that you have a lot of computation
power and basically you are competing
when you're creating blocks you're
competing with the biggest computer
distributed computer the world has seen
it's you know much faster than actually
I read a story or a a paper on that on
that a half year ago where it said that
if you took the 500 biggest
supercomputers in the world and Evon
together they would be 200 times slower
than the Bitcoin network at solving
sha-256 which is quite powerful so if I
really want to increase the money supply
rapidly I am forced to solving these
blocks and and if I have more computing
power than the rest of the network I can
maybe do that for a short period of time
but eventually the difficulty will
readjust so that it gets just harder for
me
I cannot you know continue to do that so
maybe you can increase the money supply
for a short period of time if you have
really not a computing power but you
can't do it continuously okay the next
thing is transaction is reversibility so
nobody can undo a transaction and that's
also not the entire truth because at the
tip of the blockchain bad stuff can
happen so here's again the example with
withdrawals here is that I created this
this transaction originally and then you
know eventually a miner he confirms it
and everything is good we have a
confirmation on the transaction but
maybe in secret I have you know created
an alternate future why I have a longer
chain which doesn't contain this
transaction but another one that spends
the same output and sent them to me so
in order to pull that off again I need
more than 51% of the of the network's
calculation power which is not really
possible and and if I you know really
managed to pull it off I you know
invested millions of dollars into
getting this computer here well then I
would have cheated tours of one
transaction and everybody would lose
faith and network and maybe I wouldn't
get that much out of it anyway
because I would just cheat him for some
bitcoins so this attack is very
expensive so the last property is is no
double spending and so basically all the
nodes in the network continuously
validate that the blocks are sound so if
a miner creates a block and it contains
a transaction that has outputs they were
spent previously then the nodes will see
that and then just throw it away so you
cannot do double spins unless you can
reverse reverse transactions and that
costs a lot of calculation power so
blockchain technology is is very new it
has only been around for a few years it
started as in the grassroots and it's
getting bigger and bigger every day
and basically what it gives you is the
trust list decentralized ordering of
events so there's no central server
but somehow you can get an agreement of
the events that happen in some certain
order and and that is pretty powerful
it's it's a tool that we haven't seen
before and you can do with your lots of
interesting stuff with it one of the
earliest examples is namecoin so it's a
different currency called name coin with
a different protocol slightly different
protocol and but still a network based
on the same principles as Bitcoin and
basically that is a decentralized open
source information registration and
transfer system so just like DNS but
just decentralized so there's nobody who
can come and say that that mess you
don't own coke that calm anymore we give
it to you know coke corporation is that
or something like that so but you can
register basically key value pairs and
you can then transfer them to somebody
else and they can and you can do that
using name coin so it has its own
currency and you can transfer stuff
around other people are working on
solution where you can trade stocks and
you can have a publicly viewable record
of who owns which stocks and you cannot
cheat and and there's no you know
trading below the counter and stuff
another thing is vote coin and I read an
article that actually in version 2 which
is a Danish a Danish IT news site where
it said that Libre Hallel yangshin which
is a party in in Denmark they they have
announced that they favor of blockchain
based voting so if you do voting using
the blockchain then you virtually cannot
cheat anymore because everybody can
count the ballots because you can see
the blockchain all the transactions that
occurred everybody can count who got how
many votes and such very interesting
stuff of course it requires that people
they can manage their private keys and
that is tricky so it's not a no-brainer
but very interesting so interesting
technology and we can do stuff that we
couldn't do before so
that's it any questions yes so right now
there's a rule in the network that says
that a block can only be one megabyte or
arch which basically allows you to have
around a thousand or something
transactions in a bottle and that is
obviously not enough because if we want
this to really scale then you know a
thousand transactions you know in every
ten minutes it's just not enough right
so there's a lot of stuff to improve on
yeah yeah so the question is why do we
have these Bitcoin addresses could we
just use those public keys and we could
the thing is that public keys they are
larger they are roughly 33 bytes when
you kind of compress them and the
Bitcoin address is only 20 bytes so
there's something saved by doing that
and also there's another potential
attack which is using quantum computing
you can potentially in the future attack
elliptic curves because of the
mathematics involved but quantum
cryptography cannot really be used for
brute forcing sha-256 because it's a
different kind of math and that's also a
reason so so a Bitcoin address is the
hash of this public key so it's two
different classes of mathematic you
you're fine yeah yeah good question so
basically you know we see this reward it
haves every four years and eventually
there it it ends up being zero right so
and you cannot have Bitcoin without
mining so so why should people continue
to mind so the thing is that right now
the the mining reward is based on you
know the block reward but that's another
reward which are the transaction fees so
if I leave like 0.01 it might not sound
like a lot but if there are many
transactions then it adds up and and get
to be something and the idea is that
gradually the the miners will be living
on the
action fees insert for the block reward
so and it will be you know it will
happen gradually over a hundred years or
something and so it's going to is
interesting to see how it works out
because in the end there's a there's an
incentive for the miner to to add these
transactions at any cost
basically any positive value should be
enough but on the other hand there's
also that you know when the blocks they
increase in size they take log take
longer time to propagate over the
network so you might lose the race of
salt is sending the block out to
everybody before another solution is
found so that's kind of some dynamics
here and eventually I think that that
would be basically a market for
transaction fees sure so and I'm not
sure how it works with world coin I
haven't looked into it in detail but I
could imagine that if there's a vote on
something that people they would be
interested in just you know adding
computer power just to ensure that the
vote is done right so if you are a part
of libel a gangster for instance then
maybe you would volunteer your computing
power to secure the vote core network
while the vote lasts that's an example
mess
yeah so the question is who changes
Bitcoin so basically the Bitcoin is open
source anybody can download it and tear
the code apart and do something funny
and then start it and it still works
because the other notes will not trust
you so but how but how but how does the
code actually change so there's a list
of core developers it's about 10 people
or something and they have a very open
process where any change is voted on and
basically any code available can say no
to a change and then come with a reason
and then it has to be you know also
anybody can go in and see the change
list it's done on on github and verify
that they are you know messing around
and it's scrutinized a lot and there's a
very big incentive to to find security
holes and whatnot in Bitcoin it's
several billion dollars of worth are put
into Bitcoin and in value and if you can
find a hole or something then you know
it's profitable and many people have
tried that so but that's a committee
kind of that that does this and it's
very very open yeah so the question is
how about this news that came recently
that an organization was close to
getting 51% of the of the calculation
power and that is really bad so
basically the way mining works today is
that because you have very little chance
of finding a block yourself because the
network is so big now then people they
have gone into what's called mining
corporations kind of so so you can take
your mining power and add it to some a
centralized system and say that our mine
for you guys and them any of those and
and the interesting thing is that if I
do that then there's a higher
probability that this group finds this
reward right so if I do it on myself
then it will maybe take ten years before
I find the block but if I do it with
them we will find or I block once in a
while and then we can split the profit
so so that makes sense
but the problem was that one of these
mining corporations got really back and
if they control 51% of the network then
you know it's bad because they can do
bad stuff so but the thing is that they
don't really they only control this
mining power on behalf of others right
and and and they and these others they
can then say oh there's something bad
here I'll point my mining power at a
different mining point so but there was
I think at some point it was very close
to 51% and it is bad and we have to
solve that and a lot of interesting
solutions have come up to with you know
how to how to change that in some way
but it's complicated yeah so but the
thing is that if you people who mined
they invest a lot of time and effort
into mining they buy racks of hardware
and you know time is such and if they
are instrumental in in damaging Bitcoin
then all of this investment will go away
right so they are heavily invested into
making big connect success so and that's
them sensitive to actually say oh this
is bad I'll choose another mining for
because I want to secure the network so
the question is how many confirmations
should a transaction have before you can
say that it's really mine so basically
the more blocks that your block is
buried under the more likely it is to
remain there for a time and never so in
the very beginning Satoshi Nakamoto said
that well if you do the math and
calculate stuff then you know six
confirmations then you are very very
very sure but as it has all of the the
Bitcoin network is so strong today that
just you know if
blocks makes you makes it really
unlikely that just a few like I would
for but it really depends on the amount
that right so if if mess is sending me
100 Kronos then I wouldn't even wait for
a wait for confirmation because well
mass is probably not going to scare me
because I know him but also the amount
is so low that if he should attack it he
would have to mount an enormous amounts
of mining power just to win hundred
Chronos and that doesn't really add up
but it really depends on on the amount
so if it's if it's a Ferrari or a house
or something then I would probably still
wait like six blocks or something like
that oh yes it is because the block has
to be sound it has to be it has to
adhere to the rules so it has to have
the right difficulty and such so you
cannot just you know put out a block
because it will be thrown away if it
doesn't attach with the rules so the
question is what happens if if you know
if math doesn't put enough a fee on a
transaction and basically it propagates
into a network all the the notes they
they relay it actually some rules here
but anyway let's just assume that it's
sent out to everybody and nobody minds
it then eventually it will disappear and
so the transactions are that haven't
confirmed I kept in memory by the notes
and when they get rebooted they lose it
right so after sometime it will just
vanish and then you can send it out
again but you kind of the problem here
is though that the notes they refuse to
relay something that spins and output
that they have in their memory pool
already so you cannot just do that
rapidly and then send it out again
because they will kind of block it so
after a week on me
you can you know try it again so but
basically these outputs are kind of
blocked until you successfully can send
it out again so okay a question at the
back yeah so when shall so the question
is when what happens when sha-256 is
broken well then our entire financial
industry will fall apart because they
are using the same algorithm for that
security not really so so first of all
when or if sha-256 gets broken it's very
likely that that we will figure it out
that you know that there are some
weaknesses like with sha-1 some
weaknesses were found but it took a long
time before real exploits could be
figured out sorry well no no but yeah so
that weaknesses right and and we will
learn about these weaknesses before it's
really exploitable but the thing is that
we can change that algorithm so we just
need the majority of the network to
agree that now we upgrade and use a
different hash function that is correct
and and so basically he says that well
that the old blocks they can then be
faked the thing is that the software
contains protocol them x times over to
call it and they have fixed points
in the source code which says that we
know we all agree that one year from now
this block occurred at that time so we
have these fixed points and they allow
us to to kind of say that no matter what
happens you cannot produce a chain that
is longer than this and then go this
long back but it requires of course that
the nodes in the network they upgrade
and agree and this new rule but they
come all the time a question
because accounts how do you make sure
that yes so the question is how do we
ensure that that that yen here and I we
don't create the same accounts right
because it's just random numbers right
and but the trick is that you have to
make really sure that you have good
random numbers and and you know
computers are not always good at that
but when you have a good random number
generator then and you pick 32 random
bytes that is actually a large large
random number and the probability of
having accidental collisions is really
really astronomical I don't remember the
exact numbers but but when you do the
calculations is something where you
compare stuff to the number of atoms and
the universe and you know big numbers
and it's really really really unlikely
so even if everybody in the world
creates a new random Bitcoin address
every second then it will take a billion
of years before the circulation or
something it's really big numbers but I
cannot tell you the math off the top of
my head yeah okay so we're out of time
