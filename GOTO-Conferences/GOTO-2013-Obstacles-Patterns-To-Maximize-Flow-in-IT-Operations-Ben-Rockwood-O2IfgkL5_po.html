coming so I'm going to be talking about
all the way up there obstacles and
patterns to maximize slow in cloud
operations now I crossed out I teen put
in cloud because I think we've seen the
last couple of years is a big difference
and the difference is becoming water all
the time between IT and cloud right I
know as an administrator when I think of
IT now I think of a very different group
of people who keep the printers running
and take care of back office
applications and essay p and things like
that whereas what we're doing with with
large-scale deployments in the cloud for
applications and various types of
services are very different so I
distinguish this a little bit normally I
would ask you know how many of you are
dev how many of you are ops I imagine a
lot of you are deaf but we're going to
go through a little exercise instead so
I've just hired all of you you now work
for me congratulations and we're going
to build in four weeks a Formula One
analytic site now each of you in your
heads probably is thinking something
about this right some of you will be
thinking Scala we're going to use Ruby
or we're going to use Java some of you
will be thinking what would the website
look like what would the interface look
like so maybe you're thinking there's a
lot of things that can go wrong with an
application like this is a good a scale
some of you will think things like which
cloud are we're going to use or we're
going to get data center space where
we're going to use servers what
operating system are we going to use the
way that you answer a question like this
will determine what you actually are a
lot of people think well I like the
program so I'm a programmer I like to
administer unix systems therefore I'm an
administrator but really the difference
between all of us really comes down to
how we approach a given set of problems
the way that we view that problem and
which part of it is the most passionate
and emotional engaging to each of us
so when we look at taking on a you know
organizations or solving a large task we
have to be concerned about Flo Flo
companies made of lots of individuals
all those individuals need to work
together to accomplish a task and that
means that there needs to be a flow now
when you think of flow do you think of
something like this water you know it's
being pushed via pressure or it's being
pulled down by gravity and it flows
along and it comes up upon obstacles it
goes around rocks it goes into certain
pools swirls around a little bit keeps
moving it's very fluid or do you think
this is that flow right some people this
is what they think about when they think
about flow that immediately tends to
shut you down right let me think about
water flowing it's very peaceful it's
very comforting you think about
something like that you're thinking no
right you're thinking I should go to
link in and work on my work on my resume
a little bit so this is the flow of
DevOps as I see it anyway we have
business people over to the left these
are our founders or CTOs people come up
with ideas they produce requirements I
have a vision of an idea I have
something I wanted to do they engage
with developers who produce software
that software is then typically fed into
an operations organization they go ahead
and do what I calls the weaponize it
they make it available to customers
customers consume it customers have
feedback they bring that back to the
business and we go round and round and
round this cycle this is the flow we're
talking about DevOps now a couple of
things I want to couple ideas I want to
bring to your attention when you look at
this first if you studied business you
know that the way that we manage a good
and the way that we manage a service is
this entire
different they are completely different
there are lots of great methods out
there for managing the production of a
good and there are a lot of good
business techniques out there for how to
manage his services business and they're
not the same they're not compatible you
can draw a lot of conclusions from one
and apply to the other but they don't
map one to one developers are producing
an asset right at some point you can't
theoretically get your program perfect
and it's out there and it's perfect
right in your operations organization
your operating is the service there's no
point at which you've completed the task
right until the business goes out under
or something like that right one has a
time element field it is not so when you
look at this you have a natural
opposition actually between Devon ops
one is producing an asset the others
produce is is providing a service that's
your natural tension that a lot of
people grapple with don't quite
understand another idea I want to
introduce systems thinking systems
thinking hopefully something you've
heard about before it's incredibly
important it's a number of different
ideas and a school of school of academic
thought around how we managed systems a
couple important principles about a
system a system cannot be divided into
independent parts and one of the key
things here in any given system is that
the essential properties of the system
itself are that which none of the
individual components have and so if you
take a system and you divide it into its
constituent parts you lose the emergent
properties of that system right so why
you take a company and you chop it into
bits and it falls apart right the
emergent behavior doesn't that you get
out of out of a company doesn't come
from any one individual or in any
individual group it's this it's it's the
interaction between all those teams
working together to produce an outcome
not just the sum of it so you can see
this is a system
there's an interaction between each of
these components and that interaction is
what produces an outcome in DevOps I
like to look at things in terms of three
primary components people process and
tools but what's important is it's about
the collaboration of people it's about
the convergence of process various
processes coming together not just
existing but coming together and the
creation and exploitation of tools so
you see here again we're going we have
people in each of these areas there are
people there interacting we're looking
at process that brings them together
converging process between all these
different elements and then creating and
exploiting tools in order to facilitate
that flow now a lot of times when we
think about this in the context of a
business we're too close to the problem
it's hard to conceptualize and think
about it but all of us have a wonderful
example we like to talk about factories
and things like this but one of the best
examples of flow working or not working
that we've all experienced as a
restaurant right the kitchen has to work
with the wait staff the wait staff has
to work with the maitre d reservations
need to work if anything is out of sync
inside of a restaurant you have a bad
experience right and it's pretty
immediate right you don't tend to say I
don't like that restaurant because I
don't like the head chef right you don't
like the food that came out of the
kitchen that has a bunch of processes
there's a lot of intricacy that actually
happens in restaurants that is pretty
easy to see we've all had good
experiences bad experiences and that
actually matched pretty closely to what
we're dealing with a lot of our
organizations we want to look at the
holistic picture because and you can say
it with me garbage in garbage out right
if we start out with something that's
crap it's good to end up we're going to
end up with the craft results right and
particularly for developers everyone's
probably worked at some point on some
project that they thought was wrong
they started they hated it to begin with
but it's a job and that's what they want
so okay you produce it in the end
customer hates it company goes under you
left I told you it's awful right you
could have written the best
implementation of it ever it's beautiful
code right I mean everyone's probably
got at least one or two programs out
there that they've written it was just a
work of art what it did was crap but the
way it was implemented was just gorgeous
so we want to look at the holistic
system so what does this journey look
like we want to establish flow flow
involves the entire organization we want
to think about it systematically so we
wouldn't need to start at the beginning
and work all the way forward so we look
at these in 11 patterns first pattern is
starting with why now this is so obvious
so obvious but people don't do it
shockingly people don't do it the key to
being good at anything is intentionality
if you read a book on how to have a
better marriage it's good to say you
need to think about your partner you
need to think about what they need you
need to make time for them you need to
go and you know organize events all this
is good to tell you need to think about
it you need to be intentional read a
book about how to take care of your dog
you need to think about your dog you
need to be very intentional about your
dog you need to think about what they're
feeding in the one you're walking right
any anything you ever read about how to
improve it's on it's always going to
come down ultimately to intentionality
you need to be intentional about it you
need to set goals and values and
understand what those goals and values
are and fundamentally that means
starting with why guy names the Nixon is
simon Sinek wrote a fantastic book
called starting with why and it really
gets deep into this issue of really
evaluating yourself and understanding
your core principles are understanding
who you are what you are before you
figure out even what you're going to do
second is once you understand who you
are you understanding what you're all
about you need to build trusting
relationships here's another thing
that's obvious that people don't
actually get intentional about you need
to build trusting relationships within
your
the new organizations simon Sinek in his
in his book and he said in a couple of
his talks is that when we're with people
who believe what we believe trust
emerges okay simple concept if we're all
on the same page we all have something
in common that we believe we trust each
other trust is not just because somebody
says are going to do something than they
do it's because we have some kind of
bond with them around beliefs that's why
any of us walking around our who's we
see somebody with go to badge and we
trust them just a little bit more
because they believe something that we
believe when we're in a foreign country
like this if you see somebody else who
has an accent like yours you trust them
a little bit more even though when you
go back to your country of origin who
cares when you build trusting
relationships with people you need to
have honest one-on-one discussions with
them and please get out of the office
when people have wheel we have these
meetings inside of offices around big
tables we have a tendency to say yes and
we that's a great idea we won't get
along with that but for some reason
trust doesn't actually come out of that
right it's just another meeting you just
want to get along as fast as you can to
get out of it get out of the office go
to a pub meet with key people right key
people in the organization that that you
should be working together with you
really want to have good strong
relationships with them it's
particularly important for the leaders
right if the managers and the different
leaders in the organization aren't
getting along don't have trusting
relationships everything's kind of
screwed from the beginning now i do want
to know i'm not saying that you need to
be friends with everybody you don't need
to go out to a pub with somebody and say
you know how many kids do you have and
what do you like to eat and all it
doesn't matter is is that you understand
that you're on the same page and that
you're behind each other in it in the
initial vision that we talked about the
previous pattern and once you've got
that then you want to share the vision
and align the culture spread your why
why are we doing this why are we
actually in business what are we trying
to achieve who are we trying to read
to once we know what that is you've got
to share that information there was a
lot of companies issue if you're not in
the executive staff of a company if you
ever go to an executive staff meeting
it's almost always enlightening because
they'll start talking about things that
they're trying to accomplish that you
start realizing like why doesn't anyone
else in the organization now this should
not communicating this down what are we
really about some companies are good at
this summer very bad you want to make
sure that everyone gets it whatever your
company is about that everyone gets is
you want to extend personal trust and
respect throughout the entire
organization you want to propagate a
flow based vision of what we're trying
to do and you always always always
always always always be customer-focused
think about your customers if you're
doing it for yourselves on the inside
it's going to be neat it's going to be
fun you're gonna go to business focus on
the customer always ensure that every
employee understands who your customer
is and who you're trying to reach right
i mean this is what this is ultimately
about is providing value to the market
to a customer everyone in the company
needs to know who the customer is right
don't let employees just figure it out
for themselves share that information so
that everyone is absolutely aligned and
most importantly once you've gone
through this if there are people who
argue with you people who don't get it
people are fighting the vision cut them
get rid of them and just do it now
because they will sabotage you later and
that's the part that's hard we like to
think that certain people who don't get
it well eventually it'll work out
they're really good at this really good
at that we can use your skills get rid
of them now all right so now we've got
kind of basics down we've got a company
that's thinking together working
together we understand our customer
we've shared that vision everyone's kind
of on the same page we got that we're
building trusting relationships for all
fired up we want to go and work we're
not singing Kumbaya but we're doing cool
things now we need to understand the
systems inside the business that are
going to make that happen
or the best most practical ways to do
that is called value stream mapping if
you've heard about it before you're
probably thinking that's an incredibly
boring thing yeah it is but it's
important making a to-do list is boring
but it's important fundamentally in
value stream mapping we need to
understand that as a business we start
with some resource we've add value to
that resource through a variety of
phases and then we provide that to a
customer so the company does right if
you're in the business of selling hot
dogs you buy buns and you buy hot dogs
and you buy condiments and a customer
comes you take those raw elements that
you do not produce you put them together
as a service for the customer and you
hand it to them that was your value add
you provided to the customer that's what
you do so we want to take all the
different components it's of the flow
throughout the business and we want to
visualize that so we can all understand
we can all grok what we're all about
here that's your system and that's what
you want to visualize in some way that
everyone is on the same page with that
there are a number of things you can do
outcomes that come from once you've done
this like adding cycle times how long
does it take for iterations to come
through dev you know often if you're on
scrum in your time box of two weeks it's
going to be too weak tact I'm going and
how long does that take to get through
development through deployment out there
are a number of things that once you
have a value map kind of immediately
fallout is fairly obvious now if you're
new to value stream mapping you want to
get started with it Wikipedia always
just a decent place to start there's a
fantastic book called learning to see
that is a fantastic read one of those
are definitely jogs your your
imagination is you read it is very good
at giving you some ideas and helping you
figure out how to start doing mapping so
we understand what we're about we
understand how the business is organized
and how value is brought is added
throughout the business to provide value
to customers now we want to get down and
more granular standardized your work
people don't like this because they
think it's morning and be
cratic but it is really really important
to document your process that you use
hit each stage in your value stream
employees should never have to struggle
to note to do in a lot of cases we sort
of just let everyone figure it out some
people get it and some people don't
that's a shame it should be very obvious
what we're doing and if you don't
standardized your work you'll almost
never find the flaws in the process you
end up with these beatings where you say
well how can we improve how can we make
things better and you get a thousand
different ideas and they're all over the
map and ultimately you just can't do
anything about it when you standardize
your work you suddenly can spot the
flaws in that process fairly easily also
be careful to include execution times
which is with standard work once you've
produced standard work once you've got
that then we're going to manage the flow
through the value stream con bond is one
of the best ways of doing this it's
taking something that that is kind of
virtual and makes it physical some
people are using you know physical
boards of post-it notes some people are
using linq it how many people actually
are using linq it anyway a couple so
linked it is a fantastic way to
visualize this you know ken ben is
something that some people have some
preconceived notions of what you can or
can't do with that fundamentally it's a
board with a bunch of notes on it right
so you can map this out exactly to your
value stream and you can watch us you do
handles through departments you can
schedule tasks in an individual group
there's a lot of powerful things you can
do with combine don't just use the
ticket system a lot of people try to do
everything in JIRA right and it becomes
sort of a mess and the one of the
problems with just doing things and
tickets is it works for an individual
group but it doesn't work across
organizational boundaries right a lot of
your managers look at that they don't
have any idea what's going on right
almost nobody's got really good
dashboards in JIRA anyway so using an
external system like con van for
visualizing your workflow is actually a
really fantastic thing to do and helps
get everyone on the same page it's a
sort of thing you can put up on a big
screen somewhere in your office and ever
one sort of knows what's going on
throughout the business a couple of
things that we want to focus on as we're
doing this one is muda muda is japanese
for waste literally it means futility
one of the fundamental aspects of lean
and the Toyota Production system and the
things that they've worked out in
manufacturing is that we constantly want
to be eliminating waste and waste is
defined as any activity or effort which
is not adding value right so except we
we have in our in our businesses we take
stuff we add value to it we push it
along the stream we give to customers
right for not adding value to it it's
wasteful right there's a lot of things
that we if we don't use that definition
there are a lot of things that we can
say well that's important that's not
important is it actually adding value if
it's not get rid of it don't just do
things to do them right make sure that
everything that you do every time
someone touches a product or puts in any
effort that it's always adding value
this is one of the things you deal with
a lot in code to write is you don't
necessarily need to over optimize
something if you can simply say we don't
even need that loop like what is it even
doing wow we got a 10x performance
increase right there you go our
businesses have a lot of these sorts of
things things that we don't even need to
do we just need to have the courage to
say we don't need them and get rid of
them a lot of examples you know
excessive meetings are one of my
favorites do we really need to have this
meeting no get rid of it one from an
operational perspective is when you do
hand off change to ops teams please give
them change lugs and release notes
because if you don't we have to figure
it out ourselves and we may or may not
actually get it what you wanted so just
give that to us that makes it a whole
lot faster also excessively large
changes right if you have too many
changes going out at one time you get
the
huge batch deployments are what not
makes it a whole lot harder get them
smaller faster iteration a lot less
waste when you stamp out muda you want
to be using kaisan Kaizen is a Japanese
process for doing continuous improvement
kaisan literally means change for the
better focus here is not doing things
just to do them again this is to make
sure that we're adding value that we're
constantly improving a process this is
done what's through what's called a PDCA
cycle plan do check act we want to be
using the scientific method that's what
pdca is essentially the scientific
method maps to industry we plan out what
we need to do what we want to do
different ways that we can attack it
then we experiment we go and actually do
it see if it works once we've done it we
watch it see if it's really doing what
we wanted if it really has a desired
effect and then finally we act on that
we standardize it we push it out across
the organization we expand it and we do
this all again that's the process of
continuous improvement called Kaizen one
of the important things about cries n
though is it needs to be driven by the
people actually doing the work having
some group off somewhere else who goes
and figures out a better way to do
something and then hands it down as a
document to the people actually doing it
never works ever it's a it's it's
absolutely just you're going to end up
fighting you got ego problems people
don't understand different factors you
want Kaizen to being done actually by
the people doing the work right all of
us doing an individual task we know how
to make it better we know where the
warts are we know how to how to make it
more efficient those are the people need
to do it those are the people need to be
improving it and it needs to focus on
where you are and where you want to go
not what would be nice where are we now
where do we want to go and then we're
going to figure out how we're going to
get there
we don't want to go into it saying okay
we need to we need to be more scalable
so we're going to use Cassandra
Cassandra may not be the right solution
right you need to figure out what is it
that we actually want to achieve and
then we'll look at all the different
solutions that could potentially get us
there two ways in lean to do this one is
like i said is PDC a plan do check act
and they actually have a form called an
a3 which is an ode to the sheet of paper
that it's on which is just a form that's
broken up into a bunch of individual
sections where you put in you know what
is it that you're trying to achieve how
do you plan about going about it what
does the supporting data in order to get
there and all this you can see an
example of that kind of form the
important thing about this is that if
the idea cannot fit on a single sheet of
paper it's too big it needs a fit on a
single sheet of paper right you have to
have done a lot of your leg work to
figure out what you're going to do and
most of us in tech we love to just like
now let's just try and see how it works
and maybe it'll work maybe it won't
right we don't can't actually see
ourselves evolving because we're just
kind of figuring it out as we go along
if you go into any manufacturing
organization doing lean as soon as you
walk onto the plant floor you'll see a
board with a bunch of a threes and
everyone considered a 3s and see all the
things that are going on and different
improvement projects one caution about
Kaizen when you're doing this
improvement is that a fish is a Peter
Drucker famously said that efficiency is
doing things right effectiveness is
doing the right things if you improve a
process that is fundamentally broken
that's not adding value if you improve
that process you're making the company
worse right don't optimize things that
are broken to begin with right focus on
effectiveness not just efficiency
ninth pattern is judoka jazz I think
talks a bit more about judoka in in
detail and how it can be used in a
number of practical sort of ways this is
quality at the source judoka and in
Japanese refers to autonomous automation
it's really philosophy around sort of
fault detection that if some part of the
process is broken it should stop there
so like in a manufacturing plant if
you're tooling a given component or
something you'll have no go no go test
units right next to it so you machine
something down to a certain size and it
needs to be so on so big and so you
actually just have this a little tool
there that you pull it out slide it in
if it fits perfectly then you know
what's right you don't have to wait
until you get to QA at the end for it to
find that out you find out right there
and if it's broken you fix it before it
goes on to the next stage anytime that
we do these things is we go through
these you know deployment pipelines for
instance we want to make sure if
anything's wrong let's stop there fix it
there before we pass it on some
practical examples is that when you
build pools for heaven's sakes please
make them idempotent what that means is
any tool that can't be run twice right
tools absolutely need to be implemented
in I'd too potent way using test-driven
development helps us a lot right find
the bug as you're developing it rather
than waiting until sometime down the
road things like automated security
scanning and things like this make sure
that we're seeing this all the time
clear or reporting you know any time any
of you spend time making airs and logs
more clear and actionable you know a
sista happening somewhere is loving you
so please we love that Japanese
implement a system called &amp;amp; dawn if
you're interested in how it gets
implemented in factories pattern 10
gemba go and see literally Gimba and in
japanese means where the work happens
it's important to go out and see what
people are doing
um if you're a manager go sit with your
developers different teams QA people
whatever go and just sit with them hang
out go to their meetings spend some time
with them see what they're doing in a
manufacturing plant you would have a
manager who would just go and literally
stand at one spot in the factory and
just watch for like 2-3 hours and just
see what's going on they get a real
sense for what's really happening not
just some report I would encourage all
of us to do this with your customers go
spend time with your customers and don't
just say hey Samir report on how you how
you like the application or so they'll
like that spend time watching them use
it see how they how they interact with
it get that experience yourself so that
you can use that to make better
decisions in your day-to-day work and
the final escada practice and teach
cotta so we want to have standardized
ways of working standardized ways of
solving problems we want to be using PDC
a scientific method for solving problems
we want to have certain ways of thinking
about how we approach things about this
philosophy of going out and using gemba
seeing what's actually going on out
there we want those to be deeply
entrenched in our organizations and in
order to do that we need to practice it
we need to use it and we need to
encourage other people to do it now
cotta is if you've ever done martial
arts when you you see people practice
you know block you know kick you know
whatever you go through all these
different motions and you practice them
over and over and over and over again
those are contests those reforms the
reason you do that is so that when
somebody comes up and tries to bash you
on the head in the middle of the night
you just go through the motions and it's
automatic subconscious it gets built
into your habit and our companies we
want to be doing the same things we want
to be practicing again and again and
again the way that we do we implement
these sorts of things and we want to be
making sure that other people in the
organization are being taught those same
methods so at the end of the day it's
just subconscious this is why if you go
into a lot of like Toyota where a lot of
these ideas were originally a kind of
coalesced if you ask them how they do
things they don't even really know it's
just how they've always done it is
just natural to them it's because
they've been practicing it they've been
watching other people have been taught
so to review these are the 11 patterns
like so the first four of these really
are about understanding the organization
five six and seven are really about what
we can do once we have that foundation
Kaizen is what's constantly improving
these cycles making things better nine
judoka ensuring quality at the source
all the time and then 10 and 11 are
really about how we manage lead
understand our businesses and and are
kind of situationally aware
fundamentally it's really important to
know who you are for real and be honest
about it be really really brutally
honest about it who are you as a company
what is your culture what are you
building who is it for you know it's got
to be practical otherwise you're just
lying to yourself and you're not going
to go anywhere you need to know where
you know where you're actually hot today
and you need to know where you want to
be and once you've got that makes it a
whole lot easier to figure out what
needs to what needs to happen and
whatever you do do it with repeatable
patterns otherwise it's just random
happenstance how did we get from where
we were in 2010 to where we are in 2013
I don't know good decision-making look
who knows it's going to be repeatable
patterns so you can understand where you
were where you are where you eventually
want to go and how you're actually
getting through thank you
I guess after rotation take the divine
or any action found that use it towards
an ipad Gampa know the keys because they
sound way cooler so the most of these
concepts come from from lean lean is the
term let me go back a lot of these ideas
came from from Toyota they built in the
1950s something called the Toyota
Production system when other people
looked at the things they had come up
with they wanted to use them but
nobody's going to walk around saying
Toyota Production system at Fort for
instance or any other car company so
they decided they need a more generic
sort of name and they called it lean
you'll notice that lean as a philosophy
has sort of invaded sort of every
industry and now you're seeing it invade
our industry it's been used extensively
throughout healthcare and a number of
other things the things that you see
that there that are here they're common
sense right they're really just common
sense and if they weren't common sense
you shouldn't believe them anything
that's not common sense generally is
just a lie it's a very clever but it's
not actually useful what's unique is is
that they worked out so much of the
system and how it all fits together and
how we can apply these things and how
they can reinforce each other in a very
unique way and very few industries very
few people have ever spent the time to
really figure it out so Toyota stumbled
onto something really powerful and
you're seeing it spread throughout I
like using the Japanese words because it
make sure we don't get too far away from
sort of the original intent i also want
to make sure that you can go to
Wikipedia and find any of these things
if you want to don't trust me go on
explore for yourself it's a fascinating
journey and you know a word is a
powerful thing so there are certain
words I could pick for certain things
but they may kind of you know be too
overly prescriptive
but what are good tools methods for
presenting and sharing the vision cross
team sites Knox's dude in person that's
that's the most important sort of thing
is do this yourself do this in person
make sure you actually building
relationships and talking with people
you know one-on-one don't worry about
you know building a really great slide
deck or or a great document or whatever
make sure that your you're getting into
cross you know the passion right there's
a lot of here is one of the practical
sort of things a lot of people come to a
conference like this you get all fired
up and you go back to your organization
and there are other people in the
organization will get the trickle-down
of your of your learnings here and they
don't actually understand why you're
doing this they just know that they're
supposed to do it now you want to make
sure that you're taking the the passion
the interest you have in things and
sharing it directly with people in the
organization and that everyone gets on
the same page right we've all had that
that executive who did some stupid
off-site came back and what guess what
we're all doing now you're to love it
it's going to be fantastic right they've
got the passion they're convinced but
they haven't convinced you so you need
to make sure that you're actually
talking with people giving people the
opportunity to understand what this is
really about because if you just say
like you know guess what it's all system
and we're going to standardize our work
and it's all going to be awesome because
we're totally customer-focused like
nobody's gonna buy into that right you
have to have it worked out for yourself
and you have to share that vision with
other people and make sure that prompt
propagates throughout the organization
so we're here at Khoda Khan community of
developers I'm going to appoint you as
the ambassador to the development
community on the behalf of all of I key
operations people everywhere what are
three things that you would love every
developer to know about Ops people that
they may not know already okay number
one we don't actually hate you I know it
seems like we hate you but we don't
actually not to your faces definitely
another is we actually do program for
reals we do we actually do write
programs we do understand it we just
don't think it's all that important
fundamentally the difference between
somebody who considers themselves a
programmer and anybody else who writes
programs is that we just know we need to
accomplish some task five hundred times
and that is best done using a program we
don't actually geek out over how we
write it which is why we love things
like pearl right like pearls still rock
and hard it's still awesome sorry yeah I
mean we know you're thinking out loud
but believe believe it or not there are
there are system administrators out
there who are like dude i'm going to
write that and closure okay right so we
do geek out over things like that too
and the other and the biggest thing is
just like you know let's communicate
always need to be communicating we're
really not opposing each other we do
want to work together and too often
there's a sense that it sort of code is
sort of thrown over over the fence and
you end up with with with administrators
looking at developer saying why the hell
did you implement it like that right
then you have developers you guys are
standing at necessary going why the hell
don't you just do what I told you to do
there's a reason I told you to do it
that way there's a reason I want to
implement it that way if you've ever had
something implemented and you said I
need you to use postgres sequel to do
that and all of a sudden it actually
gets implemented using my sequel like
what the hell is that about so making
sure that you're you're communicating
you know between the organization's is
really powerful because we don't want to
get along I love this question lean in a
factory has to be different from a lean
in a software development process right
where do you see the difference the
biggest difference is what I talked
about before the difference between the
production of goods and services so lean
is applied to software development
itself just the software development
organization Maps pretty pretty damn
closely it's different across an
organization because the fact that lean
doesn't map to services Toyota when they
develop this they were trying to figure
out how to build cars faster and better
not to over produce and so it was really
built for that when you look at like how
you offer a service lean doesn't mount
perfectly over to that it's a little
more challenging and you can use these
principles as guiding principles but if
you go and and and you know get you know
lean books on how to implement
manufacturing how to do total quality
maintenance and things like this like
they don't map one to one so you have to
take the principles and leave some of
the actual implementation details aside
I think there's actually a tremendous
body of work that actually creates the
isomorphic mapping between lean applied
in a plant floor operations versus lean
in a service provider service and if
your interest in that come find one of
us later a lot of its spent a lot of
time thinking about how to apply
different kinds of concepts out there to
service because there really is very
little out there with regards to with
regards to how things work in services
organizations it's still a body of work
that's really been ongoing one last
question isn't it true that Kaizen
actually came from the US during World
War two as the United States Army had to
produce Harbor fast so that's that
question put your hand up you sir you
know your business you know your
business yes it is absolutely is true
yes so all these things that came from
Japan actually came from the United
States all this it all started with the
Frederick Winslow Taylor around the turn
of the century and his work that was
built up by a number of people that
ultimately got to a fellow named Deming
Deming is the real genius he worked out
a lot of different things there was a
number of programs throughout world war
two that were used to help manufacturers
in the United States produce bombers
faster so that we could go and kill
Hitler those sorts of things were very
interesting to manufacturing during
World War two but then afterwards we're
not we're all sort of abandoned and in
America things after world war two for
us anyway we're very good right so we
just made tons and tons and tons of junk
and we made puns of
it but people could buying it because
the economy was good when the economy
was not so good we were just making
stuff that nobody bought and just fell
apart so the Japanese had sort of a very
different situation and they were trying
to recover after being bombed into the
ground after World War Two and so they
were a very rough spot but anyway long
story you'll get me going like fern I
can talk for six hours the answer is yes
stemming yes yes yes and it came from
Deming so so anyway he went to he went
to Japan to try and teach them because
the United States was trying to help
japan following the war to get back on
its feet with an industrial base he
taught them they turned the methods into
into lean-to TPS that ultimately became
lean and then in the 1980s the Japanese
kicked their butts and we had to learn
what we taught that so it's this
beautiful irony this is uniquely
American of course any minutes thank you
so much and now please rate the talks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
