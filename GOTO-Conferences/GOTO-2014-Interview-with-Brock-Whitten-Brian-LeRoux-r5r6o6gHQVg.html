go to Chicago 2014 and I have the
pleasure to interview Brock wooden and
from the room my name is aina Corey and
part of the pc and these guys have been
part of creating phonegap and also some
other nifty things afterwards and before
so I have some questions for you guys so
my first question would be when you when
you think of phonegap is there anything
you regret doing or starting with that
one I have some actually it's not
necessarily a grep but it's a reflection
you know our motivation with working on
it was really to further the web and we
wanted to see web development flourish
and I often ask myself like did we help
the web or do we help native and it's
not i'm not opposed to helping native
but i want it i want to see open
development and open collaboration open
tools and the it's been really great to
see how phone gaps matured and Cordova
and how that's all gone and it's been
really cool so it gives me like comfort
but I think we put a helped put a lot of
apps in the App Store and I question
like maybe maybe a better way to put it
was that not to belabor the point but
was maybe there wasn't enough emphasis
on running on the web in the beginning
yeah and that which which is kind of
what what we're working on now more
right is just like go to the web first
and then also getting the outdoors if
you want to write yeah I echo those
thoughts we initially created this sort
of fancy compiler and it it doesn't
target the browser so we always assumed
that people would be writing the code
for the browser and then they would use
this compiler after but instead the
reason compiler first and hitting the
browser is an afterthought we're fixing
that writing the browser's a platform
now then we started to do that we
realized that we added a lot of
stuff that really distanced both cordova
and phonegap from the web and so we
consider those bugs okay not features
and so we're fixing it we're getting
back to that the one other thing the
first second you said is there anything
you regret I regret all the XML that we
used but there was no other way I was
that was what it made sense at the time
we chose using the widget spec for
config files and there's there's a lot
of XML in there and I just wish we'd
chosen JSON from the beginning the truth
is that even an option it was kind of an
early option it's funny because early
phonegap had JSON parsing built-in and
there wasn't native libraries for this
stuff of time and we were actually using
Douglas Crockfords JSON libraries at the
time you remember this and I remember
IBM got really upset because Crockfords
libraries didn't have a patchy your MIT
compatible license basically had this
bond or evil he said I don't know evil
as I'm we wrote him and said you know
can we changes you know I'm super stoked
about so he changed it to do no evil
unless your IBM she's kind of awesome
you have to give Douglas Crockford props
for that story yeah ok so maybe it takes
me to the next question yourself what
are you doing now what's occupying it
every start with you yeah well so I
started a company with Rob Alice who was
part of the phone got story from the
beginning as well and we kind of took
reflected on this right and we wanted to
just like publish on the web and wanted
to make that as easy as possible so we
built a harp which is a static web
server that does pre compiling for you
just on the fly and and we've offered
that on a platform that lets you deploy
through dropbox and so we're just like
we're trying to lower the barrier for
for publishing and take away like all
the configuration that that exists right
now especially for front-end there seems
to be a trend towards like really heavy
tailored configuration
and we think like most of that can be
done through conventions so that's what
we're working on making it easier yeah
it's all phonegap philosophy too so it's
all in source pretty software good to
throw that out there it's not just your
company's gig yeah and i use it too it's
good stuff thank you do you have
anything to add but what you doing now
oh the big thing for us these past few
months there started two prongs so we
realized that command line tool ian is
great everyone likes it but maybe not
everyone in our audience wants to use
the command line I don't really believe
this but could be true so we've been
working so we're working on the app
split or not so we built apps there in
the App Store for iOS Android and
Windows Phone soon blackberry you
install an app on your phone and we have
a GUI desktop tool coming out soon and
it pairs your desktop to your phone and
you just write code in a refresh this on
your device previously if you want to do
this you had to install the iOS SDK
install the Android SDK install VMS
install Windows Phone provision your
phone all this crazy stuff and this
takes that like one day set up down be
like five minutes so that makes kind of
our front end designer audience really
happy and we think that's going to be
pretty big success and then on the flip
side we discovered in the last year that
the enterprise really likes phonegap
they're building lots of hybrid apps out
there and we sort of did a survey of all
the adobe stuff and adobe has a lot of
stuff one of the things that we have one
of the assets is adobe analytics she
used to be known as omniture and so
we're putting together an offering
that's coming at the end of this month
called phonegap enterprise and it's
basically phonegap with all mature on
analytics baked in and our Adobe
experience manager which is a content
management solution lets you update your
apps on the fly yeah okay yeah so what
do we see that soon okay well we
announced tit in march i think we're
this is a real enterprising thing I
think code freezes at the end of
oh my god do i get to stop writing code
there I don't think that's actually what
happened to go Theresa soon thank you
that's it's an interesting perspective
like for us we we looked at that
question about like front-end developers
and designers and whether they want to
be on the command line or not and I
think what we're learning is that a good
tools are good tools and like there's a
time and place for both like both the
command line and like gooey and with
that being abstracted but we actually
have been kind of pleasantly surprised
in a way that it's the command lines
being embraced more by designers and my
front end developers we're slowly like
grunt and golf and all these cool front
end tools coming out that are really
maturing extremely quickly and it's kind
of inspiring and and when we we worked
on the heart platform like we made the
assumption that it wasn't going to go
that way but it was going to be very GUI
based and people wanted to use they
wanted to have a visual good but but I
think both are needed both are necessary
and if applications are architected
correctly you can offer both right yeah
it's interesting because we're seeing
the same thing a lot of front-end
developers who used to sort of a shoe
the idea of touching command line are
now becoming pretty dangerous in there
themselves which is question is is it
the same people or is it because the new
front-end developers actually from
another age if you can say like that
yeah they have been using command liner
in the games that they play yeah I wish
I knew yet I don't know the answer
either i mean like you look at Brunton I
think it's pushing over something crazy
like a quarter million downloads a a
month and so grunts a front-end
developer tool so it indicates these
people are out there and they're using
it i think it is the new generation web
develop it's like it's no longer a web
designer or web developers somewhere in
between yes yeah yeah it's a brave new
world who knows I'm hoping to save it
where it goes and
what what the answer to that question is
and speaking about the future yeah okay
if we take us forward to 2017 what will
my mobile wit development do back then
yeah well us every time I attempt to
make these predictions like we're off by
years we are off by England already um
well I think I think we saw it phonegap
be in a very ephemeral tool thought it
was a hacked project I'd be gone in a
couple of years yeah yeah I was always
in the intent okay we demonstrate you
could use web tech everyone would go up
why would I bother with this other stuff
we'd go away yeah here we are six years
later it's still going strong I can tell
you what i'd like to see yes do that i'd
like to see this the way that the web is
consumed to kind of learn a little bit
what people like about installing apps
and just how being online or offline
shouldn't matter quite so much to the
web and just the URL represents where
the source of the program is right
whether or not it's being loaded
dynamically or perhaps once off the
server and then additionally from there
from yeah that'll work machine yeah so
you know it's I think that offline
storage but needs to mature and my cache
manifest especially and there's people
working on this and and I think that
it'd be nice if there is a greater
emphasis on on that particular issue or
my perspective but but I know like
there's been a lot of progress made in
this area especially recently it's
moving so fast yeah they just landed
it's the serviceworker speck in Firefox
which starts to address these issues
where
you get more control over the network
layer and you can do your own caching
and Delta dating type of stuff I think
it's interesting because we see a lot of
people now treat the App Store as the
primary discovery model for their their
experience in a computer and it's even
it's terrifying to watch a child use the
app store but the three-year-old is
pretty good at a computer all of a
sudden and they don't know how to read
as far as I can tell so how they're
doing this I have no idea but they're in
there and they're adding apps and they
start playing games whoa what's happened
I and stuff i buying the apt exorcism so
what that sort of taught me was whoa is
the web is really an important asset but
we kind of have conflated Google with
the web and Google is kind of the App
Store of the web and so there's a bit of
a discovery issue here that no one's
really talking about the app stores is
the discovery place that you're this is
where you find your programs and if it's
on the web then you go to Google to find
your programs what is the open
equivalent of this I mean everybody
wants to be the person who is the
purveyor of all computing experience for
sure but is that a good idea is this
truly a commons or not and it's those
are just challenging questions without a
good answer yeah should we eat them
hanging there yeah so getting her self
driving car and tell me in the future
very much for joining us I don't hope to
see you again sometime okay fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
