and I have to say where scrum began for
me is is maybe different for others it
actually occurred in 1967 I was flying
missions over North Vietnam and an f4
and so every day I had a project I had
to plan the project I had to plan the
timing I had to plan to get to get to
execute the project successfully and as
I crossed over the border into North
Vietnam it was the most heavily defended
airspace in the history of aerial
warfare we were getting shot at a
hundred percent of the time and so the
plan had to be executed to evade risk it
had to be built on risk avoidance every
second you were over North Vietnamese
aerospace and so I adopted an evasive
maneuver that was executed crossing the
border and it never ended until I get
back over the border but in the middle I
had to hit the target now I noticed many
years later I'll go I'll go forward to
when I got into software development
I noticed that software projects had
similar problems every day I would come
into work and there would be something
that was trying to shoot that project
down and the the the style of managing
those projects was not effective at
dealing with the problems so you know in
Vietnam only 50 percent of the pilots I
shot I flew with got shot down but in
the projects particularly in the big
banks where I worked eighty-three
percent of the projects would fail okay
so I realized they need the
the same kind of risk avoidance
mechanisms that was that was built into
fighter aircraft so let's say from
nineteen actually from even before to
nineteen sixty-seven till about 1975 I
was in the Air Force flying high
performance jets the other thing I
noticed when I got into the big banks is
that not only were projects failing but
the people didn't have a way to
understand how to tell it to me it was
looking like they were trying to land a
project on an aircraft carrier you know
the the the land was kind of moving on
them or they're trying to land that
project and they didn't have the tooling
to understand where they were if you
think about how a high performance jet
has to land in an airframe there's many
different things you need to know you
need to know your airspeed you need to
know how far away the runway is you need
to know that your rate of descent you
need to know the angle of attack of the
aircraft because depending on how
pitched up that nose is it can you can
get into a place where it takes more
power to go slower see I saw that
happening on the waterfall projects
it's called Brooks law if you take a big
project and it's late you add more
people it gets later and then the
projects clap crashes now fortunately
fortunately and when you're flying
fighters you produce a big black burning
hole in the ground so it gets people his
attention but for some reason when the
big project fails at the bank people
don't learn from the experience they
still keep those projects crashing all
the time so well let me tell you how I
got into the bank
I actually went from the Air Force into
I became a professor of medicine in a
medical school interesting transition
and from 1975 to 1986 I was funded by
the National Cancer Institute to study
biological systems and particularly how
does a human cell work and how is it
transformed into a malignant state and
my job was to work with some of the some
of the people that word my advisers were
the leading scientists on the planet and
our job was to actually establish why
cancer occurs because people didn't even
know it at that time and by 1980 we had
established the model which is now the
standard model for thinking about how
cancer occurs and to mathematically
model that occurrence in the human cell
and and translate that model such that
it would be predictive of data on all
the data in cancer patients that we had
in the United States the first time I
ran that model it took a third of the
computer science budget for my
department in the university for a year
and they told me I could never run that
model again so I had to get creative and
I worked with the head of the medical
computing laboratory a physician who was
acquiring new technologies and we got a
fault-tolerant system a system which was
being used in the big banks for
automated teller systems but it had a
unique characteristic to really unique
characteristics it never went down it
was fault tolerant but it also had an
architecture that enabled me to grab
every spare cycle of every CPU and there
were multiple CPUs without disturbing
normal production so for five years I
grabbed every spare cycle on multiple
processors to get my PhD now at that
time a bank the banking company that was
running 150 banks across North America
came by and they said ok you know at the
University you guys have you know all
the knowledge but almost no
money but over the bank we don't know
what we're doing and we have all the
money so why don't why don't you come on
over to the bank you know and and help
us out you know we'll make you the vice
president of advanced systems you can
lead us into the future and and they
said and and we'll make you an offer
that your wife can't refuse
which they did she agrees they did and
so I wind up at the bank okay how many
of you were bankers in here working
banks there's a lot of them in Zurich
okay so I wind up in the bank and one I
the first thing I notice is they have
hundreds of COBOL programmers do you
still have COBOL programmers here in
Zurich few of them still left and I was
looking at what they were doing and I
noticed all their projects were late
your projects till late and and when
they were late the management would get
upset and and and they would put
pressure on the developers and when they
put pressure on the developers it just
made it worse they just got later and
the end and the customers were really
unhappy
now I had spent 11 years modeling
complex systems and was at an expert on
systems theory and so I looked at this
thing called
running software development in a bank
as a system and any system has certain
stable states in a state space and and
and this was one of them and I noticed
that no matter what the management did
they just reinforced this state of late
unhappy people pressure unhappy
customers everything the management did
made it worse and I couldn't believe
what they were doing I said you know
either these people are crazy or I'm
crazy I need to figure this out because
I had never worked in software other
than with my own team writing my
software and we had to solve really hard
problems which we never would have
solved using this system which is
complete failed system okay
so for the next ten years
I tried experiments I went through four
companies where I was head of
engineering and we tried experiments to
try to break out of this out of this
stuck pattern what I was trying to get
to is you know I thought that project
should always be early and you know and
you know we should be kind of the
management you know they should get all
their bonuses and but the developers
should be having fun you know software
development I went into software
development because it was fun it was
interesting okay so that's what it
should be and the customers they should
be ecstatic they should like your
banking software they like they like
their iPhone okay that's what we want
but how to get there because to go from
one stable state to another
you have to across a region that is
unstable there's a lot of chaos out
there so you have to first of all inject
energy into the system that's broken and
the first level of energy we injected
and had to do with what we learned what
I learned from 15 years of working with
entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley how they
started up entrepreneurial teams brought
out new companies took them public and
cashed out and I worked with many of
them who had retired in their 30s never
had to work again in their lives and
they were trying to figure out how to
make the world a better place and they
were doing by building high energy teams
just like they did in the software
business so we noticed that most teams
everybody is headed in a different
little different direction than the
other person you know some people are
headed for
towards some people are headed sideways
some people are headed backwards and if
you can figure out how to align the team
get them all agreed on a central
direction they can immediately double
their performance by working less simply
because everybody is headed in the right
right way
and once you get that going then people
actually feel that what they're doing is
constructive they feel like they're
working together they start feeling good
about one another and then you can start
building team spirit into the equation
just like you do in sports teams and as
soon as you start building that team
spirit you can double productivity again
so when I was interested is is building
teams that could build so much software
so fast the managers and the customers
would be saying you have to slow down
it's too much it's like drinking from a
firehose so I knew it was possible just
a way to figure out the mechanism now it
took until 1993 I got to I was actually
hired into a company called diesel
corporation in 1993 known as the VP of
engineering they were actually
recruiting a VP of engineering but the
CEO a guy named Doug Kahn had just
acquired a software company actually a
German company a German small talk
compiler company and he had bought that
company to take his products to the next
level the easel was I believe the first
fourth-generation language company in
the business and they were getting
increasing competition from companies
like powersoft
and they needed to ramp the technology
to the next level and they thought
object-oriented tooling was the way to
go and so they went up to and bought a
small talk company but the question was
then what were the tools and that was my
job my job was to create a toolset that
and do it in six months that would bring
out a new product that we praise all of
their legacy
products they didn't know what the new
product was they just knew it had to be
twice as good and twice as fast as
anything they'd ever done and Doug said
Jeff you've launched a lot of new
technologies and we've got 10 guys that
can be veve engineering but nobody that
could take this unknown product and
deliver it in record time and we think
that you could do that if you're willing
to come in and take a small team of five
or six people and figure it out so I was
hired in like kind of like a chief
engineer at Toyota build this new car
and do it really fast and on the way
figure out what it what it should be so
off we went the first thing we did as I
had done with many new technologies
object database technologies information
retrieval on the internet several
different things the first thing we
needed to do was review all the
literature in the computer science
journals and research papers to know
everything that had ever been done so
that we could take it beyond and it
always seemed to take about a thousand
carefully studied papers before you got
to the end of what was already available
turned out in this case we reviewed 30
years of IBM systems journals and then
we started wading through everything on
about the 300 paper we came across the
paper by two Japanese guys who are
visiting professors at Harvard Business
School and it was it was unusual because
it was published in the Harvard Business
Review not in a computer journal and in
their professors Takeuchi and Nonaka
talked about going all around the world
looking at best teams what did they see
that really worked and that they and
they noticed that the teams that really
worked really reminded them of sports
teams and really and rugby in particular
and in particular the scrum formation
rugby they worked like all they were all
linked together moving the ball forward
down the field and oh and working around
or overcoming any impediment that got in
the way with intensity and focus and
they had seen this in in many Japanese
manufacturing companies consumer product
companies a couple of US companies that
would not software companies so we
looked at this paper and they described
the style of how management set up such
a team and how they invested it such a
team and how they treated such a team
and we looked at that and they said the
whole team said you know that is exactly
what we need for software development
it'll provide us a formal model to
produce high-performing teams and
Takeuchi and Nonaka had called that
style of project management strum scrum
project management now it's interesting
because that was in 1993 and I I never
met professor Tanaka until this January
I went to Tokyo specifically to meet
professor Tanaka and in that time the
NOC has actually become what many people
argue is the leading management guru in
the planet he's replaced Peter Drucker
the guy who invented the concept of
Management and he is tremendously
fascinated that his work you know
largely in Japanese manufacturing and
management Theory has been inflated on a
huge scale in software all over the
planet and so we spent a good time
together and he said you know when you
go back to Boston professor Takeuchi is
back at the Harvard Business School and
professor Takeuchi had been the Dean of
a hibachi Business School for 20 years
in in in Tokyo and was forced to retire
by hitting the retirement age
and so he went back to Harvard so we get
back there and the first thing he wants
to do lets me to do is teach his class
at the Harvard Business School which
which I did with my wife Arlene last
Friday we got together with a Harvard
Business School students and I find that
he's teaching a different style of
management to the Harvard students
that's a counterpoint you know all this
strategy and driving companies by the
numbers might have some value except
that it's not really how it works if you
go in and look at the best companies how
they started how they became great it's
all about the people it's all about
inspecting and adapting it's all about
being surprised by success and then
taking advantage of it and he's trying
to introduce scrum into the curriculum
in Harvard Business School and this
example he has of Lotte scale deployment
in software is a nice tool for him to
add to his arsenal okay so that paper
scrum was created directly from that
taki Tanaka paper the first scrum team
and we form the team we was based on all
the knowledge that I had gotten from
working with Bell Labs for many years
also working with people at MIT
particularly the media laboratory at MIT
we knew certain things were really
important for example Bell Labs had
removed all titles from development
teams based on ten years of research on
best teams of the world they found what
was it that made teams perform well and
they discovered that it was the way the
individuals communicated with one
another and how they interacted this is
the first principle of the agile
manifesto individuals and interactions
over processes and tools we didn't just
make that up
there's ten years of Bell Labs research
that show that is what's most important
okay
so once they understood that they came
up with a metric to calculate it called
communication saturation then they went
out and did 200 case studies and
companies all over the world and got
hundreds of data points in every company
and did regression analyses to figure
out okay what is it that cripples
communication saturation and brings
performance down and they found the
major thing is specialized roles and
silos of information that's what
destroys productivity and so they said
at Bell Labs we're not going to have
that everybody is going to be a member
of the team so we already had that
before we looked at aki-chan Anaka but
talk you should knock I had a formal way
of setting up these teams and when the
team looked at that and said you know we
had a we had a who should be the team
leader and what would we call them we
decided the scrum master because it was
gonna be scrum and we started the first
scrum team actually started scrubbing in
January of 1994 we worked this all out
in the fall of 93
the first scrum teams started scrubbing
in 1994 about the middle of the first
month of scrubbing we kept on
researching reading studying and we were
looking for you know talk to you to
knock achieves we're not software teams
we were looking for really high
performing software teams and what was
the highest performing software team in
the world we found it it was a team at
Borland they were building Quattro Pro
at the time which was a Excel
spreadsheet kind of product before Excel
existed and those gate guys at Borland
we're delivering software at the rate of
400 guys at Microsoft
guys were worth 400 guys and it was all
because their communications saturation
was so high they were the highest team
on the communication saturation metric
in hundreds of companies and we said
what was it that made that communication
saturation so high and and in the paper
was written by Jim Copeland who's now
working within the scrum community
he showed that it was a daily meeting
that that a cross-functional team had
everybody every day all the developers
all the testers the product the product
marketing people were there often the
CEO was there Phillip Kahn at the time
every day and at Berlin it was usually
at least an hour and we said in order to
achieve that high-performing state we
have to have a daily meeting the whole
team decided that the same day and the
next day we started so it was about the
second monthly sprint that we started
the daily meeting and when we did that
we found that an hour was too long we
didn't like a long daily meeting so we
really worked it how do we get it short
out what how what is the shortest
possible meeting we can get and what
needs to happen in the meeting and by
within about a month we had gotten it
down to 15 minutes and what we what we
realized is that everybody needed to
know everything that was going on and
everybody needed to know how to help
each other and then actually do it help
each other we needed to figure that out
in the daily meeting every day so that
meeting got wound up in the second
sprint we started up in the third sprint
we plan for a month's work based on our
velocity in the second sprint and at the
end of one week we were done and it was
a huge surprise people said what
happened the team had gone into a hyper
productive state it's always a surprise
but when that happened we knew we were
on to something and I had to act
immediately when that happened the team
then was immediately going so fast I had
to go out and get someone to help me in
figuring out how we were going to target
this product properly for the market I
needed someone that I could put out half
the time in the marketplace half the
time and the team explaining exactly the
priority of the features that needed to
be delivered because in three months we
were going to deliver and we were going
to be delivering twelve times as much
functionality as I thought we were going
to be able to deliver so I went to
product marketing I got the best guy out
of product marketing I said come on
you're gonna be over you're gonna be
over working with the team your job is
to own the prioritization by the product
backlog and be there in the market look
at the competition work with the team
every day you're in town make sure they
understand what we need to do to make
this product the best product that the
market is seen when it hits the
marketplace so the goal of scrum from
the beginning was to get five to ten
times productivity what most people do
it using scrum today don't fully
understand yet because they haven't
experienced or achieve this state is
that scrum is a disruptive technology
that if you implement it well your
competition can't compete and you will
put your competitors out of business
that's what it's for that's why I spend
a bunch of my time working with a
venture capital group that's what they
want to do they say Jeff don't go work
for those banks injury in Zurich we want
you you know our job is to start with
small companies and put those big ones
out of business you're just helping that
our competition by helping these big
companies okay so we know systematically
now how to do this with every team
because of my work of the venture guys
they really pushed me to document
exactly how you can take every
I productive and we know exactly how to
do it now just simply we know that
getting software done and tested inside
a short iteration will double
productivity test it at the feature
level so are you so it end-user can
evaluate it if a team can do that they
will double performance we know that if
the product backlog what they're
building is in a ready state it's clear
it's prioritized properly it's in small
pieces its estimable its testable by the
team it's well understood so there's not
a lot of questions and confusion that
will double their productivity again we
know they can go four times as fast and
I've defined that arbitrarily as the
beginning of the hyper productive state
but we find that most teams doing scrum
are not doing that they're not done at
the end of the Sprint their product
backlog is not good so most teams go
into what we call a slow scrum State
okay now the good news about this is
that even slow scrum is better than this
failed system we call one fall you know
at Yahoo after we booted up 250 scrum
teams 50 of them were well trained well
coached they were running at 3 to 400
percent of what the rest of the teams
were doing
but even the other 200 teams they got a
35 percent improvement that 35 percent
improvement for Yahoo was 200 million
dollars of free money every year just by
running a lousy scrum ok
so most of the work that I'm doing these
days since there's so many people doing
scrum now I work mainly people with
already been doing scrum for a year or
two and we're trying to get them from
this slow state to the fast state
because that's where the fun begins okay
people that are on these kind of teams
I'll just close by saying I was in
France France is an interesting company
to try to introduce scrum you know
they're so bureaucratic you know they
have so many managers and but I was
teaching in Paris and I had a guy at the
table on a team that was working on
software from BMWs and all the rest of
his guys on our team was like a scrum
we'll never work in our company and but
I said to this guy that was actually a
Siemens subsidiary and I asked this guy
well how does your scrum we had teamwork
he starts choking up and tears come to
his eyes and he says I can't tell you
the exhilaration I feel it's changed my
life and he wouldn't say anything else
he just shut up so my hope for all of
you who are interested in this that one
day you will experience that
exhilaration but to do it that's the
hard part and that's what Jenna's gonna
talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
