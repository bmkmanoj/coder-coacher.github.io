today we call it lean UX in the
experience economy in reality it's my
practice and the work that I've done for
the last 20 years and I'm going to talk
about today and it's it's I'm going to
cover some of the aspects of how to
become faster at getting to really
really strong products and a strong
understanding of what what's really
what's really important for customers so
how many of you saw some poco earlier
today okay so so son and I we go way
back and a lot of the the stuff we've
done around this area kind of we weave
in and out of each other's lives when at
least when we live on the same continent
and and so some of the examples are
actually work that we did and some of
the things he mentioned you will see
myself referring to that but I better
get the get going so I want to cover
three things
why lean UX now what is lean UX and also
how can we use lean UX because one thing
is to know all the theories and I can
show you a lot of things they might look
easy from stage but when you try them in
real life you run into all sorts of
issues and I'm going to talk a little
bit about that if time permits towards
the end my path to this customer centric
way of working so this year I had a 20
year anniversary
straight and when I came from school I
started straight into Nokia and the
first project I did was 3210 the mobile
phone that that that's really set a lot
of standards for what mobile phone
should be and I spent 12 years at Nokia
with the rise and the fall and like I
can say that one of the reasons why I'm
so obsessed with customer centricity is
that we had it at the on start at the
start
time and we kind of lost it and I've
been working since since those tragic
days of 2007 8 to figure out how does
that actually work from there I went to
Silicon Valley I worked at Amazon I
headed up the the UX labs in Silicon
Valley for Amazon among other I went to
eBay and PayPal and worked for how to
build design culture there and how to
make design practices a common strategic
tool and upon returning last year I've
started I've worked a lot with try fork
and other teams while also studying is
not starting this time but lecturing at
the design school here in Holmen and and
parts of of my time at Cranfield
University in in UK and lately started
at design all the Danish Design Council
to help bring in the design thinking
practices more common into the design
industry there so when we so why do X
now and I want to start with a picture
and I want you to see see if you are all
awake so can you guess what this picture
depicts and there are some clues right
there's some some structural elements
that look pretty familiar up in the
corners and maybe a profile of a church
any anyone know about this story yeah
it's the Eiffel Tower yes and that's a
little dots suspended in there somewhere
in the picture can you all see it do you
know what it is it's a very very failed
product launch that's what it is let's
let's have a look so in 1912 this guy
Franz HL he had developed a wingsuit and
he had called for the whole world press
to come and see the launch of this
wingsuit that he was going to fly
himself he did not know apparently knew
because let's see what happened to the
guy and this is actual
and he's carried away by the I think
that everyone was shocked maybe not too
surprised but and I think that this this
this says it all someone was so
measuring that the depth of the hole
that he left in the ground and so this
is a picture of what happens when you
don't get your your product work right
and you you end up launching something
that's actually a very expensive
prototype and let's do something about
that today preventing that
so in this customer experience economy
design thinking the way that we express
it it's really the way that all the
functions of the company can get
together to work creatively at the on
start that's the way that I that I used
to sign thinking now so it's a number of
tools and thinking styles so that you
can go wrap it and lean into your
product development and we're going to
look at that so the classic PDT a
triangle meeting in the middle and we
want to focus around the user experience
at this point in time
why because launching such successful
products today is all about getting the
user experience right as soon as you
figure out what what the users need to
experience you can start building your
tech systems and your design systems and
your business models from there lean UX
then it's a set of rapid prototyping to
get that user experience done first so
it's a set of learning cycles where we
just continually pound that that drum of
how do we get the customer to experience
what the corresponding customer needs
and then we can add those technology
business and and interface design layers
to it so that means that the lean UX
becomes that engine that sits at the
center of what we do as a collaborative
diverse highly diverse team and let's
let's in this presentation I want to
show you some examples I want to show
you some video from some
work that I did some months ago while in
India and also talk a little bit about
how you can bring that into your own
company and into your own work good and
I also want to mention that startups and
companies that have that have gone agile
they are at an advantage point right now
because they are used to kind of this
cycle and the speed and the testing all
they need to do is add some of that
customer centricity and some of the
tools while
grown and mature companies they're
challenged on multiple parts mostly on
the culture of the front end that's not
there and I can talk a little bit about
that towards the end so let's talk about
the lean UX first of all I want to talk
about lean UX requires empathy the first
thing we do when we start these projects
is to say no matter what we are trying
to do we need to build customer empathy
so here are some cards that we did at at
PayPal a practice that we started well
while I was there so every time we went
to the field we took a picture of the
people we interviewed and we wrote their
story on the back side of those cards
and only the people who had been at the
interview were permitted to share those
pictures and and print the pictures they
were printed looking a lot like
Polaroids and then people shared them at
their desks so you can see here's a at
Christmas time in in the Paris office
someone is really happy because they've
collected some empathy and they've
understood some customers and that's
that's a great thing so let's go and go
to Chennai together how many people have
been in Chennai here visits it Chennai
India yes it's a super busy town it's a
very interesting town some people call
it the Silicon Valley of India India is
getting to 1 billion of people country
that is doing a tiger lab into the
digital world
so we went went there with PayPal to
figure out how could we launch PayPal as
a domestic brand in India so everyone in
India knew a lot of people knew PayPal
but they knew it as as a brand that you
would use when you bought something from
outside and now we needed to go in and
figure out what did people actually
expect of a modern FinTech brand
nowadays and this is some photos from
from that session so we brought the
product manager from San Jose California
we brought the design lead from New York
City we brought the the product
marketing person from Mumbai and we
brought the engineering lead from from
California as well yeah let's let's roll
that and they get a little more volume
it's um
what we're really trying to do here is
understand what is PayPal story for
India we started the same with Robin
Discovery CDI where we got into the
emotional understanding of what people
really wanted and what are the pain
points they have with online shopping
and we take with of those learnings our
starting points for the solution
discoveries in the I which was this one
intense fiery option is like if I can
actually take these prototypes walk
across to my dev team and give it to
them and they be able to start working
on on it
and I think that is extremely powerful
the fact that like one week ago we
didn't even know what we wanted to build
and then a week later we actually have a
document or a design that we can give to
our engineering team to work on it the
fact that we were able to hear from
customers what they want and how they
want it is actually very helpful for us
to go back and say can we build it the
way that the customers wanted and it
also kind of takes away a lot of
assumptions from our mind so it's no
real data that we decided we decided to
call it PayPal credit just so people and
this election we're such an exciting
time to be a part of doing things the
right way in developing products and
selling them to market my views coming
overseas about what we need to do the
launch in India are completely different
to my views going into
and I think anyone who's in a
decision-making role in regards to a new
market launch should also have the
benefit of that person I like that we
can be contrarian we can be bold we can
really explore new ideas and then we can
rapidly go from hey we're talking to a
customer to hey we've got a sketch on a
piece of paper - hey we've got a design
that is you know black grayscale it's
not that interesting it's just it
doesn't look like PayPal - hey now we
have PayPal designed for me this whole
session did not feel like work it was
like I am following my passion
this is the first time we are
interviewing real customers and getting
to know how a product is going to be
built from scratch I think the entire
five days was feeling like a scrappy
startup the workshop is over but our
work has just begun and now we're going
to think of how it was a package all of
this - yeah no and next stop Singapore
and San Jose and hopefully the whole
company is as excited about India as we
are good so what happened here was that
this team that came from all over the
world was supposed to go back and sit in
each their own camps which happens a lot
in global companies and trying to build
something for a customer that they had
that that they didn't know and they
didn't know about how they lived their
lives so before this session we are
taking the the core team and sent them
around in tier 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 cities for about
two weeks to visit people in their homes
and during the workshop we had about 30
35 different types of Indian users or
consumers to come in and interview so
Jacob was a really interesting example
because he's a real New Yorker guy he's
been living in Manhattan and doing
Manhattan ish things for 20 years and
they're coming to India was a big
experience for him let's hear what he
has to say
a big moment for me was when our first
interviewer was talking about him giving
his phone to co-workers and letting them
shop on on his phone and it was just
like you you would just never do that in
the US it was just like that's
inconceivable and if you were told that
that happened you would probably assume
that it was something that was only
happening in only rare occasions not in
his case every day that's a really
different interaction that's a really
different way of using technology and I
love moments like that so stick with me
so one happy design lead there so what
we did is that we took a meeting room
converted it into a design studio
brought in all the monitors and and
designers and put our foot a stick on
the door don't don't disturb and they
actually sat and built and did UX design
work and visual design work all week
with with the user testing studios
happening around them super effective
another person oh yeah I Jason you saw
that but another person that we need to
hear from it's the product manager
product managers at this day in time
it's really hard for them to actually
master doing great products because it's
not about the business case anymore only
it's about user experience and they are
often left with very little tools to
actually explore and write their
requirements on what exactly are the
users supposed to experience if it's
brand-new and they never saw anything
like it before
so she was really really happy to do
lean UX with us what was unique about
the process we didn't day three which
you don't tend to see elsewhere is that
you as a product manager may have some
ideas or thoughts or validations that
make sense but in day three being able
to you know actually see other P
either echo what your ideas were or
provide an argument which helped kind of
disprove your hypothesis was extremely
powerful okay well one of the things
that we that we did and that's what she
referred to and you saw that little wall
there is some of the things that we do
when we do this lean UX we shift between
also as a as a certain Pogo mentioned we
built experience prototypes we test them
and then we try to figure out what we
just learned put them into some
frameworks this is one of the best
frameworks for for us to very rapidly
figure out what to build and what to do
more of so if we look at our ability to
solve severe customer pain or just like
customer pain in the vertical axis
versus how easy is would it be for
PayPal at this point PayPal in India to
launch and operate these products the
concepts that would sit up there to the
right would be the wants to go for for
the MVP and for the pilot the ones to
the left would be the ones that we would
put it put into our to our stack for for
development further development both
business-wise regulatory and also
figuring out more precisely about
experiences the ones to the lower right
would be the ones that we could sprinkle
into the current product portfolio or
just kind of quick quick fixes and then
the ones to the lower left are they in
insignificant ones that we could forget
about and often when we come out and we
do these rapid cycles companies they
will realize that they have spent years
and millions of dollars on stuff that's
actually not asked for anymore and and
the and the wise guy why's companies
will stop and the ones who the ones who
will not listen they will continue until
they are stopped so let's keep Jacob
because I have something more today
Jacob just talked
how how this studio that I just
mentioned before how that was set up in
the middle of all this learning so that
the designers could get the input and
test out their ideas immediately at day
five we did this storytelling and if you
recall from the the video we had the the
VP II or the head four of Asia marketing
showing up and she was completely
surprised because she had actually lived
and traveled around and talked with
agencies all over Asia
but being there and talking with real
customers around real experiences had
opened her mind and she figured out that
it's not about that it was completely
different from from what she had thought
and they weren't they were now going to
figure out how to change that the whole
marketing story based on that experience
so I want to talk about just zoom out a
little bit and talk a little bit into
process so I mentioned to you before
that we sent people out to do field work
and that's also what we do here in in in
Europe and what I've done in us it's not
enough to invite people into a lab or a
meeting room and and drill the drill
them because they will not necessarily
tell you what's actually happening they
will tell you what they think is
happening but by going there going into
the real world and observing you will
see what they do and you will see some
of the things that are part of their
blind spots so based on all this work
you will come out with some themes that
we can bring in and and start working on
as as a as a broad development team and
we we go with these five days sprint so
I know that there's a lot the the Google
sprint book that probably a lot of you
have have read also talks about five-day
sprint and from those 20 years of
experience I have running these I can
tell you why it's five days sprints
first of all it's about as much as you
can as you can a beat and pound on a on
a normal team that are not used to these
tools I get super exhausted so five days
is about the top also five days is about
the top that you
get the a players of the team and the
organization to come join you if you ask
for five weeks not at all if you ask for
for five months you will not get those
guys you will get the guys that are that
are for the project for the core but if
you want to open it up and say who is
the best people for marketing who are
the best people for technology five days
is about the time that you get and
that's that's what we use so how are we
how are we using those empathy as I said
we do one day of empathy one day of
ideation one day of filtering and
selecting one day of iteration and one
day of telling the story so that this
actually becomes something that you can
the company can use in their in their
further life and the actual five-day
workshop the way that you can talk about
it you don't use the lean UX language
you use the language there towards the
bottom which is the language that the
people the the sponsors actually use in
their everyday so you have to translate
your lean UX lingo and Design Thinking
lingo into something that the decision
makers actually understand and they can
relate to so you get customer
segmentation you get you get idea
catalogs you get solution portfolio and
roadmaps
and that's that's the kind of words that
they understand not necessarily filter
and select and and those kind of terms
and then from there we go into agile
development so someone asked CERN how
they fit together to me they fit really
nicely together both of them are really
about acting and learning first and
foremost
but in agile development we start to see
this cycle of development and one thing
that that sometimes fails in in software
companies and other places is that from
the get-go you have a lot of empathy and
a lot of great ideas and and and
understanding but then the guys who
carry that knowledge they taper off and
the development team and the product
manager are on their own
and for every cycle they get a little
further away from how they actually
started with an onset so you have to
keep coming back to the market you have
to keep coming back and talking with
real customers to see if what you're
doing still makes sense or if you are
starting to work on some kind of
illusion that that you're doing customer
centric work while you're actually
sitting in your own room and just
hammering or hammering in everyday
without looking up so you have to look
up and as I say at least every second
Friday you have to look up and make that
customer day and get out of that room
and to get into the real world so this
is this is my vision for how to actually
get this this going three sections the
customer research getting the full team
into the field and really understand the
the Sprint style of bringing the
customer into to a diverse team and then
the agile development where the team
continuously checks in with the reality
and don't stay at home in the in the
office and if we look at that little
part there in the middle of this process
description we have to do our assumption
testing in all steps and and at working
with try four of the last year we've
been practicing on how you can do that
with with people during that five-day
sprint and bringing in customers on a
daily basis actually works even though
it feels to a lot of customers and an
organization it feels a little awkward
how can we continuously keep talking
with customers and what they what they
learn when they when they go through
this lean UX work is that yes we talk
with customers but we talk with them
about different things depending on the
mindset so during the ideation on day
one it's about empathy and not talking
about solutions but understanding what
life they want to live what types of
problems that they face
and kind of just figuring out what are
the themes of areas what are the things
that they dream of what are the things
they want to accomplish and how can we
help them on the ideation day we invite
customers that are a little more on the
creative side and a little more I can
save people that are a little more
accustomed to expressing their ideas if
we have a choice one of the best
projects I've done was when we did
accessibility strategy work for telecoms
in a project and we invited designers
with different handicaps so we had a
blind software developer we had a
fashion designer with a trisys and we
had a teacher with in a wheelchair and
getting people that live a full life
with those certain problems that we want
to address and have creative or is
fantastic it's a lead user scenario you
get where people are actually able to
express how a kind of more nuanced how
they how they need to live their life
but obviously you can you can talk with
normal people and use ethnographic tools
to get a lot of value from them so those
are those are ways that we keep going
also I want to talk to you about the
prototypes because you saw in the video
from from Chennai that we focused a lot
on this paper prototype software
experiences which are important but you
can also do a lot more and a lot of
different things so let's just go
through some of them for example when
you want to work and understand a new
business case why not set up a business
case spreadsheet so say if we did this
solution the way we did how would a
month in in your business look like
using this solution in that way you get
to talk with the CFO's of this world and
the CEOs of this world and and figure
out what
their needs then you can you could go
with a company pamphlet which is like a
little folder either it's a little PDF
you can ship around or maybe it's a
print little print guide that talks
about the value proposition and in that
way you can get to talk to a lot of
ordinary people about this solution to a
problem that we want to learn a little
bit more about and also if you cannot
print it on a on a simple folder chances
are that you don't know what you're
doing right so so it's a really really
good exercise to just try and do a
simple a five-fold print folder take it
to the print shop and look what you what
what comes back if it still makes sense
the digital version is a landing page
where you can do a lot of conversion
testing you can put up bold statements
and then put a button that says learn
more and then you can actually do a very
very quick test on does this have
traction or not of all the people who
land on this page how many would
actually have liked to learn more of
this concept finally you can also do a
value proposition showcase video and
we've done that the the process of
getting to a to a three minute video
that expresses a concept more thoroughly
think of a Kickstarter like movie that
process is extremely valuable because
you actually end up developing your
concept while you are thinking in
storytelling modes then you have that
choreographed product experience down
there to the left which is you can see
it looks like a little theater and you
can you can kind of fake your way to a
product experience before you get any
line of code done and where that started
was a we did for example ATMs were made
of a little box and the people could
punch in but then inside there was a
little bank clerk who was actually doing
the work and and putting out paper slips
to see what kind of tone of voice and
what kind of features actually worked
and in that way you will also hear it
referred to as a ghost in the machine or
we sort of us if you talk with some of
those lean UX guys that those are those
concepts that you do really really
powerful stuff to learn and the the
storyboard for the experience just right
say well if this was a play let's write
the scripts for what the who are the
characters and what do they accomplish a
very very strong way of doing a
prototyping - for experience and then
finally the more kind of traditional
prototype putting a learning clickable
shallow front-end and then also working
on a back-end and then have some people
connect the two dots often if you do if
you if you work in in e-commerce you
would do a landing page and people would
say I want to buy this and instead of
hooking them onto some payments you just
sent an email and then they will again
be some clerk somewhere running the
payments in manual works so if we
rearrange these I want to talk about how
to do prototyping a little bit and why
we do prototyping so let's look at two
dimensions for prototyping if you think
about fidelity the fidelity of a
prototype or any solution is how well it
resembles the final product so high
fidelity prototypes are made with the
right topography with the right
materials with the right size with the
right materials low fidelity made with
paper cardboard big boxes and what have
you and when we look at the resolution
the resolution of a concept is how much
of the of the functionality of the nth
functionality is actually expressed in
that prototype so if it's a if it's an
e-commerce page if you do a lowres maybe
it's just the check-in and if you do a
high-res it's the full experience right
so let's let's put some examples of
paper prototyping super-powerful you
should always do a paper prototype and
you should always be doing paper
prototyping of any experience that you
want to do before you do any code
hypermarket Singh so imagine that you
say let's just skip expressing the the
solution and just talk about how we want
to sell it because with those talking
points we can realize if people would
buy it at all if they would ever get to
your code right so anyone know of June
the product of June service yeah so
tense get back had a landing page for
June up for eight months during last
year that was no more than a hyper
marketing prototype with some learn more
and sign me up super powerful way of
learning something for those high
resolution low fidelity very typical
engineering type so principle prototypes
you say you you should you go to the
engineering department and I have this
big box with all these wires coming out
and they say yeah this is this is the
product we're going to do and then we're
going to shrink it into this package
right so that means that it's low
fidelity but it has a very high
resolution because it actually does what
you want it to do it's very very hard to
test these kind of prototypes on people
and sometimes you see companies that try
to kind of bring in this big bulky thing
in into to the sales and say you want to
buy this and it senses are that that not
a lot of people can see what you see
when you see that and then finally pilot
prototypes and kind of high fidelity
high resolution prototypes why it
actually does everything and it looks
like it but in reality is perhaps not
very scalable perhaps it's a it's run on
software that that could not scale from
a thousand pilots accounts to a million
right so you you you also want to build
some of those and system but what you
also have to see is that you need to go
progressions right so you need to go
through progressions from left to right
and a lot of times when we go into two
projects and I work with companies
there's a tense that's this creep that
people say oh we want to do it much
better Michael let's just make a high
fidelity prototype at first go and what
I say I say no let's I shy away from
those because if you spend a lot of
money you are afraid of killing it and
the reason you build prototypes is to
kill them and learn from it you have to
be able to scrap any prototype that you
build and being happy about it
because you've learned something so I
remember once at Nokia we had to we
built this super realistic new product
we found someone in New York that could
build it and it'll cost a hundred
thousand dollars and we carried it into
this meeting and the VP was through
trying it around and then oops and and
it and it died and that was the last
time I did such a such an expensive
prototype for that type of project
absolutely because the higher quality of
the prototype the less you invite for
co-creation and comments for change
right because it's your darling people
don't wanna upset
they don't want up to upset themselves I
said holy crap we spent three months
building this and I actually don't like
it I better better keep quiet and the
risk is that this this a bad concept
actually continues a little too long so
the the idea of lean for lean UX is to
go to the experience and do it fast
to learn to to correct and and only to
only promote great stuff right so only
built the minimum prototype possible to
satisfy that current learning goal you
have don't kind of over emphasize and
say hey if we just spend another week
and they put some gloss we could also
use it for the car show or the the trade
show or whatever because it's actually
going to lose its purpose and I want to
talk how am i for time
yeah that's good because I want to talk
a little bit about how we could use
linear X so I showed you some and talked
about some of the principles and some of
the methodology that we use in the field
and it I don't know how you feel but but
at least I find them pretty simple
because the issue with lean UX is not
the theory it's the practice it's to do
it because there all sorts of reasons
why you're not doing it and while
thinking of it I put some solutions in I
said at least from my experience we need
to work on three layers we need to work
on an essential on the practitioner
layer digital concept making this way of
doing five steps and getting really a
quick at those mindsets and and having a
team around you that understand what
what that implies building concepts
accelerate the the product development
process getting some of the new design
tools embedded in the in the
organization but you also need to go to
the leadership and get real sponsors
which is often one of where lean UX and
and other new methodologies fail because
it's so incredibly hard to express the
the value of this until you have been in
it remember the the marketing VP from
that video she said going into this I
had a completely different idea of what
we were to do than coming out of this
and I see that again and again that
sponsors and senior people they it's
really hard to them to figure out what
the hell is going on in these world wins
of sprints so we need to invite them we
need to tell the story for them in words
that they understand and we also need to
work with them to inspire them so you
also heard earlier the
companies like try fog and others do
these safaris where they invite senior
leaders to places where these new
processes are being done I see them as
part of this whole inspiration and
figuring out your your maturity as a
company so you need to work or you may
need to make sure that work is being
done on the most senior level that
there's an aspiration and a readiness to
go these ways otherwise the
practitioners will have to work
undercover and it's it's seldomly goes
well for very long working on the cover
in a company in a company even though it
has to be done at times but varying the
appetite figuring out what it is that
you want to do establishing actual
programs so in my time I've done several
practitioner training courses and the
the successful ones were always
supported by a c-level sponsor and these
kind of partisan ways of doing things
they only survived for a very very short
time so super important this whole
senior leadership thing the culture
anchor is the is the last thing so one
thing that I hear a lot when we do these
workshops for a week is that people are
very excited they're like energized like
oh we can't stop where this is the best
thing and then they come back on the
Monday morning and the world is the same
they have changed but the company didn't
change which actually brings a lot of
frustration and for some of these
innovation manager executive education
is up to about 50% of the people who are
trained in these tools they end up
quitting their job because they cannot
they cannot make the rest of the company
change with them so they've been kind of
our store they have out stood themselves
so we have to work on the culture of
innovation and we have to work on that
whole kind of story of what it is that
we do
so getting design thinkers in to inspire
getting the storytellers in to inspire
and also establishing new ways that new
goals to work from that are more towards
the the lean agile way of working so
that people can live out their passion
and being doing a great job and not the
opposite good so let me finish on that
just to recap if you want to build a
sustainable design culture that is
capable of using lean UX you have to
have support from the top you have to
build a dedicated practitioner layer and
you have a at most times you need an
orchestrated change management on an
organization level and then lean UX
becomes super simple yes that's what I
had
and I want to open to see if we could
have some if there are some q and A's
there is I will take it from the bottom
how much are the customers involved
participating in the five-day sprint
okay so customers are involved in those
five days Sprint's that I do I do day
one so they need to come and express
their actual needs for the full team so
it's not enough that a couple of them
have been out doing field work and they
come back very inspired and say oh these
are all the things the people they have
to see and hear and be super close to
customers expressing the problems that
we need so that's day one day two
co-creation ideation getting getting
ideas made it's not that you can ask
customers to give you the concepts but
if they are around while you do your
concept making you can test some of your
assumptions with them real time we also
involve customers in the iteration that
we do for prototyping so we built a
version of a prototype in the morning
invite someone in before lunch reiterate
in the afternoon and invite some more in
at the evening and if it's a global
company with a with a kind of offices
other places I've also had other offices
doing tests over the night so that when
you show up on the on the last day you
actually have some some more test data
so you involve them at least in those
three levels the filtering and sorting
not so much and the storytelling of
course they're involved but it's the
story that we tell we don't tell it to
them so that that's how they involved
Thanks
how to solve the situation where all
ideas are of high value and feasible to
implement yeah that's that's that's a
good one you have to you have to step
back and work a little bit more nuanced
on your
Syria because you if you have a bundle
of dots in your in the space that sits
on top of each other if you zoom out and
you start stretching that space you will
learn more so typically the beginners
problem in this is that everything is
important and everything is urgent and
it all ends up in the same quadrant and
I all we do is we need to just stretch
that space and learn a little bit more
so go back a little to assumption work
before you go into the filter session if
you end up bundling everything there
yeah and also if you think of MVP you
will also have to just figure out where
to start so it make a starting point
that can give you value and give you
learning
almost from from on set that's a very
good place to start going with something
that would require a lot of work before
you could get feedback is it's not a
good place to start so there's always
some of your concepts that are easier to
to learn from than others and those are
the places you should start yes cool a
few more questions how do you handle
companies with 80% power point
management as Nokia was I remember your
sessions there oh cool yeah actually
yeah for a long time I have abandoned
power points from my sessions full week
except for the int storytelling on day 5
we need to create a PowerPoint show
because people they need something that
they can use to carry back to the
organization when they come home when
they return again and so just get people
give a PowerPoint a break and start
doing real work it's a very good
PowerPoint is good it's really really
good for something but not for design
work not for design work yes
last question perhaps how do you recruit
the right customers to participate in
the right amount great question
so the way that that it's done it's an
iteration and the way that I've I've
seen is that if we have time time
permitted we we take that the the whole
core team out to do a couple of
interviews a little in advance and then
we go and we talk about what we saw and
we figure out that we could circle in on
a couple of generic or global problem
themes and from the global problem
themes you start to craft a screener
that says we want to talk to customers
who within the last three months have
experienced some of our key problems so
for example that at PayPal I was going
out to work for solutions around credit
card fraud in Italy and so the screener
we did we said we want to talk with
people who have completed transaction
online within the last three months and
have had the credit card cloned and and
hacked within the last three months
because then the pain and the wound is
fresh and people actually remember what
happened if you if you if you spend time
valuable time and you do not make a
strong screener chances are that you
will have to speak to ten until someone
expresses that core problem that you
want to address so you have to work on
your screen errs and make sure that the
people you talk to
they have real experiences of the kind
of problems that you want to solve yes
excellent I think that's it thank you
very much thank you
