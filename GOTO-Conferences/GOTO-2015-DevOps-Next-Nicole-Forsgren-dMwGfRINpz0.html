coming to my birthday party thank you
for throwing me such a fabulous party um
as a quick reminder this will turn on
you can go to the go-to app click on
engage right the sessions so DevOps next
part of my background is that I was in
tech for a long time I was a software
engineer I was a hardware engineer and
then I went got a PhD because I was
always fascinated with what made
organizations click what made our
software development and delivery
processes better because we can always
hear stories about what makes us better
but I wanted evidence right I wanted a
really good story but with some data to
back it up because I you know sometimes
we go to our managers sometimes we go
and we ask for more support or we ask
for more funding or we ask for more
resources and they always say and yeah
but that's not going to work here yeah
but that's somewhere else so for the
last several years since the late Ott's
I have studied how teams in
organizations technology teams and
organizations can really drive IT
performance and not only that how that
IT performance contributes to
organizational performance and when I
say organizational performance
I generally mean like money so how does
it make us better so for decades
organizations would invest in IT but
this money was basically just going down
the drain right so we'd put money into
IT but it never showed up on the bottom
line it never showed up in financial
statements it was just a way to keep up
has anyone ever heard of the term cost
Center yes
IT was always a cost Center they gave us
money because they had to but they also
gave us money and they put us down in
the dusty corner in the basement
right we're always laying cable in the
dusty corner in a basement we don't have
good desks we don't have good offices
because they didn't think that it was
going to help them we were not going to
be something that would help us move the
organization forward but suddenly we
started noticing a handful of
organizations that could and they did
this by using certain practices and
processes and here's why they weren't
just buying a server throwing in a
closet giving it pretty up lighting
because another any other company your
competitor could buy that same server
throw it in the closet buy a
competitor's server throw it in the
closet it would do the exact same thing
you could even do hard things you could
buy ERP systems but so could anyone else
it was basically the same thing so we
would call that a point of parody not a
point of distinction it was enough to
help you keep up it was never enough to
help you get ahead so that just sucked I
think that just wasn't gonna be enough
until we started digging a little bit
deeper so starting in late 2013 I sat
down we started doing some research with
Jess humble Jean Kim the team at puppet
labs and we realized that the DevOps
movement is seeing something that's very
very different and it's because it's
this unique mix of people and process
and technology right it's not just
technology it's all three and it's
starting to make big differences in
organizations and now we're hearing a
lot of stories of how companies are
actually making money and how they're
making big big differences so we decided
to do this study and include a measure
of organizational performance because
now you have the chance to not just have
a competitive advantage but have a
sustainable competitive advantage you
can get ahead of your competition and
you can stay ahead it's not just going
to be for a little bit at a time so
here's what we found DevOps is good for
IT performance and this IT performance
translates to organizations so quick
background where did we come from a
quick history lesson have you guys heard
of this talk is anyone here familiar
with it 10 deploys per day dev and ops I
see a few hands okay so for some of you
who may not be familiar with this there
was a talk given at velocity 2009 by
John all spa and Paul Hammond dev and
ops cooperation at Flickr they are doing
ten deploys per day at that time this
was just completely unheard of people
who were at the conference talked about
it people who were not at the conference
talked about it and it seems like the
crowd was split some people thought this
was the most amazing amazing thing they
had ever heard of this was revolutionary
this was groundbreaking the other half
the crowd is like this is the worst
thing you could ever possibly do this is
inhumane what are you doing to your ops
people you were just like to hammering
them into the ground because if you know
like dev teams right like you hand it
over you're going for a happy hour it's
a party like we're about to have the
offs teams are like anime panic but also
on Hammond are telling this story as a
success story so that was 2009 let's
look at some other examples this is now
Amazon deployment stats now let's be
real this is Amazon they have more
service in god they're reporting over a
thousand maximum deploys in a single
hour
that's the deploy about every eleven and
a half seconds mean number of hosts
receiving deploys simultaneously is ten
thousand with a maximum of 30,000
deploys okay so let's back that up but
still let's look at Etsy that's he's
code deployment in 2013
Mike Britain reported I think this was
even at Q Khan
he said what once took six to 14 hours
and what they called their deployment
army now in 2013 took 15 minutes in a
single person they were doing 30 deploys
per day in 2013 in March 2014 at Q Conan
London he reports 52 plays per day and
just a month later at chef Kampf they
report doing 80 to 90 two plays per day
so look at that growth curve look at
that learning curve this is this is
clearly not a fluke what Flickr had been
reporting so here's what we're saying
DevOps is good for IT now what I'm
talking about what's good for IT here's
what I'm talking about when I talk about
IT performance I'm gonna focus on two
things I'm gonna talk about both
throughput and stability okay so we want
to move code through the pipe as best as
we can but we also like don't want to
take it down at the at the back because
that doesn't help anyone so when I talk
about throughput I'm talking about
deployment frequency okay now keep in
mind this doesn't necessarily mean
you're delivering to customers that can
be a business decision okay but we are
talking about how often you can deploy
we are also talking about Oh at the
bottom another throughput statistic is
lead time for changes code commit to
code deploy how long does it take you to
get that through your pipeline we also
have mean time to recover those are the
three things that statistically load
together we do actually capture one more
statistic that is change fail rates so
when you do introduce a change to your
production system does it result in a
failure or since we know that our
systems never actually fail we just
emergency patch them forever and never
until they actually come up we did ask
if it results in the system failure or
change in service or degradation of
service so what I'm talking about
IT performance what we did is we
collected those measures and then came
up with categories of companies counters
you have IT teams high medium and low
okay so they they fell into
logical groupings by themselves the data
did high medium and low so here's what
we see high-performing DevOps teams are
more agile so we see more throughput
high-performing teams compared to low
performing teams we see 30 times more
frequent deployments we also see two
hundred times faster lead times than
their peers this is fantastic
sothe right think about this what this
means for your company this can mean
faster time to market faster time for
features let's pretend that you live in
a fancy world where you have no
competitors this could mean faster time
getting a security patch out this could
mean better compliance and regulatory
responses high-performing DevOps teams
versus low-performing DevOps teams are
also more reliable so in 2014 the data
reported 3x and in a 2015 data set it
was 60 X changed success rate so when a
change was introduced into production it
was much less likely to result in any
kind of incident and when we talked
about faster MTTR 2015 it was 168 X so
these are huge numbers right so this is
no longer we can't do this by the way
this is on thousands and thousands of
respondents so we're talking about over
14,000 respondents to years of data
thousands of companies over a hundred
countries so this isn't just startups
this isn't just enterprises this isn't
just one country this is around the
world so if you're thinking about how
this could apply to you think about the
times when we were asking for resources
we were asking for support we were
asking for money this is how this has
helped your company and now we have
evidence so here's what's really
interesting DevOps promises and actually
delivers better throughput better
stability and they move together they
moving tandem
we aren't seeing trade offs anywhere in
the data this flies in the face of what
traditional IT has told us we have to do
we've always been told that we have to
throttle our throughput in order to get
stability has anyone here ever heard
that before I'm seeing some hands right
and a few people are like maybe not
wanting to put up hands we've heard this
right we've always heard that we have to
slow things down well do you know what's
interesting we don't see it anywhere in
the data nowhere year-over-year we
consistently see that throughput
instability move together when you think
about it this makes sense because
stability is just when your system goes
down you need to be able to rollback or
introduce a patch or a new change into
your system what's the difference
between your emergency change and your
regular change process no testing how
how awesome of an idea is it should like
put a change into production without
testing it especially when your system
is already down not great so if your
pipeline is already very very efficient
this is this has immediate payoffs and
stability so we talked about this right
when you're more agile you have more
content delivery you can start doing
things like a be testing as well you can
see what types of things are good for
your company value around speed to
market you can also do compliance and
regulatory changes and security as well
now this is a great quote by Koh hobby
they did a lot of experimentation at
Microsoft and they found that evaluating
well-designed and executed experiments
that were designed to improve a key
metric in the organization only about
1/3 of those experiments were successful
in improving the key metric so think
about having a pipeline where you can
introduce code and do a/b testing if
only 1/3 of those are successful
two-thirds of those are not with the
ability to back out those 2/3 you now
are more efficient
the work that you do or you can take the
time spent on this two-thirds and like
go on holiday okay high-performing
DevOps teams are also more reliable we
talked about this as well so what does
this mean for value and savings around
reliability value and savings around a
system uptime compliance and security or
even reputation around compliance and
security imagine the press releases that
your company can put out when you're the
only company that doesn't go down are
you familiar with Netflix and and what
happened when AWS went down years ago
Amazon went down and they went down for
a while and the funny thing is is that
Netflix didn't really notice the first
few hours for a long time people thought
that it was conspiracy Netflix had their
own special batch of Amazon Cloud
because they were such a massive client
no a couple hours in that was when they
noticed because everyone else was in a
panic well they finally made it to about
five hours down when they finally
decided to declare a sub one incident
what happened they had such amazingly
reliable systems because they had been
building it and testing it that their
systems just didn't go down it was from
something called chaos monkey have you
guys heard of chaos monkey you don't
choose chaos monkey chaos monkey chooses
you BES they were already used to
failure they were used to building in
failure and learning from it and
building very reliable secure systems
and when something went down they could
bring it up very very quickly so we also
took a look at the data to see which key
factors correlate with each component so
other things that are very good we can
see version control for all of your
production artifacts by the way this
includes system configurations
application configurations not just your
code all of those are important and we
see that because any time your system
goes down you need to be able to reap
revision from code very very quickly
automated testing monitoring continuous
delivery all of these are important some
other things that are interesting to
note here culture big predictor and very
important which we've known at least
anecdotally job satisfaction it's a huge
predator number one predictor of
organizational performance and a climate
for learning by the way new research
suggests that the transformation is
worth it has anyone here heard of the
mythical man-month
so in production like actual production
of like widgets and things as you add
more people you can make more things
this doesn't work in software delivery
but we went ahead and we took a look for
organizations that are deploying at
least once a day we cut down the data to
only look at that this is a plot of that
so your y-axis is deployment frequency
and your x-axis is number of developers
so if you take a look at that line that
kind of dives these are your low IT
performers they're doing everything
possible to shove cut out the door and
as you start adding more developers it
that's your mythical man-month right
that just tanks if you take a look at
your medium IT performers that's the
straight line right around you're not
seeing increases at all take a look at
that yellow line though these are our
high IT performers these are the teams
that are doing DevOps and they're doing
it incredibly well and incredibly
efficiently we see evidence to support
the fact that if you can undergo this
transformation and you can do it
incredibly well you may be able to break
the barrier of this mythical man-month
you may be able to add developers and
increase deploys so this transformation
and this investment is worth it okay so
we see that it's good for IT how does it
carry through to organizations took a
look at the data and we see that high IT
performing organizations are twice as
likely to exceed profitability market
share and productivity goals now this
was across the entire sample of data
when we took a look at the companies
that were large enough to be traded on a
stock exchange so that's a smaller set
of data we saw 50% higher market cap
growth in the previous three years which
is really fascinating and great to find
because historically people have always
said especially enterprises large
companies have always said oh that only
works for unicorns that only works for
small companies here's some solid
evidence that it's working for large
companies as well and it's working in
big big ways so main contributors to
organizational performance we see here
that IT performance and a strong strong
DevOps practices so we know that an
organizational culture is very important
and job satisfaction now let's take a
look at organizational culture quickly
one is a pathological and power oriented
another is rule oriented the last is
performance oriented also called trust
oriented we can see clear differences
here particularly in how information is
shared how trust flows through the
organization take a look right through
this who here has a friend that works in
a power oriented or pathological
organization you are a friend you see a
few who here works or has a friend who
works in a bureaucratic organization who
here or a friend has a friend that works
in a performance-oriented organization
okay so in the data we see it fall out
about half or enroll oriented again this
is the really interesting thing about
this is that this in particular
contributes both directly to IT
performance and directly to
organizational performance
so this carries through the organization
and we can see themes of DevOps culture
throughout this the fascinating thing is
that this actually comes from a
sociologist who studies healthcare and
Aviation things where it's a very
complex system and the risk is very high
and if you mess up people die but
research also shows that we
feel the risk and we feel the pain when
we worry about screwing up - right I'm
sure we've been there when we introduce
an error into the code or when our
systems go down like we feel it I
remember feeling it so this carries
through as well and we see we know that
cooperation is important when we work
across teams risks are shared we know
bridging is encouraged failure leads to
inquiry we know that blameless
post-mortems are an essential feature
and a key component of doing the work
that we do fast feedback loops are
really important and that novelty is is
such a big thing here so culture Scott
Cook is the founder of Intuit
he says by installing a rampant
innovation culture we performed 165
experiments in the peak three months of
tax season our business result
conversion rate of the website is up 50
percent employee result everyone loves
it because their new ideas can make it
to market so into it is a tax software
ten years ago no one would dream of
doing huge experiments in the middle of
tax season that would just be crazy but
what else are you going to run
experiments no one else is going to be
using your software except when they
actually need to be using your software
so it was risky but it was important and
the thing that I like about this call
out here is that he points out that
conversion rate of the website is up
that's their customers but he also
points out that it makes the employees
happy imagine an environment where you
can introduce changes and you can try
out what you want to do you can do your
own experiments if your experiment works
that's great but even if your experiment
doesn't work you've had the opportunity
to test it and try it on real customers
this is another really great example
Greg Linden was at Amazon and he had
this great idea for recommenders at
checkout I assume we've all been to
Amazon and ordered something and I'm
checkout the recommender system is there
he walked into an SV P's office senior
vice president he had already mocked up
the prototype he walked into his office
and he showed it to him because he was
thinking when I go to the grocery store
they have loads of candy they have
magazines they have all of these
things I can buy on checkout senior vice
president looked at him and said
absolutely not you cannot do this
because I'm too worried that if they see
it they will be customers will be
distracted and they will leave you can
just close a web browser and a grocery
store you can't leave it's like you're
physically there you're not going to
leave on a website it's different you
could just slid off you can do anything
you want SVP said no Grenland this is
okay fine
turns leaves walks out it goes back to
his office typey typey pushes it into
production
he'd coded up an a/b test pushed it into
production leaves it up there for a
little bit comes back later with data
showing significant gains in revenue
what kind of an organization do we work
in can we work do we work somewhere
where an organization has a culture that
against the express wishes of your
senior vice president you push something
into production and if you have data to
support what you did you don't get fired
Greg says I think building this culture
is the key to innovation creativity must
flow from everywhere whether you're a
summer intern or the CTO any good idea
must be able to seek an objective test
preferably a test that exposes the idea
to real customers everyone must be able
to experiment learn and iterate I'll
point out here the culture was
absolutely key but also who else works
in an environment where your
infrastructure supports this they had
the foundation to be able to do this as
well job satisfaction is also the number
one predictor of organizational
performance and the data that we did and
we've seen this for decades across
several organizations although it's
funny because for years people are like
I wonder if this works an IT yeah maybe
we don't put us in the basement of our
jobs that counts so so we know IT
performance is comprised of both
throughput and stability and both are
possible together they move together
you don't need trade-offs we never see
them okay IT performance contributes to
org performance culture as a key
predictor
of both IT norik performance automation
and tooling are important so I've got IT
performance and organizational
performance but what drives eighteen
organizational performance what else is
there that's what we looked at next so
step one define and investigate IT
performance step two
question mark step three profit okay
first we took a look at continuous
delivery we wanted to look at automation
and tooling practices okay so when we
took a look at continuous delivery we
specifically looked into these things
these things held up as being
statistically significant in the data so
test deployment automation continuous
integration and all production artifacts
inverse control this came up earlier
right as a theme so statistically these
things make up what is continuous
delivery in the data continuous delivery
then is predictive of lower change fail
rates and IT performance so we've had
suspicions about this we've been talking
about it for years now we have evidence
now the data shows us continuous
delivery makes our work better but you
know what's even better than that makes
our work better but it also well hold on
makes it work better also makes us feel
better but we'll get there in a minute
I've got this quote from Yahoo we never
had testability before we have it now we
have this experience and we know this
stuff is working and it's working with
controls they can do their automation
configure and deployment of 250,000
nodes they can deploy up to 140,000
nodes in eight hours so they're seeing
huge efficiencies there and they can
patch the entire thing in six hours so
by the way CD makes our work better
which is awesome but it also makes us
feel better I don't know about you but
that matters to me
as someone who was in tech for a long
time
that matters to me so we found in the
data the continuous delivery decreases
levels of deployment pain and we know
that's right look as you push something
into production it's like the things
that you feel fear the things that
you're worried about it also decreases
feelings of burnout we know that burnout
is a significant problem in our industry
right working all hours working long
nights we feel like a hero for a minute
but if we do that all the time it just
doesn't last and after a while we don't
even necessarily love our jobs anymore
so this is some really great insight
that we got out of this data so and the
really cool thing is that we still see
that tie all the way through to
organizational performance so continuous
delivery fantastically worth the
investment okay so next up we also took
a look at lean management okay because
we know that DevOps isn't just tooling
tooling is important but it's also
practice and processes so within lean
management lean management was comprised
of three things based on the data that
we had the first one is whip limits who
here does with limits Oh some hands okay
by the way pro tip women whip limits are
one of the best leading indicators of
how your team is about to do if you're
if your whip backlog ends up being very
very very big that tends to be
predictive of your future work starting
to fall apart because we start having to
hold too many things in our head we
worry about too many dependencies with
limits are a big deal we also have
visualizations to monitor work and
finally monitoring by the way to make
business decisions don't just like have
monitoring because it's pretty don't
just make a dashboard because someone
asked for it have some monitoring to
make business decisions not just paging
to wake you up in the middle of the
night so these comprise lean management
lean management makes our work better
now an example of this is Etsy at Etsy
if
moves they graph it and they graph it
and they make it visible for other
people to see and they graph it and they
have their graphs an order of priority
so that the dev team and the ops team
can both see it they also use what they
call vertical line technology these
lines represent every time something was
pushed to production so you can see if
it drastically changed something that
was existing in the environment and if
you now have something if you have free
time if you have free cycles and you
have something to do you know exactly
what should be worked on next you can
make a business decision based on that
so lean management also makes our work
feel better it decreases burnout which
is another great thing right again as I
mentioned before we know this is a
problem or a concern in our in our
workforce it also leads to improved
organizational culture that westrom
culture that I showed you earlier
remembered one that was pathological we
had some friends that worked in
pathological cultures we had a few
friends that worked in bureaucratic and
a few people here that worked for
generative cultures lean management
practices helps contribute to strong
trust oriented cultures and again this
carries through now here was a great
quote I was trading with Julia West over
a couple months ago she said I was
trying to figure out why my team was
working themselves to death but not
getting anything done by implementing
with limits we were able to focus on our
work finishing work feels better than
sprinting and feeling like a hero in the
moment because that's only a moment and
again we see organizational performance
carrying through so we can see again
that our devops drives IT and
organizational performance and we see it
through our common themes we we've heard
for years the DevOps is tooling in
automation it's practice in process and
it's culture because if we only throw
money at one you know sometimes we just
want to buy the next tool and plug it in
and think it's going to solve all of our
problems
that's not what helps makes companies
make companies money so in tooling and
automation we see that continuous
delivery drive IT knork performance
practice and process we see that in lean
management practices and culture the
westrom high trust and information flow
so DevOps isn't just IT it's how we
practice IT it's what we do with it
gives us greater efficiency it
contributes to the bottom line it helps
make our companies money but not only
that it helps us feel better in the way
we do that our work so this is the lean
for the software and technology
transformation revolution and again this
is our chance to make those investments
to technology make a difference not just
for technology but for our entire
organizations because no longer do we
work in companies that are just software
or just retail or just finance every
company is a software company so this is
our chance to bring our contributions to
the world thank you very much
remember to rate the session and post
questions and she has some okay thank
you very much yes I have some questions
because people were asking questions
through the app great so first and
foremost how did he get the data about
the company for the mentioned statistics
sure so the data was collected through
the puppet labs state of DevOps serving
and so it was a snowball snowball
sampling method so it was posted through
email lists and mailing lists and then
referrals out through there for whoever
asked the question was that an adequate
answer do you want more okay there's no
scream of more then how can DevOps be
employed in an embedded development
environment for example non-internet
environment a non internet environment
so we actually see DevOps in several
environments we see it in retail we've
seen it even an embedded firmware in HP
LaserJet printers it can the principles
themselves can be applied anywhere
because as I mentioned previously
deploying and delivery can be a business
decision it doesn't necessarily mean you
have to push it out to customers and out
to the web it can just mean breaking
down work into small single piece flow
that moves quickly through the system
and then it can be packaged software at
the end okay and then a soft one did you
know that forest grain is a Swedish last
name and that means River branch I
didn't know that so thank you good thank
you very much for asking questions and
thank you so much for this amazing party
keno Thank You Nicole thank you
