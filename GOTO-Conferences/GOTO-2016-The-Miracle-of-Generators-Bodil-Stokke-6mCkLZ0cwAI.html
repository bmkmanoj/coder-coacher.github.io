do you like JavaScript you are very
sweet people so I've had a relationship
with JavaScript before I make my peace
with it I really like it guys want to
the other extreme but it's what I did
for a living and the thing that that
happened recently is JavaScript girls
like us balance committee and this
committee has actually been in
development language and adding new
interesting feature so jobs come from
completely horrible to slightly worried
over the past couple years and this
latest standard that's been actually
finished and published this 4df 2015
which is the cordilla six until they
decided that we should now call it by
year instead of version number I'm just
gonna keep calling it in snakes because
I'm slow that way and it's easier to say
and and I'd like to tell you today about
one of the most exciting features the
muezzin it's whatever they like
in terms of programming languages fear
one of the really exciting features
about es6 and that's generators and i'm
so excited by generators a little but
this became this is like i'm about
excited about generators as that dog is
about the sausage in his mouth so they
mate we need you to sit sit is a beetle
from austin texas and he has been
relation to huge incident forming he has
this thing where he likes to just sit
and hold food in his mouth not eating it
just sitting that
the tension wagging his tail and Julie
know exactly if you pay close attention
might be hard to see but right before
the image leaves right now right now you
can see it through it
very good see amazing okay let's look my
generators or actually let's see the
brief commotion intimate
I just just like to mention our
technologies we have so many wiring we
sort of in in the intersection of high
finance and JavaScript and we do an
exciting stuff and if you'd like to come
work for us then we got over the booth
downstairs you go check it out
only from the Internet's right now so
generative I before I get to generators
I need to show you another feature
that's not true leads up to generators
called iterators that's not so much
language feature as that's not so much a
language feature thank you welcome this
thing ah it is a standard library
feature and it's attached isn't it
right um it's raitis absolutely the
defined interface musics for iterating
over the things that you could iterate
over
like say an array in JavaScript so if we
got an array called ponies which has the
main takes opinions from my company
we can be like this they're a race we
can get oh yes right the companies we
can't in factor them index looking at
the length of them and and from there
it's to extrapolate how we can walk
through the entire array but we can do
that using iterators as well so if
you've done any sort of traditional
object-oriented language like Java and
c-sharp or even seen a lot of the
traders before is essentially Sofer
rates now have this numerical values
which can get you an iterator of the
values inside of the array and this
gives us an object an iterator object
which has one method to call next so if
you call next on I knew it Twitter
it gives us an object and the object it
takes to property is value and done the
value is the next value or in this case
the first value up to the array and the
dome is saying whether we are iterating
us and it's that's fortunate house so
we're not done if you want for the
entire thing we've got applejack already
you in Fluttershy Pinkie Pie rarity done
with no money seven iterates it and
there's a person using tax for each
purchase
oh that's Mia for loop so instead of
doing like the we're doomed three-part
see thing that you had to do to to
iterate over an array previously you
could do something reckless of pennies
and the other thing is me that's a way
not taking anything that can be a way to
cover like the very and very simple
thinking
all about this so if you just like
console of the eye and we won't get
explain is that it's a medical let's
look at the mechanics of this so I
written my own custom each racer here or
a race car business together but as long
as you have an object that implements
the interface of initiator or a
miserable then you can Romero I come
here it's like very we've got a count as
the incremented when you call next then
if it's well normally returned in Copiah
if it's too weird to Rainbow Dash say
only if I could be honest this is just
an object which has a method called
symbol does iterator those symbols are
remembered another new feature in
JavaScript in India six but if you like
symbols in lists for in gravy
they are a nice thing that can be tacky
in an object and for whatever reason
then funded instead of a having like the
usual string is racer method name they'd
they're descended a good four cylinders
in traitor sure why probably a good
reason but we have to implement slightly
similar saturator is a function a method
which takes no arguments and returns an
iterator the interactor yeah it's
something that has a mixed method and
that's it
so now we can instantiate this I think
all same with my custom iterable is
called pennies pennies symbol iterator
so I guess I'm here to make sure I don't
next see when I b1
pinkie pie call it again and see will be
- - its Rainbow Dash after that because
done so increment 60 every time you call
it but that gives us done and thus also
a new constructor method on the array
Britta time which is called from this
isn't it
so if you got any kind of or miserable
we can convert it into an array by
according the regional from and it takes
something that's in trouble or an adroit
i've been in trouble so that gives us
the list of two pennies and at this
point I'd like to show you a little
expansion bad way to mai-mai rebel I
come on my frontier this is not an
actual JavaScript feature is just for
convenience so I made it to an iPhone
with an ampersand so if I go ponies
right now I'll get an object but if I go
how innocent on anybody if it's an
effector or an iterable it will walk in
for me and prints what comes out of it
so this one gets this Pinkie Pie and
Rainbow Dash done done if I might but
you can also do slightly more
interesting things like I made this
infinity which as you can see it's very
straightforward is outputs numbers
incrementing numbers incrementing one by
one forever
there's no at it it never goes into done
so
and up next it starts at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
to infinity I can do 40 favorite.i
and feel free to stop me it's a good
idea so the things this is going to
crash my browser and if I render because
it just takes the audio give you and run
never actually finishes and because I'm
running a Chromebook that means the
browser is the operating system so it
would be very unfortunate so let's not
be nasty
I can't drive safely do you mind if I
didn't think that would actually just
take the first time an exact of it just
so I sort of keep myself from doing
anything stupid I didn't see it goes up
tonight and then it stops taking but it
indicates that there are more monies and
we're not actually done so that's cool
with you then we can imagine building
I beat illative library on top of this
like for instance we can have a function
intake which takes a number and initial
and takes own in the first X values of
initial month so I think I'm like take 5
out of infinity guess there's only the
first 5 natural natural number visiting
that's cool and we can in this one we
can actually do for me further
safely
thank you mrs. find numbers we can go
further we can add like a map function
so if we go to take if I'm out of
infinity but still it's a fact and we
can add on the map so map in case you're
unaccustomed to functional programming
it's a function which takes a function
and any trouble and for each value at
immeasurable it supplies the function to
it and reaches the trouble of the
applied monies which means that I can
add a function like is I plus five which
is an intensive useful function and it
gets me a list of number setups with
five and that's very interesting we miss
complacence very well it doesn't matter
which order I do this in for instance
okay give me an infinitely starting at
five and I can take five out of that and
I get the same result as previously so
these are actually compensable functions
but she can be really useful if you
think about it the thing though look at
this looked a little code just to do
these simple things
well the boiler wait but the symbol does
iterator and the object being returned
when the next method so on it's it's not
great it's like writing Java to so much
point of page
so I like to actually look at how we can
improve that but first let's do some
pain this is saved with the German are
looking quite pleased it wasn't actually
drooling this one there it makes my
consent so let's try and rewrite as
infinity iterator using a generator
function of static this is what they
used before the generators so if I just
know remotely to delete this before I
try running it one more time so I could
have stand above this coin operated
thing like an infinity is functional
star with no arguments the function star
bus a new keyword in es6 that means we
are making a generator function instead
of a normal function a generator
function is something that instead of
running will return an iterator but you
can get results later I'm going to show
you so my invitation notes a little more
concise I start with let's see if there
are no previously and this time I could
just make an infinite link and so to get
some value out of the normal function
you would just called return that return
the money that will exit the function
and I'm getting you the value as a
result it generates of functions you can
just do this which finishes the
iteration which results in adultery and
but it wants to do yield that's an
integrity you'd C++ not the language but
it will give the value of C underneath
with Molly on C and then go back in so
what the universe is it forces the
generator function and returns a value
to the iterator that we get from calling
it and it's not nice to know if I just
show you so now I can do is infinity and
this time I have to actually call it so
according to the generator function I
get an issue a router and this woman I
can do I don't next first value 0 then 1
and 2 and 3 and so on until infinity we
don't have clear the hints of don't
really respond of course so these are
generating functions I hope you find the
FinTech slightly nicer and disgusting
idea we can also do you know where acid
strike the other central weapon own
generators as well because they just
return vectors yeah person works let's
do the take function
that's a generator function and it takes
your arguments none and visa number of
Oh money to go to say not a neutral so
that that's like zero I need a variable
next we need a winding one C++ it's less
problem incrementing cm and checking it
for John and so I'm getting that X
finally out to be a traitor and
returning it to the variable next and
then I'm checking if that's done yet
the conciseness of JavaScript and we
just use next to Pony women in that one
essentially it we're taking it to enter
in we start putting next event and
either we're gonna get done is true in
which case we're done all we are going
to hit the evening you're gonna get the
value of the thing that came out next
core and we keep going we have counted
up to the number so let's think that
works take five Adam infinity yeah so
that's the same thing that would
determine whether it's the same
principle we wire antenna done and we
Eve next value applied to the function
concept they're just a very fine map is
I plus five
take five out of infinity infinity
applied that weekend that works we can
do interesting things because this is
Travis prayer I plus string though okay
so that's where that went
and then hits way and actresses give you
anything so so far with these generators
team to make like streams of values
which can be really interesting because
you noticed with infinity generator that
we are too unless the lists are
essentially evaluating these streets the
values lately we would ever put the
pubes evaluators needed which is the
very powerful that I concept that's what
we're interested in here today we're
interested in this other feature of
generators which is that you can
actually pass values both ways so I
might written there's extremely clever
function called five up something that
would probably be very useful in your
own business all right we stopped with
with seeming zero but we're going to
infinitely we even see so the first time
we called the generator is going to be
zero coming out but they spoke with what
we do that instead of just evening we
actually get a value out of the yield
and the sign mantasy then we'll
increment see but fired I'll keep going
which means I called five up and gets an
attractant I quote I don't next I get
this array and I'm this plane is waiting
for me the one second and the thing is
I'm evaluating thank you must find so
what's gonna happen that what's gonna
come come out oh come on like get it
and I can Perth in I get up and move and
fight because it's waiting for the value
bag toss in let's go Matt to see adds 5
loops million Leland five I can do - 50
- 45 I can do not a number I know that
that's empty JavaScript fine lovely
language right same at this point so
this is new perhaps the most useful
application of the notion is in today
I'm sure you're thinking right now they
hate own instead of leasing them this
what if we in Roma's think another
interview before we get back just to
rest our brains mr. Sid with bacon 99
okay it's like frustrating
they're drooling I think okay that's it
okay say promises also clearly erroneous
things but we've been solely using them
for a while anyway as as libraries the
problem is is sort of something that's
going to happen so if we have a promise
object we have a value that hasn't
necessarily been coordinated yet but
it's going to you like saying we get
something from the internet and we're
going to get to the string back with the
contents of the Internet and to do that
we can call a method called back on the
promise I'm going to so I made a very
simple function here called units which
just takes the value and returns it from
it that's already realized without money
so we're going to try again perhaps from
it so it's a queen in it right back to
permit and then I can call venom it with
a function that would take the value
that comes in you know so that we chose
premiers and again the pin is fight and
that's what we expected that could be
like yeah and also my other sentiment
words and promises as well I can go and
was in unit five it were waste in the
promise resource and then print the
value by a useful so that's right
it's like that knocks needles just a
couple of everything WTF geeky and let's
go fly the lap time try running it so
alright its prominent first thing we can
house as promised you can see that I
think it's already that the feminine
bonnie is own of me and now my promises
function is sitting there waiting for
the promise to be resolved manning if I
mean it's should be only so I'm just
gonna pass in oMG seems obvious and that
makes it blog and key and then it
returns the next promise it recedes down
the function it gets to the next promise
WTF so I could return baby clap nice
return this ring in Oakland and it
returns final comments BB King and there
needs to be predictable that's resolved
into you knows not that looks nice
number then we're done
don't we make more promises sort of
pointers for the moment what we would
like to do is we would like to add a
function that automates this that would
take in my nature of promises and wait
for them for them to resolve and that
there was the back that's look at that
that's koala run
is now so that's a function of two
arguments the first into the iterator
and the second in because I wanted to
request through this I don't figure than
figured out it and needs receive
different way of writing this I needs to
be a bit of regression so the value is
going to start at the last immunity 20
years Texas well my the way that's
deformed values so if I call this poking
with one element the second argument is
going to default in black you know so me
clapping you look at that the first time
we call next on this of the generator
it doesn't expect a value was that of
just called call it the first one has a
prime month so now it's ready for us and
then if we are not yet done let's demand
then that's to wait for the promise to
finish in a function takes a result and
then all run again with the iterator and
the results so the result here is what
came out of the permits we call that but
because the Val that record in turn up
next value which now is presented to the
generator what the next value turned out
to be after we waited for it to resolve
let's try that's cool run from is this
what auntie Toni see at the beginning
it's amazing
do you know what do you notice what we
did it's not the prettiest thing but we
essentially write a sequence of promises
but it looks like synchronous code it
looks like how that is broken for those
promises to don't but there's no sign of
callback hell or them chains
or anything it's just this one keyword
if we have an AZ value which is what our
premises
we just slap you in front to it and that
one pause this function until there's a
value for it and when the body is ready
we just use it actually a bit amazing so
I like to show you let's have a look
it's a new and browser API this is not
me a six finger this is a new thing they
put in browsers so you're going to put
the back of the old days when you wanted
to get a reasonable start of a URL and
it's nice you wouldn't use this thing
called XML HTTP request which was
invented by Microsoft back in the
nineties probably because at that time
the people remote could imagine that you
would want to fetch anything that wasn't
in the document so it's called XML HTTP
request we call it against a Java shoot
and that's about the nastiest APR you
can imagine for getting a file of the
internet it's really disgusting
so this evening it's a function that's a
confection it takes a you're in this
case I'm a richness from it and that's
it we can resolve a promise it's a
response object that has a method called
no it's very nice resolve at first and
get the result that there is one subject
and there's one subject it has a method
called method called text which returns
a promise for the textual content of
that response so getting that or you
can't read this and to increase the font
size because
the amazing meeting screen so that is
the first paragraph of fallout Equestria
which is my favorite book it's early
it's a family mashup of the two
franchises fallout and my little pony
and it's exactly as amazing as you think
it is that the size of warring piece but
you know makes it so amazing so we just
fetch that of intimate with this bit of
code we fetch that off of my vocal
machine but that's close enough
that's a lot neater than the nature to
be your request if you've seen it a lot
and that's what with a mechanism the
promise this so you can imagine where
I'm going with this we should be able to
write a function that's going to form a
generator function thanks so that won't
touch the file and it will print it the
cops they experience via that you should
have noticed that to you so incidentally
the rules of I'm coding and I'm
guaranteed to to make a mistake it's
only useless but bad mistake and correct
me because ok it's now I'm testing you
it's locally making stupid mistakes that
wouldn't happen so I'm just checking if
you're paying attention if you
as I can run for that now according with
my run function that I write and then
you format not sure that's a text that
seems to work but this sucks a bit I
mean I am doing amazingly I'm I'm doing
a synchronous i/o like it well think
ranae's I am which is pretty cool but
what I would like to do is I would like
to generalize this function I would like
to have a host about to say to URL and
then returns the result of that
instantly so I would like to make a
function that does all these steps but
doesn't actually include it what I want
to do with it because I'd like to to be
able to generalize this into something
where I can just do that later I would
just the bit that fetches none of it
that prints and to get fair I need to
extend my run function a bit for one
thing I needed to return a promise of
the eventual return which means that I'm
going to add from the argument which is
going to which is something I can use to
resolve it from its later I need an ad
suppose if we are done then instead of
continuing the iteration I want to
resolve the promise with next of money
so if I'm returning a value from from
the generating functions that are
yielding value this is what we get as
the value that comes out
I also need to return the promise from
the Revolution so no need the reproach
narrative is a promise that I can just
wait on to get the final money so I'm
right very concisely this time because
you know how it works I'm just gonna cut
corners it takes a your own argument
then onions or eating on the fetch your
home the text this is the same thing
except without be intermediate variables
I wait for the match I quote text in the
rhesus position the response object and
I even that and then return that the
result of the eat so that should get us
text I mean that's pregnant
so this is the the Muricy fanfic I just
sort of changed the names a bit right
well that was embarrassing but at least
when I knew the W have generalized
because I was fetching something else
and here's one that's it very quickly at
the end and I want to show you that it's
not just for actually promises as long
as the better then method we can do some
interesting things like here we've got a
function called things we got out of an
object for pennies with - pain isn't it
I think you buy Rainbow Dash training
function which ones to tell us that
these two minutes are friends because
that is what pain is deep they are
friends and so we get finished up - we
get finished the pine and we returned -
she's friends with pine let's try that
that's for than that thanks Raven - the
friends would think of my obviously so
far spiggot now
Rainbow Dash as happiness is also
friends with Twilight Sparkle so let's
do that
get twine some pain is to try and say -
is friends with twine what's gonna
happen now
well one thing you look at that there is
no join poverty in in my opinion which
means that JavaScript type system is
going to cash this at compile time yeah
yeah
so JavaScript doesn't have a Texas - so
we would expect about JavaScript read
time with frame exception because there
is no to my property that's an error
that we just read one time yeah maybe
now she spends with undefined because
obviously if you try to get a property
out of an object there is another
property you get the venom undefined
which I would like to do here is I would
like to handle this
ideally I'm in this one area but for now
for brevity I'm going to try and handle
this so that if I get better tomorrow at
please
I won't print the wrong thing I would
rather just print nothing so I'm going
to make me a little value yeah I'm gonna
have a function called main me which
takes the money and returns something
dannimal by which I mean something then
method which takes a callback function
for the value the valium constant it's
not now and that is because this is not
a scrip for violation eNOS its intention
and I'm using W class or tell me this
equals in this case instead of triple
equals in the case of comparing it to
none that basically means is none or
undefined which is what I'm after
so if value is not none nor undefined
I want to return functional map
essentially I want to call the callback
function with the value that we put in
this maybe and it's not like this one or
is it not and I would like
maybe five like that I'm looking at
maybe on five then is maybe of six that
guess it's a six but if maybe the first
maybe it's none that nothing happens
instead so the chain stops if one of
these values is not it's the idea I'd
like to take advantage of this by having
a focal pro which takes the Tierra
project and the idea is to get that key
out of the object but return the maybe
maybe object key
so that's undefined I will get on I may
be mad that I send a fight which means
the callback would never get caught but
if not everything's fine things should
work so I take my things function
slightly set up a nice of - I eat on pro
- pennies pray is he right
pennies
I run much and since really - it's been
friends with Pinkie Pie previously but
now we're going through the maybe so if
I try to get twine excited nothing
happens so that's very much for the
better than doing the wrong thing and we
could extend this quite easily with a
natural error message which might be
useful
I don't know summarize we got this basic
interface in judgment now this is what
promise looks like this is sorry this is
tiny
this is typescript mutation then is the
method when an amazing object it takes a
function this function takes an a which
is the value of that's gonna come out a
type in the body and that's gonna come
out of the promise and it turns the
promise of that Matthew and this
function also has a promise at that
value I've been doing things like
returning null but that's actually I how
did the unit method as well that's the
way I'm just guessing the ramming into
the promise that takes the value and it
returns returns a promise that's already
resolved out honey
so this is sort of our entire interface
for making promises and that's really a
night so we could chain the operations
using that we get the balance after
promise and if you keep going before you
change the promises using the then
method and then we can use
yield and generators and our little
trick with a run function to get rid of
the bench chain so you can write code
that looks synchronous and they were
back home site we can do this with
anything
it's not just promises as you just saw
with my little maybe you say can you
imagine the world without I mean you
don't know Dan sorry for you if you see
there's programs available pressures I'm
going to show you everything sir but
this is how it could look like this is
doing a pre-k synchronous iron it reads
completely an IP synchronous i/o you
write it that way you come back money
except for the young people so this is a
new program that would read teen poets
able to text field text concatenate them
and write back out of time for bracelet
text with the blue synchronous is
actually same thing going on you got
what you broke that and you redefine it
just made you inflate wouldn't be your
right to throw back out
it must be same thing but it is the pre
something high school it's all compacts
it's got this thing going where no so
affects our amount so if you have a
function the function if Ellen isn't
allowed to do things like a printer the
screen or right every time you call
function with a certain panty the value
that comes out has to be the same for
any input the output must be the same
every time you call that function which
is the next kind of thing so nervous
that's what pure hunting the program I'm
I'm gonna have to ask though is
completely pure you notion I have to be
honest until I am which might seem
socially used to it but the thing is it
can still do
in fact no side effect it must be a see
you can anything tonight
the enemy conceptually ideal new program
here we said amana if that means please
go and do this IRA
and then called me back on this corner
country which is exactly what the
meetings might know Jay has high school
25 yes ago before they actually solve
this problem half the loot like this
well this is JavaScript this is Nate
this is actually put back home it's the
same program except it's disgusting and
messy and hostile was actually even
worse I would be in when explaining see
what they were actually doing but
everything with Nazism this so they had
to come up with a solution and they had
to enforce business so eventually one
man solve this problem this man has been
at what that he sleep at least he found
this amazing solution for how to to
manage this social program in has the
very thing is - that favors the very
famous for being understand those famous
for being like a burrito which is a
famous Munna tutorial that we got a fear
that like burritos
so that they're quite legendary for
being able to actually understand so I
won't actually try and make you
understand that and I did this is what a
minute looks like in Haskell take a
minute it is something for which is
their type and you can implement a
function return' that looks like this a
function from type A to M of a and a
function binding this is how has some
people swear by it greater than greater
than equals make it makes perfect sense
if you know Haskell we're nice to
pretend and that's a minute away and
that takes a functioning
aids banana be that returns minute a P
and if each one state visit to norman
language and
this is the main advertisement mutation
I have to change BM the names of the
methods because return is a reserved
word in JavaScript and greater than
greater than weakness it's actually not
something you can email or function
I couldn't even units and then literally
a promise that's not it
because the init method any of the
venomous head tickle that you got a
minute
you've seen the eye amendment from
Haskell there's promises in JavaScript
the main amendment or my acute
implementation of it is the thing
impossible to and easiest for dealing
with that's a little thing this is where
that convention in Haskell the to block
and sort of waste before the mimetic
operations to finish this is known a
convention in JavaScript that's the
wrong function that's a generator
function may be promoted ace for using
on them but we're not gonna bring
continuation
but let's look into that so I'm not
gonna do an editorial because you don't
need one at this point you already know
perfectly what when that's up their
promises and you get a confession out of
the air out of the generator functions
so fortunately there has been people in
the audience or they will be going well
well actually there's a bit more to
being a moan that unless you have to put
them between were animals left identity
arrest identity associativity premises
do that I shot one of them if you're
interested in these are the laws
expressive JavaScript best triple equals
in in cool math Unicode stuff so free
remembers have to be that is not one of
them usually that's it so if you like my
writing function one again play with it
big is the run function it's a bit
simplistic there's this very own so
guess what right now it's just the same
thing it's everything better check it
out
for completeness if you like this but
you think you maybe make the Haskell
syntax better but you know mine actually
go all in and do Haskell you want to
stay like do javascript in the browser
and stuff there's a plan of judgment
which called pure script there's this
bad program from previously written in
JavaScript this compliance to nice tiny
JavaScript and it's pretty much like
husband you got all the funny bits the
my enhancement me applications and the
font is the very fun is saying that is
the movie
very cool anyway push it might be worth
looking into
you might want to stay I'm dry now and
with a cone over instead at one that's
it so sorry an apology for teaching in
with mass without you realizing it oh
yeah actually if you go alone back
around you would find my spikes the
additive works you can play with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
