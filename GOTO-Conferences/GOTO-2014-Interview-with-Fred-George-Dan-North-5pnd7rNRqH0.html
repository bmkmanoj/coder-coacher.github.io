to be here with Fred George and Dan
north to agile and software disruptors
and we're just going to have a chat to
them about even a lot of things he could
have said about us that was pretty kind
about so I'm going to just chat with
them a bit about you know what the way
that you know sort of the best teams are
building software today are the best
teams that they encounter and i think
that there's just sort of classified
there's those people who have the
complete degrees of freedom that maybe
Fred's able to work with and dad I know
has worked with them to in several
companies but there's also great teams
are working in it in a much more
constrained environment so so programmer
anarchy you're seeing do infected yet
another company with it Fred yeah
although of course anarchy is not
exactly the best interviews in front of
CEOs but it's calling extreme Porter and
back in the day it was not the best term
to sort of so agile um yeah so you know
we basically have decided that it put
the team together we make sure that
we've actually built in a lot of things
like the trust and any power of the
programmers and we're basically hiring
people that are very experienced and so
our charter basically to stay out of
their way let's just try to lose for the
real problems and let them innovate so
of you with your thoughts on this
program or MIT and a couple of things
one is I've seen this style of
development work with not just very
experienced developers but also with
shaylee graduates coming into that
environment and that really surprised me
and I realized that it was probably
because they haven't learned a bunch of
bad habits then needed to unload like
they just kind of they come in fresh
from college look at this mega well it's
not we go to college but this must be
how work works and then you know
spools in pretty out of kind of work you
know they go into the other environment
they're like what are you doing surely
this can't work the issue with the word
anarchy I really do and the reason I
Fred will probably agree with me the
reason is anarchy is an absence of rules
an absence of any of that stuff and an
assumption that it would just kind of
work itself out the there's a very
strong kind of tacit assumption and
tacit kind of deal if you like
commitment from anyone engaged in this
they they take they take this stuff
seriously they really do they have you
see and a lot of these teams in the
various companies that Fred's me I love
you all right affecting yeah the
companies that had been affecting and
there are other places that there are
very strong shared values very strong
shared beliefs about what good software
looks like what good product is line
looks like so and your phrase like
getting out of their way is exactly
right i think there needs to be a an
awful lot of alignment whether that's
tacit or explicit before you can get
that model to work when you do it's
incredible well i think there's two
traits we look for in this environment
and we always look for self learners
people that are you don't want to pick
us up at themselves and also a passion
for delivery and i think those are the
two keys that allow you to work because
it's the anarchy of sort of the first
definition that we talking about it's
one where the organization of the team
is dumping within the team not from
imposed without side with some super
knowledge because the knowledge that
exists any better outside of the tea
we're social animals unless you're
having a sociopath and then you
basically you do want to organize
yourself you do look for leadership that
look for recognition peer pressure is
very very strong for conformance you
kind of those forces work themselves out
I had the same experience as well we
acquired a company when when lemon comes
acquired another company with ordinary
programmers we kind of ripped out the
management structure ripped out some
other things and they were way more
productive yeah and happier and enjoying
their jobs better so I think there was
something in there just about trusting
trusting them even
ordinary programmer doesn't want to come
in what programmers shows up every day
says I one rice and bugs the fact that
happens is probably a failing of our
processes and our structure around now
so what happens in which you friend you
worked at IBM you know large corporation
many luck you have worked with many
large IBM customers you know big
institutions what that died saying this
is someone who will say well tonight
they gave us an idea well I was I was I
was in a bubble because I we we brought
in a protected entity and it was
protected for the time i was i was with
IBM but the my question is how you what
do you think the odds are bringing in
there cuz it you know because that's
something you could do into a corporate
environment you know there was it
something that's going to take a kind of
new gen kind of company well i think i
actually don't quite a people-to-people
in IBM still and a lot of these guys or
or do a lot of things we're talking
about as long as it's an internal
delivery or internal products they're
building this word processes run free I
think it's when you go to the external
customers and expectations are set for
project managers and many other in
southern roles and frankly you make more
consulting money the more people of
projects oh yeah i went to 16 different
roles to find i want to have you know
different levels i want to charge
accordingly and you kind of feed the
beast and keep it going so I think
that's kind of the flow of that you know
expect 70 expectations with the customer
in and following through with it so what
are the big barriers to adoption well a
lot of his trust you know that customer
asked to sort of say first of all I'm
going to trust that will make good
decisions on your behalf and the end if
anything is we've trained the customers
over over the years to you know tell us
what you wanted in excruciating detail
sign it in blood probably don't change
your mind and we promise to deliver we
train them do that over the years
they you just wait in the 70s that's not
where we worked we trained that way now
we have to untrain that we have to say
trust us you don't have to ask for every
feature upfront otherwise you'll get it
just tell us what you need today they're
not ready to respond that way well I
this all say it's on Aston to make to
help them with it where the one that's
changing the game you know where we're
the ones that are saying do you know
what if we deliver it in small
increments and have a lot of low touch
collaboration with you rather than these
big ceremonial things in every period of
time that we think we can deliver a
better product with less risk risk
adjusted our a return of capital all
that kind of stuff and they're looking
at us again you're the same guy that
just last year you know so so is
actually is on us to kind of help them
with that and we're kind of a minute but
then also organizational structure so
you project officers I mean basically a
lot of our process has been
institutionalized into the organization
the easiest guys to transition to this
or poor manners but means you work you
into the stuff into the rolls some of
these roles doing make sense anymore
we're talking people you know basically
having to reorganize your who's there
who's our responsibilities how do you
deal with the the the role of the
customer domain knowledge and sort of
things said with elegance it's probably
the only two interesting roles we have
is what is a visionary and then one and
it somebody who's going to make sure the
software stays clean at some level so
it's easy to change I think almost
everything else is interchangeable and
where the visionary is coming from a
software developer that did the previous
release or where there's a customer the
vision way to accomplish you still need
that visionary and doesn't have to come
with a title necessary just know who
this guy looked for is so I look for a
visionary if you haven't got one a lot
of times I'm true to the same thing we
have to play the visionary hmm you have
to be the consolidator of the vision we
have to happy you know so go out there
and sell it isn't thinking what to do I
think also a lot of those formerly
specialized roles certainly the way I
coach this is that the the way they
engage changes so we've traditionally we
look at specialists and we say do this
specialized thing that you do as a
business analyst analyze the business as
a tester test the software and and it's
shifting now to
as a business analyst you carry a
capability of analysis help us
understand what it means to understand
how this business works or as a tester
the last thing I want you doing is
testing I want you raising the
capability of testing and everyone in
the team a way to be a vector of testing
this around the place and things like
product owner this is one where
photo/jeff patent get really upset about
this because he's both product i am sure
if i go is that why on earth would you
have a product owner outside of a
software thing that's as crazy unless
the role of the product owner is to
coach the team to make good product
decisions like for me a successful
product owner isn't saying how we need
to do this in this mr. a successful
product owner is largely making
themselves redundant because the team
can make really good product decisions I
think it is that implies that the team
is really empowered I mean really has a
lot of domain knowledge which is on
women's again above the chain up or will
you are willing to willing to learn a
lot of the main know we were you bet I
mean the old site customer is all about
putting the domain knowledge into the
team and I think that's that's what
we've seen and that worked really well
when you bring the demand for peace and
I think it's more than just anything
anyway you have an expert where this
front-end expert database expert or
domain expert their job is to build
competence than the rest of the team not
expertise because that's a long haul up
at least build confidence and knowing
that here's the edge of my knowledge I
need to go find the expert and I think
more ability sort of Polly's co-workers
who are competent in these reversal
technologies they can take a problem and
solve it well I give me an example I was
working on a trading firm and the two
the first four people in two developers
that came in were ex Googlers no trading
back I one of them never seen trading
any trading environment any finance
environment his life they had been doing
things like paint apps on the iphone
right very very time to program is just
that's what they had been doing and so
the first thing that they did was SAT
with traders they SAT with trade as a
learn trading labs org
them often studied it and then you know
before the writing any software and one
of those guys is now leading the dev
team for a very successful trading desk
and he's a physical phenomenally deep
trading knowledge he decided that the
way to be effective in this environment
is I've got to go learn trading and and
that was a choice and but again it's the
it's the mutual support thing so within
the team there was the trust you as a
program or learn trading I as a trader
will spend the time to sit with you and
teach you this stuff that is that paid
off so much so many times oh and I think
a lot of this has been exacerbated by
our business need to go faster I mean we
talked about how fast we're going you
know 30 years ago and then 20 years ago
in 10 years ago I think the speed at
which we're running is driving us to try
to create these poly skilled workers the
specialist works fine in nine months
delivery cycles but it doesn't work in
two days of cycles yeah although
sometimes the specialist is needed I
love the expertise at fluid of the
expertise and you want to have those
guys around and call well thank you very
much Dan and Fred this is really good
and for those who thought XP was scary
and maybe you'll be thinking about a
complete programmer anarchy although i
think it's dan sussed it out there's
really a lot of trust and discipline the
nice piece of banana case i think i get
i guess it's perhaps that the anarchists
are all all have the same cause so you
get alignment there thanks very much
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
