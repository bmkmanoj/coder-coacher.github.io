great time in Chicago so when they asked
me to come back to Copenhagen I could
not turn down the opportunity and since
some of you may have been how many
people were here at the Chicago one by
show of hands oh okay so it's not a big
overlap but I did decide to do more of a
science focus because as everyone knows
we had a pretty major finding with
regards to Mars over the course of the
past two weeks so it'll be a better
focus but to start off with so my
background is in aerospace engineering
specifically in propulsion systems and
entry descent and landing systems and so
I think probably about in 2006 they
asked me if I wanted to work on the Mars
Science Laboratory mission because I had
an aerodynamics background and
specifically to lead the development of
the supersonic parachute which is a type
of aerodynamic decelerator which is used
supersonically on Mars and I couldn't
turn down an opportunity just because
everyone wants to send something to
another planet so that's how I ended up
getting involved in the mission and some
of the images that you can see on the
front page of this o is there a laser
pointer by a chancer it's okay if there
isn't I can kind of just go but so you
can see kind of the arc of the planet
Mars and one of those craters there is
actually Gale Crater where we landed the
Curiosity rover and then the picture
that you see of the rover is actually a
selfie that it took of itself on the
surface of Mars it has different cameras
and it's able to piece together those
images to be able to create a full-on
image of itself and then the sequence of
images you see up here is part of our
entry descent landing system and so I'll
show you a video which goes through that
but to start off where they think what
everyone is so fascinated about is how
do we actually land something on the
surface of another planet and so
reference Mars is about 200 million
kilometres from Earth on the average
difference that it can go all the way up
to around 400 million kilometers and so
the challenge from an engineering
perspective is to be able to take
something which is essentially the size
of a small car and a distance of 200
million kilometers and land it in the
area of something on the order of the
size of downtown Copenhagen so it's a
pretty big engineering challenge from
that perspective and so what I'll start
off with is in a video that went viral
back in 2012 just before the start of
our landing it's called seven minutes of
Terror and it details the in
during challenges associated with
landing something as large as the
Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars
and you can also find this on YouTube
for your viewing pleasure later when
people look at it it looks crazy
that's a very natural thing sometimes
when we look at it it looks crazy it is
the result of reasoned engineering
thought
but it still looks crazy the top of the
atmosphere down to the surface
it takes a set of minutes it takes 14
minutes or so for the signal from the
spacecraft to make it to earth that's
how far Mars is away from us so when we
first get word that we've touched the
top of the atmosphere
the vehicle has been alive we're dead on
the surface for at least seven minutes
entry descent landing also known as EDL
to refer to as a seven minutes of Terror
because we've got literally seven
minutes to get from the top of the
atmosphere to the surface of Mars going
from 13,000 miles an hour to zero and
perfect sequence perfect choreography
perfect timing and the computer has to
do it all by itself with no help from
the ground if any one thing doesn't work
just right it's game over we slam into
the atmosphere and develop so much
aerodynamic drag our heat shield it
heats up and it glows like the surface
of the Sun 1,600 degrees
during entry the vehicles not already
slowing down violently through the
atmosphere but also we are guiding it
like an airplane to be able to land in a
very narrow constraint this is one of
the biggest challenges that we're facing
and one that we have never attempted on
Mars Mars is actually really hard to
slow down because it has just enough
atmosphere that you have to deal with it
otherwise it will destroy your
spacecraft on the other hand it doesn't
have enough atmosphere to finish the job
we're still going about a thousand miles
an hour so at that point we use a
parachute the parachute is the largest
and strongest supersonic parachute that
we've ever built
today it has to be able to withstand
65,000 pounds of force even though the
parachute itself only weighs about 100
pounds
when it opens up that fast it's a neck
snapping nine genes at that point we
have to get that heat shield off it's
like a big lens cap blocking our view of
the ground to the radar the radar has to
take just the right altitude and
velocity measurements at just the right
time or the rest of the landing sequence
won't work this big huge parachute that
we've got they'll only slow us down to
about 200 miles an hour and that's not
slow enough to land so we have no choice
but you got to cut it off and come down
in Rockets once we turn those rocket
motors on we don't do something weird
you're gonna smack right back into the
parachute so the first thing we do is
make this really radical never fly off
to the side diverting away from the
parachute killing our horizontal
velocity and our vertical velocity
getting you over moving straight up and
down so it can look at the surface with
its radar and see where we're going to
land and we head straight down to the
bottom of a crater right beside a six
kilometer high now
we can't get those rocket into the to
close to the green because if we were to
descend propulsively there are engines
all the way to the ground can
essentially create this nice dust cloud
that dust cloud could then go and land
on the road they could damage mechanisms
and academic instruments so the way we
solve that problem is by using the sky
cream over 20 metres above the surface
we have to lower the rover below us on a
tether that's 21 feet long and then
gently deposit on its wheels on the
surface
as the rover touches down and is now on
the ground to the same state it's in a
collision course with a roller human cat
the bridle immediately confided the same
stage to a safe distance from the road
so everyone knows we were successful and
so the rover has been driving around the
surface of the planet for the past three
years since now I want to take you back
to the motivation for why it is that we
explore Mars and so there's two reasons
one is a scientific exploration reason
which is the reason why we do everything
we do at NASA and ISA and all the
different space agencies and the other
one is the possibility of human beings
one day living there in terms of another
location to live or in terms of
different commercial venues and if you
go even further back it's to understand
the planetary science basis and so
there's something called the terrestrial
planets the terrestrial planets are
Venus Earth and Mars and at the
formation of the solar system planetary
scientists believe that the planets were
very similar to each other
in terms of them having a thick
atmosphere and water flowing on the
surface but as you can see in this image
here the image on the left of course is
Earth which has a very thick atmosphere
with plenty of oxygen and water that
covers you know 75% of the planet and
the image on the right is Mars which is
essentially a dry dusty planet with a
very very thin atmosphere no appreciable
water on the surface and so what we're
trying to understand from a planetary
science perspective is what happened why
is it that these planets are so
different from each other now and on the
contrary to that is Venus and Venus
actually has an atmosphere which is 100
times the surface pressure of Earth and
is about four hundred and seventy
degrees centigrade on the surface so
basically the temperature of the inside
of your oven or a self-cleaning
temperature of an oven and so we don't
understand why those things happened but
then the other reason of course is could
we one day live on Mars so how many
people think the day on Mars is shorter
than the day on earth just by a show of
hands longer so it's actually a little
bit longer so it's about twenty four
point six hours so that means that the
engineers at JPL who operate the rover
are working on Mars time so every day
they shift by about 40 minutes so
sometimes they're working in the middle
of the night sometimes they're working
in the early morning but from an human
physiology perspective it's not that
different from the month of day on earth
which means that you know your circadian
rhythms wouldn't be that disrupted by it
and so the gravity of Mars of course is
less because of the size of the planet
is smaller and so the gravity is about
1/3
what it is on earth but compared to the
International Space Station where you're
essentially in a zero gravity
environment or microgravity environment
the gravity on Mars is one-third which
means that your body won't suffer as
deleterious effects as you do in a
microgravity environment and then of
course it's not full 1g so it's actually
easier to do things like construction on
the surface of the planet now who thinks
the temperature range on Mars is hotter
than Earth fire shows our hands colder
it is colder but surprisingly it's not
too terrible so the temperature of space
for examples around four degrees Kelvin
which is you know impossible for anyone
to deal with except for bacterial spores
I believe are the only things that can
survive in that time to temperature but
the temperature on Mars goes from a very
cold minus ninety degrees C in the
winter times in the polar regions but it
gets up to around five degrees C which
is warmer than it is here in Copenhagen
in the wintertime so what that means is
that even though you'll have to deal
with the fact that there's a lower
pressure environment from a thermal
sense if you were living inside of a
greenhouse for example like that they
have this really amazing thing out on
the riverbank where they have this green
structure you should go check it out if
you haven't seen again you can see how
it's about 20 degrees hotter in there so
you can imagine how these sorts of
environmental conditions are difficult
but they're not impossible for us to
deal with especially within our existing
technology range now the real problem of
course of Mars is that the surface
pressure is so much lower it's only it
got about one percent of the surface
pressure it does on earth which means
that as human beings we need to have you
know about a hundred times that so we'd
have to be living in pressure suits and
of course we don't have air on Mars
which is it primarily you know nitrogen
oxygen mixture it's primarily co2 which
means that we would have to have
pressure suits and we would have to have
an air supply to be able to live on the
surface and everyone knows about the
movie the Martian which just came out I
think this week and you'll get a little
bit more of the challenges associated
with living on Mars by watch reading
that book or watching that particular
movie but what this means is that we
could actually one day live on Mars with
the appropriate technologies and it's
actually not as challenging as it is to
live in the environment of actual space
like the international space station but
if we move again back to the planetary
science exploration is Mars had a
fascinating geological history and so
what you see by these pictures here is
the one on the upper right is a place
called Olympic Mons and what this is is
the solar system's largest mountain
and it's an extinct volcano which means
that this volcano is about three times
the height of Mount Everest so at some
point in Mars's past it had massive
geologic activity what we don't
understand is why it has essentially
stopped or why it's appeared to have
stopped and then similarly the picture
down the bottom here is Valles Marineris
and I like to call this Mars version of
the Grand Canyon and this particular
feature is about six times as deep as
the Grand Canyon and so everyone knows
what formed the Grand Canyon on earth
right water flowing on the surface and
so we believe the same thing happened at
some time in Mars's past there was a lot
of water flowing on the surface but
where is it now
where did it go is it all frozen in the
subsurface did it all escape through the
atmosphere is it still there that we
could actually make use of it for a
future human colonization mission for
example so by a show of hands who thinks
Mars has moons you're right it's got two
moons Phobos and Deimos and so these
look very odd because there are small
moons which means they haven't yet sort
of collapsed under their own
gravitational mass to form a sphere so
they kind of still look like potato
shaped objects and they're essentially
captured asteroid or bodies captured by
the gravitational well of Mars but one
of the architectures which we have
considered is actually using these moons
both as a mining colony that collect you
know minerals or even potentially in
Lion water for some future human surface
mission but also as a communications
outpost so just like we have GPS
satellites around Earth which makes it
very easy for us to navigate and to be
able to communicate if you have
communications outpost on these moons
for example that would help anyone
living on the surface to be able to
communicate via those moons back to the
earth so who thinks we found water on
Mars you should all know the answer to
this this was a more open-ended question
about three months ago but yes we have
and so just to go a little bit further
back in history we do know that large
bodies of waters did flow on the surface
of Mars a long time ago
it appears to have disappeared and one
of the reasons why we have these
missions to the surface of Mars is to
understand why did it disappear and one
of the nether interesting missions which
is out there which I think only arrived
around last year around this time which
is the maven mission
it's an or anima mission specifically
looking to see what happened to the
water content in the atmosphere of Mars
when was it stripped away
how was stripped away we don't have the
findings yet from that but it's
certainly under way
we know that the polar icecaps have
water ice and you can see this image
which is taken from the polar regions
and then back in 2005 our Phoenix lander
which was not a rover it was lander when
it came down and landed and its engines
were firing towards the ground taking
away all the dust and soil it actually
exposed frozen ice just beneath the
surface and closer to the polar regions
so we know there's a lot of frozen co2
saltwater on sort of just below the
subsurface but now here's the question
which everyone should also know the
answer do we believe that there's water
flowing on Mars today by a show of hands
if you've been paying attention the news
yes in fact there is so we have a
spacecraft called the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter which has been up
I think since 2006 and it takes amazing
high-resolution images of the surface on
the order of a couple of meters
resolution and so we're constantly
taking images of the surface sort of
mapping out the topography of the planet
and so back in I think between 2010 and
2012 by taking a look at these images we
were able to see these features which
appear to be streaks coming across the
sides of cliff faces during certain
times of the year
these were images which were documented
but the composition of the material were
just streaking out was not confirmed it
was hypothesized that it was water and
then very recently in early last week
they were able to tune one of the
spectrometers onboard the spacecraft to
indeed confirm that the composition of
this material coming out at the cliff
faces is indeed water and so this is a
very important finding because it means
that there's water frozen just beneath
the surface and because Mars is tilted
on its axis as it transits around the
Sun in its heliocentric orbit it heats
up and it cools down
so those subsurface aquifers basically
melt and then that stuff seeps out of
the sides of cliff faces so if we were
to send a future human colony for
example we would probably want to send
ourselves to one of the sides of these
craters so we could extract water and
use that to actually you know live bathe
and then potentially even hydrolyze to
get oxygen for a breathing source so
this is a very important finding both
because it means that there is still
water on the planet and because it has
major implications to future human
mission to Mars or future colonies on
Mars so
it's really exciting times actually for
the Mars program and so people you can
feel free to ask me as many questions as
you want to later on but what this means
is that going to Mars for people is more
of a reality and having a long-term
presence on the surface is more of a
reality which is very exciting for I
think you know all of humanity so these
missions are not done for the United
States for example they're done for the
sake of planetary exploration which I
believe supports all of mankind's goals
and interests but you can find all of
these amazing images on the surface and
this particular feature which has been
documented in the findings of late it's
called a recurring slope lineae and it's
basically just the size of a cliff face
and then we seasonally watch it as these
streaks come out only when the planet
heats up on that particular portion of
the hemisphere of the planet so how many
times who thinks we've landed on the
surface of Mars five times or less by a
show of hands more than five times yes
we've landed on the surface of the
planet a total of seven times now I
shouldn't take too much credit here but
it was all done successfully by the
United States space program it is very
very difficult to land on Mars from an
engineering perspective and also from
knowledge base of what the atmospheric
properties are gonna be and so there
have been some failures on the surface
and the most recent one which was in it
has it did anyone actually listen more
I'd say over the course of the past year
the Beagle lander was actually located
so if you follow that or not so they
lost it because they didn't have
telecommunications access with it when
it was coming through the atmosphere so
they never knew what happened to it but
then we have these amazing
high-resolution surface images and so
somebody finally spotted it they saw the
parachute they saw the heat shield and
so indeed that entry system actually did
work but the rover never communicated
unfortunately that's the reason why the
mission was lost but we've landed
successfully a total of seven times
amazingly the first entry descent
landing mission to Mars was in the 1970s
the Viking Lander when we knew nothing
about that
system and the computers were the size
of a house you know relative to what we
have now so in terms of the
computational capabilities that first
mission was nothing compared to what
they are today
you know orders have met orders of
magnitude below the Mars program sort of
fell off the table for I'd say about two
two decades and then it was resurrected
in the mid 1990s with the Pathfinder
Rover where we sent something the size
of a that big like twice the size
toaster to the surface of Mars in the
early 2000s we sent the spirit and
Opportunity Rovers which was about the
size of a lawnmower to the surface of
Mars then we sent the Phoenix lander
which I showed you the picture of the
Brian water beneath and then Curiosity
rover which was the size of a small car
and the reason why we make the Rovers
bigger and bigger is for the reason why
you have a bigger truck because you can
carry more to stop on the back so you
want to be able to carry more of a
scientific payload so you can get more
interesting science information and the
most recent mission actually is coming
up very soon it's launching this year
it's called the insight mission it looks
just like the Phoenix lander and it's
going to make measurements of
seismological activity on the surface so
are there still Mars quakes basically
and that will tell us more about the
internal structure of the planet and
whether or not if it's still
geologically active and that's also
important because of another finding
that I'll tell you that towards the end
of the presentation but this shows you
sort of the the evolution of our Rover
technologies over the course of the past
20 years or so starting with a little
baby Pathfinder Rover going up to the
Mars exploration Rovers spirit an
opportunity and there are much larger
Curiosity rover and the technology has
improved over the course of these three
generations of Rovers from a
computational sense from a material
sense and then from a power system sense
so these two Rovers for example used
solar cells or solar arrays to power
themselves or as the Curiosity rover
uses an RTG which is a radioisotope
thermoelectric generator so it makes it
less sensitive to the diner circles
cycles of the planet because it's able
to generate its own power by radioactive
decay of plutonium 238 and so but the
primary reason why we go with these
larger Rovers is that we can carry more
scientific payload and because the
wheelbase is much more sophisticated we
can actually traverse much more
difficult and interesting terrain which
gets us more interesting scientific data
and so from an engineering perspective
when you design one of these entry
descent landing systems it's your job to
safely land that payload on the surface
of the planet right because if you smack
it into the ground it won't be able to
do its job as a robotic geologist and so
for our challenge for MSL was to take
something so heavy and so big and land
it in a location far more precise and
we've ever done before we basically
improved our landing precision by an
order of magnitude from the prior
mission
the mission which was curiosity and that
all came about as a result of the
engineering activity to develop that
Rover and that you care you can see the
evolution of the wheel technology so we
have the tiny little wheels for the
Sojourner over up to the much larger
aluminum structure wheels for the
Curiosity rover and in terms of how we
bring the rover down to the surface we
do it using a very simple concept which
is the concept of aerodynamic drag and
so aerodynamic drags everyone knows if
you're going down the motorway you put
your arm outside the window you feel the
buffeting force on your arm that's
aerodynamic drag
that's the interaction between the
geometry of your arm with the density
and the speed of the air that you're
passing through so as you enter the
Martian atmosphere even though it's very
thin we're coming through at a very
incredibly speed so if we surround
ourselves by a high drag producing body
we can actually generate a lot of drag
and slow ourselves down that way so it's
a way for us to slow ourselves down
essentially for free not having to carry
propellant for at least that phase of
the descent but during that time you're
basically experiencing friction with the
atmosphere so well you know when you rub
your hands together they get warm think
about that but thinking about so much
friction the temperature that you feel
the surface your hands is actually the
surface temperature of the Sun so the
other engineering challenge is being
able to keep the rover at essentially
room temperature inside of this cavity
were just outside of the cavity you're
experiencing a temperature the surface
of the Sun and so we mitigate that by
using something called a heat shield
technology and so that's what you see
here on the face of this vehicle which
essentially slaps away like the tip of a
match to absorb the energy to protect
the rover in the interior cavity and a
very most difficult part I would say of
the descent is that because the
atmosphere is really thin compared to
what it is on earth
you can use a parachute to slow yourself
down but eventually you reach a terminal
velocity and you're still going around
I'd say 350 kilometers per hour that's
not slow enough to land safely on the
surface at that point you can't go any
slower on a parachute so the only way
you slow yourself down further is to use
retropropulsion so that's the reason why
we use these main landing engines or
rockets the slowest down further and
there's a lot of controls challenge
associated with coming in maintaining
the correct attitude while slowing
yourself down and so that's the system
that you see here the rover is tucked
away underneath this propulsive
stage which has a series of basically
eight engines on them and the thrust
level is actually changed on with each
one of those engines to create a thrust
vector which allows you to orient
yourself to fly to a particular location
and all of that is done with closed loop
software control by the rover no human
being in the loop because of the time
delay between Earth and Mars so that's
where there's a major challenge which
couples controls software and the
hardware element to be able to get us
down safely to the surface and then of
course the most important part is our
precious payload which is our robotic
geologist which contains our science
payload so where do we want to land
those so this is something which we go
through many many years actually a
debate during the course of the mission
to say what is the most interesting
place to land on the surface of Mars yet
where can the engineers take us to so
that we can land safely on the surface
and so we have a sort of a hybrid
relationship between the science
community saying I want to go here I
want to go there versus the engineering
community saying well I can't send you
there because either it's too rocky it's
too steep or on the altitude is too high
and so there was a big debate in terms
of you know doing this trade space and
we selected a location called Gale
Crater that you can see here in the
topographical map what this is is a
crater and in the very center of it is a
mountain which we call Mount sharp and
so the engineering challenge was to make
sure that we had enough precision so
that we could land inside the Creator
not smack into the crater wall and not
smack into the mountain in the middle
and the reason why the scientists were
so interested in this location is
because they believed it to be the site
of an ancient lake bed on Mars and where
best to understand you know whether or
not there could have been life in the
past then looking at the the bottom of a
lake where you have sedimentary layers
that form as a result of water which was
flowing on the surface a long time ago
of course that was a hypothesis later to
be confirmed by the rover which we
indeed did but this is the location that
we selected because it was going to
contain the most scientifically
interesting historical record of the
planet in a location that we could
actually get to and so even though may
be hard to see here I actually have
indicated where some of the other Rovers
are on this graphic so right towards the
middle is where the NBR Landers and then
we came in over here which means that
they're so distant from each other that
there's no way one Rover
would ever be able to meet the other
Rover because there across the planet
essentially and these Rovers do not move
quickly so the purpose of the Mars
Science Laboratory mission specifically
though is to determine whether or not
Mars could have been habitable support
life and whether or not Mars still is
habitable you can support life and so
this is done by taking a look at the
geology of the surface the geochemistry
basically how do the rocks form due to
the environment
understand how water the role that water
plays in the formation of the geology
and also to understand what the surface
radiation environment is and so one of
the big challenges for space exploration
for organic people such as ourselves or
any kind of organism is radiation
because as we all know intense radiation
causes cancer it destroys your genetic
structure so if the surface radiation is
too high
then that would suggest that you know
organic life as we know it can't support
itself on the surface of the planet but
if the server radiation level isn't too
bad then that means that perhaps
organics can still survive there they
may be surviving beneath the surface and
then we could also survive there or not
die from cancer and so this was a very
unique measurement that we're making
with this mission I'll show you some
data that we've collected over the
course of the past three years so this
just gives you a better indication of
our landing sites so this is basically
Gale Crater and so our landing site is
something called a landing ellipse which
is our engineering prediction of the
uncertainty space that we may land in
and our precision has to be driven such
that we land inside of the circle
because just outside of the circle is
the Mount sharp and just outside of the
circle here or the crater walls so this
is where we have to be able to tune our
landing system from a precision spective
to land so that we don't get injured and
it's basically a 20 kilometer by 4
kilometre ellipse which is around the
size of a major metropolitan area and
then I updated here to show you an
example of what that looks like in terms
of the size of Copenhagen so this is
what we call the bull's-eye on Mars
these different circles which go from a
much larger ellipse to a much smaller
lips shows you the precision of the
landing system that we have developed
over the years the largest ellipse was
around 174 miles in its long axis that
was in 1976 the little tiny ellipse here
is the landing precision that we
accomplished for the Curiosity rover so
you can see we've had orders of
magnitude
improvement over the course of the past
30 years or so or I guess almost 40
years now and the reason for that is
technology it's computers in building on
our past experience and looping all
those things together and so this is
what enabled us to land in this very
interesting location all the prior
missions to Mars we basically the
scientists took the data at the place
that we could land them in this was the
first mission where the scientist said I
absolutely want to land here we designed
a system around that essentially so
that's what's so unique about it
so to give you a little bit more
background on how the entry system works
I will take you through this video so at
this point in the mission we're going at
hypersonic speeds experiencing that
friction with the atmosphere originate
drag going from around 20,000 kilometers
to around 1,500 kilometers per hour then
we deploy a very large supersonic
parachute which pretty much fills the
size of this room that takes us down to
around 350 kilometers per hour then
we've reached terminal velocity we
actually cut away from the parachute
because it's not doing anything for us
anymore and we descend the rest of the
way on retro rockets and so these take
us down from about 350 kilometers per
hour down to around 2 kilometers per
hour which is a very slow safe speed to
touchdown on the ground when we reached
about 21 meters above the surface which
is probably about you know twice the
height us room we started the sky crane
maneuver and this is where the rover was
lowered away from that descent stage on
a tether which was around 7 meters long
keeps on slowing down keeps on slowing
down and then the rover lands wheels
first onto the ground and the reason why
this is such a smart thing to do even
though it looks scary is because the
rover is itself the landing platform so
you don't waste any mass for a landing
platform it is the rover the descent
stage above carries enough propellant on
it so that it can actually detach and
fly off a Saif's difference and crash
away but then the rover is essentially
ready to do its job and so that was the
architecture that we selected and if you
have questions for me later I'll be
happy to answer questions like why
didn't you go with airbags how come you
didn't use thrusters all the way to the
ground it's an engineering trade space
decision the primary reason why it's so
beneficial is because the rover when you
design any mission for space you the
things you have nothing of or mass and
power so if you can minimize mass for
things you don't need for example a
landing platform and
have it be part of your Rover which in
this case is the wheels it lets you be
more mass efficient and then by being
more mass efficient you're actually more
power efficient and so this is the rover
and so some interesting features to
point out here are that it has several
cameras around it this is its primary
camera which is looking from high above
it has a robotic arm which allows it to
go out and touch things and then it has
an RTG a radioisotope thermoelectric
generator which generates a lot of heat
we convert that heat into electricity
and the electricity and powers all of
the systems onboard the rover but it's
so hot actually that we have to
dissipate the heat away from that RTG to
keep the rover from getting too hot
during the day there we go make it bits
per second I think on the way back but
the question was how does the rover
communicate back to earth and it has two
different telecommunications systems for
redundancy essentially so if we go back
here so the rover also has a series of
cameras the cameras are used to both
protect itself from injuring itself as
well as collecting science data and as
well as a navigation and so one of the
things that we're always concerned with
with the rover is that what if it is
about to drive off a cliff right that
would be terrible it has has cameras
Andres ticket every single side of the
rover and so those images are then
processed by software real-time to make
sure that it doesn't get itself into any
damage now there is something that
happened a few years ago with the spirit
rover so pretty everybody here knows
that there was Spirit and Opportunity
Spirit stopped working unfortunately
opportunity is still going about 12
years later and the reason my spirit
stopped working is because it actually
drove itself sort of not down an incline
but it got stuck in the soil in a still
in a slight descent and it didn't have
enough power to drive itself back out
because it's solar panels get covered
and dust over time because the Martian
environment is very dusty so we use
software basically it's not terrain
relative navigation but it's image
processing software onboard to protect
it from getting into any problems and so
this is how we do science on Mars I like
this picture it's not quite that extreme
but we do have a laser onboard and the
laser actually allows us to determine
the composition of the soil and the
rocks and I'll talk about that a little
bit more later but our primary
instrument on board on the care
ASSA tear over which is so important is
the Sam instrument and what it has
onboard is a tunable spectrometer and so
does anyone here know about spectroscopy
in the audience you okay great you do so
with speck every single elements in
every single molecule has sort of a
fingerprint called spectroscopic
signature and so if you can excite
molecules or excite elements and they
release light at a particular frequency
you can actually map it back to the type
of element or the type of molecule it is
we have a much more comprehensive
spectrometer than we've ever had before
which actually allows us to determine
whether or not there's organics present
because organics are much longer
molecules which means they have a much
more complicated spectroscopic signature
and so we collect samples using our
robotic arm we put it inside this
instrument it's basically like an
easy-bake oven where you heat up the
sample and then it turns into a gas and
then when it's really hot it gets
excited and releases these spectroscopic
signatures which we then determine with
our spectrometer to be what the
competition is one of the most
interesting ways that we actually are
able to determine what the properties of
the surface of Mars are is by actually
going out in making contact with the
surface of the planet we have a drill on
board we have a scoop on board we have
an arm and we have a microscope and then
we also have something called an apxs
instrument which is an x-ray type of
spectroscopy which tells you more once
again about the composition so we have a
very full suite of geology instruments
on board this payload which allow us to
determine what's going on so how long
does it take to get to Mars it takes
around seven to nine months so we worked
on this mission from about 2005 up into
2011 and then we launched it took about
seven to nine months to get there and
the one opportunity that we had that
we've never had before is we had a
camera located at the base of the rover
so when the heat shield was released as
you can see here we were actually able
to collect image data as the rover
descended all the way to the surface we
never had this opportunity to do this
before because either they wouldn't let
us or didn't have money to provide for
one of these cameras but what you see
here is the rover under the parachute
and it's walking back and forth because
the parachute actually has a sort of
oscillatory motion to it approaching the
surface of Gale Crater and so now we're
seeing basically the bird's-eye view
real
of what the rover experience towards the
surface and as you look down you see a
darkened region that's basically
evidence of past volcanic activity or
sort of like volcanic rocks or Magnus
rocks that or igneous rocks at that
point in time and you also see a lot of
pock marks on the surface those pock
marks on the surface are smaller impact
craters inside of the Gale Crater
geometry because the Martian atmosphere
is very thin a lot of material is able
to get in and actually impact the
surface you see more of those sort of
surface features now as we get closer
towards the surface you'll see the
rocking stop because at that point
actually right now we've now
disconnected from the parachute now
we're on the powered descent vehicle so
at this point we're doing this divert
maneuver or the Mars landing agents all
eight of them are firing so we're
slowing down we're getting closer to the
surface and eventually you start to see
some dust and that's because we're
getting so close to the surface that the
engines are firing into the ground
kicking up that dust and now we're
starting the sky crane maneuver you can
see the rover's wheel just fall into
view and all of a sudden things become
very dark because there isn't enough
light between the surface of the rover
or the surface of Mars to be able to see
and so this data we downloaded of course
the day after the mission but our
greatest fear was that even though we
made it to the surface those tethers
wouldn't cut which means that the rover
would be dragged across the surface of
the planet which would be awful that
didn't happen of course and this was the
very first image we saw was of the
shadow of the Curiosity rover and Mount
sharp in the distance and so that was
pretty exciting for us you could imagine
we were all jumping and screaming and
you've probably all seen the videos from
JPL when we got that image in because
that was the first image that was
commanded back to tell us but what I
really like to talk about in this image
is that if you take a look at the
environment that the rover finds itself
in if any of you have ever been to the
United States have been to the desert
for example like near the Grand Canyon
or near Las Vegas it looks eerily
similar to those locations so even
though this is another world so far away
from us there's a lot of similarities
between our home planet and the planet
Mars which is pretty exciting that's why
we call these things the terrestrial
planets and then what you can see out
here are striations which are basically
layers and layers that form on top of
these rocks and are actually cut away
during the windy erosive vibin on the
surface and so the other thing I want to
talk about from an entry system perspec
is that we made an engineering
prediction it's a little bit hard to see
but there's a red ellipse here so this
is what our computer simulations of what
our descent was gonna look like that we
would fall somewhere within this
elliptical circle in a reality we landed
right in this white box which means that
our engineering predictions were really
good and we essentially land at the spot
on and it was a good day on Mars and
then my very favorite picture of the
evening was we were able to take that
spacecraft it's called the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter which is
constantly taking wonderful pictures of
the surface in orient it so that it
would be aligned to take a photograph of
the rover as it was descending towards
the surface of Mars under the parachute
and snapped this image which was amazing
right because this is actually what it
looks like the parachute on Mars and
since my primary role in the mission
with the parachute when I saw that
almost we were drinking mini two beers
at four the morning we're all screaming
as it all came on our iPhones like yeah
of course we knew it worked at that
point but and we knew even better that
the parachute worked perfectly so before
we started the science mission we wanted
to make sure that everything was okay so
just like if you get a new car you're
gonna drive it around the block a few
times before you take it out on the
freeway so we drove it in circles drove
it back drove it forth and then the
other thing to notice is the tire tracks
you see here actually spell JPL and
Morse code so if one day in the future
there's some alien race that says oh
look JPL was here who's that but that
was our kind of way of saying you know
that this is our work this is what we
did and that's pretty cool now this is
another great science image the image on
the right is what a dried-up riverbed on
earth looks like and the image on the
left is the landing site location for
MSL on so I'm not a geologist but when a
geologist looks at these images they say
yes indeed the way these rocks are sort
of like connected to each other and the
way they're smooth Dover means that
water once did flow on the surface in
this region and so what we believe based
off of the science data that we've been
taking over the course of the past three
years or so is that the water was about
knee-deep in the gale crater region
where we landed so that's pretty
exciting if you think about it that a
long time in the past many many millions
of years ago there was a lake which was
around you know two feet or so deep that
the rover now finds itself in which is
now dried up of course another important
science finding is that we've determined
that a lot of the material in this
region are phyllosilicates and the white
is important is because phyllosilicates
from a chemistry perspective can only
form in the presence of water so that's
yet another clue what's proves that we
landed in a place where there was a lot
of water and then another important
finding is that the soil in this region
is alkaline and so everybody knows about
acids and bases and either an acidic
environment or a basic environment is
not friendly to life but a neutral soil
environment is very friendly to life
which helps to support the hypothesis
that Mars was once habitable so I'll
show you a few more images before I wrap
up and so this is shows you picture of
the the scooping of the soil so there
are lots of sandy regions of the surface
so the scoop can go in collect that data
and put it inside the rover into the
easy-bake oven and determine composition
and we do have lasers on Mars so of
course this picture had to be made which
is curiosity
killing the cat I'm a cat person so I
would never do this but for those of you
who aren't cat people you'll like this
but in reality what the laser does is
and you probably if you're if you're on
Twitter and you follow the things from
landing you heard pew pew pew with like
the hashtag that people used and what
that means is that as the laser fires a
distance of about say from here to there
it actually vaporizes the surface
material it vaporizes the rock and then
that spectroscopic signature comes back
and we're able to determine the
composition what that means though is
that if you are a Martian living on the
surface of Mars you don't want to get in
the way of the rover because it will zap
you but what this data does is it
immediately gives you a fingerprint of
what is in the material that you just
zapped and so here you can see basically
the different intensities of the
composition of different elements in the
region that the laser actually zapped
now we have a weather station on board
so the weather station measures the
winds posts the velocity in the
direction and it also measures the
temperature cycles in temperature cycles
and pressure cycles and as you can
imagine between day and night the
pressure cycle is going up and down up
and down the temperature's going up and
down and so this is where we're able to
tell you exactly what the the variations
are in temperature and how much you know
you would experience if you have to be
able to survive on the surface of the
planet now this is another very
important measurement which is the Mars
surface radiation environment
measurement and so what we do know is
that the surface radiation is high it's
higher than we would like to live in but
it's not so high that we couldn't design
shielding for example to be live safely
on the surface of the planet and then we
also can
is that the radiation level varies with
the temperature cycle or with the
pressure cycle which means that if you
can put yourself in a higher pressure
environment you'll also be able to
further attenuate the radiation and this
is important for us basically to design
a human system or a human habitat so
that we know how we can last and live
there a long time on the surface so
another recent finding which is
important is methane on Mars and so
methane is an organic compound methane
can either be produced by geological
activity such as you know gas leaking
from rocks of volcanic explosions or can
be produced by a biological activity and
so everyone knows about methane and cows
and what that is is that when you or
when you ingest food or plant matter you
end up your bacteria in your gut
actually break down that matter and part
of that process is the release of
methane
so when you see methane released it
could also be from an organic process
and the other interesting thing about
methane is methane only has a very short
residence time in the atmosphere which
means that if you detect it it was
produced relatively recently in terms of
the last couple of hundred years and so
we've made some measurements from orbit
of methane but they've been kind of
suspect because the resolution wasn't
that great so we've made a very very
high precision method of measurement
measuring a methane around point seven
parts per billion and it was made
locally and recently which means that
there was either geological activity
going on Mars or even potentially
biological activities that's a wonderful
confirmation for all of the people
interested in you know future and
habitability of the planet or current
have ability of the planet and so this
is some of the data that was collected
of late so I already showed you this
video which was the basic goal the
images pieced together and so people say
is there intelligent life on Mars well
of course there is because the Rovers
there we built the rover and we're
relatively intelligent and we're
constantly communicating with it and if
you read or watch the Martian you'll get
more of a kick out of this and then of
course would you want today LaVon want
to live on Mars and I think a lot of
people would answer yes to that question
it wouldn't be a walk in the park you'd
have to live in a pressurized
environment you'd have to wear a
pressure suits when you went out you'd
have to have radiation shielding but it
isn't that impossible and I would argue
that the astronauts that went on the
moon were in a more harsh radiation
environment cuz they work low close to
the Sun and there is no atmospheric
attenuation whatsoever so it is
something which is in the New York
future I would say and so really we
don't actually know what's over the next
horizon and to this mission you know was
essentially accomplishing a compilation
of over a thousand engineers and
scientists twelve different countries
participated in the developer this
mission from the science payload to the
engineering payload to the mccune
vacations assets and all of the images
are returned to earth and they're
readily available to the public via the
website and so this mission is done not
for the US Space Agency not for the
European Space Agency we do it for
everybody so everyone can partake in it
and when these data come back in terms
of images anybody can take those images
and make their own scientific findings
off of them so for example the most
recent one which was you know the
finding of water was actually done by a
student at Georgia Tech which is a
Georgia technological Institute in
Georgia in the United States and they
were the person who were credited with
this finding by using one of these
images which is collected from one of
the cameras onboard the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter and then having
that important fighting so this is
science and it's done for exploration
and it's kind of done for everybody and
so yeah if you're interested in it you
can find all the information yourself
and that about wraps it up and I think
there's no time for questions but maybe
you can find me this evening err in the
hallways thank you
there are about a hundred questions in
if I should distill them then the main
question is so that movie the Martian
how realistic is the science really so
when I was reading the first chapter I
got super annoyed because it's
preposterous to think that you would
lose that they would have liked a single
telecommunication system they would all
fail so that was the the whole premise
of the movie is flawed in that sense the
fact that they wouldn't have
telecommunications because the one thing
that we learnt over the course of the
past ten years that you have to have
telecommunication so that you can
constantly communicate back to earth so
if you get over that which I got over
about screaming oh this is ridiculous
actually a lot of it is very accurate so
I think maybe the the making of water
with the hydrazine I don't think that
would have gone so easily because
hydrogen destroys everything but he did
a pretty good job and I actually had
dinner with the guy like two weeks ago
and so we got to talk about a little
more detail but it's pretty good so I
think all of his calculations are
correct there's some preposterous things
about the setup to get there a lot of
the politics in terms of the different
space agencies I would say is correct
they gave so many shout outs to JPL
which we all love because that makes us
look good but I think it's a great I
would definitely read the book before
you see the movie or if you've seen the
movie read the book cause you'll get
more out of it obviously one short
question in the end how did you test the
landing did you drop it from a plane on
earth that's a very good question and
that's actually the trickiest part about
designing an entry descent landing
system for another planet is there is no
way you can actually demonstrate that
system end to end so what you do is you
break it up into pieces so you test the
parachutes so my part of it we tested
the parachute and wind tunnels small
wind tunnels at supersonic speed large
wind tunnels at the right load the
engines we test individually but the sky
crane system for example you can never
test you have to rely on the fact that
you're inertial measurement unit is
going to get the accelerations right you
have to rely on the fact they're going
to get the thrust level you need and
then use math and sort of a you know
guidance navigation control algorithm to
make it work so my biggest fear in the
mission was the sky crane that you
wouldn't have enough control authority
to be able to get you to where you
needed to be to be able to land on that
location because there is no way to test
it end to end because the gravity is
three times higher on earth and it is on
Mars the atmospheric properties are
totally different from a velocity from a
density from a composition perspective
do you have to actually understand the
physics behind what you're doing
map it out in a
particular environment and then do it
end-to-end simulation to piece all those
things together and you also use
something called engineering margin to
give yourselves wiggle room in the event
that your calculations weren't quite
right and we typically use depends on
the system but sometimes a factor of two
sometimes a factor of you know 0.5 it
kind of depends on the system but it can
give you if you want to know any of the
details about any of those different
subsystems you can ask me like during
dinner or something like that right so
there are so many more questions and
she'll be her departure tonight if you
are too much in over to scare to us
questions which I would understand you
can ask less than me to ask the
questions to her tonight just make sure
it's before we had too many beer so
let's thank and eat again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
