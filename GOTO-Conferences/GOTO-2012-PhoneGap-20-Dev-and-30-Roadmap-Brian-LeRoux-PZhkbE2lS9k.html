you kind of web phonegap to looks like
we release phonegap 2.1 on September
21st which was ahead of schedule and
it's kind of awesome because it doesn't
happen very often software development
I'm gonna talk about that phonegap 2.2
is going to be coming at the end of
October I'm running phonegap 2.0 only
because I have a slightly older macbook
air and I'm absolutely terrified to
update it to mountain lion right now
because I've been on the road for last
couple weeks but 2.1 and 2.2 are
actually identical it's just 2.1 has a
lot more bug fixes for mountain lion and
iOS 6 so this is the 2 point 0 download
can you guys see that okay like in the
back okay cool so it's just me I'll open
it in here it's just a directory there's
nothing really special about it and the
phonegap package has a bunch of junk in
it like all of our documentation so if
you were so inclined you can go to the
docs and if you're a Python guy you
could do like Python ash and simple HTTP
server and that'll start serving them on
48,000 and you get all of our
documentation whatever that's just kind
of useful so I'm not here to show you
our dock so we're to show you this stuff
so I'm gonna get out of the docks and
I'm going to jump into lib and if we
look inside a lib actually it's easier
if i look at it in here if i look inside
a lib you can see all the phonegap
platforms that we support now some of
these you probably don't care about like
most of them why don't we take a look
inside of a OS well actually let's get a
sense of this who here's an iphone
cheese who has an android phone all
right all the same people how many
blackberries do we have okay I'm
Canadian so
why any windows phone users do you guys
work for Microsoft no okay windows
phones actually rising up so I'm gonna
jump into iOS and we just created inside
of phonegap all this new command line
tool incapability and the reason we did
this and you don't have to use the
command line tools by the way there's
there's visual tools as well but we
found our developers we're all using
command line tools but they were all
doing in different ways and so they were
creating projects different ways they
were debugging projects different ways
they were logging in different ways and
this is the phonegap project you're not
supposed to do that so we wanted to have
all the different nomenclature for how
you interact with your project to be the
same in phonegap too so one of the
things you can do is create a project
and bin create is pretty simple so we
can go let's see create something on my
desktop i'm going to call it go to i
have to give it a package name so i'll
do I O'Brien app go to and I'm going to
give it a project name go to app and
believe it or not that just created an
app on my desktop so let's go take a
look at my desktop all of my devices by
the way I have the courage wolf as the
background because he's awesome so that
generated this Xcode project this this
is going to change a little bit from
platform to platform but the general
gist of a phonegap application is that
in the ww folder is where you put your
stuff and then we generate all the other
native bits and so let me kick that up
think it's time for adobe to buy me a
new macbook air there goes the long
running joke if you've heard me present
before you probably heard it but Xcode
is exactly like eclipse it just looks
like iTunes it's true so I've got this
on iOS 5.1 still because I need Maps
while I'm in Europe
he'll succeeded launches and you get
this little so we used to have this
horrible hello world it was like it's
bad font and stuff and so in phonegap to
we finally have this kind of nice
looking app that's really simple and
clean it's got a little Cordova robot so
let's go take a look at the source code
for him now I open an issue in our issue
tracker at Apache Cordova and I was like
we need a hello world app and it needs
to be really simple which was I guess
you know not specific enough about what
simple is so the mark-up for this
application is really quite simple you
probably program web code so there's
nothing really special going on here
it's got a h1 it says Apache Cordova we
include some JavaScript for the Cordova
bridge and then we have this app
initialized let's go ticularly that
because that's what's actually doing
something and this is pretty funny I
think this might be what happens when a
Java guy writes JavaScript so we have
this global called app and it calls a
method called initialize which in turn
calls a method called bind which in turn
adds an event listener to device ready
which in turn calls app dot report
device ready like what the which
that in turn changes a class name so
that you get that little pulsing action
on device ready that you can kind of see
it right now it's like pulsing ever so
slightly so you don't need to write that
much code but you can if you want to so
that was iOS and we're I to back out now
and jump into androidland bin create is
exactly the same so I can put this on my
desktop but I better not call it go to
because it's going to generate an
Android process called go to Aaron and
because it's Java its slope or and
that's fine so we'll jump over here i'm
going to kill x
code or else I'll regret leaving it
running I will kill you and here's our
Android project and actually this is
anyone doing android dev here all right
so it this will look familiar it's just
like a classic Android project we have
one slight difference between iOS and
Android and then our Android
implementation yeah we put our ww folder
inside of assets the reason we do that
is because we're lazy it's faster load
that's about it otherwise though it's
just a vanilla Android project and so
while i'm going to kick up the android
sdk manager and i'm going to start in a
VD which is android speak for Android
virtual device and start a 4.1 and i'm
going to go get a beer while that boots
no I'm just kidding although why my
computer side you go sleep there I don't
know so that's going to take couple
minutes so we'll get back to that one
because we don't want to now I can
actually start my presentation so I
always feel like I people if I'd save
that for the end people are just like
what's phonegap so I'd rather just start
and show you you know what phonegap is
but there's a lot more to it than that
so this is not me that's Dave Matthews
but for some reason it starts
circulating on the internet tagged Brian
LaRue it's not me he actually lives in
Vancouver too so go figure I've done
some stuff so that doesn't matter i work
for Adobe but don't hold that against me
so phonegap lets you build native
applications of HTML CSS and JavaScript
has anyone here built a phonegap
application on added holy that's
actually quite a few people at school ok
so the idea of phonegap is at
standards-based and its future friendly
so we're not building applications to
current standards we're actually
building phonegap applications to what
we hope will be future standards and
it's open source software so it's apache
license which is great and something we
realized in the last year is that it's a
really powerful
extensibility layer and so we didn't set
out to build this thing this way we
actually just kind of made a mistake and
now people like it so the extensibility
layer is how phonegap talks to the
native code side and other people are
using it and of course it's a huge
community software developers I think
our latest numbers that phone gasps been
downloaded like 1.3 million times so
that's quite a bit and we know that
there's millions of apps now but I can't
say what they are so phonegap is kind of
an ecosystem the first thing nine toby
is a company I work for when we created
phonegap we were acquired by Adobe just
about a year ago and at the time of the
acquisition we decided the best place
for the source code to live was not
adobe but at the apache software
foundation and so we donated the source
code phonegap back to apache under the
name of patchy Cordova Cordova is the
street that night o be used to be are in
Vancouver so adobe phonegap is a
distribution of Apache Cordova the way
to think about this is Linux to red hat
or chromium to Chrome or WebKit to
Safari same idea also interestingly and
I didn't know this up until recently but
Apache distributes source and the
Eclipse Foundation tends to distribute
binaries for whatever reason so it sort
of works out because we're done patchy
project and we're shipping the source of
phonegap or Cordova Adobe phonegap is
like the binaries so I'm gonna talk
about Cordova first one thing you notice
that we've got this fancy URL Cordova do
all the information about the projects
there this little robot dude is kind of
our mascot I guess that's Cordova
jaychris lets it go man so it's a mobile
operating system compatibility and
extensibility layer that's a really
complicated way of putting that we have
plugins so there's all these different
platforms that we're targeting right now
and we're trying to give a common
surface area or come painted over the
same way so you don't have to run all
these different operating systems all
these different SDKs and all these
different emulators
which this one's to remind me that I
booted the android emulator at the
beginning of this talk you serious if it
didn't hasn't loaded okay that's
the face of the mobile developer okay so
not only are we dealing with emulators
so there's all these different devices
and it's not just about phones anymore
and we started maybe the name phonegap
wasn't right maybe it was like supposed
to be device gap or something because
there's tablets now there's cars that
are running Android there's even desktop
machines that are running Android and
other other things or the windows
surface windows 8 surface is now a
tablet computer thing who knows and
another angle all this too so a lot of
people are talking about responsive web
design and one thing eyes any one try
this out yet is anyone using media
queries in the audience at all so this
is pretty cool stuff allows you to like
you know adapt your content for layout
but there's a really big problem with
responsive web design right now in order
for you to have a website react to
different screen and handset sizes it'll
you'll still have to download all of the
CSS for all the possible combinations so
you think about this if you have a small
handset on an edge network you're still
going to download all the assets for the
larger form factor but actually there's
frameworks to fix that it's called south
street from filament group just like
point that out because everyone right
now seems to think that responsive web
designs the answer but it's really in
its infancy so another angle all this is
that we don't really know what the
developers are going to do if you ask
anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area
everybody is on iphone but the market
stats seem to indicate that everybody's
actually on Android unfortunately it's
not even a good android it's android 2.3
which is probably the new ie6 so all we
do know is that there's going to be all
these different platforms and that
things are going to change we haven't
seen any consolidation yet another angle
to all this and I've been talking about
this a fair bit because it's an
interesting trend so has anyone heard of
ties in like one person okay to people
so Tizen is a collaboration between
Samsung and Intel
primarily and it's a linux kernel
sitting on top and sitting on top of it
is a WebKit which is probably familiar
to you if you remember webos from HP
which apparently is going to get open
source later this year well Zola has a
new project and it's called boot to
gecko it's also called Firefox OS I just
saw demos of it last week and it's
looking amazing and this is a linux
kernel with a web browser on top it so
for this time is gecko there's something
called web and os which is a European
Union initiative of some kind it's
underway it's happening there's also
Chrome OS and when you think about it
Windows 8 is also all about the web so I
don't know what this means necessarily
but it seems to me to indicate that this
web thing might work out so phone get
who cares because that's the future so
phonegap today supports iOS Android
Blackberry Windows Phone bata which
actually so is anyone here ever seen a
bottle phone nobody not about you have
okay well yeah so one person bada has
more apps and developers and
distribution than Windows Phone and
that's only because it has huge adoption
in Korea which is really interesting
nobody has webos anymore so that that's
today this is what we support right now
but by this time next year we're also
going to have all these platforms in
addition cute is actually been on a
development for a long time it's futures
a little bit sketchy we'll see but
Windows Phone 8 is shipping Windows 8 is
shipping windows 7 we have an
implementation Firefox OS we have a shim
and ties in we have a shim that's that's
already working which is kind of great
so you got this situation where there's
all this different stuff going on what
should you do our general opinion and
the phonegap team is that you should
just build a web app you probably
shouldn't bother with building even a
native application web solved operating
systems a long time ago it solved many
screen sizes a long time ago and it
solved SDK issues a long time ago the
only issues that remain right now is
that the web of sandbox
so and this is for a good reason it's
not a bad thing that we have a security
model for the web is probably why it's
worked as well as it has the web is a
terrible offline story if you I don't
know is anyone here seen Jake
Archibald's app cache is a douchebag
talk I recommended if you do haven't
it's funny as hell so the app cache is
supposed to be the solution to the web
for offline but essentially it just
doesn't work it's broken some people
think that it's a detriment the web
doesn't have an app store I actually
think app stores are kind of a weird
aberration I don't know they'll last
forever but this is personal opinion I
find Google to be much better for
discoverability the real issue for me is
that the web can access device api's and
that the tools just generally suck right
now although the demo in the beginning I
think you kind of saw that hey actually
let's see our android emulator boot oh
it did sweet okay so now we can build an
Android app so assets ww this w is like
an old version of our app so I'm just
going to delete all that crap i'm not
going to delete this cordova a je s file
the JavaScript on our platforms is still
a little bit different from platform to
platform there's a really good reason
for that I'm going to show it to you in
a second okay so we had our iOS app in
the go to folder and it's in ww so I'm
going to select everything on this over
architected app and jump it into assets
ww our android application back on the
command line in my oh no okay in my app
we have this command line tool available
for iOS android all these platforms to
so i've been cordova debug and cordova
log
so this is going to barf a ton of output
to my terminal because it's Java know
what happened it didn't like something
apparently that package is bad don't
mind me wave my hands around so I see if
this works no oh that's stupid of me
okay so let's regenerate that
application long gap Android oops live
Android thanks man so big create
requires a path will say desktop go to
better android I or I go two and six few
seconds sweet get out of my face android
sdk it's kind of a screen real estate
issue here isn't there ok so i'm going
to take all the assets of this other one
that i generated that failed like just
everything because it was only the java
bits that i actually wrote a tissue
there and I'm going to delete you and
paste you and I'm going to also delete
this folder and pretend that never
happened ok oops
the better android yeah Cordova debug
and if that is successful Cordova blog
barf a bunch of output to my terminal
yay so that worked yes there we go sadly
this is actually faster building to
device which kind of doesn't make any
sense you can get Intel there we go go
to Android really
yay same source whatever it's a web
browser it's not really that surprising
is it okay if you're doing actual
Android development by the way you don't
ever use the emulator no one does so
phone gaps hybrid development you kind
of get the strengths of both the web and
the native code and you also get the
same weaknesses though where the first
project to do this device api's thing so
if you check out our api's are all based
on what we call device api's and when i
joined adobe all of a sudden people
started asking me about what they
thought phonegap would be because they
thought now that adobe was involved it
would change or something so on i've
added this slide now to like kind of
like make make it very clear what
phonegap is not phonegap is not an IDE
we're not interested in building an ID I
was totally kidding when I said you can
use Dreamweaver but you can if you want
to we don't we don't dictate tool in
choice we're not language we're not
going to build a higher-level language
that adds optional static typing and
compiles to JavaScript because other
people are doing that we're not
proprietary we're Apache licensed and
we're not a runtime it's free
open-source software and we want people
to build what they want to build with it
we don't hide anything from you and we
don't try and abstract away the
underlying platform to lean we think
that's a mistake if you're going to
build an iOS app you still need to get
into X coats internals if you're going
to build an Android app you still need
to have access to androids too late so
phonegap powered by Apache Cordova this
is that sort of bit i was saying earlier
where you have to think of us as a
distribution of an open source project
we're actually not the only ones
distributing phonegap there's a whole
bunch of different or patchy cord over
there's a whole bunch of projects out
there doing this today encap mobi would
be the most notable one but other people
are embedding phonegap in there in their
SDKs s ap's doing it intel's doing it
ibm's doing it Oracle's doing it so
phonegap is just a distribution and sort
of on that note there's a whole bunch of
corporate support for phonegap now ever
since we joined the apache software
foundation all these different organisms
patient's have jumped on board to
support the project which is great
adobe's obviously got the most engineers
IBM has the second most engineers I
think they've dobie we've got roughly 12
full-time people a total of twenty-three
people on the project iBM has six
full-time people Microsoft test three
rim has six nokia has two guys that kind
of fade in and out and Google's got
three full-time engineers on phonegap
today and they're working on both iOS
and Android which may interest you and
it's funny because Google joined and
we're like why what do you guys do it
can you fix android for us please they
start working on iOS that's weird so web
standards are really important there's
been kind of a lot of questioning about
whether or not the status process works
I think the kind of rapid adoption of
html5 is shown that this thing can work
it's not always pretty and the process
is possibly could be improved quite a
bit so anyways we participate but we
participate as implementers we're not
really interested in the debate of
editorship but we are interested in
seeing the web move forward as a
platform so we track a few different
groups a device API working group is the
primary one that we've been looking at
we implement most of the device API that
they have standardized so my computer
right now is convinced that it's running
in a mobile device so I'm getting this
mobile layout for our docs but if you
look these are the kind of like things
that I'm talking about for device api's
and I'll go through those in a little
more detail a bit we're also looking at
like what's going on in kind of the
other groups of the w3c the widget group
may be reformed in something called the
packaging group and there's another
group called sis apps which we're
tracking systems has just been chartered
so with with the device API is we
basically learn off when we create all
these different awesome api's for things
like your camera or your contacts your
file system and they left the security
side of the story up to the implementers
and that's probably a bad idea and now
that we have all these different mobile
operating systems and operating systems
in general that are based on the web
it's becoming very apparent that we're
going to your runtime security model
where
we declare what permissions are needed
for an application when we're building
it so the the classic example is when
you go to a Maps app it's like hey can I
use your geolocation and you say yes but
you can't necessarily go back and find
out what domains have access to your
geolocation revoke those rights later or
change those permissions and when we
start adding other api's like your
contacts in your camera things can get
pretty hairy your phone knows where you
are it knows what you look like and it
can email all your friends what's going
on so you don't want any of those things
happening I think we got like a
different kind of philosophy for an open
source project so we started as a brute
force implementation we didn't try and
do the right thing which would be a
compile to or something like that we
really believe in the web as the
ultimate platform that we want to build
against and we actually don't even want
to be doing this stuff you really don't
want to be writing java and objective-c
and we believe in open source so this is
where i'm going to show you guys a
little bit of how we work has anyone
heard the term foreign function
interface it's kind of precious it's
basically what we do it's an IPC call or
an inter process communication call we
like to call it the hack and the hack is
different on different platforms so this
is why phonegap exec or why the phone or
the cordova source code has to be
different on different platforms so i'm
gonna i'm going to jump into my working
development stream and i'm going to look
at our javascript is this the best tool
for this you can probably read this so
it every platform in phonegap can share
all the same in javascript but except
for how our bridge works and so i'll
show you what i mean in iOS all phonegap
platforms add this is this is a better
way to describe this so all phonegap
platforms have a method called exact and
exact takes a few arguments 0 as see if
i can find that method signature here
right here these are them so
it takes a success callback a fail call
back service which would be something
like calm phonegap geolocation and
action which would be something like
watch current position or get current
position and then a arguments like
enable high accuracy so in each
different platform we have a different
way of doing this in iOS we discovered a
long time ago that it was impossible to
communicate to native code unless you go
through a URL so we create an iframe 0
pixels by 0 pixels and we hide it and
then I you not and then Dan I'll
somewhere was it yeah oops yeah right
here and then we just use the this
source of the URL to communicate back
and forth between the native code and
the JavaScript code so now all of you
good comp sci students are thinking this
guy's nuts and you're trying to look for
a way out but I'll watch you if you
leave and then I'll find you later now
it's ok it's hockey we know this and in
fact Apple knows this too they have
better methods in the pipeline for us at
some point you'd think this would be
slow but it's actually not we have a
benchmark that we run regularly it gets
around four hundred operations a second
now four hundred operations the second
is not very fast if you're doing like a
3d game or something and you need to do
like I know crazy math across this
bridge but we're using it for device API
so you do not need your geolocation 400
times a second probably once a seconds
good so it's fast enough so that's the
iOS bridge and if you thought that was
weird let's take a look at Android so
does anybody this is not really the best
indentation for the code because this
long long long method but does anyone
see anything weird in here actually set
number
checkout line 24 we override the prompt
to communicate between the native code
and the JavaScript code on Android
unbelievably and it also works really
fast this is just what we have to do so
it's a crazy hack and yes we do use eval
liberally and don't believe Douglas
Crockford it's a useful method yeah so
that's how it works under the hood and
it's worked that way now for four years
and consistently across many platforms
out I'm painting over some of the uglier
details in Android we actually have
something like five bridges that work
different ways on different platforms so
different Android phones have different
bridges that can possibly be faster so
we use like a strategy pattern we pick
the best bridge but that prompt overload
is easily the most heinous so I want to
show that one to you guys and yeah this
number is now wrong it's faster so we've
got two goals with phonegap and this is
probably the most controversial bit of
the project a first part is that we want
the web to be a first-class platform so
that's great I think everyone here can
agree that this internet thing is going
to work out for all of us and we want
our kids to have the same internet that
we had and maybe even a better one if we
can and building to proprietary
platforms that lock you in in sell you
tools is not going to be the solution
not the future that we want so our
second idea is that we want to cease to
exist and so we're building phonegap as
a reference implementation for web
standards and this is why we're doing
this project in the first place we'd
rather be building web apps phone gaps
free so this sometimes confuses people
they're like all it's open source so
what's the catch there is none it's free
for you to use we just want people out
there using it it's based on device
api's which are based on standards so I
talked a little bit about this I'm going
to talk a little bit more so we've got
different types of device say P eyes
there's basically three buckets their
sensors data and outputs the sensors
like your camera accelerometer or
whatever data is your file system your
media your contacts and then your
outputs would be things like your screen
or the speakers on the phone we don't
give any access to that but we have
ginza do so we're big on the UNIX
philosophy so we advocate freedom of
choice for developers which means you
know we don't dictate what tooling use
and we also advocate small
single-purpose tools so you don't have
to use all of phonegap to use it you can
use just the Android part or just the
iOS part if you want we're not here to
lock you in and we don't choose we also
don't dictate tooling for GUI
development this one's been really
difficult for a lot of people to swallow
they want us to tell them how to build a
web app but any time that we come out
and say hey here's how you build a web
app we're basically self-deprecating the
this industry was really fast and we
there's no way that we could stay on top
of it and we're solving enough problems
as it some people like to use things
like sencha so people like to use jQuery
Mobile I recommend that people try
writing JavaScript and we don't dictate
IDEs either so we're not interested in
that when we built phonegap so we built
this exact bridge thing right and so
every platform has this thing with this
success callback this fail call back
service action and arguments and we use
that under the hood actually you get out
here just go to Android's is what I know
best so we use that under the hood to
dynamically invoke the API is that we
call and when we were building phonegap
we realize that we do this the same way
all over the place and unfortunately all
of the developers that were out there
starting to notice this too and so we
finally in phonegap 2 point 0 gave
people a what we're calling a a plug-in
interface or a plug-in API so right now
phone gaps really only concerned with
device api's because those are truly
cross-platform and those are things that
we can implement on the web but there's
a lot of functionality that are on these
native platforms that people want to get
access to that we might not necessarily
want to participate in so the first
obvious example is native gooeys so if I
look at just very quickly I'll show you
how a plug-in is written
I want to pick something simple
definitely not the contacts API as
accelerometer is pretty simple
geolocation would be the simplest maybe
that is so every I'll make this a bit
smaller like in Java so every phonegap
API follows the same thing where returns
a plug-in result which essentially
serializes down to JSON and it's not
very complicated at all so you can call
any native code you want in any platform
you want we don't lock you out of that
and recently a lot well not even just
recently we just figured this out
actually there's currently a hundred
community contributed phonegap plugins
for various platforms I might not be on
the web totally I am so if I jump into
like iOS these are all plugins and you
know some of them it does just doesn't
make sense like we wouldn't include say
in-app purchase manager but lots of
people would want to have the ability in
their phonegap application to access a
revenue model from in-app purchases so
they use that our plugins right now are
documented and but they're not we're
improving them so if you want to create
a plug-in you just go to our plug-in
development guide and if it was loading
actually I know why I was running that
locally that's rare I was running it
locally and it didn't work so in a
plugin development guide i'll teach you
how to write a plug-in for all these
different platforms and it's also a good
way to get ramped up contributing back
to phonegap yourself there isn't any
functionality that the mobile platform
can do that isn't available to you so I
just want that one to sort of shrink in
phonegap has issues there's the web
versus native debate you've probably
heard of it there's device browser
variants so this is also an issue and
web development hard
phonegap plugins just make the whole web
versus native debate completely moot you
can write web apps and you can still
access any native code problem solved
great browser parody however is a real
issue is talking some guys at the bar
last night of course mobile developers
are at the bar late and this is just an
actual fact there's not much we can do
for it android 2.3 is a crummy browser
android 4.0 is a slightly better browser
but it's actually slower because now
google is putting all their effort into
chromium iOS is browser keeps getting
faster but they're kind of letting their
webview languish it doesn't get nitro
for example so these browsers are
different they're all WebKit but they
are different so you're going to end up
having to write cross-browser code this
probably isn't news to a web developer
though you always had to do it and grab
a drink afterwards so there's a we have
a couple of hosted services we have this
thing called build phonegap com I'm not
here to pitch you I'm just telling you
exists build a phonegap com lets you
compile phonegap applications using our
servers so you don't have to install
these SDKs in your personal machine it's
open source or sorry it's free for open
source projects and it's free for one
private project so that's cool we have
support services so if you work for a
bank come talk to me as maybe not that
funny or everyone here works for a bank
and they're like okay our first priority
though are my first priority anyways is
to get people contributing phonegap is a
big brute force project and there's a
lot of work that we have to do so if
you're interested in writing mobile code
come talk to me about that we have a
different release philosophy than a lot
of open source project so we ship on the
classic major minor patch like to point
1.0 or whatever we generally agree on
one goal for every month and then we
ship no matter what at the end of every
month and and we prioritize bugs first
and this is actually really good so an
iOS broke local storage in and five
point Android or iOS 5.1 we were able to
fix it and submit a patch within two or
three days Apple actually incorporated
that same thing and iOS 6 so
our cadence is super important we ship
and we we put shipping as the highest
priority above putting a feature in a
ship date and I know your marketing
department would hate you if you told
them this works but it does so we just
shipped 2.0 and we shipped it on the
date we said we would because we took
all the stuff that we had left over and
we put it into 2.1 its software it's
okay you can ship it a little bit later
plugins were a big story consistent on
donations around our CLI tool in which I
started download for you guys earlier we
added windows phone support which is
cool there's a few people here that'll
be happy to hear that I guess we added
this thing called cord overview which a
lot of people are starting to use now so
Cordova lets you embed phonegap inside
of a native app or larger native
application so this is good if you want
to either migrate away from phonegap or
if you want to have a whole bunch of
phonegap instances in one project
there's a whole bunch of links I'm going
to breeze through our roadmap because i
think i'm almost at a time and i want
you guys to build ask me questions so
big theme for 2013 is developer ganar x
and one of our developers was joking
that we want to be the herman miller
chair of mobile development which i
thought was sweet so our CLI to lean
right now I was you saw at the very
beginning of this presentation was
trying to install the latest build of it
we hope to ship this for 2.2 I think
maybe 2.3 but the idea is you're going
to have this whole set of CLI tooling
for doing absolutely everything with
phonegap it you'll never have to look at
the native code if you don't want to
we're building winery which is this
remote debugger in and we've got this
ripple emulator thing from rim which I'm
going to talk a little bit more about in
a second so our plugin api is documented
but we haven't completely agreed yet on
what plugin packaging looks like and so
when you have a plug-in right now it's
kind of a copy paste job you got to copy
some native files and some different
spots and going to copy some javascript
in it's not super pretty once we have a
common package format will be able to do
automated installation when you think
about it if you have like a consistent
package format then you can do this copy
paste job really easily this is by the
way not just something that we're going
to do soon it's like under heavy active
development it's happening right now the
guys that work on nodejs are actually
nice enough to let us use NPM as our
prototyping surface so we're going to
have plug into
every the same way node has NPM package
installation which is cool so you'll be
able to do things like cordova plug and
install facebook and you'll get facebook
sign in in your web view phonegap
sometime this year we're now starting to
work with a CSS working group of all
people the dap and of course widgets and
sis apps i talked a little bit about
that so I explained that our our
releases work this is our schedule for
the coming year so we already shipped
2.1 on the 21st ironically 2.2 slated
for the end of October which is well
underway in November will be shipping
2.3 in December we're going to ship a
Unicode snowman and no one cares so
there's like generally agreed on themes
right this is an open source project so
like I can't say exact dates because
there's no way I can assign bugs two
guys at work at different companies
autumn was all about making 2 point 0
more solid some bugs were discovered
when mountain lion was released for
example that was funny it got it
released and some guy like posted to the
phonegap issue tracker that mountain
lion broke amateur hour and we're like a
mountain lion shipped an hour ago like
come on so we have Firefox OS prototype
Google's help me a speed up phonegap
Android you can check out their work is
crazy they're doing a whole bunch of
prototyping ripple is an emulator from
rim and you'll have to google it to
check it out but basically it puts a
phonegap environment in your browser
which is nice and we're going to start
making a part of the phonegap project
proper we have this thing called the
config.xml which is from the widget
packaging spec it's where you put a
bunch of manifest data so you say things
like what features you want to enabled
what your app title is that kind of junk
right now there hasn't been parity
across all the platforms and we're
finishing that there used to be a really
popular plugin called the child browser
plugin but then there was a bunch of
pedophile jokes so we renamed it to
in-app browser to stop that and we're
adding it to the phonegap platform which
is great it's going to have the
declarative and imperative api so you do
things like window open and they'll
spawn a browser window inside of your
phone gap application
the master script CLI tooling it's on
the way like I said working with node
the winter we think we'll have plugins
done so I'm probably going to regret
saying that Ripple's so this device
emulator that we have is pretty good so
let it lets you create a phonegap
environment instead of Chrome but
there's still problems with it and
namely you can't get any device api out
of your browser so you end up having to
fake them so if you take a picture we
just put a fake picture it we figure
since this thing is written in node why
not just put a socket in there and allow
al phone to connect to it so that we can
pipe device events from the phone into
the browser so sometime in the winter
we're going to have this capability we
actually have a prototype of this
already and it's pretty sweet when you
move your phone it'll send that they'll
pipe the event straight into your web
browser so then you don't have to like
goof around with testing just on your
device you can do all your development
on your computer using refresh and still
get all the same behavior that you'd get
on a phone we talked to Zynga about
html5 audio they told us it was
so we said all right well unfuck it and
we're going to do that we're still going
through all of our API so a lot of stuff
is changing because the standards are
changing and we have the goal of
graduating to a top-level project from
Apache by the winter we actually just
shipped our first official Apache
release so hopefully it'll be even
sooner maybe even this fall the spring
time we're going to continue migrating
our API is to the new stuff that's
coming out the standards we figure sis
apps group will be well underway by then
we're going to be adding a notification
center plug in to a core part of the
platform urban airship is probably going
to work with us on that and offer it as
a service if you want to use them but
you can set up your own server right now
we need native pickers for all of our
different things so if you want to
create your own contacts list in
phonegap you have to render all those
contacts in the dom and that's expensive
time consuming and slow so we're going
to have input type equals contacts and
that will invoke a native thicker for
that just makes sense we have all these
awesome contributors these are our goals
boom that's all I got for you guys
I don't know do we have time for
questions uh so how big of a problem is
browser fragmentation it's kind of ugly
like so if you're getting involved in
doing a basically iOS and Android it's
pretty seamless and Blackberry when you
throw Windows fallen into the mix things
get a little grosser so windows phone
doesn't have touch events bizarrely it
has one of the fastest canvas
implementations so windows phone is
really good at some things and just
really annoyingly bad at others we're
trying to polyfill that touch event
problem for the next release of phonegap
but yeah I mean it's browser based
development you're going to have
conditional code you're you're also
going to have situations where you're
going to want to do stuff like in
android you don't want to put the tab
bar on the bottom because they have the
virtual and/or physical hardware buttons
at the bottom so you always want to put
a tab bar at the top and android
sometimes people are like oh well then
your fork in your code and it's like
yeah I guess you have like slightly
different CSS for two platforms but it's
not that bad did that answer your
question yeah cool any other questions
I'll be here for the next few days if
you guys want to find me I'm
approachable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
