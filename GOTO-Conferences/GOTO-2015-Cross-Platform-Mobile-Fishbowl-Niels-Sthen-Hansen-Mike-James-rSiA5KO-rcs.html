fork and been doing a lot of app
development we seem to be doing that and
try fork and recently just this year in
Copenhagen we decided to alter tryout
xamarin so we've been building native
apps in mostly Android and iOS and we
decided why not try some samer and
everybody talks about it we should
probably see what can it do so I've been
part of two salmon projects this year
it's been an interesting experience so I
feel I know a lot more what the platform
can do and also what it cannot do so
just to summarize I think I think
xamarin when you doing cross-platform it
makes it easier to make apps it makes it
quite frankly harder to make great apps
sort of where I'm at what sku yeah so I
pull this impreza i also i'm not a fan
of microphones to sound much rather just
shouts our apologies whoever has to
master this latex I'm going to be quite
now so I'm gonna have to disagree with
you on that one so I think that xamarin
is everything an interesting one because
we've got xamarin forms and a lot of
people assume that xamarin forms is
xamarin and so what I tend to see going
out and meeting customers is they say
it's difficult to build great apps using
xamarin but it's what they really mean
is it's difficult to build great apps
using xamarin forms and you're not wrong
if you're going with the traditional
approach and you're using the storyboard
designer you would using Android XML
with our design tools there is no reason
why you can't build experience for your
user that is delightful as delightful as
an app built with Objective C or Java
it's down to possibly your UX team
rather than
rather than the toolset that you're
using you have a hundred sent access to
every API there that the native Native
developers have access to but I'd like
to to reply to that because we did not
use a marine forms okay the projects
were not appropriate for that because I
mean stammering form is great if you
want to make an ad that's not that
pretty you can do that really fast free
project is great for some things that
was not appropriate here and I'm not
saying you cannot build great apps what
I'm saying is it's not easier when
you're using xamarin and the reason and
the two reasons for that that we found
in our experience first of all we were
able to share some code but the COPE we
were able to share was the kind of code
that there wasn't so much problems in
risk line and so on where we spend a lot
of our time is actually building the UI
building specialized UI components and
really trying to get the most out of the
device and when you're really trying to
get use out of your device it's not
helpful to have something between you
and your device and samer in I mean I
think it's impressive what you're done
because I do think is a great piece of
engineering I'm not questioning your
abilities I just I'm just I'm just
challenging the underlying principles of
what you're doing so yeah I think if
you're building is you're going to build
an app that is highly customized in
terms of the UI then I mentioned early
before we tend to see about 75 to 80
percent code reuse but if your app is
purely UI and there is no rule anything
going on other than you I then at that
point there is very limited advantage of
using xamarin because you know you've
shifted to eighty percent custom UI you
know twenty percent background code and
it isn't that what great apps are about
is almost all you I I disagree so you've
got to deliver a fantastic you I but
what you mentioned is about using a lot
of restful services which tends to push
the processing up into the cloud now
when I'm so I mentioned earlier in it
talk that I'm building a beer tracking
app there's a very very popular app
called on tabs
which is for tracking how many beers you
drink and it can make suggestions and
it's built using called over now it
doesn't do offline now when i'm in a pub
and i want to be able to search for a
beer and add it to my beer library i
want to be able to still have the
results available to me you know what
are the top 100 beers for the UK or what
are the top 100 beers in denmark and
have it saved offline so when i go to
the pub and I search for it's there it's
available I can add it and when I'm next
on on the internet I've got connectivity
will sink it better back up but if you
create all of your apps with a beautiful
you I falling into a restful service yes
you've uploaded a lot of your processing
but actually your app isn't going to
work offline which mobile apps need to
well we actually did have offline
capabilities but offline capabilities is
still easier to code than actually
coding you I when it specialized so so I
think it's more that yeah it it is very
you I intensive and it tends to be
people who asked try for to build
something is usually because they want
something where we don't know what do
you want yeah so if they want a cruddy
add they'll probably do it themselves so
ready crotty looking like complete
rubbish and looking like xamarin forums
like app so so I think I think in our
experience it didn't really help us so
much that doesn't mean that there's no
case for salmon I think it obviously I
mean it lowers the barrier for who can
create apps in this space but I do think
that there is a number of apps that
where it doesn't really doesn't really
add F anything so maybe we can talk
about something other than some rain or
summer in bashing yeah so we have so I'm
also try fork um we've had good
experience with apps that way I built in
like unity or other kind of systems
where you don't really care about
do I looking like the native Native
stuff right so so there's games we don't
have much experience with games but
that's my impression also the games tend
to be written in systems where you know
you make up your own UI anyway so so
that's that's like a category if you
should categorized these different kinds
of apps right there's category of apps
where you don't care that it doesn't
look like an iPhone app or an Android
app or whatnot it's just a nap and then
in that in that space there's a lot of
value it's very easy to write a cross
platform app where it just it just looks
the same and all on all platforms and
you know frankly some to some use cases
that that's a big game it's easy if it
just looks all the same so that's one
thing another category is you know it's
it's also perfectly fine to do an
inexpensive app they just get it gets
the job done right that it doesn't look
like it it's not a great app but it's
useful it could still be very useful um
might be a bit slow or whatnot but it's
there and you always have it in your
pocket no I mean go it also depends on
what your team it knows what to do right
because if there are many places you
have a shop of web developers JavaScript
ease that know how to do that no all
this CSS and stuff I never really
cracked that CSS code but if that's the
capability you have and it also makes a
lot of sense to look go like on the box
the web app approach and of course
there's there's that's also not going to
give you a great app because the great
great app is is when it comes to you
know building the native UI that really
looks and feels like it's an integral
part of the system you're using
so I mean that's getting the best of all
the world so I think that's that's
that's impossible of course that's what
he's trying well we're no silver bullet
that's the really key thing here you
mentioned about you need the core
competencies of your staff if you're a
JavaScript shop then actually going with
as a marine solution probably isn't the
right technology for you because your
staff already know JavaScript they're
going to no html5 they're kind of know
CSS are going to be able to produce an
appt with something like called / or
jQuery Mobile in a tenth of the time
that it take to learn Objective C Swift
Java or C sharp so you go with what your
stars core competence are so if you're a
dotnet shop and you're building MVC five
apps or WPF apps do that we need to go
mobile your sat in visual studio every
single day you've got dotnet libraries
that you've already invested hundreds of
man-hours to write and you want to go
mobile at that point xamarin starts to
make sense but if you've got a clean
slate you've got a customer that's come
to you and you've got a whole wealth of
objective-c experience and they're like
we won an iOS app well if your team
knows of get to see and it's a one-off
at the inn you know it's almost a
throwaway app and you're not gonna have
to maintain it for a huge amount of time
and just go with what you know I'm not
I'm never keen to go into a business
where they've already rolled out a nap
the sales team often tried to get me to
do this to go into a business where they
built their app using objective-c for
iOS and they built it java using Android
and they want me to go in and pitch to a
room full of developers that they should
be using C sharp and I just won't do it
because it's madness because if you're
you should be using what you're most
comfortable with and most performant
with the Pitchford xamarin is euro
c-sharp netdev you love visual studio
but you want to hit well you
need to hit iOS or Android at that point
it becomes a very compelling thing to be
using when we look at things like unity
that C sharp again so if you want to do
gaming and you're a c-sharp developer
look at things like unity look at coupa
to DS which we've got bindings for or
look ma no game which is you know
Microsoft killed XNA and the community
backed by mano which is what xamarin is
built on picked up the slack and
re-implemented it so you can build XNA
games now for iOS Android ps3 ps4 xbox
360 not the xbox one yet don't ask me
how dot you know dotnet code runs on a
ps4 before it runs on an xbox but
classic Microsoft but it's about it's
about where you feel most comfortable
yeah well I will concur with that one of
our clients specifically wanted samrin
because they had they were a c-sharp
shop so they didn't save any money but
they got a platform that they could
review and maintain so it's perfectly
valid so so i think i'm gone stammering
bashing that's good for a little while I
have a question could somebody kicked me
off
yeah so I'm a trifle as well felling you
a trifle been a unity developer for six
years now and there's a lot of good
things to say about unity there's a lot
of bad things to say as well and the
point is very valid that that if you
build something where you can make stuff
look the same on a lot of different
platforms then you're it's going to be
easier to build applications but you're
absolutely right that they're probably
going to be not quite as good as if you
build them all natively but it's going
to cost you a whole lot less to get them
out on a lot of platforms and I think
the most important consideration is well
that it's a point good point that I
think every option that you have whether
it's salmon or unity or something else
it's valid for some projects I think you
can find the solution that you could say
well that's that's never a valid
solution for anything you can always
find some validity for any solution that
you can find out there but you have the
only way to figure out so for our next
project and customer needs user needs
whatever how do we figure out what the
right technology is well you have to try
them out you have to try a server in to
figure it out you have to try unity have
to get the know-how and and make a good
decision based on that that knowledge
does anyone have any experience with
html5 apps or any any opinions on it I'd
be happy to relinquish my seat
can I ask my question yes go ahead I
changed a couple a little bit over the
time here you said that it you didn't
save any money by making the samurai end
product at least not if it has to be a
high-end app but would you say it's just
as easy um is it just as capable because
theoretically it has hooks into all the
API so you should be able to do
everything that you can do in native
objective-c is Swift yes more or less so
if you were to create a new product
let's say your new team or start over
something you haven't really had you
don't have that much experience in in
any language would it make sense to go
stammering way provided you have the
money to actually go that route because
maybe as we've seen salmon has MIT has
improved a lot over the past couple of
years may be able to continue that art
and actually at some point become
everything that they want it to be I
think it's really how much do you expect
to spend in really fine-tuning you I
versus all the part of your app sure
because the more fine-tuned you get in
the less the more it gets in the way any
kind of each of the savings if you're a
little less you I heavy you can save
something if you're starting from
scratch and all three platforms so
you're actually saying it's harder than
the objective-c just sitting in Xcode
and doing the same work yes and even
though and it's how come it's only
because you have an extra component that
can model things up and what what is the
extra component because who's familiar
with platform invitation has anyone done
p.m. vote before come on someone in the
right yeah so Microsoft had a sea bound
API which was win32 they created net
which is a managed language and they
were like we've got this lovely API I
say lovely we know win32 is unbeautiful
but it's got some useful bits we want to
be able to call into that from C sharp
so they create a platform invocation so
that we can call this native code from a
managed language that's all we've done
so actually I'm gonna have to say that
your your argument at Caesar and
Objective C
it's factually wrong because every
literally it's a one-to-one mapping I
can take an objective C method and
convert it straight in to see shot it's
no more difficult but i know i'm
definitely not talking about performance
here and because you can absolutely get
the same performance the same look and
feel what you do have is you have a
complexity of another framework in there
and it does trip you up when you're
trying some of the things so you're
using UI kit you're using the same frame
you're literally using the same
framework there's a swift and of jets to
see them and sometimes stuff happens
that you wouldn't happen if it you did
in a tip so we would try things and then
it doesn't work but it works if we were
to do it in the native platform so you
kind of hit some of those snacks
sometimes and that's when so so it's
just it's another thing that you spend
time on managing there's another
dependency management on top so that was
where we kind of felt we were we were
losing some of it this time we were we
were using we were but I will also say
this there's also a couple of things
that are good about xamarin so it's not
about just about Simon thing because one
thing that was actually very nice about
working xamarin is that when you're
working several platforms you can share
code and even though I don't think we
save time by sharing code I think you do
improve your all collaboration when you
can talk in actual classes vs normally
when we're doing each platform we talk a
lot about how we model things but then
we go off our separate ways and build
separate code bases it's very nice that
you're using the same model objects
there's also another quality parameter
which is interesting which is when
you're building for several platforms is
that you want the apps to to work the
same way so even though it's a small
part of the code it's not where you
spend most of the time it's nice that
you can put that in the share code
because that means your behavior cancel
to be centralized in one place so that's
one coil quality parameter where you get
something out of samurai so I think it's
hard also because
we looked at it we're just students I
guess but we looked at xamarin to see if
it's that what the rude we wanted to go
and where I'm from IT minds we're iOS
developers are the ones that looked at
it and we have very high standards for
the tools I mean that's why we went to
iOS in the first place because the tools
are so so nice and when we went to
summer in it wasn't quite there I mean
it's close it's very good it's insanely
close but it's just the last two percent
the interface builder wasn't right us
just a snappy and you know there's just
a little more delay when you're building
and stuff like that and i think that's
that's probably why you're not fulfilled
with with the summer and experience if
you come from a iris development or a
background but i think if you're if
you're starting and you don't know or if
we give summer in time to actually get
the tools where they need to be then
there must be a very good case to use a
marine because in some way you must gain
something from being able to share code
yeah well there are definitely gains or
please kick me off if you have questions
I think all seven upcoming that is that
the thing you gain like on using
something like salmon is if you don't if
you have native development then
typically you have Android developers
and you have iOS developers and they
don't shift so iOS developers keep
developing on iOS projects and Android
developers keep developing on android
projects but if you use a cross-platform
tool then you can basically mix up those
experiences and have them on the same
team and and work in a cross-platform
tool if you buy enough licenses yes well
but yeah but that's not my department
I'm just a developer yes I just asked
for the license bad but it's the same
with unity yeah well basically you could
develop with unity yeah the
the newer versions of unity you can
develop the full app because you have
all features available in the free
version and then basically when you need
to to launch it you could buy the
license I guess but yeah but that would
still no well you have the full feature
set but you have some some tools that
aren't enabled oh so the nails you
talked about it the whole UI experience
and how that weren't easy to do but what
about the quality of the the code you
actually write because I last time i did
some android stuff it was really
cumbersome to start a threat and wait
for it to come back but with C sharp you
got the whole async await and we heard a
lot about asynchronous stuff and it's
all built in and it's gonna make your
code really CLE on all the platforms
yeah well it's a c-sharp compared to
Java 7 is definitely a pretty language
so you get some prettier code so the my
only trouble is I cannot write C sharp
faster or read it faster than I can do
Java so so it's not the big economic
gain but yeah it's a it's a more
beautiful language which I would comfort
a lot in a big team way way share code
and make it readable and untestable but
it's not more readable that's the thing
it's prettiest insects it not more
readable okay so you see a syntactic
sugar yeah yeah because I've been doing
Java for a long time so I can read it
very well so it doesn't really give me
any productivity gain to work in c-sharp
so but but I would probably be be
different if you if you don't come from
from that background and as well if your
objective c developer
I mean objective-c is a horrific Lee the
bose language exceptionally easy to read
just because Apple have made it
painfully obvious where everything is
doing but actually write it I think you
probably we're through a few keyboards
just to get through an app because you
end up typing so much stuff Swift does
kind of fix this swift but if you're
going to build an app with Swift it's
like f sharp version 1 and a sharp is
now in version 3 so and we support
everything that we do in c-sharp we can
do an F sharp so again it becomes why
bother so yeah I think if you're looking
at pure languages Java versus C sharp
everyone knows c-sharp is a bit more
modern and a bit nicer but actually
really care if you're a Java developer
just uppercase and you're pretty much
there especially when you're doing
xamarin Android development because it's
a one-to-one mappings you know just
uppercase and you're good to go whereas
with the objective c to c sharp it's
very easy to read up literacy horrible
to write in my opinion you may disagree
but there's a huge i think that's a huge
bonus for using c sharp over objects to
see if your developers in-house have
only ever used a managed language you
know trying to explain pointers to
people who've never you know what what a
memory management a lots of developers
don't want to get involved with that a
lot of developers that i meet have
subscribed to the notion that computers
are intelligent enough to deal with
their own memory we shouldn't as
developers be having to to deal with
this nonsense so is it kind of kind of
comes back to my earlier point that it's
about horses for courses where you're
most comfortable and if you love
objective-c and there are people out
there that a die-hard objective-c fans
it's not for me I'm not a JavaScript guy
either I'll write it I can read it I'm
happy to do it I say happy I will do it
I'm not going to be happy about it
whereas I feel most at home in visual
studio writing C sharp that is where I
feel warm and fuzzy inside but I'm right
and that's why xamarin was a natural fit
for me because I was a cast just to
point out I was a customer before I was
an employee I you know I was drinking
the kool-aid whilst I was paying before
I jumped ship and joined the company so
I'm not something that's coming to the
company and then decided you know I
should probably learn this stuff I was
actually at the coalface developing apps
with it and I came from a c++ background
so I understood the importance of you
know performance whilst being native so
yeah well until there can you share some
of the experiences you had before you
join summer in with the team's you were
in building apps using the the product
so as a loan xamarin developer on the
team at the previous company so i built
an app using jquery mobile so has anyone
seen the London Eye it's a big ferris
wheel next to ya Big Bend you seen it
yeah so the lights on that are
controlled by something called Farrell's
and it's an embedded ARM processor
that's got some I oh so you can do
inputs and outs of RS 232 485 MIDI does
ethernet commands as well you program
the lights on this bad boy and they've
got two of them strapped to the outside
they've been going around for eight
years now and works perfectly but the
way you interact with it is you go into
the control booth where they've got the
big knob to say how fast it's going and
there's a computer that's running like
Windows 2000 I thankfully it was an Emmy
but it's it's got a webpage on it that
connects to the controllers and each
controller has got a tiny little web
server on it so you can press buttons on
the built-in web page that queries of
programming of the box and you know I
want to fire a rainbow and then the
wheel starts doing a rainbow color or I
want to set it to blue and the engineers
were like well we're going into the box
and setting the lights like animals but
we've got this roof over us and we can't
see what's going on and it's just
talking to it on a Wi-Fi so there is a
private Wi-Fi the London Eye to control
the lights
I will say no more but they were like we
want to control this from our iPads and
at the time you know we're a cutie house
we were writing cute I can have a a week
cute or cutie cute so we're a cute house
and they they didn't have the qml stuff
ready to go for mobile they just started
to bring it out with cute 54 desktop it
was so early they didn't even have the
compile library is ready to go you had
to sit there and compile it like an
animal yourself so going with qml for
mobile just wasn't even an option it had
to be cross-platform what I created so I
was like right I'll go hybrid I didn't
know any better so i downloaded jquery
mobile well i actually downloaded
jqtouch and the developer built that
abandoned it when he was hired by sencha
touch so I then jumped over and started
building it essential touch and I didn't
particularly enjoy the development
experience of that because I've gone
from Visual Studio down into basically a
text editor as I this is not the way
it's the right software but the UI for
sencha touch look very nice someone who
spent a lot of time doing the CSS
styling for a web page and look great
and I was like right I'll try jquery
mobile and we have a reasonable success
with that but what we actually shipped
to the guys at the London Eye they
didn't like it they said it doesn't feel
right they said it looks right because
it I made it look how they designed but
it said it doesn't feel right and it's
because it needed to so basically work
the same on ipad and iphone there's
little subtle things and it's all about
you know that the subtlety of the app
when you transition from few a to DB and
i said i wanted to just a slide if
they'd launch the the web app from the
spring ball to the home screen on the
ipad it would flash through why every
time and that was just a bug in jquery
mobile and has anyone looked at the
source code for jquery mobile it's
horrible isn't it no one wants to start
debugging that and you keep bugging in a
web browser as well it's horrible it's
just nasty so I was like there's got to
be a better way and they came to me and
they said we want to color with
so we want to be able to select group of
lights on the London Eye and drag around
and change the color live as I that's
reasonable isn't it this is a web page
so I was like I've got to make it happen
and that it was a Friday evening I got
the email that said that they were doing
that as hack I'm gonna have to quit my
job I can't write any more bloody
JavaScript and I got home that evening I
was like right I'm going to find a a
cross-platform native solution and i
literally just typed in c-sharp a
c-sharp iphone and xamarin was the top
link and back then you couldn't even
trialed a marine you there was no
starter edition they didn't even have
visual studio support it was just
monodevelop running on OS 10 and you had
to use xcode to do UI design and do the
actions and outlets and all that madness
but I pulled out my credit card and I
bought a license and over 48 hours i
built an app that controlled with a
color picker a native color picker or
hey for the London Eye and I shared
about eighty percent of the cove so the
following week when I went into work I
managed to build the Android version
which again was 100 sent native the
London eyes guys they loved it the app
was finally what they wanted are sharing
a whole load of code and it and it was
native so like my experience of getting
into mobile I kind of fell into it I was
it was just because I pulled the short
straw and the guys are like well you're
gonna have to write some JavaScript now
haha and I was like no i'm not writing
JavaScript forever so that's kind of my
background in how I fell in love with
the technology yeah but I said I would
still build web apps and i still have
built web apps whilst I've been employed
at xamarin because there a certain
situations Phillips the the lighting
company got a trade show booth they
wanted to be able to control the lights
on the trade show they had a multitude
of devices I had a very short amount of
time to make their UI how they wanted it
to it had to look the same on everything
I wasn't going to do with that was a
marine because it would take more time
to do the pixel perfect design on
Android and win android and iOS
whereas hybrid perfect for that I don't
enjoy writing hybrid but it certainly
has its place well that's a rant wasn't
it I can ramble good sorry I think you
should pick someone just drag them out
well I'd like to hear more about jQuery
Mobile so yeah yeah could you come up
and tell me what to tell us what what
you've been working on in yeah I think
I've tried this before i let
retrospective us off okay so um yeah i
got out to a customer so i'm a
consultant and they had this existing
web app and it was built india-mobile
and I thought great i love this it is
2015 and they have chosen jquery mobile
okay I can work with this I've done a
lot of jQuery before so no problem until
we thought okay maybe we won't do
something a bit more modern like data
binding and I said okay let's do this so
we tried putting a knock out on top off
take her mobile which works okay it
could have been better but at some point
I had to fill around with some events
and stuff and well lo and behold it
didn't work and I thought okay I'll try
and debug this
and I just couldn't figure it out so I
had to dive into jquery mobile and
actually all the way down through keep
her mobile seven handlers and into
jquery itself and it was just oh my god
I don't know what they have been
thinking I think that smart guys guys
know I'm not bashing anyone but it was
not pretty and I had hard time
understanding it to be honest so not a
pleasant experience but I think I
eventually found work around or
something but yeah so is your background
javascript developing a front end I've
primarily been doing that yes but from a
chick initial education stamp and I'm IT
engineer so I'm also educated NC shop
and i love it too so I haven't been
tried I haven't tried out summer in yet
like for real but i think i'm going to
get into it so if you looked at things
like call divert any other web
technologies not really not that much I
of course I know about it ah but not
really like proficiently so I actually
recently got into download salmon once
again to try and take a look at it and
actually try and see well I did
something in visual studio and windows
and that ran perfect and I thought okay
does it actually work on in OS 10 right
I have mac like okay and it actually
just worked out of the bars and I would
like whoa I did not see this coming that
was actually really really nice
just blown away to be honest have not
seen that coming so yeah I'm really
going to saurian take a diva look well
we have trials so that the decision to
use jQuery Mobile yeah that was that the
customer that had made addition we want
this made yeah as I was trying to say it
was an existing web app yeah so it had
been built like I think they did it like
a year before I Cain yeah into the team
so I don't know why they chose it okay
they I think one is also a hybrid app
and with their own design like yeah and
I guess they sought thought that was the
best way to go the thing a lot of the
time right decisions such as that is a
result of people going back to something
they know so there's been someone in the
organization who who who was familiar
with it and then thought well this is
what we're going with and I think that's
actually one the most dangerous things
that we as developers and organizations
can do is fall in love with something
and then just use that for the sake of
using it whatever the technology may be
and I can't remember whether it was
pianist host of all where was who i saw
a video and is that oh you should learn
a new language each year so it just or
try out new technology now and then just
just to do it and just to get informed
and and change her perspective now and
then well i totally agree i think that
was the case yeah and it's not the first
time I've seen it certainly not but it's
a it's reality you know unfortunately
yeah but I think we have a
responsibility as
of 22 may be provoked coolers making the
decision or or take part in making the
decision and well maybe we should try
out something else maybe you should use
another technology or yeah take an
experiment on this do an exploration yes
can anybody hear me good i'm a native
iOS developer a tripod I've had some
experience integrating hybrid pages into
our native app in my experience that
gives us Sapa user experience and then
then thinking about phonegap and jquery
mobile and stuff like that I my opinion
performance lacks massively it's like
pressing a button you can feel a delay I
think web technologies are simply not
suited for doing native apps whatsoever
yeah mother yes I want to put that up
into the air Oh on top of that i'm not
sure about samreen but my understanding
is semillon compiled to native code yeah
it's not there's not virtual machine
with the sharp C sharp code is running
so it really depends so on iOS we we
compile down to a native arm assembly so
we do ahead of time compilation for
Android we have two options we get apple
say you can't jits on the device a poor
very clear about that so we have to do
ahead of time now on android we can dip
so historically as a marin android app
would use our own runtime which we load
up next to delve it and they communicate
with each other but you can also now do
ahead of time compilation for android
but in terms of your comment about you
know performance as i was trying to say
mark zuckerberg said the biggest mistake
facebook is made is betting too much on
html5 and i always think that you know
if a company with
resources of Facebook and did anyone see
the post i think it was on reddit about
that they can't scale for iOS and you
know iOS simply isn't powerful enough
for them so they've reimplemented like
80,000 classes and you know they're just
they're hackers they're like slapping
fix on fix and bad code it sounds
horrible their engineering practices but
yeah they bet they bet on hybrid
couldn't do it and I just don't think
with the amount of developers that
they've got is a 4,000 commits in one
week with 400 plus developers working
just on the iOS project so let's assume
that they took those 400 developers and
said you're now going hybrid and 400
developers couldn't produce an app that
could get more than to start because
they took it five star app to to star in
one release if 400 people can't do it
then myself is an individual I'm
probably going to struggle that's just
my opinion on hybrid but I get what as I
said before I get where it's useful when
you've got that pixel perfect design
your designer has come to you with
something that is identical for Windows
Phone Android and iOS you're going to
save so much time and money going hybrid
but if you if you care about how it
looks and how it feels and you care
about the end user and you have to go
native my name is Joaquin and I've been
a web developer for some years now and
well my interest for for mobile
development has mainly come pretty much
as a as a hobby I just had to stand up
when you said that a web wasn't suited
for mobile also yes yeah yeah well I
just wanted to say that yeah you kind of
have to put that into context because
it's also true that well yeah mobile
technologies have evolved a lot during
the last year's and apart from mo
busting our technology is evolving the
tooling has also evolved a lot so
there's actually web hybrid like
solutions web-based hybrid solutions
I particularly like looked into for
example ionic framework I don't know if
you're familiar with it and that's based
on angular 2 and and and they've
actually they've actually tête à you
know tackled a lot of the problems that
hybrid has they they tackled several
problems in how to look and feel this
and they managed for example to like get
the same product to look different
depending on which platform you to play
that on of course it still doesn't feel
right but I mean for a developer that
you know wants to put their app on
market as soon as possible and doesn't
have many resources it's a perfect
solution as well and other than that
going even further with the tooling just
recently Facebook released react native
where you know for me was great to say
okay i have to i don't i don't have to
learn any iOS i don't have to learn any
android but with my knowledge on web
development I can you know deploy a
native app and wow if you look at the
examples of those apps that there are in
the market just as an example of that
Facebook released their their Facebook
Ads application based on react native
and if you look at the app it looks like
crap kind of it doesn't have anything
smart but but it's there and it feels
native and it feels good right and it's
a start and it's a new technology they
just got there right so I think the key
thing there is the you said that you
don't have to learn iOS Android that is
where hybrid fails and I think that's
also where xamarin forms fails as well
to some degree and that people assume
that because they've got thus
abstraction that they don't need to
learn the platform and I'm not saying
you need to learn the api's of the
platform I'm saying you need to know you
need to get in the headspace of the user
of that device and when people are
talking about it doesn't feel right it
it's because you know you've styled the
bottom of your CSS to make it look legit
Android but you know you press it down
and it sits there for a bit too long
before it pops back up and that's not a
threading issue or performance
it's just your CSS is marginally out and
they pick up on all the tiny little
subtleties that are wrong because you as
a developer don't know that platform I
think you owe it to yourself if you're
going to try and hit all three platforms
to go and get a device of each and
actually use it for a for some time I
wouldn't dream of deploying an app to
Android without using an Android device
for a considerable amount of time and I
wouldn't i wouldn't try and deploy to
Apple watch without owning and using one
but that's where I think it's really
important that you put things into
context if you're a startup company with
a limited amount of resources and and
even if you consider that the app is
like a central piece of your business
it's you know this very there's very few
companies in the startup world that can
really deal with you know releasing an
app into which is one platform into it
writes what Instagram did they chose and
whatsapp did it as well it shows iOS
first they monetize it they prove the
business on the one platform they got it
right and then when they have the
resources they went and targeted the
other platforms
