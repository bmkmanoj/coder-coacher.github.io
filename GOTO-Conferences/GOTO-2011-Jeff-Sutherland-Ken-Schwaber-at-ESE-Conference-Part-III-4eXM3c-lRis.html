the audience I would like to pose some
questions first and most important
questions why are you both wearing
blanket tops
I don't know if any of you ever have
listened to Johnny Cash
country and western singer and he played
a used to always wore black and he was
playing at Folsom Prison and someone
said so you know you're not in prison
why do you wear black he said well I am
going to wear black until there is
justice until there is honesty until
there is compassion in our world and he
said so that's why I wear black it's my
symbol of my quest so I'm not sure if
that's why Jeff and I are wearing black
but you know it's good story it's
definitely the best answer let's get
serious
um I got so many questions about scrum
Alliance scrum Doric should I certify
for scrum Alliance certified scrum
master should I go for scrum Doric
certified whatever could you bring us
some light and to these organizations
and what's your thoughts about this
absolutely I found its agile liens I
found it scrum Alliance I found it
squandered org Jeff founded scrum Inc
Jeff founded scrum foundation all of
them are great sources because we built
the theory of expertise of scrum
knowledge of scrum in fact there are a
lot of other organizations including
yours right I was talking to
again in development once and he was
yelling at me because he had hired a
certified scrum master and the guy was a
dolt kind of like a word like idiot and
I said oh he said so so he you know I
think you guys did a lousy job I said
did you interview this person so many
sources of excellence as well as many
sources of truly terrible support
products and capabilities I thoroughly
advise you to investigate before you
engage okay because we're all trying to
do the same thing right yeah I you know
in our interest scrum is beyond any
organization these organizations are
just mechanisms for trying to bring
scrums of the world often there's
competition between them over money
which has nothing to do with what's
common about our interests from the
beginning is to then make scrum open and
free and our major interest is in
keeping that keeping it that way
absolutely and so even though I still do
work with scrum Alliance Ken described
our I work together closely with scrum
there should people should have whatever
certification they want you know when I
teach a scrum class I tell people Kota
Ken's site take the test get certified
by him you know I can get you the
certified scrum Alliance thing as well
whatever you want the main thing is that
you learn how to do scrum well and you
you build great teams that's that's
that's what we're all about and that
comes from experience yeah yeah I don't
know if you've noticed but Jeff and I
have put formed something called the
scrum guide and Jeff now has a scrum
handbook because as we see the spreading
what we're trying to do is avoid what
happened in the old times
object-oriented times where there were
so many varieties in opinions so we said
to us the issue is not scrum you mean
it's really small it's simple so we laid
down the definition it's how you use it
that's the issue so we've tried to do is
avoid the you know this being a
methodology issue rather than a you know
earnestness
your useless effort issue who knows you
know it's big world we do the best we
can so if a humorous Osmond intro asking
me for education we would ends up it
just doesn't care you know it just a
good teachers matter you know people try
to get into good universities and they
try to get trained by the best
instructors that will never change and
the best way of doing that is either
looking for references or talking to
your friends right things have a next
interesting question you said scrum is a
tool tool to getting more agile there
are more tools out there Kanban is
increasing so what is your ends up
between scrum and Kanban what is your
thoughts about this well combined is is
a very simplified ease practice it only
has one constraint minimizing working
progress which is a really good thing
and I recommend every scrum team do it
the the thing that makes scrum work is
that it's based on putting together
teams and get into working well together
with the first principle the agile
manifesto you can implement a scrum
Kanban team that will do that and it's
particularly good for continuous flow
but what I do is always wrap scrum
around it you know I want a product
backlog is prioritized right I want
retrospectives I want cross-functional
teams working together that is the only
way you get high performance and if you
look at Kanban teams get better I've
challenged David Anderson to show me a
high productive Kanban team yet because
it's going to be it's going to be very
difficult it's gonna have to be very
scrum like I did write a paper on a
company called patient keeper who had
one of the most highest performing
scrubs I'd ever seen and that paper was
entitled the future of strop and we call
that a types
scrum and the scrum community had a a
bit of a hysterical reaction to that
paper and said you know that's not
really strong at all and even Ken said I
don't know what it is but it's a
competitive monster it eats the
competition for lunch but it was
structured in a way that is beyond the
current conceptions of Kanban but it had
a Kanban approach we were it was like we
were doing things like parallel
pipelining I'm on a microchip
you know multi-threading Sprint's
through teams and that completely
baffled people but doing that allowed us
to go to production in large enterprises
big hospital systems at the end of every
sprint and so whatever we sprint we
needed to bring hospitals into
production whether it was a one-week a
two week three week or four week never
more than that we had those Sprint's
running and we would launch multiple
Sprint's simultaneously we always had
four to six Sprint's running
concurrently through a set of stable
teams and that was a very difficult
implementations to sustain once the once
the people that implemented that left
but I've yet to see
I know there are cont there are a number
of companies now in the world that are
actually able to do releases you know at
the end of every sprint there's some
people that even do daily releases now
but to do what we did which let's bring
up the four biggest hospitals at Zurich
at the end of the next sprint we could
do that I haven't seen another company
being able to manifest that people would
call that a very con bond like scrum and
I told the Kanban people you know when
you get really high performing Kanban
teams it'll look very similar to patient
keeper what what Jeff forgot to mention
is he spent six years getting patient
keeper to that state
I spent two years with and it it is a
manifestation of engineering excellence
and my concern when people talk about
Kanban is that they often do it because
scrums hard and Kanban is easy and what
they then miss is the work that they
have to go through to gain the
engineering excellence that you were
able to achieve if you look through the
documents on process control Kanban is
is meant for complicated work that is we
have things that we pretty much know so
we can have actually swim lanes and we
can look at the extent flow of things
coming in and let's measure it and
optimize it but by and large we know
what's happening we're just trying to
optimize scrum is aimed at complex work
where the number of things you don't
know overwhelms the things you do know
and so I would suggest that you well
everyone needs to make a living
so there's karma before open up to the
audience I have a last questions we have
no 15 years scrum and scrum is still a
scrum what will be in another 15 years
okay
so our worlds becoming more complex our
products are more complex the need for
creative teams coming up with
sophisticated high quality products is
growing I think whether it's called
scrum scribble nuts warts
an approach which improves our ability
to do this is needed I would hope I had
hoped that by 2015 2016 the whole
terminology around scrum would have
disappeared because it would have been
inherent in a rework the terminology is
very useful because it causes these ease
of talking amongst people the framework
is very useful because it points out the
problems my fear is that it proves too
hard for us and we don't rise to the
challenge and scrum disappears as a
cloud of fads my hope is that this
continues for a long time and it's part
of us rising to the occasion because we
certainly aren't short on problems yeah
I think you know the thing that in my
view that is base comes successful is
that it's about people and it's built on
what builds great sports teams it pulls
passion from the people it pulls
honestly it pulls people being able to
count on one another people people being
to be willing to watch each other's back
and when someone's Falls they will
protect that person and pick them up no
matter what we call it 15 years from now
that will be part of whatever makes
great teams and to the extent that we
can keep that part of what we call now
call scrum scrum will continue to exist
and we have those beliefs about people
work these are you know furious
great values and I think they're you
know you see them across history the
neat thing is we've proven now that if
you do it it pays for itself you know so
businesses which are hard-nosed tough
places it turns out that if you let the
people do creative work and work
together and coverage back you can
out-compete the others that don't dance
so that's me yeah I mean I remember 15
and 20 years this would be forced from I
was I was doing startups and I would
meet with the VCS that would tell them
you know my way my way of thinking about
how things should be done and they would
say you know you're a flower child
you're like you're some kind of hippie
from California you get it will never
work you can't trust them yeah but now
they come to me and they want to hire me
as an advisor doesn't me they're gonna
do it we it's awesome but well they know
it works even though they have a hard
time doing it I'm pretty sure there are
many questions are there in the audience
we would prefer that you constrain them
to once we know the answers to I really
appreciate your talks thank you very
much but I don't like if you recall
scrum is a tool I think is necessary
work every time someone says but I get
worried you spot yeah you know like it's
a setup
so scrum is a framework my question is
are they any plans to generate return of
investment or generate some money with
scrum with this very more to who to
generate some money or to make some care
for myself yeah we're gonna form a
company and we called make a list
incorporate and we'll treat our
employees like but we'll make money
off it no not for you but for the scrum
aliens or
we leave up to you yeah I mean scrum is
about you know in the business world
it's about making company making money
for companies I mean the company I
mentioned that had the type C scrum
their revenue went up 400% in one year
that's what a really good scrum will do
for you so there's plenty of money to be
made from scrum when we started though
promoting its of the world I wanted it
to be open and you know it was before
open-source we we didn't call it
open-source but basically scrum is
open-source that's the way we want it
and so it's free for everybody to use to
make as much money as they can
our greatest regret and we've been
seeing some is is where people are
starting to try to copyright or create
market parts of it and and that's almost
counterintuitive to the idea of this
being common sense you know and
something we gave to everyone yeah thank
you and do you think one question I yeah
i I do want to make a pitch though I'm
looking for somebody to donate at least
10 million dollars to the Harvard
Business School the former scrum
Institute and if there's anybody out
there and you're a company that's ready
to do that we'd like to talk to them
again and what we think Jeff can I get a
emeritus professor ship there yep maybe
we'll have a scrum chair they'll have to
establish a scrum chair though I don't
have to stay in Boston though this
sounds really good both of us and my
last question do you think that you
reach the phoenicians of thumb for scrum
or we talked we told you that already
you were listening right yes good we
said no right do you have any experience
in introducing scrum for example into
organizations reaching CMMI level 3 and
above yes I've spent maybe ken has also
but I have spent since 2006 I've worked
with a CEO my maturity level 5
organization who has the best data
I think in the world unsprung what they
found to get to see how my level-five
takes in their view at least seven years
and they did it in the late 90s into
2005 I think they were finally appraised
at level five they then decided that
they needed to lean out the corporation
because the the overhead that they
introduced they thought was excessive
reporting bureaucracy and they decided
that they would use scrum as a tool to
introduce lean one of the things that
people may not realize that scrum is
probably the best tool on the planet for
introducing lean into your company we
have Pete I know in Auto Parts companies
in Germany they've told us you know our
Lean Six Sigma team is introduced more
lean and scrum with with scrum in six
months then we were able to do four in
three years without screw scrum throats
waste up in the air makes it so the
impending gets everybody involved so in
any event once they introduce scrum they
did pilot project for six months and
they found that every project on the
average cost half as much and had 40%
fewer bugs plus a minus 3% and cut their
process overhead for managing process by
more than 50% and they immediately
started bidding they do these big fixed
price projects and defense and elsewhere
ten million for the euro for the for the
waterfall version five million euro for
the scrum version and these at CMI five
you need to be able to do a perfect
waterfall almost every time so they're
taking the waterfall guys and put them
on the scrum teams changing them back
and forth if they're on scrum teams it
costs half as much and that's that
there's the waste yeah that's showing
the beast do you have to remember that
the question that hasn't come up yet but
it's technically related to the CLI one
is how you guys feel about PMI and
prince2 agile you got to remember the
goal of software engineers to was to
improve our profession we're all for
that yeah just our our technique is
scrum and you look at their what used to
call
called keep process areas you can do
those either in an agile way or in a
heavy documentation way either one are
ways of for showing excellence we
welcome PMI agile I mean this is them
recognizing value in something and
they're certainly going to do their
approach at it this is not a competitive
methodological war we're actually trying
to do something what a guest I really
enjoyed the your this intervention here
but if you remember Jeff I think it was
in 2008 in Frankfurt
I took a scrum master class with with
you and you you talked about the money
for nothing and change for free concept
in the context of firm fixed price
contracts right which for me was a bit
the missing link that had troubled me
because I had worked with European Space
Agency for so many years and and then
they were using a nil 2167 a
implementation which is the origin of
waterfalls and we've made some progress
in the last three years in implementing
in parts those these options that you
were you were mentioning and and myself
in a project with automotive industry
actually did successfully implement
those things so good so I'm so I'm you
know I find it I find it really really
interesting and maybe you wanna share
shared ly the ideas a little bit well
you know whenever I talk to CEOs senior
management of a company that's working
in software for example I work with the
CIO of o2 in Germany a big telecom
company and he you know one of the first
things he said to me is Jeff here's my
problem
I just finished a hundred million dollar
prize 100 million euro project it cost
me two hundred seventy million euro and
it was two years late can scrum fix that
and I said well you must have had to pay
for changes that's why he had the cost
overrun right the requirements change
and you had to pay time and materials
and the vendor came in initially and
low-balled the price knowing that all
their money was going to be made in
costs and materials when you made
changes the change orders and so their
incentive was to make that project go on
as long as possible and have you pay as
much as possible and he said that's
right and I said I was at the Pentagon
two weeks ago again we haven't talked
about this but the Department of Defense
of the United States has been instructed
by Congress to implement iterative and
incremental development so one of the
first things that happened is the head
of IT for the DoD who has been to meit's
chrome core said Jeff you need to come
in and talk to the task force right away
so I come in and I I tell them the same
thing you know those Beltway bandits in
Washington they come in with a lowball
building a contract you sign it time and
materials they're gonna charge you until
they can bleed you dry and every person
in the room said yes that's what they do
and I said well you need to start
putting a short option clause in your
contract that says all change is free if
the new request which scrum can absorb
immediately is offset by throwing away
some low value feature of equal work and
there's always low value useless
features that can be thrown away we know
on the average all over the world 65% of
features I never are really used and so
there's huge amounts of waste in
software projects so for the CIO of o2
if he had that in his contract he would
have come in at a hundred million euro
instead of two hundred seventy million
euro it's a simple low-risk
way of changing the incentive structure
in the industry which is designed for
projects to be late and for budgets to
be high we
a number of companies that have worked
with you know Lockheed Martin Northrop
corporation Essex corporation Gestalt
corporation do DOD contracting and
bottom-up the currents and captain's in
the Department of Defense have been
using scrubbed for a number of years and
they just you know come up you say wink
wink nod were green scrum what happened
is the programs that would make defense
projects like new he whacks projects new
over the hill radar projects typically
those are fast overruns and fail and so
the idea if you're a colonel or captain
is if you're assigned one of those
programs and you can politically survive
its failure we might promote you to be
any upper lower General what started
happening is these guys were you it came
out of a pl Johns Hopkins where they
first were prototyping music scrum and
what start happening is these started
saving lives
I mean United States and lots of wars
and and number of things they'd bring
ends were saving lives and it would come
right back to the colonel or captain
with a credit you got to be promoted
based on the success in helping our
forces and so now it's it's you know not
that all the curls and captains in the
world don't want to be generals and
admirals but they're fighting hand over
fist to use scrum with their projects
there's a very interesting item that
came out in the press about the Iraqi
war that was essentially turned around
by cross-functional teams that put
together all the intelligence services
and daily meetings collocation and they
were so fast at finding identifying and
knocking out the bad guys that had put
the whole terrorist infrastructure into
disarray and it dropped the violence by
over 80 percent in less than a year and
allowed the u.s. to then extract itself
pretty much from Iraq all right what's
that
the next part is interesting see this is
what happens when the leak when the
leadership goes away when General
Petraeus goes away all the intelligence
services have their own agenda they said
this information sharing is against our
self-interest we have our own agendas
we're going to stop these
cross-functional teams so that
bureaucracy is taken down all the
cross-functional teams in Iraq whether
they have them in Afghanistan now or not
I don't know but if they don't have them
we're going to have a disaster in
Afghanistan so scrum is much bigger than
just getting some software done another
company that we've worked with and is
one of our huge success stories I'm not
going to disclose its name because of
what I what I'm going to tell you about
it it is our our leading example of
agility and empowerment of the
organization for instance in the Chinese
earthquake its local office went in and
helped all the people in that area of
China and spent 15 million dollars of
the corporate money helping them rebuild
without permission you know from the
United States and when they found out
about it no one is punished this is a
good thing and now if you want to buy
equipment in their part of China it's
going to be theirs and a consult I know
that that was working with the CEO of
that company I'm working next told me
that the top vice presidents there can't
wait for the CEO to leave they are sick
of this collaboration and cooperation
stuff they want to reaffirm their
lifetimes their power you know they're
sick of this stuff so the top guy leaves
and this is why we're Jeff and I are
talking with you about culture change
you know this is not just a you know top
guy forcing it this is different way of
thinking and that's why I don't think
we're gonna be retiring for so yeah and
you know it's all about whether you're
for the best for people or where you
have a self-serving interest where
you're feeding at the trial that's
what's going on in the world there are
people that want the best for people
and there are people want to take
everything for themselves and what
happens is scrum makes that visible yep
and so then you have a battle if we've
implemented scrum like seven times at
Fidelity Investments whenever they have
problems of your problem
they bring in scrum and used to solve it
but everyone infidelity is paid more
than almost anyone else in the Northeast
to the United States so they do not want
to leave fidelity so politics is rife
Instagram is transparent anti-politics
so as an organizational idea never
happening yeah but it's a great problem
solver for them you know I met a VP from
Fedeli on an airplane recently and he
said I'm implementing scrum and I said
well I heard you've already implemented
in seven other locations and he says to
be it doesn't matter how many times
we've implemented in a field he says the
problem is always the same and scrum is
always the answer so bear with us if
Jeff and I sound occasionally a little
cynical all right that that last story
begs a follow-up question then but if
every time if you don't the liamri
implements from and brings you in you
also benefit from it no the question
really innocent I think it's relevant
for a number of us in this room is how
to bring scrum to enterprise and make it
stick I mean yes I know your book and
and there are very the book sucks the
book sucks yeah Here I am telling people
to read it it's it's a it's a good first
attempt sure please Jeff and I up in
engaging with you know like the Harvard
Business School and what we're picking
up is this is a cultural organizational
change agree and Ranier you have copies
of the path booked yeah where we
engaged and started working with
cultural change experts and they've
helped us lay out how this would work
now the cultural change immediately
tests the company because if they aren't
dead serious they will immediately not
do it and and it's laid out that way and
this comes from Jeff networks more with
companies they're gonna succeed but I
could call say he helped us with
training and I'll say ok so this is the
way we're gonna do anything no no I just
want my people to talk the same words
okay that's not cultural change and I
think what we're gonna find is that this
is not going to be a one or two year
project anymore it's we organizationally
lead thing to be competitive with
agility by treating their people
differently and the corporations that
engage in this won't lose it because
that's who they all will become our
problem right now with like the CEO I
had and Petraeus is that's a veneer
above a mess better to work their
relative veneer but it's can disappear
you know the reason I'm still running
around the world doing this is that I
view scrum or whatever scrum being um is
really a training ground for people to
learn how to be free how to be empowered
how to be open and transparent and help
one another out that's what we need in
the world and you know if this started
so part of the background of early scrum
which I didn't have to get a chance to
talk about was my work with micro
enterprise lending because of my work
and startups and with a creative
initiative foundation which Ken and I
both were involved in years ago a group
called accion the largest micro
enterprise development company in the
Western Hemisphere based on Nobel
laureate what's his name unit Yunus in
Bangladesh I can't pronounce his work in
the Grameen
and the president asked me to be on the
Advisory Council and so I spent a year
or two watching how they went and worked
with the poorest people mainly in that
for that organization Mamie and mainly
in Central and South America people who
couldn't even feed their children and
they would get them together in a small
group and they would say you know we can
help you come up with a small business
plan and when when the group each person
has their own business plan then we're
going to give you $25 and then you go
out and execute that business plan the
$25 it will be alone and then when you
pay back that law and then we'll give
you more money and working that small
team in coaching them they'd find that
in a in less than a year all of a sudden
they could feed their children they not
only could feed their children they
could buy clothes for the children once
they could buy clothes to the children
the children go to school and become
educated when they got them into school
all of a sudden they were now where
they're building a look a new house
maybe it was just a little shack but it
was it was a new house for them and all
this time I'm going into work and
software development and I'm realizing
you know these software developers
they're there they're not pouring money
because they're making reasonable money
but they're poor and spirit they're
constantly being told they're not good
enough their time to constantly be
tolling they're late they're constantly
being told their software sucks
and so I said you know is there a way to
to bootstrap a team just like we do with
the poor people in South America so that
they can actually rise up out of
oppression and be free and that was the
the the the emotional motivation for
starting strong and it worked and that
actually goes to of something you and I
have both seen in organizations where
we're talking to the developers and
we're talking about self-organizing
teams and and what you see in their eyes
is fear like we can't get away with us
here if we do
yes you know I'll be Neal and it's it's
pretty weird so here we have something
radically different which gives
corporations and organizations more
profitability and competitive advantage
yet it doesn't allow the management to
react in autocratic bullying ways what a
conundrum that is hmm I have to give up
my way of acting to gain all this
competitive advantage strong incentive
finally got an incentive that's good so
can can you say more about the your work
with involvement with the organizational
change management approaches and how
that has worked or produced results
because that's really started started
nine months ago I'm working with
partners like salka who have management
consulting arms as well as engineering
and consulting arms for development and
because it's a it's a dual thread thing
you're working with the leadership team
not just the senior management but the
most influential people in the company
and they're driving change which is
leadership and then the managers managed
to change but it includes things like
first of all making sure you broadly
communicate what this is about
keep the communication going to stop
rumors from occurring making sure
everybody has a vision of what's going
to happen and knows or has a way of
asking what this means to them and their
families as this occurs things like
making sure we change all of the
policies procedures techniques all that
within the company which support the old
way of thinking manufacturing and
support instead of creativity and
empowerment so it's a pretty significant
effort we'll see how it goes
so aside from the work of John Carter
which is very much in in that in that
area of of thinking and and his
steps any any other tips from your nine
months of engagement in this area yeah
for a quick read what it's like to
create change in all the aspects of it
45-minute read by the book our iceberg
is melting by John Carter yeah
it's it's a little fable about a penguin
you know colony on iceberg who discovers
it's melting and guess what the other
penguins don't want to know and so it's
all the thinking and plotting and
strategizing except from a Penguins
point of view and it's because of it's a
story it's not offensive it's easy to
read and it doesn't scare people of you
know abstract theory so you're saying if
you have management commitment and from
the bottom commitment you can implement
scrum is any way of get again gorilla
away from the bottom and not having the
acceptance for management for instance
or do you think you just have really bad
odds there I was at Swiss Re a while ago
and they're using scrum pretty well and
they were asking how do we sell this to
management and my advice was don't let
anyone know you're doing this because
the moment if it happens prematurely
they're gonna come down and want to
control it and manage it and everything
but if it goes long enough improves
value then you're not gonna be selling
anything it's already sold so low
profile no it's great yeah in the
beginning air all this from was guerilla
scrum yep and Jeff and I were seeing
that in Zurich I mean Klaus you were
there in this class we had that guy
Christian you know yeah he was having
trouble selling scrum the management and
you kept on asking about that I said
well who started from in your
organization he said I did who's keeping
it going he said I am oh it's it's your
idea you're the one that's causing the
trouble said yeah so we said well keep
that
so those who think that it's impossible
to learn Jeff and I both in Vietnam
studied clearly Vietcong tactics and are
implementing them with scrum I'll say
yes hey Jeff and I want to thank you
guys for being here
to the extent that we've been able to by
talking with you engage you our pleasure
to the extent that we're gonna able to
keep working with you and you work with
each other this is pretty important so
thank you for being here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
