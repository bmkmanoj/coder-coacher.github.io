conference should have at least one
weird talk and I also believe that the
closing keynote thank you for being here
the closing keynote should be really
unusual and maybe a little provocative
so that when you leave you'll have
something to mull over now you've been
sitting here for two days haven't you
most of you been sitting you're sitting
for two days so I'm going to add my
voice to yearns to say if you want to
stand up and walk around not only will
you feel better but you know it'll give
me something to look at because right
now I can't see a thing because I have
this light in my eyes and so I
appreciate your being here not only
because it's the closing keynote but
because this is the first time I have
given this particular talk and those of
you especially who are in the front row
can see that I'm incredibly old and so
I'm real nervous when I have to do new
things so just in case you're wondering
I know the question in your mind is oh
my god how old is she so I just had one
of those significant birthdays and now
I'm I guess happy to say I am 75
so if I stumble around a little bit why
I know that you'll be sympathetic and
supportive of this old lady so this is
going to be a talk about resistance and
it's a talk in progress but just like
all my talks I'm happy to give it away
if you send me some email you've got my
email address right in front of you now
I will send you the PowerPoint you can
change it up and make it better because
right now it's really a work in progress
in fact I'm a little nervous about this
talk so I hope you'll be patient with me
my name is Linda riling I live in the
United States and I did not vote for
Donald Trump that election changed my
life I thought my protest days were over
protest to me meant civil rights from
the 60s Vietnam in the 70s I put away
all my sign making material I had to go
back into the back of the closet to dig
that out but I was one of those 15,000
women who marched in Nashville the day
after the inauguration peaceful gentle
people nobody threw anything at anybody
and I felt better hanging around at
least a few other people who felt the
same way I did very upset disturbed and
so that was my first protest I've done
several others since I've signed
countless petitions written countless
emails written countless really you know
letters to my public officials but I've
also noticed that I started to do
something else I live in Tennessee which
is a red state it's a red state with a
couple of little tiny blue dots in it
one of them is Nashville and I say that
I'm from Nashville but I don't really
live in Nashville I live 18 miles east
of Nashville so I lived in a sea of red
and I started looking at my friends and
neighbors I started wondering could you
be
Trump supporter and something happens to
you when you start doing that you go to
the grocery store and you look at the
checkout clerk and you wonder could she
be a trump supporter it really messes
with your mind and after a while I woke
up one day and I have to stop this I
cannot spend my time wondering about
whether all my friends and neighbors who
are really still the same people they
were before the election whether they're
somehow different now after the election
I feel like I'm losing my mind I feel
like I'm maybe one of those characters
in one of my favorite Twilight zones if
you haven't seen this one the monsters
are due on Maple Street you can find it
on YouTube and enjoy watching it nope
not now not now Oh too late too late
when you enjoy watching that you'll know
how I felt the people on Maple Street
began to turn against one another their
friends and neighbors all of a sudden
for a lot of strange reasons began to
attack each other I didn't want to do
that so for therapy really I started
riding this talk it's a work in progress
I'm not happy with it
but it helped me get through some bad
times so that I wouldn't become one of
those maple street citizens ready to
kill my friends and neighbors when it
this is a problem we face not only in
the US but around the world
we're coming apart at the seams just
cause we think something is wrong with
our friends and neighbors and you know
this is something we've had in software
development the developers don't talk to
the testers and neither one of them
talked to the business people and they
don't talk to the customers so it's not
like this is anything to do with
politics
so I hope that maybe I can provide some
therapy for you and maybe when I get to
the end of the talk I will feel better I
hope so so here's the problem this is
what we do now let me assume my fencing
pose when we disagree with somebody it's
it's like this isn't it we think we're
having a conversation about some
contentious issue but we are not we are
not having a dialogue we are not
conversing we're doing this and while
our opponent is talking we are not
listening we find some key word and then
we go through that little file box that
is our conscious mind and we pull out a
proprietary say ha take that and the
goal of course of all of this is to at
some point be able to say ha gotcha and
to stand with our foot on his neck yes
okay come on haven't you done them have
you done that come on haven't you done
that sure okay and when you did it
did you reach down did you help your
opponent up and did you find that he
said oh thank you for making me feel so
stupid
I so appreciate sharing your insight did
you see that is that what happened well
what we should realize by now but we
don't seem to because this is what we do
all the time is that rational argument
giving reasons fighting back and forth
doesn't convince anybody nobody really
listens nobody pays any attention to
logic well we must take another survey
here how many smart people in the room
25 okay thank you 25 so you 25 people
the smart people in the room you believe
don't you in logic in rational argument
that's how you influence other people by
making a nice rational argument in fact
that's so solid in us that even at the
level of countries who need to come
together to negotiate they are willing
to do so because they think if I just
explain it to my opponent will then
clearly they are also smart people
clearly they will understand my position
and that will solve the problem and each
side believes that
and they think that's what negotiation
is all about a logical explanation
reasons we think that will solve
everything and then of course when it
doesn't our conclusion is well there
must be something wrong with those
people if you've ever had a discussion
with somebody who doesn't agree with you
politically or even who doesn't like
your choice of programming language and
if you're unable to convince them by
rational argument usually your
conclusion is there must be something
wrong with math I didn't understand my
clear my logical argument so fortunately
there is help available how many of you
have read Thinking Fast and Slow okay
hire these people Daniel Kahneman and
his colleague Amos Tversky could have
won a Nobel Prize Amos didn't live to
receive it so Daniel took it and the
Nobel Prize was for creating something
called behavioral economics experimental
evidence that in opposition to classical
economics which claims that man is a
rational decision-maker Oh contraire
behavioral economics says I'm sorry man
as in people we do not make decisions
rationally lots of data lots of
empirical evidence so please read the
book if you have not and also anything
by Dan Ariely my favorite behavioral
economist
it's not happy news but the summary is
we're not rational decision makers and
so I hope at least that's the purpose of
the talk is to say there is a better way
so the thing that it is pointed out in
thinking fashion Lo is that we had a
series of what are called biases this is
the worst one this bias says in essence
as soon as we believe anything then
something happens to our brain we
immediately install a little filter and
that little filter makes sure that we
only see we only hear we only read we
only pay attention to that information
that substantiates or confirms our
belief so my favorite experiment that
demonstrates the confirmation bias is
one where two groups of people who
disagree on some contentious issue say
abortion rights or gay marriage we've
got a lot of contentious issues right
now both groups were given the same
paper and the paper contained evidence
the paper contained data the paper
contained science the paper contained
logical argument both groups read that
same paper and the conclusion that both
groups came to that they both reached
was this paper supports my point of view
how is that possible if they disagree
how could they read the same paper and
conclude
that the paper supports their point of
view now that experiment has been
repeated a number of times with varying
kinds of contentious issues but the
result is always the same it speaks to
the power of the filter once that filter
is in place you don't see evidence to
the contrary or if you allow yourself to
see it you dismiss it I don't want to
hear it and so I don't I don't hear it I
don't see it I'm able to filter it out
that seems bad enough then what we'll do
is we'll make up a story oh well I saw
that data but you know that sample size
it wasn't big enough to really prove
anything oh yeah I did notice they
reference that study but you know that
university they never do anything that's
worthwhile we'll make up a story we'll
explain it we will say in the very
convincing way why we chose to ignore
the data we did and why we accepted the
data we did it's our little narrative
it's our vision of what reality is all
about and everybody does that it's what
gets us through the day actually and
then we build on that with something
called the backfire effect because when
we have to go through all that work of
exercising that filter we become even
more convinced that our position is
right
so being exposed to any kind of evidence
that our point of view is wrong will not
only know
convinced us that we might be wrong it
will instead lead us to be more firmly
entrenched oh my god
so have I given you enough so that maybe
you'll put aside the logical argument
what do you know no I haven't because
you've discounted everything that I've
said that you didn't like and so
therefore your thing and she doesn't
know what she is talking about oh my god
the woman is 75 years old it's a wonder
she can even read so why should I listen
to her so anything you don't like that I
say you do you see what's going on here
I think it's pretty scary but also
interesting because we are really
uncomfortable when we see two
conflicting ideas we just can't do that
there's something in us it says wait a
minute I can only hold on to one view of
reality I can't just say on the one hand
this could be good on the other hand I
can't do that well these are things
we're stuck with and I don't want to say
that it's bad to be one of those
resisting kinds of people in fact I
think it's good to have some people
around who disagree I certainly wouldn't
want to advocate that we all agree on
everything that is not the path to
greatness we got to have some people who
are and I don't mean the proper choice
of word makes a real difference here but
to me it does that I want somebody
around who is a skeptic somebody who
asks good questions somebody who's
interested in finding a better way
somebody with an open mind and an open
heart who can add to the discussion
instead of saying well this looks like
everybody is going this way so let's
just do it I don't want somebody who's
negative for the sake of being negative
but a skeptic very valuable so my goal
is that we shouldn't all be joining
hands and singing Kumbaya it's that we
want to ask good questions in a seat
seeking for the better way so you knew
this was coming I hope it took ten years
of my life to write fearless change with
my good friend Marilyn Manson in it I
discovered something about patterns
obviously but somebody suggested that
the reason why the patterns work so well
is that there's evidence there's
scientific evidence that backs up the
patterns and it comes from something
called social psychology which I had
never heard of twenty years ago the
study of groups how groups make
decisions how groups do anything the
looking at influencer strategies and
finally evolutionary biology to say we
have evolved from a collection of
hunter-gatherers who spent tens of
thousands of years doing things a
certain way we can't undo that we're
stuck with it and then another book came
out ten years later and so I'm going to
go back and pick out some of those
patterns looking at them through the
lens of the latest cognitive
neuroscience and I hope give you some
better ways so they are all essentially
sub patterns of the name of the book was
called fear less change and the pattern
is called fear less because when we find
somebody we disagree with the reason our
natural inclination is to go into
conflict mode or battle position is
because we are afraid we're afraid of
listening to or being attacked by
someone who doesn't agree with our ideas
I also heart them
back to Stephen Covey's book who said
listen listen with intent to understand
not with intent to do battle so the
first piece of advice I'm going to give
you is to have a nice clear rational
argument you're saying wait a min Linda
you just told us that this isn't any
good why should we do this rational
argument not effective for influencing
people that's right that's right but
what we do know about people is once
they have been influenced or how they
have made up their mind or they decided
on some issue they need to explain it
they need to explain it to themselves
they need to explain it to other people
and they need to do it in a nice clear
logical fashion so if you have this in
your pocket my idea is a great one and
here's why then when they're ready when
they've been influenced then they can
use that to explain to other people into
themselves why they made the decision
even though you and I both know it has
nothing to do with it what's the name of
that process by the way after you've
decided something then you explain it to
somebody else and say well here's why I
decided to do this it has a name anybody
know it's called rationalization it's
the nice elaborate so why did you take
this job why did you marry this person
why did you decide to come to Chicago
well because I and out comes the nice
logical argument which you now know has
nothing absolutely nothing to do with
the real reason why you chose to do any
of those things but it's handy so you
need it so prepare that first
the problem is that's where we usually
stop we get that nice clear logical
argument we make our PowerPoint
presentation and we say that's it bring
everybody in we can go through those
nice bullet points and that will
influence them and we know now I hope
that that does not work in fact you
could see the backfire effect in action
so this was the only tool in your
toolbox just have it in your back pocket
have it ready the pattern you need is
called personal touch
because everybody who comes to talk to
you whether you think you're ready to do
battle or not is asking one question and
then as why should I do this
why should I support that political
candidate why should I choose that
particular development environment why
should I vote for that programming
language what's in it for me and that's
your job is to understand what that
person is thinking and what they're
feeling and what it will take to move
them in the direction you want to go and
what we know from this very old study
that was done by M Rogers that
regardless of what the new idea is
people are going to have set responses
that in a population of people a very
few are going to be excited about
whatever your idea is just because it's
new it's the newest coolest thing and so
therefore the people who are called the
innovators they get all excited and
he'll say yeah sign me up you don't have
to do anything
they are the low-hanging fruit the next
group well they do want to see that
logical argument not because it's
convincing because they know they're
going to need it and they want to read
thing about it or hear something about
it they want more information now the
biggest problem the people in this room
have is that that's where they stop they
think the world is made up of those two
groups of people because usually that's
all you think about and you're probably
one of those when it comes to technical
things you're an innovator or an early
adopter but if you'll do the math you
can see what a small percentage of a
normal population that is I've never
seen a normal population by the way
maybe someday I will but I do live in
Nashville so what we forget is that
there's that big chunk in the middle the
early majority in the late majority over
two-thirds of the people we are ever
talking to are not interested in new
things and they never will be until
somebody they know somebody they know
pretty well is doing it is happy with it
talks about it and then they start to
think well you know my brother-in-law
did buy that brand of car and he was
pretty happy with it
so maybe I might think about it and
there is nothing you can do to change
that I talked to people in a lot of
organizations who are all trying to move
to something well we're going to go
Angela or they're going to go lean or
they're going to get some new
development environment and they have a
goal that says we are all going to do
that well unless it's a really tiny
organization you are never all going to
do anything some people are always going
to be ahead the innovators the early
adopters some people are always going to
be behind
they're going to be slow they might
pretend to do it but they're really not
doing it and then you have the big chunk
in the middle and just when you think
you've moved them in a given direction
you haven't gotten rid of that normal
distribution it's always going to be
with you so live with it you can't get
rid of it there's no way you can destroy
it realize that you're always talking to
the innovators and early adopters in the
beginning they get excited there's a big
chunk in the middle it's going to be a
little slow but they're waiting for
everybody else to make a move and then
the people at the end think about it
those are really those are not people
those are both our roles and that
sometimes we play the role of innovator
in a given situation sometimes we play
the role of innovator in another
situation but sometimes we might be a
laggard so we wear different hats when
it's appropriate there's definitely a
correlation with age the older you are
the less route you are open to change
the bigger the organization the more
likely you are to have people who lag
behind and I guess if we asked the
question why would we be hardwired to
have this behavior the answer has to be
something like it must have been good
for our survival not to have everybody
get all excited about some new idea it
must have been good for our survival
to have most people say wait a minute
I'm not sure we should head off in that
direction we don't really know what's
over there let's be a little cautious
about that of course we want some people
who are innovative and
and adventuresome but if we all did that
I think the evolutionary message is
pretty clear that if we all got excited
if we were all innovators if we all said
let's go that way
then maybe we wouldn't be here today
that was the decision our ancestors made
to say hold it
most of us were a little on the
conservative side so this is about
morality
these are usually I try to recommend
books that I think are pretty easy to
read I know you how many of you still
read real books look at that well no
wonder you're so smart all 25 of you so
these are pretty heavy going I picked
them up when I made that decision to
work on this talk and it was kind of
fortuitous I think if I you know maybe
God is watching out for me I don't know
it's a blend Oh reduced to Birds the one
on the left is by fella named Jonathan
hight and he's done a lot of research on
how people who say they are liberal and
people who say they are conservative how
they think and more than that what this
might have to do with an evolutionary
explanation for those two points of view
and the book on the right has to do with
the evolutionary basis for morality how
we behave toward one another how we
treat one another and what that might
mean in an evolutionary sense so I
recommend the boat so the one on the
Left proposed something called moral
foundations theory and this was very
helpful to me because I felt like I had
to start having conversations with my
friends
neighbors who I knew had not voted the
way I did in the election and I had to
have some way of communicating with them
and of course our initial response when
dealing with people who are resistant if
we don't go into fencing mode is to
forget that these people probably have
good reasons that maybe they have good
heart good intentions and just because
they don't see the world as I do
doesn't mean that we can't have an
honest conversation
so Jonathan Hite said you know you can
look at the way we see things as being
right or wrong our values and put them
in one of these six categories the first
one says we care about people being
harmed we will take care of other people
sometimes we want to take care of
animals the second one we care about
fairness fairness for our fellow human
beings no one should have to see a child
starve to death that's not fair
just because I was lucky enough to be
born in the United States
I have advantages that some people in
the rest of the world do not that
doesn't seem fair
sometimes number three Liberty I care
about freedom I don't want a dictator in
charge in my life telling me what I can
do and what I can't do
loyalty loyalty to my countries loyalty
to my team my group my neighborhood
authority we've got to pay attention to
the guy in charge well I try not to do
that too much these days
and then finally there are sacred things
that we care about sanctity now in his
research Jonathan Hite found something
very interesting which is if you are
someone who Classifieds himself as a
progressive or a liberal that you tend
to kill I mean you have all of those
values you care about all of those
things but your emphasis you place the
most weight on the very first to care
and fairness whereas if you are on the
conservative side you of course have all
of those values but you lean toward the
other four on the list you care more in
other words about liberty Authority
loyalty sacredness now in the
experiments that Jonathan hight has done
he brings in groups of people and he
tests them to find out whether they're
liberal or conservative he explains the
nature of these six kinds of values and
he says you know if you're going to have
a conversation and you know this person
is a liberal or a conservative you need
to realize that their set of values
Falls more into a pattern that might not
be the same as yours and then he asked
people to create arguments based on the
assumption that they'd either be talking
to a liberal or to a conservative to see
what the difference would be and its
recommendation was think about those
values those are genuine do this with an
open mind an open heart
so here's a sample so message number one
we should take pride in our military
which unifies us both at home and abroad
this is an argument for increased
military spending so can you see the
basis for that argument we should take
pride in our military which unifies us
both at home and abroad what values do
you see in there I know you've forgotten
the list already but can you see loyalty
there Authority even argument number two
in the military the poor and
disadvantaged can achieve equal standing
by ensuring they have a reliable salary
and a future apart from the challenges
of poverty and inequality can you see
the fairness and care in that argument
now increase military spending is
something that conservatives will vote
for I didn't it doesn't matter what kind
of an argument you use so in this
experiment conservatives were convinced
no matter what but liberals convinced by
number two so do you understand what
I've been saying so far two groups
different set of values if you're going
to have some influence over them then
you need to think about those values
when you talk to the two groups so here
is a discouraging result of the
experiment to ask people to realize all
right I'm a liberal here are the values
I care about I'm a conservative here the
values I care about and they said now
create an argument for something you
care about
but don't you
your values use the values of the other
side and they couldn't do it even when
they were going to be paid for it they
couldn't do it so what that says is that
we don't just want to win the argument
we want that person to see the world the
same way we do we want that other person
who disagrees with us to have the same
vision of reality that we do it's not
enough just to win them over on military
spending or whatever the issue on the
table is is I want you to think the way
I think and even when I know that you
have a different set of values even when
I know that I have a different view of
reality than you I can't I can't use
your values in the discussion why is
that discouraging
that's so discouraging we don't like it
we find it awkward so I've tried a
couple of experiments little workshops
when I ask people to classify themselves
and I taught him about the values and I
said try to use the other set and I did
run into the same thing it's difficult
and in fact if you sit on one side or
the other and you read those two
arguments for increased military
spending probably one of those you
resonated with and the other you did not
we all have that we all it doesn't fit
in a match our store
worried so even now that you know the
evidence that you have the research and
you have the list see if you can
practice you can get better because I
think this is really what Stephen Covey
met if he had to hold of this research
he would have said Genesis that's what
I'm talking about
you got to sit in that other person's
clothing you got to be that other person
you got to think the way they think
that's what real listening real
understanding real influence is all
about that personal touch is being able
to for the sake of the argument to say
all right I'm going to try to understand
your values
so hard another thing that can be
convincing is to say all right I realize
you're having trouble with this idea but
you know I've got this great pattern
from fearless change that says you know
it's really hard to change people but
most people do like to try new things
if this isn't major commitment here
where does not have a little experiment
and we'll see whether we like it or not
most people are open to that ok well I'm
not sure what has really worked for our
team but I'm willing to give it a try
I'm willing to do a little experiment a
little trial run and if we don't like it
well we'll just go back to the way
things were before so the reason why
this is such an effective pattern is
well wait a minute let me ask you
another question how many of you have
ever bought a new car and when you went
into the showroom did they give you some
keys like here here take it around the
block is that what happened take it
around the block so why were they doing
that because there are nice people
and they thought it would be fun
wouldn't it be fun to just drive the car
around the block
yes well because the salespeople well
maybe they don't know maybe they have no
deep understanding of how this is a
pattern how this pattern works but it's
based on influencer strategies which say
if you do try it doesn't even have to be
a big thing just drive around the block
if you try something you are much more
likely to buy it when you go in for a
new jacket they say here try it on they
know you're much more likely to buy it
if you've just taken a little step in
that direction so once you try that
experiment you're much more likely to
keep on going so don't be afraid that
you're going to say to your team well
we'll just try it and then they'll
revolt afterwards and say we're not
interested in that no they're much more
likely to keep on going commitment and
consistency is the name of the
influencer strategy and the problem is
we're so reluctant to give up on our
idea thinking oh well of what if they
don't like it and this is really risky
isn't it and I'm not sure whether I want
to ask people to evaluate this or not
but realize that the influencer strategy
is very powerful behind trial run Oh
absolute best thing you can do if you
want to influence anybody whether
they're conservative or liberal is
listen and that is also hard sup a good
friend a neighbor who lives across the
street and that's what I practice with
him I listen in fact that's my test
every day to go across the street and
listen to Elden explain to me why it is
that Donald Trump is the best thing that
has ever had
and to the United States and that is a
severe test because all I ever do is say
oh I see hmm oh and you believe that all
I see hmm
so and you think that oh yes I see and I
was really gratified a week ago when I
overheard him telling another neighbor
who is also a trump supporter you know
Linda's okay she listens thank you
I have also tried this on Eldon but
doesn't work I stole it from Steve Jobs
what we know in English is if you want
to influence somebody or you want to
convince them of your idea or we say I
want to move you I want to move you we
also say I would like it if we both had
the same point of view and so this has
to do with standing and walking Steve
Jobs would come into somebody's office
and he would say hey let's go for a walk
and I think he knew that that was so
much more influential than just sitting
in an office facing someone with a desk
in between which is very confrontational
you don't have the same point of view
when you're facing each other but when
you're walking side by side you do have
the same point of view even better if
you say hey let me buy you a cup of
coffee so we'll have some food we will
share food at the destination how many
of you are married or whatever yes good
so I recommend this for any of those
intimate discussions that might be
contentious instead of facing off across
the kitchen table is say let's go for a
walk let's walk side-by-side let's hold
hands
blink arms put our arms around each
other share the same point of view why
you think we try to okay you can say
Linda said
and then from Benjamin Franklin Benjamin
Franklin had to deal with a contentious
member of the local legislature they did
not get along at all politics politics
politics so one day he went over to this
particular individual and he said I
wonder would you mind loaning me a copy
of this very valuable book that I know
you have in your library at the time
while Benjamin Franklin was the one who
said we should have libraries libraries
were in individual homes they were
precious and not everybody had a library
so what Franklin was asking was
considerable he wanted something really
valuable and he was asking it from
someone who disagreed with him on most
political issues of the day Franklin was
a pretty smart old dude actually he's
the reason we survived the Revolutionary
War II brought France and men well the
rest is history so the gentleman said I
guess I guess I couldn't loan you that
book do you remember that long series of
biases and one of them at the end was
cognitive dissonance we can't stand it
so I wasn't there at the time I know I'm
incredibly old but I'm not that old but
I think what was going on in his mind
was something like you know we've never
gotten along before but I'm loaning him
this very valuable book so maybe he's
not so bad maybe maybe he might even be
okay maybe
maybe we could even be friends and they
were until they died it's called the
Benjamin Franklin effect we usually
think of giving somebody something as a
way of convincing them but no ask ask
for something personal and then finally
this is a serious question if I'm having
a discussion with somebody and I'm not
sure this is really going anywhere even
though I'm pulling out all the patterns
I've got is there anything that I could
tell you is there something I could show
you any piece of evidence that I might
happen to have that could possibly
change your mind in there anything and
if the honest response is no then stop
stop the discussion that seems so
obvious doesn't it but here's the bad
part you have to ask that of yourself if
you go into the discussion and you have
to say honestly there is nothing this
person can tell me that would convince
me that Donald Trump is the greatest
president the United States has ever had
then you should stop because now what
you're saying is that confirmation bias
reigns supreme your mind is closed you
will not listen you're not open if
there's nothing anybody could say that
would change your mind and you have
already set those filters so firmly in
place
there is no hope so move on so I hope
you have a few little patterns not just
logical arguments
it's not an easy thing to do I think we
have to begin and I think we can't just
discard 50% of the people in this
country because they voted differently I
don't think that path will lead us where
we wanna go
you can try lots of experiments with
these of them they will work better for
you than others I like my last bullet
point here is the most effective things
we can do our primitive I have to do
with human touch being open sharing food
so I hope it hasn't been too weird and I
know you're really tired and you're
ready to go home and I appreciate it
thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
