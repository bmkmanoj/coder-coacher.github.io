subject so we'll just jump right into it
I'm going to go through a little bit
just my background so you know who I am
oh look at the landscape of multi touch
UI and some of the challenges I think
that's probably why you're here you know
what are the what are the things we're
dealing with as an industry and i hope
to root that really leads to a nice
discussion at the end some of the user
experience methods that we're using it
smart technologies looking at
multi-touch I'll share some of those
that i can and then i'm going to do a
little from to at the end from where we
are today where I think we need to get
to in terms of dealing with this new
user interface paradigm and then of
course a rich discussion as I mentioned
I'm first of all my background is
industrial design so I've worked in
future concepts interesting our speaker
this morning talked about the telecom
industry I spent a lot of my time with
nortel networks which doesn't exist
anymore but we were looking at future
concepts and you can see a couple of
examples up there and you go wow i wish
i wish i had a device like that with
that need interface and yes we thought
of that 20 years ago but for some reason
we thought we were the bosses of the
industry and things shifted so it shows
you a perfect example of the talk this
morning so that's a bit of my background
interestingly enough I was the
industrial designer on the world's first
calling line ID phone I know that dates
me a little bit but that's okay I can
deal with that but every single one of
you I would bet without a doubt has a
phone with a display right now this was
the world's first phone with a display
of any type there was not a sink well
they were used in pens LCDs were used in
pens to show the time and date and they
gave them away with time life
subscriptions and thing and or you had a
clock with a time and day but this was
an interesting turning point in user
interface this is where I got involved
with user interface design because we
had to this was information for the
first time
coming into a display and all of a
sudden we started going well what do we
do when five people call me oh no a list
we got to make a list oh we have a list
how do we move through a list and that
was the birth of user interface design
in devices so I've been living in this
world for a long time and now I'm at a
new point with this multi touch and I'm
going to share a few thoughts hopefully
that's one of the shortest BIOS you've
seen so let's just talk about
multi-touch first just a really simple
definition and I'm going to quote a few
people at bill Buxton and Daniel wig
door and jeff hahn some of the people
that are really working in this industry
in a research area it's basically
multiple points of contact okay
originally your points of contact with
the user interface we're usually a
button right or a mouse so as a single
point you can't have two mice all right
you can work with two mice but now you
can I think that's quite a shift and in
this case it's mostly with touch
surfaces which is all the rage of course
and so we need to talk about that
because sometimes all the rage makes us
do bad things so it's this whole notion
of multi-touch enables a lot of things
now first of all there's the multi-touch
gestures which of course you all know
how to do if you learn to do right and
it's really about using our bodies and
we'll talk about natural user interface
because we're all excited its natural
now I'm using my finger instead of a
mouse the other thing that it does salt
talk mostly about gestures but the other
things that it does is that we can use
other tools so now i can use pens i can
use erasers i can use other parts of my
body and goodness knows what's next but
more importantly and i'm going to talk
less about this and i'll refer to this
because this is really complex and what
we really don't know but it allows
multiple users to work simultaneously on
a surface because my company by the way
how many people know what a smart board
is so kids in schools or if you use
quite a few that's good so hopefully you
think it's reasonably usable if you
don't it was a product before I got
there we're working on things because we
on
stand and we're they'll talk a little
bit later about that this this idea of
multiple users though is very complex
and I'll touch on that as well so
hopefully these topics will be of
interest at smart user experience means
a little bit of a different thing
typically in organizations the user
experience group is the people that are
working on software I call it small UX
in a few companies and jakub Nielsen and
Don Norman have the same sort of the
opinion that I do that it's both the
hardware and the software working
together that is the whole experience
and so our group so I run a group of
about 15 people i have actually it's new
three years ago i was hired to build the
group we have industrial designers
graphic designers we have usability
people we have interaction designers and
then we have the mechanical graphic
designers so quite a neat mixture of
people in boy I wish I had some
psychologists sociologists etc but not
quite we'll we'll build to that so
that's what we mean user experience and
you can see by the by the initial images
here this notion of you know there's a
software that needs to support these
physical devices and so we can pick
colors and and so the software needs to
change at the same time as the hardware
so industrial designers user interface
designers need to work together you can
see on the left you probably haven't
seen that that's interactive flat panel
so it's basically an LCD panel that has
touch capability and inking capability
and so that's new for us we have a 55
inch that's just been announced we have
a 70 we're working on other sizes that
you don't know about yet so that's going
to be huge that's the future of
multi-touch large surfaces as Dave
mentioned our primary educate now is
education and you can see by that image
on the left this notion of multiple
users and that has big implications you
think about
you know to two children they don't
really know the rules of engagement they
both see a cookie and the teacher says
get the cookie and they both go to grab
it because right now our boards now
support multiple users they were just
single now they support multiple so in a
multi-touch domain do they both get the
cookie or does one guy get the cookie
and how fast does he grabbed it can the
other one grab it so you can see that
the physical world starts to not work
because there can be many cookies right
and you'll see later there's a diagram
of a table and I'll talk a little bit
about that whole multiplicity or the
challenge of the UI because if they both
get a cookie and both get put it back
are there now to you started with one
gets really interesting complicated one
of the other things is I don't know in
Europe but in in America what's
happening in Canada is school boards are
going oh they all have laptops and they
all have smart phones and iPads okay let
them use their own save money so all of
a sudden now we have this multiplicity
of devices coming into the classroom
it's called BYOD or bring your own
device very very popular so now we have
to have software that runs on all these
multiple devices so we have we have
something called notebook that's used on
the large format it now has to scale to
a smartphone never mind that it has to
be web-based and not this big fat
proprietary application that we have
right now and it needs to scale the iPad
and it needs to scale to a touch you I
so this previous mouse base you I we're
getting sort of challenged now that we
have to have this personal user
interface that's touch-based so you can
see the challenges we're starting to run
into and never mind that but the kids
are coming into school and they're
learning three to five years old they're
swiping and they're moving and they're
poking and they're opening and it got
all these things you know they know what
the blackberry prayer means all these
things and they're coming into these
classrooms with our big boards and
they're going swiping and doing all the
little things they were doing at
personal devices and it needs to scale
so we have this
a challenge and you'll see more about
that so that's the education mark market
and that's really you know working
towards consist consistency and the
teachers are all you know demanding it
of course and the students as well
what's new for us is business right now
in most businesses you're going to see
whiteboards flip charts right probably
projectors you go plug in your laptop
right you show your show your PowerPoint
you leave so we're working hard on that
space and integrating all those devices
and abilities so you can see there's
photographs of people working together
we work on we have that product and in
the bottom left there is a podium it's
touch-based and you can so now
manipulate and translate that up to a
board you can see it's starting to get
complicated things to people working
together both inking at the same time
moving moving objects at the same time
and again we have this challenge we have
these user interfaces on a very small
surface that we actually need to scale
so they need to work if somebody has
something on an iPad and now it's up on
the board is that the same gestures is
it the same kind of relationship with
that with that content very difficult or
if you start to write on a small surface
does it show up really big on the large
surface so that's the type of type of
interactions we're looking at so let me
get into some of that challenges or sort
of skirt it over some of them let's
really dig into them a little bit let's
talk a little bit about Windows 8
because it's been heralded as this
wonderful new touch base you I it's
going to pointing towards natural user
interface etc and what it does to us as
a large format so in a smaller format
makes sense there's tiles you can get
into apps and you know maybe they'll
develop and get into actual interaction
right now it's a you know basically a
launch pad but there are you know
developments in terms of making it
personal the interesting thing is we
just got certified we have a company
called next window that does our touch
touch kits for some of these touch smart
devices that comes from
our company and we've been certified now
but we only get certified up to 39
inches because the industry is being
driven by companies and personal devices
so nobody's worrying about these
large-scale interactions which of course
I do and that's my big challenge so you
can see myself here in the context of
one of our interactive whiteboards with
this big windows H which you can't scale
I took a gesture I tried to scale it so
it'd be appropriate in my field of
vision I can't even see the right side
of the interface so that's my challenge
as a group so we are working with
Microsoft I can you know tell you
exactly how we're working but we are
working with them on these large-scale
interface out of these sings scale
because this new digital whiteboards is
not going to go away in fact it's going
to be even more prevalent so that's this
whole context of the use of a UI that we
need to start thinking about things and
how they how they scale and perhaps new
new interfacer to new interactions the
other thing that's really tough for
there's a lot of different multi-touch
technologies and they enable a different
amount of touches so our boards enable
five so i can do have two people at the
same time doing two finger gestures or
two fingers or writing we can support we
can see a fifth touch because we have to
reject it because it will do funny
things in the interface if you if you
have another touch going but there are
others say on our table where we can do
40 plus touches right there's projective
capacitive like perceptive pixel pixel
that microsoft bought have a big 84-inch
bored with this projective capacitance
and it's multiple touches you have many
fingers and it's basically seeing all
those points of light right it's it's
part of me it's reading it on electric
grid so we can see all those touches so
you can do a lot of neat things problem
with that technology is you actually if
you need to write or have a pen you
actually have a tip switch or something
where it's saying okay I see a pen now
I'm not going to get too deep into this
because we'll head down a funny path
there are lots of things playing out in
the technology world in terms of
multiple touches etc the the iPads
projective capacitance at that sides
it's quite it's quite
it's a cost effective in a larger scale
it's very expensive like that board is
probably 100 and something thousand
dollars and they're to work on cost
reducing it our technology on our boards
is optical there's four cameras and we
could have more in each corner and it
can tell a difference and this is really
important it can tell the difference
between a finger and a pen our pens have
no batteries they have no anything they
are reflective and so what's really
interesting about that is we can
recognize the difference between pens
and fingers and most of these can't
unless you actually have power in the
pen that's important the other thing too
that I'm referring to is the difference
in operating systems and I'll
demonstrate why that matters there's
companies now and these are just icons
you can buy for your work in your UI
they actually sell them by the OS so
this is the start of my touchy subject
everybody thinks this is great but
everybody's rushing right now to have
their gestures and their kind of
software be the leaders so you can
actually buy the OS x different gestures
and i'm going to show you why that's a
problem gesture works you can buy code
right you can actually buy the gestures
very system centric so what we're seeing
out in our ecosystem is the people i'll
use a simple example they're using say a
rotate gesture as rotating another one
is using the rotate gesture to make
something bigger or smaller right
another one's using it to go between
boxes wow the same gesture is being used
in very different ways in very different
places so you can imagine somebody
coming into a business or a classroom or
going from device device and you're
having these gestures being used in a
different way this is the start of my
thing about our challenges it's all very
new and all very exciting but things are
very very different we've done a map
because we have to work across devices
and across different scale factors this
is just a part of it goes down for I
don't know how many rows and how many
rows but up up on the left side is smart
gestures the things that we're doing
then there's windows 7 we have windows
a we have the different apple iOS as
we're tracking all of them right now
we're just seeing variants everywhere so
just in here there are similarities and
I don't know if this is sort of your
steering wheel sort of your memes that
try to translate through the industry
okay everybody's using a steering wheel
will use a steering oh you know it's a
gas pedal on the right gas pedal on the
right okay everybody's doing a pan or a
tilt or a zoom and these are some of the
some of the things that are happening so
this is a you know us trying to track
them and we have to follow we've done
research where we're doing research on a
large format and the teacher will come
in and they'll see a big web page and
they go like this on or large boards
trying to scroll the whole web page
there's things that are people are
learning the Apple folks have done a
brilliant job of educating us to their
way of being right it's more than just
the kool-aid they are teaching us I mean
they're rich delicious ads are you know
people doing this and pop it's so easy
and life's beautiful and that it was
awful before but now you have us and I
think the important thing to realize
with this gestures are a language I they
require learning we are being taught
okay that's one thing by the people that
are actually building products that are
leveraging gestures their language and
their heart I don't know if you remember
learning your language but it wasn't
easy or learning my language or me you
know learning your light it's not simple
right but there are people that are are
teaching us and some of us in industry
are bar having to tag along my favorite
subject natural user interface sounds
lovely there's no such thing Steve
Ballmer stood up and said Harold the
natural user interface there is no such
thing we are taught how to interface
with people are different symbols I
don't want to start moving my hands and
things I might insult somebody but
that's the point there's different
gestures that mean different things in
different places there aren't natural
user interface and I'm going to talk a
little bit about this now it
it is a deflection point though we move
from command line interface to this
brave new world of goo ease and windows
icons menus and pointer tried the WIMP
and now there's this thing called a
natural user interface and I'd like to
talk about it in this way Rob cling some
time ago described a research community
in HCI as the missionary position right
which is a person face-to-face with
their computer and that's research so
this it's an awesome statement because
we've continued to work at it you think
about all the great usability lives in
the world you go visit them they have
gaze tracking they have clicked tracking
they have most tracking it's all about
one person and one device that's the
majority of the quantification of
people's experience with computing now I
think we need to move to these and we
have moved to these very rich interface
concepts where you can open things you
can be any place in the world you can
watch somebody you can put yourself up
in the world you can get two people
together in a conference very very rich
and I liken that that like it's very
engaging you're not just clicking on
content you're actually engaging with
content and so in collaboration with
people and sharing with people
especially in in my environment which is
the large scale large format where
people are actually working we are
actually working on technologies where
you are face to face with somebody in a
large format that is remote and several
people working together and I liken that
to needing to start to think about the
messages and the personality of the
interface that we're trying to develop
it's like a dance has a personality it
can bring out anger in you or it can be
a pleasure to watch and it's it's the
gracefulness of movements in the
interface and how what your reactions
are you'll know a good touch interface
and a bad one you'll know a good
engagement in a bad when we have
feelings and it's interesting I would
love to hire sociologists
anthropologists behavioral psychologist
so there any behavioral psychologists in
the room
in 10 years there will be because I
think that's where computing will start
to go we're starting to have
relationships with our devices we're
personalizing them we're customizing
them they're ours right it's really
becoming the part of us you know there's
a lot of people it's as a matter of fact
I bet everybody in here if I said try
and live without your device for a you
know for a week kidding it's part of me
all my stuffs in there are my friends
all my people that's a relationship
that's different than this that this
very cold clicking mice on things right
clicking mice etc let's talk a little
bit about methods some of the things
that we're trying as a company I don't
it'd be interesting discussion to hear
maybe there's people in this group that
can maybe share what they're trying to
do in this in this new world and you
walk up to an application now visual
application there's usually a box and a
blinking cursor you kind of know what to
do as you are out of range and coming
into the UI they actually sort of know
what to do we've been trained right you
see a box you see a radio button three
of them in a row I should hit one of
those right even before you interact
there's some signals affordance that's
given to you with gestures and
multi-touch and this is this is very
self evident when you see people using
their devices for the first time it's a
very hesitant poke try again you try
things right because there's no
affordance to tell you what to do next
so that's my eye ? there we haven't
quite figured out when you out yet then
the interesting thing is once you touch
this notion is the object should somehow
move to show it's been selected
especially in a large scale and then
when you move it the system responds by
moving it to where you want and then it
resets and you start again that's kind
of this Constantine model that we've
tried to use and then so my graphic
designers are struggling how do I show
somebody what's possible when they first
approached this user interface or
content what do you show them it's easy
when they touch it
we show them a bounding box we make it
glow where we make a move it's easy then
but that approach i think is an
interesting one what kind of language
are we going to come up with we've tried
things with grammar we have things like
global and local so if i have an object
on a big surface i can move the whole
surface which is global or i can move
something local and we have to make that
distinction it starts to matter as you
interact with multiple things on a
surface surface the other things we've
tried is this notion of nouns and verbs
their objects and actions so the thing
you pick now how do I show what the verb
is this grammar isn't new but we're
trying to do that in terms of touch and
how do you show is is there actually a
grammar or a language of interacting
that makes sense so you can see it's
sort of a deeper need since we're
engaging another sense of actually
creating some language around this and
then our biggest challenge is we also
have a communication aspect so it's not
just most of us our devices are very
it's very consumptive there's things
you're moving around consuming open and
grabbing we have this other thing of
annotating on a document for instance as
a communication and speaking as well and
how do you record the speech into the
document things like that so this it's
another level of engagement that can get
very it is a cognitive a lot of
cognitive load there another neat thing
we've tried it's I don't know has
anybody heard of an informants I didn't
make it up I don't think it's an
informative performance we use and it's
something that I'm trying to do with my
team the engineers snicker that this is
fine this idea of be the board be the
board and again I'm talking in in my
business but you could pretend to be an
ipad I suppose lay down on a desk I
don't know and be the board and somebody
comes towards you what do you do with
them so we're trying to do this with
this with this panel because it's
intimidating to get up in front of a
crowd
and you know start working at a board so
we thought what can we do to try and
figure this out so we had somebody
pretending they were the board people
would come up with up to them and they'd
say well what do you want me to do well
welcome me be nice to me it was really a
fascinating exercise and so what we came
up with on this panel it's a 55 inch LCD
panel because of energy savings it goes
that it goes to sleep right so when you
walk into the room it has proximity
sensors and this is this notion of
before you get to an object so it has
sensors and as I come in it senses me
right and it wakes up and it comes up
with a symbol which eventually right now
we're at an OSD layer we can't do very
much except just show an image but it's
touch me right and eventually we'd like
it to actually be a tutorial that it has
a little bit of a video possibly where
it's not only touched me but it might
demonstrate maybe some of the
interactions or manipulations you can do
so we think maybe we can have sort of
this built-in tutorial to our welcome
screen but it's really neat going
through the process again this
informants idea is really neat it's
really fun like that tech technique a
lot now a little bit about what's next
because I think we're just touching the
surface this is a technology chart that
shows multi-touch at the top so this is
this idea of reading multiple touches
which I mentioned it's great achievement
but there's so much more you can see
down the left this notion of sensing
people and some of your probably experts
in these other enablers software agents
there's going to be things like
permissions things like the whole notion
of speech as we know speech as has it is
on a bit of a journey but it might
happen in a personal in a personal space
we don't know but it'll be another
another aspect i can imagine myself
muttering at a board and something
happens i'm not sure what but the notion
of augmented reality and we are working
on things like that how do you
show somebody that is remote and in a
collaboration session with you how do
you actually show them as an avatar more
appropriate than a real you know
everybody's all we got to do 1080p well
some people don't want to be seen in
1080p for instance right so we're
looking at things like that as well so
we are looking at you know what is the
future and even even touch feedback or
haptics very important so in terms of UX
and I don't know how many UX
practitioners are and therefore this is
of interest but here's some things that
we're thinking about and that I'm
thinking about the notion of clickable
the touch wolves happened I think that
will be the future of interfaces we know
that is very quick to move through data
and through spaces using using touch and
there will be evolutions there as well
this notion of things being self-evident
not sure that we can get to sort of
gestures and touch being self-evident
and that's that approaching point it's
pretty hard for something to show all
that it is capable of doing but like
anything is it discoverable learnable
and memorable I think after a while
actually one of my fellows that I still
use an old-time mobile he said I just
with a bit of work you can learn you
know this android thing it's kind of fun
but you kind of spent some time you got
to invest time i thought no i don't i
needed to be really easily discoverable
easily learnable and easily memorable
and s'matter of fact you shouldn't have
to memorize it'll just become easy to
use this notion of being responsive you
click on something it doesn't does
something I was going to use the word
predictable here but predictable has a
lot it's a loaded type of thing and
you're seeing that with text and you're
seeing that with searches and you're
seeing that with you know you're
shopping and your preferences in some of
the social media where things are
predicting what you might like but I
think sensing this notion of and I'm not
even sure what that means that it knows
what you want to do that it actually
knows what interface you want that you
can actually start to really personalize
to how you behave and how you work not
how a software engineer decided to think
that maybe you should work because they
tested five
people right then this notion of here to
everywhere I think has happened as well
where it used to be that you had in the
cloud from my days the cloud was
something where you knew there was a
bunch of boxes and wires and you drew a
thing because somebody else knew all
that now it's a service and a branded
service which is really awesome and so
that's that everywhere part that you can
download things to different devices to
your large screen in your living room to
your place of work to your small device
to your car right your same piece of
information is showing up everywhere and
of course the multi-touch interface will
play out there and then this whole idea
of that something is usable we have
techniques for usability I think yannis
going to talk about some of those we
still use all those some of these other
things we're trying to you know sort out
in this shift you know maybe there's
other ways we need to behave so
usability i think is table stakes people
won't put up with something that does
doesn't do what they want to want to do
but i think those things having
personality and that that will play out
more and more over it a little over the
next little while i think they'll step
out and luma little bit i don't find
that the Apple interface has a
personality I think they've glorified
their lists and menus etc made them very
visual and I won't even get into their
skeuomorphism business because that
drives me crazy you know what
skeuomorphism is is this replication of
reality in the digital world I think
that's a barrier to us doing really neat
and interesting things for instance if I
I'd showed a picture of a table earlier
and we learn by watching children if you
have one card in the middle and they all
want it and they all take it's a fight
so we allow them all to have one and
like I said then they all put them back
and there's five of them now it really
gets complicated because we have the
physical world they seeing a card if it
was perhaps a colored square maybe they
all wouldn't want it right maybe they
take turns or something so looking at
things in a more pure and graphic way I
think is a better way to go so this is
the touchy part
I think multi touch and touch interfaces
are just super popular is like
everybody's talking about it they're
hyped are they really useful I think
time will tell I think we need to decide
that I think it's obviously easier than
carrying around a mouse with your
smartphone makes a lot of sense and
perhaps the not that's the natural part
is that you don't need something else I
think you know it's very cool now I
think we're all enamored I see people
futzing with their things and there oh
right still but you know what maybe it's
valuable enough we're willing to put up
with a little bit of grief like the
first cell phones big bricks drop the
call when you walked around a tree it
certainly couldn't put it in your pocket
but there was enough value and being
mobile to close things to be secure etc
that well you all have one in your
pocket right but the first ones were
just a disaster so some of this i think
touch UI and these multi-touch
challenges i think there's enough value
into this new interface type that think
it will continue right now companies
like myself like like ours and Apple
Microsoft we're all doing our best
nobody's doing anything to try and make
things hard to use we're all working in
our areas on on gestures and multi-touch
ideas of sharing and collaborating and
working together but there are no
standards there aren't any sort of
groups that are working together to
really try and sort this out right so
that there's one steering wheel for
everybody and a red light means stop etc
so i think you know that's that's an
area is that possible I sure hope so and
night
hi everybody knows that when you're
sitting at a desk top using a mouse and
keyboard that if you do that every day
you might rip your shoulder your risk
everything what are the thoughts on
economics when it comes to smart boards
because I can see how waiting in your
arms round like that eight hours every
day yeah we do consider that and first
of all pcs are bad for you they're bad
for your eyes are bad for your wrists
are bad for your shoulders right bad for
your ego sometimes but we we take that
seriously we do economic studies like
the weight of our pens in the state you
know we could sell it as Count
calisthenics I suppose it could be a
feature but we do take that seriously
and another there's that there are
commands for instance in Windows 8 where
you swipe from the bottom to the top or
from top to bottom to move between
things it's just not possible and these
off-screen leaves off screen bezel
swipes well you're walking over here to
try and bring something in and over here
and ever so like we know there's
economic issues with that so we look a
lot at heights of where we're working
like our new UI is going to shift to
something that probably a floating you
know possibly floating to us some things
that's in your field of vision that's
the other thing as well most of our
interfaces aren't that great right now
they're they're really and mostly
because of the the the application
coding environment they're basically
still toolbars so it's a large PC screen
in a way so they aren't great
ergonomically for instance a woman that
needs to touch an icon way up top like
maybe your shirt comes up and it's not
great like it's a man as well so there's
we do think about that but most of it
most of the use is in small blasts you
know half hour one hour it's usually not
all day
what's the life and you are working with
the alcohol board and of course is
cheaper than those capacitive do you
think leaving its future technology or
will be based on one's capacity that's a
good question like right now there are
advantages of both the optical as i
mentioned does give you inexpensive
ability to create other tools their
passive they don't have batteries or not
expensive is very inexpensive in terms
of other tools for writing so I think
that's one advantage so that whole we
call it object recognition is is a
benefit and I think it'll be inexpensive
for a while the notion of putting down
thousands and thousands of you know
electric you know conductive just call
them strips to give you that capacitance
grid to read capacitance I think I think
somebody also come along before that
cost reduces to the point at a large
scale but I can't be predicted it might
be somebody going on a lab someplace
somewhere that I don't know if but i
know the use of light is probably the
way to go rather than a physical medium
yeah we do and and you know that it's an
excellent question actually that that's
a very thoughtful question also colors
of different skin colors and also finger
polish and the shininess of fingers and
so we deal with all those things we
design our pens so that they're
comfortable for children our pens in our
business size are a little bit heavier
and a little bit different so we really
work hard we do a lot of research
directly with with children and adults
etc so yeah good question we definitely
do that and then it's a challenge for
our optical sensors to actually know the
difference and then again this is
especially for children and a pen you
can imagine they're both the same size
and an adult the figure is big enough so
definitely tuning the software for that
yeah so that that's another area all
together where you get the sort of
gestures in the air and off board
gestures it's another area we're looking
at and watching pardon me
I've trusted a good job like machine
learning into it the ability to record
high skeletal system and you have a lot
of likeability that just like the tech
shift yeah yeah balance absolutely
something and I think vision vision
systems are really huge especially you
know for Dave to walk up and I to walk
up to to a device and it knows it's us
because that I mean most of us have RFID
tags that we walk in and swipe well
that's already a database and if I if my
vision system can recognize my basic
shape for instance you know way i go i
get my interface in my network drives
etc that's right exactly and that's what
connect is doing right yeah there's
there's a lot of work being done there
so we're following that obviously
the other kinds of feedback about from
visual level you at this point we're
wrestling with the multi-touch and
collaboration like I say the multiple
user aspect the idea of the gestures is
less of a I'm not saying it's not a
challenge there's still notions of you
know latency and speed and continuous
compound gestures and things we need to
work on that are not simple pro
programmatic but are in a programming
area the other areas will come I think
this is still fairly new absolutely and
we were very much about that disability
space so that's the neat thing about
object recognition that somebody can
work with their elbow because we can now
say that's a pen so a person with no
fingers can actually write which is
really awesome and that's really seen as
very positive we can I mean that has its
problems as well in our software because
it gets confusing with two people
because one person's finger is a pen and
the other person's pen is a pen and I
will we get into the complications but
yes we can do that for that very reason
teacher said look I have disabled kids
that can't can't work and this is I
think a wonderful thing about that
technology you see any emergency
standards I mean with gestures we're
also part of the research project of the
same name project trying to look at this
but trying to just figure out what a
reasonable gesture vocabulary are even
have a common set of gestures just seem
to be
there doesn't seem to be a will at the
moment I know that everybody's you know
taking their own directions and taking
care of their own because it is new just
a challenge of getting things working
and etc so I think it may happen maybe
it doesn't need to like I don't know if
there were standards made from the car
automobile industry that there was a
long pedal on the right and a square one
on the left and that one you hit and it
made your car slowed down I don't know
if somebody got together and said around
the world we will have the same controls
on our cars so do we need to I mean
we're seeing in our big chart there are
similarities so I think it would be a
good idea and I don't know if our
company's the right one delete it been
anyway alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
