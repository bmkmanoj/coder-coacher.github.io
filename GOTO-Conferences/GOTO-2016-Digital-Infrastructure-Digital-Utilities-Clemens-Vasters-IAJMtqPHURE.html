and I'm the architect for messaging in
the azure platform so I'm a cloud guy
and I've been doing this for the last
about nine years of my 10-year career at
Microsoft before this I've been doing
also distributed systems I have been
around in the solar world for a while
and so I'm very happy I did this talk
yesterday at the same time about
microservices messaging distributed
architecture so I'm very happy that the
thing we did 10 years ago is now hip
again I think that I've started working
on about four years ago or five years
ago was the Internet of Things and how
that relates to Microsoft how that
relates to us and how that really
relates to cloud what the what the
attach point there is and we've
meanwhile shipped some product i'm going
to tell you very little about the
product at the end of the talk but
really what I want to do with you is
kind of speculate a little bit about the
future because we have a lot of drivers
out of the IOT which are right now a
little fuzzy and like what this is all
about and a lot of what we see in the
trade press certainly in you know
TechCrunch and gizmodo and all those
places is little consumer devices which
are not very interesting I leave at
least not for me because I'm about know
for me the future is something that's a
connected that's about connected systems
that we're leveraging all those devices
all the stuff that we can go do now
through this Hardware revolution so
through hardware becoming more
accessible easier to build that we can
go and and and connectivity being cheap
that we can build some more interesting
things so nurses there's a there's our
kind of running gag a meme almost with
this massive pyramid of human needs
self-actualization esteem social needs
safety security susie illogical needs
kind of that and then and then you have
underneath that Wi-Fi as the most most
important thing so that's
a meme that's going around the internet
it's interesting if you look at this
pyramid like seriously from a what that
means in terms of you know what do
services satisfy that we have that we
use you can actually use this in a very
serious fashion so let me try that
there's a border here between physiology
physiological needs air shelter
buildings heat energy wade waterways
food sleep Satan security security
physical security safety stability
protection order law all those things
that are just the foundation for our
lives and then above that line is kind
of all the social stuff right
interconnecting between people there's
pure a sustaining life and not dying
because there's anarchy and then there's
what makes life worth living above that
if we think about what internet services
do today what services we use most of
them all sit above that line they're
about our social lives there are about
our business lives they're not really
about foundational things that make our
life worth living that are and they're
sorry they're not about that keep us
alive they're about what makes life
worth living that's all tools and toys
under that is infrastructure and the
infrastructure is the piece that I found
actually most interesting about the IOT
and for me that's the line that I draw
between the web and the line that I and
what I OT really means IOT is about
ultimately about security safety and is
also a driver for a lot of those things
so here's what I think about as
infrastructure a big collection of stuff
that we can go and use digital services
to make better so there's city buildings
energy health mobility and then
underneath that I just pick energy
electricity distribution wind solar
geothermal gas distribution fuel
distribution power plants nuclear waste
coal mining oil gas production
exploration all those things are
foundation are fundamental for us to be
able to sustain our society to sustain
human life and that's true for the city
is true for all these different scopes
these are all very interesting areas
where we can use digitalization to
optimize to get more transparency to
monitor for me that's where it's at in
IOT it's not the Arduino that knows
what's on TV and when your favorite show
comes it beeps right that's a thing on
the internet and it may also be
interesting but it's not internet of
things in the way I look at it so what
can we do as well software people to go
and make the world a better place how
can we go and make those strengths those
systems better more efficient how can we
get more brains on this planet because
ultimately you know we're doing where my
head and my brain your brain your brain
takes about 20 watts it's a super
computer right Google try to move alpha
go beat and got beaten once by a human
who ran on 20 watts with I don't many
how I don't know how many thousands of
course they was they spent on this a
ridiculous amount of energy we have a
super efficient supercomputer in our
head it would be great to have more of
those super computers on earth and be
able to go and sustain a nice life
because I think overall we would get fur
much further than with trying to replace
all those super computers with AI which
runs on less capacity for more energy
uptake so there's a ton of opportunities
here process optimization in industrial
automation in logistics energy
management environmental protection
security safety and I'm going to walk
you through some examples of stuff that
exists and also point I'll also point
out that none of these things very few
of these things are really standardized
and certainly none of those things are
standardized in a way that the world
could take to take them but there's a
ton of good ideas and I think we're
going to go and see consolidation in
those in a lot of those areas the first
one
is in this last talk of this track is
the one that we started with in the
keynote this is an autonomous car well
it's actually a highly automated car
highly automated is this car is capable
of driving itself completely without
anybody holding hands in a very reliable
fashion and arguably probably better
more reliable than the Tesla certainly
by the but judging by the pictures that
we saw on an Autobot there is no
spinning nonsense that's kind of up the
lidar that's up on the roof for $250,000
this is a stock production golf that has
been modified by iav autumn automotive
engineering who are a company that
usually don't hear about but they are
building active safety systems for a lot
of customers that they have and their
customers are OEMs so it's quite
possible i know that in my car there is
a technology from them and there's quite
possible that in new york car there's
also technology from them which helps
with active safety systems active safety
systems the first wave has already
arrived you may have seen ad ads in the
on TV where the Mercedes guys are
claiming they can no longer run over a
car this is one wonderful little
commercial with the kids trying to run
the cars into each other in the living
room they can't automated automated
breaking is the first step towards that
that is now existing in BMWs and Audi's
and Volvo's and all those breaking
assistance already there what they do is
something that we heard about this
morning they will and this is something
that is it amazes me that the Tesla
actually ran into that accident all of
those cars when they have a front facing
camera and radar systems are going to be
required actually from next year to have
automated breaking automated breaking
means if the car can see that there's
something in the way it has to break
automatically and it needs to make that
decision in the right time so that's
what's interesting about this is why I
bring this up in this context is because
the only thing that drives sales of of
those
cancer systems the only thing that
really motivates automated driving is
safety that's why it's all happening and
that's what people buy and active safety
systems and driver assistance systems is
the number one option that people buy
for vehicles so right now when you buy a
little latest generation audi or BMW or
any of those cars the options that are
most chosen are these are the driver
assistance systems so that's a
significant market driver and it will
all end the assumption is that they just
get better we already have lane-keeping
and we have site assistance and we have
radar radar guidance we are kind of
already down the path of autonomous
driving but most of that is really
motivated by safety safety health has to
do with looking around the environment
so there's a number of services that are
interesting that way we have I have to
hear from Microsoft Research one is your
city city noise that's part of the New
York City 311 platform and people can
report into that platform when things
are too loud on our block so that the
noise pollution in a city in a massive
Burton urban area like New York City is
stays under control that's an i
insulated solution that works just for
New York City but it's part of the
official platform of the the information
platform of the city so that noise
pollution can be reported noise
pollution is also also automatically
reported there's microphones in the area
so that the city then can go and react
and see what the noise pollution comes
from beijing is not a very happy place
to live in for unfortunately many times
of the year people who are going there I
mean of the millions of people who live
there but people go there report that
they have hard time breathing because
Beijing is terribly polluted and it's
dangerously polluted there's measures
being taken right now but to take
measures you actually have to know kind
of what's going on and so there's an
urban air project also run by microsoft
research
which gives a fairly accurate i am
probably have to go here you go a fairly
accurate picture of what the current
quality is in beijing so this is live
data oh oh you don't huh interesting oh
because because hang on sorry this is me
no duplicating the screen because
usually I do and now I gotta go and
fumble this okay so this is this is a
fishing even though you see this in
German here it really is Beijing because
it this is chrome being trying to he'll
be helpful and translating the Chinese
for me well thank you very much and so
that's the effect of the pollution the
pollution factors and so you can go and
kind of click into areas here on that
map and kind of get the yeah but not if
ya not if chrome is getting in the way
of this ok so that's that's kind of the
the air pollution indices for you know
that corner in Beijing so they have
effectively a network of pollution
sensors that are set up through the city
so that there's transparency about what
the pollution let of what the pollutions
level pollution levels are let me get
this out of the way again usually around
with duplicated screens but the
gentleman here told me that I shouldn't
so that's the cost of that ok ok there
we go another one is and this exists in
many cities now I'm not going to go to
the to the websites again but I have
screen copies of most of them on the
slides a traffic management dusseldorf
so that's close to where i live i live
near much grappa in germany so just over
the border from velo and so the city of
dis Olaf they have a city the city
management has a very accurate database
geo database of current events current
traffic situations they have a forecast
of what's going on so if any of the big
venues the sports venues concert venues
etc if they have events
they have all of that in that database
and that's if you think about the
autonomous driving if you think about
automatic routing of buses and all these
things that's all information you need
to have you need to know what's going to
happen tomorrow so you can go and
optimize for traffic all right so this
is a database that they maintain that
you could leverage and that has all
current information the problems that
there's that there's no standard for
this so that's starting in Seattle and a
number and number of other cities
there's a project that I like quite a
bit called one bus away one bus away is
a nonprofit organization that is trying
to patch up but the City of Seattle
can't fund or the King County is the the
region effectively around Seattle the
problem in America is that public
transport is not very much in favor in
if some money needs to be needing knee
is needed for something it usually gets
cut out of the budget of probably
transportation so bus transport gets
worse not better and one of those things
that they could not fund is kind of this
real-time information network to know
what happens where and which bus is
where so one bus away is actually built
this so that the real-time information
about which buses where is needed for
monitoring the buses so they're tapping
into this and they're providing
effectively for the writers they're
providing real-time information which is
really well done about where buses are
and that's a research project by the
University of Washington University of
South Florida Georgia Tech and that also
existed Atlanta and some other cities
where they are effectively patching up
the university's patching up the
deficiencies of the public
transportation systems which is
interesting but also very sad so what
can you do with creating transparency on
routes so one of the things we have on
microsoft campus is a pretty clever
model for how we go and do we get around
on campus campus is a little city it
stretches over
I would say about a kilometer or I don't
want to probably want to have kilometers
by two kilometers it's fairly large and
there's like 100 buildings and so
getting from one place to the next for a
meeting within five minutes is kind of a
big deal and they used to be fixed
routes bus routes are get when they're
on campus and now it's kind of a pier
there's still a notion of a route but
it's mostly peer-to-peer traffic and so
we have something that's similar to this
year which is I made these slides first
and then I actually found out that the
system that we have on campus is kind of
like this so it's interesting so you
have people who are waiting at a but at
a bus stop on a route I want to go this
way and you have people who go want to
go this way and you have people who want
to go that way and you have buses what
you can do now is if you know how long
it takes from usually takes from and to
each stop and it's Sunday morning then
you can go and start cutting corners if
you have public transportation in in the
busiest time you really want to go your
route because then you can't predict it
but in off times you can go and start
cutting corners if you can't can't
create transparency on the on the bus
stops and creating transparency on the
bus stops is a very simple IOT project
what do you need an infrared camera and
a button two buttons this direction that
direction maybe or this line or that
line and infrared camera why do you need
to have an infrared camera because first
they may be an old lady who doesn't
understand what the button stuff is
right so she owes just stand there for
two minutes and then you're like let's
press the button for so that's one thing
and then the other thing is there's the
eight-year-old boy who presses the
button runs away right no signal on the
referent camera we won't come so that's
kind of that's you can imagine that
being depth rating transparency on the
route and then you can go and do cut
corners and make the route more
efficient and get those people around
and that's actually what we do we
don't do the we don't have an infrared
cameras but we have receptionists will
help us kind of check in and you also
meanwhile there's an app they can go and
use and now even though we still have
routes the routes are cutting corners
because there is transparency now on
campus it also allows you to create ad
hoc stops right you have people who are
showing up and who are connected and his
say hey I'm here why don't you send a
bus in you know right by the route and
not necessarily here and that's
something that's certainly possible and
that's the how do you combine the
concept of uber or lyft which I like
more better with public transportation
because ultimately I don't think I I
think that public transport is going to
be become more on demand and is going to
make is going to be bigger competition
for the uber folks then certainly in
Europe then you know private drivers
integrate these ad hoc stops and then
obviously you can also dynamically route
so you have people who have a calendar
and they know exactly where they need to
be where and so you can go and correlate
it with the bus system and then you can
go and tell that person hey if you want
to get to your next appointment you want
to go and take the bus then you have to
get up now because right there was a
traffic disturbance so the bus is going
to take a little bit longer so you go
and integrate the scheduling with the
bus route and that's all required that
transparencies also required when you
think of a public transport because we
want to get to e mobility we want to get
to the point where we can actually go
and do electric charging for all those
cars certainly for public transports so
that we can get the use of fossil fuels
down because we a have to be because we
have to and creating creating an e
mobility will require that you have
loading stops you need to charge sort
charging stops that you monitor that the
charges on the buses more much more
tightly than you do that today with your
with your
fossil fuels that you need to go and
take buses out of circulation need to go
and put buses back in so you have it's
there's a lot more work that needs to be
done to make that e-mobility stuff work
and again for that that's the
infrastructure that's motivating because
that's you know preserving the
environment that's the infrastructure
will motivate a lot of the change of the
infrastructure towards that it's you
know what's the driver for autonomous
cars the driver safety for public
transport the driver will maybe
e-mobility like where's the money coming
from the the change towards the shift
towards renewable energy is something
that we in certainly in Germany take
enormously seriously stupidly seriously
some people say because we are in this
since we said no more nuclear and we're
abandoning all the nuclear plans and at
the same time we also don't want to have
any of the coal anymore then we're now
what else is there what else is left
it's an interesting puzzle to solve
ultimately renewables will be required
to do immobility I believe and the
reason for that is the transfer capacity
you need to have local you will need to
have local power generation close to
your charging stations in some way and
that's something that's easier to do
with renewables then to go and card all
the coal everywhere or you do little
nuclear reactors right the reason for
that is very simple you think about how
much energy is packed in a leader of
fossil fuel and you try to calculate
that out how much battery and how much
transfer capacity you actually need to
have on the wire that's pretty crazy
we're not even close on the current
electricity grids to be able to go and
do this and there's currently a lot of
talk about in Germany about creating
these big transfer transfer lines for
electricity from the North Sea down into
the south is that's going to take just
that those those transfer lines are
going to take another six
eight years to build and so I mobility
in the thirty five thousand dollar Tesla
for everybody it's not going to happen
until we've solved the energy issues and
the management that comes with it the
management that comes with it is
actually probably the more remarkable
one if you try a grid electricity grid
runs on voltage right high voltage
transfers voltage means that you have
affected tension in the system right
that tension requires balance in the
grid that balance requires that you have
have kind of about the same kind of
level of production from where you will
produce energy to consume to consume
energy you need to go and set that you
need to go and keep that up near new
boats are interesting because renewables
are not predict are not as predictable
also if you only have you know ten power
plants in your in your grid or twenty
versus having a solar collector on every
roof or in every farm that also produces
that also puts stuff into the grid now
the management of the of the grid
becomes much much harder and requires
information about who's producing what
and also prediction about what is going
to be produced the management becomes
much harder so here's a really
interesting case study by n Tsui and so
II is a organization that is a forced
marriage sometimes it looks like that
it's a it's a it's an organization where
the transfer the the operators of the
electricity grids cooperate in Europe
and they cooperate by about transferring
data between the operators to see how
much power is where and how it needs to
be distributed and they shift the
electricity effectively around around
Europe with their operational system so
that's they call tsos and that's how
they run
the European grid this case study here
is from last year in in March I believe
or May when we had a large solar eclipse
the solar eclipse happens in the morning
started at around eight-thirty and that
lasted as you can see on that graph
until about 11 and the Delta between the
normal between the normal uptake of
energy and what was available as energy
capacity from renewables was 17
gigawatts when that solar eclipse came
around when the Sun was out so our ends
and wins both dropped to the bottom
because no certain well no Sun no solar
is clear but then also it's having
effect on the wind so that also dropped
out so what what and so had to do is
they had to go and take the new color
and power plants have them on standby
and as the Moon moves over the Sun they
had to go ramp them up and then ramp
them down again so that they could go
and deal with all this it's an enormous
thing you can see this is the the the
frequency maintained throughout the
entire event on the grid so they did a
really good job on doing this but that's
magic that you never think about and it
requires a ton of real-time coordination
between all those tsos to make that all
happen by 2020 sixty percent of the
capacity in cold and new coal plants
which has been used to to even this out
will be gone so that'll be an
interesting time so we're getting we're
getting into we we live and we live in
the place of you know when does the
energy grid go down like when we have
actually have outages in Europe it's
rare it almost left in the u.s. right
the wind blows powers out but here were
we have we live in a pretty stable place
but might change because it becomes more
it becomes harder so there's a
technology race going on of how we can
go and keep the grid the grid stable one
of the ways of how to deal with this is
more is more and better batteries
there's battery technology battery
batteries like the Tesla battery which
is which is put together from many many
many small batteries or batteries in
this form this is the caption vac in
Germany there's others like this and the
way how this works is there's a lake at
the bottom of that hill and this takes
power pumps the water up the hill and
when power is needed the water runs down
the hill through a generator so this is
a battery that's using a lake and that's
hydroelectric principle and it's also
used in many other places and that's one
way to go and deal with that problem and
that is you take the energy that comes
from wind and the energy that comes from
Seoul are you pump water up the hill and
when you need power you go and then use
the the reverse effect and you just
generate power again so we need
batteries but that also needs to be
managed and so II the transparency nce
that EU is a fabulous site you're going
to have that slide those slides on the
share so you can go and click it from
there and that actually shows in real
time who's buying power who's selling
power and it's called transparency
because that's all for us as citizens of
the you to go look at which is pretty
fascinating industrial automation is
another area which is a huge huge area
of optimization and industrial
automation has been doing IOT for the
last 40 years since well arguably for
the last forty seven years or 46 years
1969 was a fabulous here by the way moon
landing I was born fabulous here and I
was born just a week after the moon
landing the guys came back
week later I happened anyway so
industrial automation there they're
doing IOT for the longest time in that
sense of having actuators and sensors
and all strung together and exchange it
digital information but mostly just
inside of these machines this is by the
way a bottling plant and the the
bottling plant needs to go and
communicate so there's individual
machines here which are built on top of
real-time buses and they do many
operations very quickly it's a fully
automated thing but if you want to go
and communicate between those machines
that's something where the vendors of
those machines may be different that's
also not hard real-time that's like
coordination you have the machine that
makes the the bottles and you have the
machine to fill the bottles and you have
the machine that goes and puts them all
into cases and then you have the machine
that puts the cases onto a pallet and
then wraps the pallet and all this all
those steps and they also need to go and
coordinate and that doesn't happen on
the real-time bus that happens
differently so one area where we are
directly engaging I'm actually
personally engaged in is OPC UA an OPC
UA is a standard 480 automation
companies that are working together to
make all of that stuff gel and make
communication work and in our industrial
automation we're coming out of a world
where everything is proprietary you buy
something from Siemens and then you buy
also everything else from Siemens you
buy something from Bosch and you also
buy some to everything else on Bosh you
buy something from back off and then you
buy everything else from back off that
they like it that way however because
systems become more complicated people
have learned hey we have to go and make
those things interoperate so we have UPC
you a and of course OPC UA it has been
around for a while but now it's also
required to go and take those industrial
systems and connect them out to the
cloud connect them out to IT systems
which can then go and optimize and so we
have and that's something that have
contributed to extended that
specification with the pops up
capability so that it can now publish
out that
devices directly can go and publish out
to the cloud or can publish out to data
center systems into message brokers to
deliver telemetry to deliver information
so that that information can then help
streamline the systems there's more
interesting stuff in the area of home
automation so that was industrial
automation home automation is an area
that I think I have the honeywell
thermostat here just because everybody
has an ester thermostat here not do so
well that's an interesting area mostly
in the area of smart buildings vs smart
home smart home is who has a smart home
okay automatic everything right who
wants a smart home see that's the
problem so I don't care like I can I can
perfect i'm perfectly fine having my
semi automated way to get the the window
blinds up and down I don't need to say I
don't need to walk into the house and
say make it light now I can just like I
can I could touch that switch it's okay
i don't need to talk to anybody and
that's that's true for a lot of people
the home automation thing is something
that the geeks think think it's the
hottest thing in the world and where
normal people like what he wants like
one of the mean we as geeks we're kind
of happy and then we have the non-geek
wife or husband and they're like no so
but still building automation is a big
deal because building automation for
commercial buildings like this one
that's something that needs to work and
that should be working on in an
automated fashion because the guy who's
running the the show who's running the
building here and who makes sure that
the climate control works well he's not
here flipping the switches know the
please the room here should not be too
hot should not be to call
old and it should be you know automatic
so that's something that is for building
automation for something that is like a
dynamic venue like this one we want to
have automation so building automation
is the place where it's at in terms of
in terms of of you know automating the
houses or buildings and not so much
smart home at least that's my impression
right now then we get into areas of
Public Safety here's lph stunt they also
another wonderful insulated solution at
pig Ashanti de pinga online that's a
service of the federal government and
the the german federal government and
edit page tons uniquely just for that
one river who knows why has a twitter
account and that twitter account tweets
out the level of the the the of the
elbow which is nice because now you can
go and build start building rules and
ifttt on top of that etc which is great
would be wonderful if that was something
that they would do for the entire
country but they don't because that's
another one of those trial things right
but it's growing its you can see that
that may be something that will be
useful in the future usgs the US
Geological Survey has a ton of services
around water they have near real-time
water stream flow data that you can go
get visualize that you can also get as
data streams so if you live near a
stream and you want to go and do fishing
or you want to go and and navigate the
stream or if you want if you're just
worried about if you just worry about
stuff breaking down or being washed away
that's information that you can use
earthquakes whenever anything happens
when I see on Twitter earthquake
anything this is the site that I go to
usgs earthquake this usgs gov worldwide
coverage for earthquakes an earthquake
data earthquake news pretty very good
that's a global service effectively
google maps traffic information obvious
there's effectively three big vendors
Google where you can get your
information and the way that's the done
destroy Android phones enter your car so
if you carry an Android phone with you
you're contributing to that map because
they're correlating your your your
location to whether you on the street
and if you're on the street then they're
going to measure the flow and that's how
they figure out whether there's
something slow or not similar happened
similar things happens with tomtom with
the tomtom navigation systems and
similar and also for here maps so these
are the three big services that kind of
give you real-time traffic information
if you want that and then this other
like your car may be using this the the
here data I believe is what first is in
my car so I have this online service
that I have from from my car
manufacturer and that gives me data with
a resolution of at most five minutes
delay which means I'm often out of the
from off from the highway before
everybody else is because the other
systems run through the radio and have a
lag of up to 20 minutes and so I'm I'm
actually my car knows about those
traffic traffic stops earlier because
mine is on line doesn't work through the
Public Radio lightning maps org is very
very very currently interesting for all
of us because of the unfortunate weather
we're having I always blame Holland
because I live right by the hot by the
dutch border so all that bad weather
comes from you and lightning maps org is
fantastic what it shows is real-time
lightning strikes effectively across all
of Europe and some other areas of the
world so if you're gonna lightning
episode or if there's a if there is bad
weather coming and if there's
thunderstorms coming you could see the
like if you see the flash of the light
they actually tell you what the latency
is going to be you see the flash outside
two seconds later you see that dot and
the and they actually have a circle for
what they calculate how far the Thunder
goes and the Thunder is
actually a ring that goes around in real
time and and sometimes and they kind of
do prediction on this so sometimes they
just where you live when the thunder
wave hits you on the screen that's
exactly what the Thunder shows
astonishing is really cool and that's
what I use like when my wife says what's
what do you think that what the weather
is going to be like I I showed her now
now she's looking herself but that's how
we tell because you can see whether
there's something bad coming up from
Belgium well there's something bad
coming up from from over Eindhoven
that's kind of what usually what hits us
and it's astonishing so there's also
interesting data you can also use flight
radar light aware give you life
information about traffic I'm actually
contributing to that I have a little a
dsb receiver in the house it's a
raspberry pi I have an extra ten out of
my house for 1090 megahertz and I'm
actually contributing data into flight
at flight radar flightaware and plane
finder with that it's also a little IOT
application if you will and you can go
now see what's above you and I have a
pretty big camera so i happily shoot
pictures of planes that are like 36,000
feet in the sky and i still can get them
kind of full frame pictures which is
kind of fun it's a very big camera so
flightaware same thing marine traffic is
the same thing for it you're you are you
are people close by the sea so if that
there's going to be more interesting for
you marine traffic calm very similar for
ships what's going on what is this ship
like they have like VR things and that's
also working the similar way AAS data so
what they collect so digital
infrastructure in the way out how I
understand it is infirmities what you
kind of collect as data where we collect
as data under the from sensors from
civilization infrastructure and
sometimes there is already an ocean of
API and I think one of the things we're
going to we're going to see happen is
that there's going to be standardization
around that so that there's going to be
a P is for cities as API is
four states and the AP is four countries
and sometimes for like Earth great
information an API for Earth where you
can go and now start building solutions
that are on top of that and they're
using that information because the data
is ours right like as a EU citizen the
EU data I'd like I want to get something
from Brussels that'd be fabulous if I
can get that if I could go and build on
top of that if we had digital
infrastructure if we had digital
utilities in that way the problem is
tiny islands this is Germany in 1648 all
of these are different states you need
needed to have visas to go between those
places well that's passage permits we
fixed that meanwhile and see the United
Netherlands you fix that earlier right
up there and that's the state of all of
these digital infrastructure pieces
right now it's very small it's all pocs
mostly small things but a lot of them
are interesting and very promising and I
think we're going to get there to make
them more meaningful how far can that
scale how do we how do we get this what
is the opportunity well I think for a
while there's going to be all of these
different diverse sources of data and
and all the different it's it's hard to
believe that all the cities in all the
states in all the countries will go and
agree so there's opportunity for for
companies to go and collect all that
data up normalize it and then make it
available so those AP is maybe
commercial for a while we see the first
trends towards that that you are
offering a service where you are
normalizing all that data and you
providing that out to others what you
need for that to make it work for scars
to make it work for infrastructure is
you need to have a lot of scale
infrastructure high scale infrastructure
and I think and we believe that's kind
of what we can contribute the
architecture in there are the
requirements for these architectures are
extreme because we always talk about
utility scale we talk about all the
houses in
an area right all the people who live
there everybody who uses try public
transports all the cars so we're not
talking about tens of thousands we're
talking always about a hundreds of
thousands or millions so that requires
infrastructure to deal with that it also
requires a lot of security we have to go
and make all of that very secure we have
to go and secure the cloud we have to
secure the gateways the infrastructure
sits on the side of the road we need to
define all the devices we have to let go
of some legacy attitudes that we have
towards security today security
specifically in industrial systems is
typically mirroring physical physical
security right you make a wall around
the building and then you have a door
through which you can come and that's
how that's how many of the VPN setups
work right you have a factory floor
nothing is secured but yes it's rigged
fenced right nobody can get in there and
the way how you get in there's a door so
you get come through the VPN of course
that's all nonsense because you can go
and and this is how stocks networks
right you can also get through in
through USB stick stick and then that
works against you so we need to get rid
of that attitude of that attitude we
need to go in and takes yours take
security seriously and if and defend
everything in depth otherwise that's not
going to work because all of the things
that i told you about so far are under
that line and the pyramid where it is
about our safety and security and all
this is security something that we need
to go and takes it very seriously let's
skip that one so it showcase industrial
automation so that's the that's the old
we have this old model kind of where
everyone can talk to everybody and we
have these gateways which are now
talking on behalf of that external
network but that that communication
happens at the application layer and
doesn't fuse to networks so that's one
way to deal with that so security needs
to be kind of a key element in all this
so how can we help so here's a quick
pitch I'm going to make this very
make this very quick first of all we
have a ton of infrastructure we have 28
global data centers more than anybody
right now in terms of total footprint of
data centers that we have we have the
second or this the second or third
largest network in the world that's
always like sometimes one day we're on
top of the other day Google is on top
but we operate one of the top three
networks in the world on our own fiber
we have we have C cables that are our
own we have a ton of infrastructure that
we run ourselves if you come from Europe
and you hit a service in Azure you your
bits lands through a sea cable in
Virginia and go in Virginia on Microsoft
fiber and then go to whatever data
center you are in the US we have a huge
network and we have all these data
center facilities we have over 200 data
data center facilities in the world and
that's a great foundation to go and
build services on top of we have built
for these kinds of systems the reference
architecture model that we share if you
search for iOS Rio to reference
architecture on the web you'll find a
PDF document that you can go and read so
I'll just point that out which kind of
gives a general categorization of the
services that you need in the cloud to
go and kind of build that infrastructure
generally what we find is that there's a
general pattern for attaching a lots of
devices into a central system there's a
notion of a gateway there's a notion of
a hot path of a gateway to get the data
in there's a hot path where you want to
go and do compute on the hot path while
the data super fresh you do the stream
analytics the service that we have or
with Hadoop spark a storm many of those
infrastructures we support all the Java
infrastructures that in the Apache
ecosystem in as part of the dubenko
system that he can go and run and
there's of course all the code the code
path analytics with the rest of the
mostly of the Hadoop ecosystem that you
can also go and run in all this the
that we have in all those things and
this is what we built and this is the
thing my team builds is the focus in all
these things is scale and we built
infrastructure specifically platform as
a service infrastructure whenever you
need massive-scale event tubs for
instance is a way to go and get
telemetry in the cloud the way you set
this up is not by there's two ways of
setting something like this up you can
go and install Kafka and run it on VMS
which requires you to go and install it
and run it on VMS here you can make an
event up which is effectively just you
just wish for one and the thing gets
installed for you this infrastructure
today the event tubs are if you know
Kafka you know event up so the the
principle is about the same it's a
different foundational infrastructure
and sits underneath this currently runs
three and a half trillion transactions
per week deployed the growth rate that
we have is about is well over ten
percent per month over month in terms of
traffic that we run we run over 20
petabytes of data through this per month
and that's for super large-scale
ingestion we built those services that
infrastructure that is is you know doing
stuff at that scale that is doing the
hundreds of thousands of things
somewhere can go and use this on top of
that builds IOT hub and IOT hub is an
infrastructure that's that's leveraging
the same foundational technology but
then it's specific to devices it is
built so that you can have
bi-directional relationships and
security relationships with a million or
ten million devices at the same time as
infrastructure so it's a super high
scale infrastructure speaks HTTP MQTT
amqp that is exists so you can go and
take devices you can get data sources
that you can also go and send control
commands to and connect them up to the
cloud yes we know that there's also
compute at the edge we're supporting
that too so part of that is also SDKs
which allow you to go and integrate
stuff that's at the edge we're engaged
in open the open consortium because
we also know that we have to go
and integrate in the in the edge more in
the network push compute into the
network so working on that as well and
that's what I brought you today I hope
that was somewhat entertaining as the
last session of this track and I think
there's a closing closing keynote coming
after this and thank you very much for
being here thank you very much for
listening to me uh-oh will you cut me
off because of it you so want to ask
some questions yeah we still have some
questions oh good well then let's go to
answer them there are so an interesting
question i was wondering myself as well
you showed the volkswagen golf stock car
right yeah he said well this car is more
safe and more secure than which is he
from a tesla and yes only how are they
achieving that goal without all the
sensors and the cameras and they have
the so so the folks like golf if you buy
the latest the current generation fox
about golf with the automatic automatic
assistance pact it already has the
sensors in it that are required so the
capabilities of that particular
prototype that you saw is using the
exact camera the production camera and
it's producing using the production
radar that's already in that video wow
that's impressive another interesting
question is about electronic cars and
the opportunity that they have to
overcome actually the energy gap that
you showed with what what opportunities
do we see ya there so we have it we have
a actually hard transfer energy transfer
problem and we will have that because if
you calculate out what what the
potential energy in mega joules is what
actually sits in a tank in a gas station
its enormous if you think about moving
that using a you know transfer poles
yeah it's possible it will take weeks to
fill one of those tanks so I mean it's
not instant what is how do you do this
well first of all we need to have a
revolution in battery capacity battery
capacity needs to get as good as fossil
fuels
and then we need to do decentralized
energy production so I think the
windmills the new windows that we have
now all across the country i think it's
going to get that's going to get worse
rather than better because we if we want
to fill our energy needs like this we
need to have more cables more transfer
routes we need to go to offshore energy
generation but we also need to have this
a more decentralized energy generation
and the energy business is going to be
is there hurting right now and they're
hurting because of all the old stuff
that they have to go deal with but
overall it's one of its going to be one
of the hottest faces i think in for the
foreseeable future because they have
hard challenges and they also is
sometimes you see the problem being turn
around right that the electronic cars
are starting to deliver back to the net
actually well because they have but
that's a function of them of them just
having good batteries Yeah right and and
so they can go and bridge the bridge the
gaps of that comes out of removals we're
going to work our electricity story is
going to look very different in 20 years
now you tell us a little bit about IP
eyes for cities for states for buildings
what standardization solutions are you
seeing there or what movements are you
seeing there there is governments with
with smarts to the initiatives one smart
city initiative that's fairly far ahead
i think a singapore with where it's
relatively easy because the singapore is
a country that's small and it's also it
seems fairly simple in singapore to do
something from the top down which is
probably there easier in other places i
think i think this is going to go and be
a thing where we see cities doing things
first and then we're going to see states
picking things up and then probably
going to go i have some federal things i
think the EU can go and play a really
good role here to you know go ahead and
and start doing this this would be good
regulation in that case to go for the EU
to step in and say let's go on and and
do some minimal minimal first steps in
the kind of every city should go and
offer this following service or every
state should offer all this following
service I think that's something will
come from a government level Clements
thank you again for your inspiring talk
everybody big applause for Clemens
