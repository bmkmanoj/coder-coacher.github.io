and myself this morning and being the
first one out on the tryout day is
actually perfect for a Swede right
coming into to to Denmark and to this
fantastic sessions that you have ahead
of you here in Copenhagen
so topic around startup and using lean
in in those aspects I will do a few
highlights first naturally right the
sessions you heard that one out of urine
earlier on for the presentations so in
my presentations I will talk a little
bit about how traditional existing large
companies successfully can use these
aspects and are already doing so but
before I start with that I need to know
the audience so first of all how many of
you are native Danish hands up 7080
percent roughly good how many of you
perceive yourself to be more done that's
15 percent I'm not saying it's wrong not
to be modern but I just want to know
because either you are very more done
and actually self-aware and raise your
hands or actually you are really
unmodern but talking about these topics
you will have during these days I think
around also for you and myself to be
advocates in a modern world driving in
digital usage driving in innovation and
exploring new things and trying things
out then it's also really important for
all of us to push ourselves and it's
easy when you're ahead of the curve then
it's quite convenient just to continue
on the path you are but remember the
competition is always trying to overtake
you and
that I think is also one of these
components which are really important
around the topic we have have here today
and no matter if you're a traditional
company if you are a startup or you're
just an idea that is aspect is still
relevant what we see around us today as
we all know is some of the biggest
disruptions and also some of the biggest
opportunities that ever have existed I
participated last week in in a session
around how traditional industries are
changing and this traditional industry
was actually around maps printed maps
and you can imagine being in a business
of printed Maps these days and of course
this company decided actually to say we
are not the part of printing Maps
anymore and and many of us have realized
that for a long time
but for them in order to actually
provide foundation for maps that went
into the telephone book a long time ago
that was their part of their starting
point and then naturally they were
disrupted by GPS navigation systems
Tom Tom Gorman and those companies and
naturally what we are now seeing is not
only one disruption we are also being a
part of two or three disruptions in the
same industries where the garments and
the tom-toms are being disrupted by the
smartphones so we are living in a
fantastic environment and this is
impacting startup young companies but
it's also now impacting some of the big
organizations and companies and that is
the interesting point how we can use
good techniques to actually assist the
large organization to also be prosperous
in the years to come so if we if we look
at some of the aspects which is now
happening why this is now relevant here
and now many large organizations today
perceive things to be quite different if
you look at valuation of companies if
you think about the top five companies
in the world when it comes to market cap
which is relevant based on on the the
techniques we're going to talk about
here today and this is also why large
companies now pay a lot of interest
around this so if you look at the
largest companies today with regards to
valuation
it's basically software companies they
are the Silicon Valley companies they
are based on the west coast in in u.s.
many of them if you expand it to top ten
then you also bring in some companies
from from China and from East that is
coming in being highly valued of course
CEOs board members and CFO's listen to
this and they look at the companies what
they have done in order to become
successful and being valued if you go
back six or seven years the top five
companies were basically one or two
could be on that list of the current
ones after being the number one as many
of you know but if you go back six seven
years the industries that were on that
list finance banking oil and gas very
traditional industries and of course
this transformation is on the agenda for
boards CEOs and CFOs that is also why
using these type of of techniques around
lean and startup becomes irrelevant for
the larger organizations because they
said this creates a lot of interest
these days we also know that products
are becoming software oriented not only
the traditional software areas but also
companies and products that used to be
very analog are rapidly moving into
being software based some of them are
quite easy to understand that they are
software based like a car for example
around Linda and the gas yeah of course
it has some relevance how to adapt that
one what we see your own in sports is
something totally different but of
course it makes relevant when it comes
to how we act with regard is it the goal
or not and those type of aspects so if
it can be connected it will be connected
as long as we find a way how to address
the value part this is also something
that is now clearly being brought in
with regards to how traditional
companies look upon their way into the
future what I would also like to
highlight when we come into the some of
the more details or the presentations is
that the primary effects are big but the
secondary effects are much more
impactful long term wise and that is
also sometimes hard for traditional
companies in what we're now looking at
to actually judge because the fact for
example if we take you highlight that
you're on my background from automotive
if we take for example saying connecting
a car to a cloud that that could be
great it can receive some very immediate
quick customer value which is great
however the long-term impact that has on
the value chain is much bigger but you
don't perceive that and you don't
calculate that as a starting point at
least not if you brought up and Foster
during your whole career in a
traditional industry and that also goes
for for many other other type of of
industries so that is also something we
in Gotham would like you to bring with
you with regards to how in the
organization you work and with regards
to the solutions and innovation you
bring forward so when it comes to to my
presentation I will talk around a little
bit around the introduction I will come
back to some of the CEO priorities that
we have in in Gardner because that is
also important when we talk about using
the Lean Startup techniques what is the
reason and drivers behind that so I will
highlight that I will also talk a little
bit about
a few industry cases and then I will do
a summary naturally and then also give
you a couple of of quite concrete steps
and action points to bring with you in
order actually to foster the learning
and the experience around using Lean
Startup techniques in the organization
on the environment you are working so
let us go into the CEO priorities why is
that important
well number one CEOs they have a big
impact together with their boards what
we do in Gartner on a continuous basis
both for CEOs as well as CIOs is awesome
how are they priorities developing
because that gives a very good trend
what is hot on their agenda what their
priorities are what they would like to
achieve and also naturally what they've
been pushed by by their boards so when
we look at 2017 and 2018 from a CEO
perspective there are a couple of things
that are important on the agenda for
CEOs number one aspect in our CEO survey
comes down to growth so really important
for them in their top five for growth
linking in also to product improvement
and IT related corporate aspects and
customer relevance improving customer
service aspects these are some of the
most important aspect that comes out of
of our studies with regards to what the
priorities are for CEOs why is this
important then well when we talk about
some of the techniques that are
important to drive innovation trying out
new things and actually generating
growth for the future then of course
it's important to know what they are
heading so growth and isolate that are
for example some of those aspects which
are on a very good trend with regards to
priorities from CEOs so when we look at
this on a gardener context what is
happening now in the industry around us
but also also in the society in general
it's nothing new I mean when
digitalization innovation so
we're based products are kicking in is
this new partly yes but absolutely it's
been a long journey a number of you and
a number of us in here have actually
been a part of working with web aspect
being a part of a business then I know
also a few us or maybe not myself but if
you were actually not even born down
here but that's another story
but if you then look upon this journey
there has been a lot of different
aspects where a number of industries
have projected that this will happen but
when we look at traditional industries
it has not been that easy for
traditional companies which have had a
great success year over year in
traditional industries to see that
disruption is coming and now we are
coming into that aspect where we are
connecting people things and business
jointly and here is what you also
highlighted in the beginning yarn with
regards to how Google and the other ones
have been working with these topics to
explore and try out new things to create
tremendous corporate values both in
startups but also how these techniques
are being used in larger organizations
or we then done absolutely not
I mean this is just the starting point
the big effect is still to come
that is also why large organization
these days are now also discovering that
they need to be much more progressive
that than they used to be they also know
that their competition might not come
from the traditional industries which
they have been competing with for a long
time it might actually come out of other
directions some some of the companies
which they have had as partners and this
is not a liner development it's
exponential which means it will have a
big impact in the years to come
a number of you a number of us have been
aware of this for a long time as I said
earlier on but now this effect is coming
in and hitting the boardrooms and
hitting the executive teams and that is
also why your knowledge you
experience in how to drive innovation
and try out new things becomes
tremendously important so when we know
this then steel companies find it really
hard to drive change and they usually
fail or at least having a hard time to
actually comply and do these type of of
deliveries and make sure it hits a
customer make sure it hits the bottom
line so a lot of a lot of CFOs a lot of
CEOs find it really hard to actually
deliver and it's only close to two just
above the 10% that actually managed to
do these strategic changes and that's
really bad if you are a CEO or CFO that
is used to hitting your targets then you
become really frustrated what we also
see in our surveys from a from a Gardner
perspective linked to this is actually
also linked in to a number of comments
what is happening out when digital
business is hitting us large-scale so we
know that digital is transforming but
culture is a big aspect of this what are
some of the key aspects you need to
handle when you're working with Lean
Startup techniques in your organizations
that is actually a number of comments
from very traditional people that never
have worked with these topics so what
you will face is for example you take
the CFO digital is great innovation is
great for example however I suspend
cannot increase we can't afford that one
and if you're working with a CTO or head
of R&amp;amp;D they say okay fantastic you can
do whatever you like in customer service
in IT or in marketing but technology
belongs to my part of the organization
then everything stops or you can
actually have someone in in the market
saying everything we do on digital or
i2r innovation needs to be done locally
and then you still might be a global
organization it might also be so that
the CEO knows we're behind we need to
accelerate and then the non-executive
board comes in and put
and say have you yet hired a CDO and
pushing that one and then you have the
IT department will say okay it's great
with all this new stuff but we still
need to fix the the legacy of that
twenty years we haven't done anything so
a number of these things these this is
environments you need to work it and
these are some of the comments you will
be getting we are getting and what the
traditional companies are seeing and
that is also why it's so important to
use a different set of techniques in
order to be successful long term wise so
linking into our companies need Lean
Startup techniques I think the number
one aspect highlighter around CEOs CFOs
how they perceive value historically how
they have seen that other companies are
developing number one is trying to do
new stuff with the models and structures
and processes which made you successful
historically will not be the solution
for the future that is the number one
aspect so when you look at these aspects
that you need to use different tools and
solutions and processes and structures
and also culture to be successful for
the future is one of the number one
aspects you can try to fix that rule a
number of times and a number of big
organization traditional ones end up in
a situation where you bring in people
you sit around the executive team and
then you know you need to do something
differently and then you lift that rock
or try to fix that wall and see how
expensive it actually is and then you
actually do a short term fix instead
because that is easier and it looks good
and then you decide to actually put it
back and only fix the surface and let
the next board or Lex the next CEO or
and let the next CFO fix that core
problem that has been successful or
partly successful for a number of years
but now it is truly changing and that is
also by these techniques are important
so what we see in in Gartner is truly
linked in to that in order to to change
an enable digital and enable innovation
it is very much a leadership aspect and
that I think is just that understanding
is important for traditional companies
in Gartner we also look at a couple of
different aspects with regards to how to
handle traditional companies which are
working both with history as well as
preparing for the future how do you
combine that aspect it's not an easy
journey a lot of effort and thinking
I've gone into that from a research
perspective as well as from experiences
from the existing companies so as a part
of this in our research and our advice
to organizations but also to the
practical experiences bimodal
capabilities where you're both able to
work in mode one way of taking care of
what's predictable what is stable what
needs to be taken care of
that is one aspect how to handle things
but then also mode two is also an
extremely important part especially when
we link this into Lean Startup
techniques because that's a part of
trying out that's a part of doing
exploratory services and also seeing if
it will work if you're able to scale it
and learn from it and if you need to
fail fail fast and this has also been
one of the aspects where where our
research and our capabilities have been
brought into many organizations in order
to find the right people and the right
mindset in order to actually drive these
things into traditional organizations
and to elaborate a little bit more on
mode one linking it into two mode one
then you are basically in a situation
where you know what you're doing it's
stable you've done it many times before
and you do big projects you never stop
then you know where the end goal is and
actually you have a plan you might
to adapt it but you just need to get
through and that requires a certain type
of funding it requires a certain type of
people and it also requires a certain
type of business organization to make
sure that this gets through and it's
also one of these aspects that you place
a big bet and once you've done that you
need to make sure it gets through so
this is you can say it's a very very
important part of any large
organizations in existing businesses but
also in this aspect it is so that it
might be perceived by some to be not
extremely progressive but it's still
very important because it's a part of
the foundation so it's certain it's a
part of the basic you need to have it
what is now being highlighted and
visualized lot more in in during these
past years have actually been to come
into the mode to the exploration part
the innovation part while you actually
are not really sure what you're trying
to achieve and what you're trying to do
but you need to do it and you need to
experiment around it and you need to
learn and also you need to know that you
will not only kick off one of these
activities you will have an array of
these opportunities to move forward with
the only thing you know is that everyone
will not be a success but you do know
that everyone will be a great learning
and that is also part of of a new
thinking in traditional organizations
and also that your your having much
quicker loops how to actually work with
these topics in order to get this energy
into the organization get the the
findings get the opportunities up on the
table discuss it sieved adds value to
your customers and then if you see that
that is relevant boost it and horns it
and and and roll it out roll it out and
scale so of course this this is a quite
important part but linking into
organizations that have been working
very stable with 2% growth on an annual
basis long development cycles and
for example product plans there are
three seven or nine years long for quite
traditional industries this is a
revolution and it's hard because it's
also about people and skills so linking
it in this is a part where things are
not set and changing people's mind takes
time so this is a very important part
when it when it comes to actually
changing a company and that is what we
see when we're using these type
techniques and by about bimodal it's not
only for IT or the digital or a software
part it's actually a part of changing
the culture and the leadership of an
organization and that is also linked
into adapting yourself and your
organization for the competition you
have ahead of you which not which might
not be linked to the traditional
companies in your industry so many of
these traditional companies if we go out
and ask them and actually see what they
are doing they are into DevOps and agile
absolutely many of them are so that is
not not the challenge and I think you
recognize yourself in that aspect as
well if you also then is it enough to
actually have these aspects on the table
sometimes it might be because it gives
absolutely some incremental improvements
but is it enough to bring you the whole
way that is an important questions that
more CFO CEOs and executive business
leaders need to ask themselves and what
we see when we when we look into the
industries and how traditional companies
are working these days then when they
realize you need to business develop in
a new way you need to drive innovation
in a new way you look at startups for
example in a new way or you buy it
startups in a new way then you can also
look at the Lean Startup techniques in a
different way because some of the
companies are using these type of words
yeah when we are planning for the future
we need to involve our people we need to
drive innovation we need to look at our
customers
we need to learn from it we need to
understand it it's important with speed
we must go out and see what is happening
we need to be able to build we need to
be able to scale so when you use
traditional corporate languages
sometimes you're actually touching upon
many of the aspects of Lean Startup
techniques and also a few other aspects
around DevOps agile and also design
thinking and that I think is also part
of why it is important for myself and
you in your roles to understand some of
the traditional thinking in large
organizations with regards to how to
leverage some of the new techniques but
if we take these you can say traditional
corporate languages you can actually put
that very much
into the structure of design thinking
lean startup and agile because many of
these components are actually fitting in
and being boosted by these type of
frameworks and if you just take a couple
of years ago when you were talking about
customer problems for example then a lot
of organizations internally within that
organization went out and and talked in
the office about the customer problems
didn't go out and look upon them
traditionally in in the real world so I
think when you look at this whole
journey both when addressing the
customer perspective the employee
perspective and then bringing it in to
the lean startup aspect about looking at
the product see how we can get it up and
running fast
to some extent potentially get revenues
measure it learn from it and then
continue and Hawn's it over time that is
really hard because this is hard which
goes into the DNA of many traditional
organizations which is going the
opposite way what they have been used to
so when you for example come in to the
aspect of of the book etc and so on
around these aspects I will highlight
minimum valuable product as one aspect
while with regards to why it's hard for
traditional companies
and I will then use an example naturally
from the automotive industry so you can
actually have two ways of getting two in
this case a car then of course being in
this audience how many of you have a
driver license hands up your so on
modern how many of you have a membership
in a car sharing organization it's
actually a little bit less than the ones
that perceive yourself to be more done
that's interesting but it's good for
those of you that don't have a
membership in a car sharing structure
get it if you have a driver license of
course when you look at the car and you
can actually have a different way of
developing a car or a transport solution
very traditionally way had actually been
okay look at number one the car people
are happy with but a semi finished car
basically the chassis it's worth nothing
and it's also not possible to sell then
if you just have the wheelbase or just a
wheel basically very limited value order
out of that one that is why for a
traditional industry it has basically
taken from this point year zero three
years to develop three years to specify
and also three years to make sure you
have your sub suppliers ready to get a
car out in the market and people are
happy about it then when people are
happy about that product then that
product usually lives in take the
automotive industry for seven years then
you have seven years of continuous
development of that product and you have
a mid-year upgrade around year three
year four for this product and it
continues to live and after around six
seven eight years it's being perceived
to be on more done and in many cases
when you have a part of the highest
profit per car line then you decide to
actually let it go and move into the
next generation of vehicles so that is
the traditional way however if you use
minimum viable product
expect to actually develop something
similar the journey would look very very
different if you would start so one way
of looking at that is actually to look
at transportation and take it step by
step
ease people way of getting from point A
to point B everyone of us knows that
skateboard might not be suitable for
everyone but it will kick you off you
will learn from it you get interaction
with customers you actually get feedback
what works you know you will have
accidents but that is also why you might
improve it for the next version you do
but you have revenue you're on the
market you build the brand and of course
then you can keep your first version you
can also keep your second version and
move into the third version of how to
improve your product and finding new
customer segments while keeping the
others including also moving customer
segments from the earlier products to
the next level and here actually for
this company you actually can have
customers in this whole room because the
first organization could only address a
part of the structure so of course this
is a totally new way of thinking and
this is hard for traditional industries
because it's everything what traditional
industries what have made them
successful is actually to work in this
path they've been fostering that part
all the these structures processors are
fostering them in that direction and
then all of a sudden a number of
companies coming up according to this
structure and doing things differently
and then linking in to what I said
initially the interesting part is that
many companies that do recording to this
structure in software they are rapidly
being more highly valued than the
companies in the firm in the old lane so
to speak and that is of course something
that is being noted by the boardroom and
the executive teams and then of course
if you look at business value if you
look at revenues and if you look at
customer satisfaction
this is a totally different journey and
that is also something which is
important for you to bring with you and
what also how to advocate in the
organizations you work why Lean Startup
techniques now are becoming much more
interesting for traditional companies
and industries but remember the
important part is not the technique as
such but rather the the culture
leadership change that needs to go with
it in order to be successful so if I
will go into the industry case and
highlight a few aspects around how this
work in in in practical life for for for
an industry if you look at if you look
at automotive automotive has been going
through a number of different
transformations for a very long time
automotive was partly developed in
naturally in the US but actually trying
to solve an environmental problem anyone
knows the problem the environmental
problem
yes exactly horseshit piles this high
smelling in New York taxes in New York
environmental problem needs to be solved
and automotive is being brought forward
think about that based on the
discussions that is today in the world
where automotive is one of the biggest
aspects around environmental challenges
so transportation environmental problem
going from point A to point B in a
better way when that one was solved
through automotive engines wheels that's
a trans Oh on what happens then well it
needs to go quicker and look great there
okay everyone moves into that
transformation what happens then you
have accidents big surprise then you do
the next transformation of the industry
which is linked into safety and security
both for people in a transportation
vehicle but as well as for a vehicle for
people being outside of the vehicle then
then also after that you get a linkage
back with the environmental challenges
which naturally the the automotive
industry I've been working working with
for a long time
and then based off what happen in other
industries around technology telco apps
and software solutions then the dream of
autonomous drive and connected solutions
into the vehicle really kick off so you
can say these are the different
transformation steps in the automotive
industry
the interesting part with this one is
also if you would combine this with a
number of players in the automotive
sector the number of big companies that
are successful and earning money because
that would go the other way in the
beginning you have many companies
producing and servicing this market
segments but so far based on every
transformation steps less and less and
less players are still in business
globally if you then look at how these
traditional automotive companies are
basically structured you can actually
say that you have a core you need to
develop the product you need to make
sure they are working in in
manufacturing you also need to take care
of them in the aftermarket then you also
in the modern world have a lot around
event and online sales and so on but you
also have a 10-digit of solutions
related to the product in the beginning
it was only these where information
technology and software were brought in
then developing up into the marketing
area and then naturally also being
brought in as the car and the customer
becomes connected how does this link
into the what I said previously well if
you then look on how how things are
developing now in in this type of
industry which is also very relevant for
many other industries it's actually
linking it into bimodal where you have
more of the traditional predictable
aspects that is linked into these part
the core part that is you know what you
need to be doing it's more predictable
you cannot fail you just need to get it
through if you then look at what what is
up here with regards to mode to the
expiratory areas where you need to
innovate and be quicker long term wise
and you don't know if you're doing right
that is actually linked in to some
aspects around these areas event
marketing and also the product area in
these areas you don't know that
everything will be a success and that
links in to mode to basically the areas
where you bring in a different set of
people so if you look at a few examples
around that you can actually take then
looking at the customer aspect and how
the Lean Startup techniques are being
used in these areas with success not
necessarily being brought in as the tool
from the beginning but if you take a
successful automotive company today it
very much originates out of the customer
the customer feelings and you can take
that if it links into user interface
without the smartphones the user
interfaces in a vehicle today wouldn't
look the same it is actually the
smartphones the telco industry that has
been driving the user interfaces into
the vehicles if you look at for example
some of the more progressive brands in
general in the industry if you take
Tesla they were the ones that actually
didn't look at the automotive suppliers
in order to get their interfaces into
the car looking the way they looked they
went into the IT industry to find
players there so it is this aspect about
looking at new type of players in order
to get your solutions to the customers
when you also look at for example how
over-the-air updates are coming in a
modern car today a generation of the
modern car today basically contains
excluding maps around 100 Meg of
software full car that is normally out
on the streets today if you take a car
that is basically being released as we
speak entering into the market it
roughly plus/minus contains one gig of
software and that is without maps and
basically without also self-driving
capabilities so of course the amount of
software that goes into these type of
product is increasing by by the hour why
is that important then well of course if
for all of us that are aware
that software needs to be maintained
it's a huge challenge if every product
you have needs to be attached with a
cable in order to get the latest version
it will not work over time
that is why over-the-air updates and
cloud solutions comes in but when you
start off working with that in the
beginning it's a very hard aspect
because the traditional companies they
don't see that aspect with regards to
their leadership structures their
funding structures how to get those
solutions in place but once you get it
through discussions that that is needed
then all of a sudden you have the
secondary effects where you for example
can look at ok now when things are being
connected what can we do more with that
and then you are able to actually have
totally different solutions being put in
place and also getting totally different
experiences and that for example has has
led in in some of the cases I will do a
little bit of use case with regards to
when things are connected what can you
get out of it and if we take a case
where you can have a connected vehicle
where you actually do a connection in
order to download software which is
great you have a business case for that
you do that then when you put people on
top of that you sing Lean Startup
techniques that you say ok now we have
that connectivity on that product and
with that customers what can we do more
and you brainstorm around that taking
both of the motive people know now to
motive people including customers around
that well one of the aspects that came
out of such an adventure was actually
around making sure that cars and people
and connected
well let's wound people what is around
them and what is happening on the roads
so one of the solutions that came out of
such innovative workshops we're actually
ok if you have a car that is driving on
a road and it's no thing that you have a
slippery road it's icy frosty relevant
not so much in their mark but in other
places of of the Nordic at least and and
partly also in in this in Denmark
naturally but if you figure that one out
communicate that to the cloud and then
could use that cloud connectivity to
communicate that to now
roll user and all of a sudden you get to
connect the deco system and you get
real-time information communicated
between two road users and then you as a
driver get that information in your car
saying okay cars that have just passed
this section of the road but you are
entering into have experienced that it
slippery road and you get an alert on
that it's real-time information as a
secondary effect out of that you wanted
to download software to the vehicle and
if those type of solutions that actually
drive out new ways of working and new
ways of culture and understanding also
in classic industries and for those of
you that might have have noted that one
of the biggest aspects around using
business canvas and using the value
chain customer input in the Lean Startup
techniques were actually around a
connected customer and a connected car
and bringing that one up with regards to
connecting it to e-business in a
business many many people found your
online your ask for a shipment and you
have your home as a drop-off point and
usually then the shipment company's DHL
SPO snood TNT and so they try to deliver
when you're not at home and find in many
ways how to accommodate for that through
such a innovative workshop using
business canvas and Lean Startup
techniques it was actually discovered a
couple of years ago by the first one in
this case Volvo of actually saying okay
let's use a car as basically a drop-off
point using a digital key using the
cloud connectivity and basically doing a
trial I'm saying the car is connected
the customer the owner of that car
purchases online and are able to choose
the car as a drop-off point using a
single-use digital key that the
transport company gets and through a
mobile device are able to locate that
vehicle and that vehicle is then usually
much more downtown and also once they
located it they know they can open it so
you locate the vehicle
drive to the vehicle open the trunk
deliver the shipment and then digitally
closes the car again and the owner of
that car receives a message your package
is now delivered and your car is now
safely locked again it might seem like a
small thing but I can assure you in
automotive in a traditional company
where you usually do not do those type
of activities that actually rock the
boat a little bit and the important part
is it rock the boat externally before it
actually rocked the boat internally and
per se it might not be that that
solution in general would be a huge
commercial success but it actually moves
people's mind and that is the important
part you move people's mind it is it was
hugely successful from a communication
perspective also internally based on the
fact that for example people would like
to come from us to talk to an automotive
brand in the Nordic and that actually
ended up being a couple of minutes on on
CNN and all of a sudden you end up
having your brand exposure in a
different context than rather just to
have rims or the torque of the engine
and and you move people's mind both
internally and externally using those
type of techniques so linking this back
in to the Lean Startup techniques and
that is actually try it out
fail fast do the learnings see how it
goes in this what I explained originally
of course it was not a huge scale during
this part it was just 100 users and
learned from that see how the technology
works and then actually when you
discovered what you needed to do and
what you needed not to do then you
actually also decided let's scrap the
technical solution because we learn from
it but we now we need two totally
different stability for the next version
and then you also bring it in to
actually the agile part how you develop
it for the next level so if you then
look at these type of aspects it is how
you use these type of techniques in
order to actually work with traditional
companies using it but also adapting it
to the value chain and language you have
in your respective industries and
companies and then the most important
part is actually how for example a
business inside the newspaper in UK when
they have a headline of actually a car
Oh am moving into totally different new
space that is actually one of those
aspects where you really understand both
internally externally the things are
changing and then you can link that back
how you use the start up techniques in
order to actually move a brand both
internally and externally with regards
to people culture and customer
perspectives so if you look at look into
them from from what I've covered with
regards to how would my and gardener's
proposal be with regards to how to work
with these type of opportunities in
order to get things going in the
organisations you're you're embedded in
and working with by modal aspect you get
companies we see are working in these
areas they get a much better interaction
they get a much better dialogue they get
a much better traction by using the by
modal aspect of having mode one the
traditional the predictable areas the
certain areas combining that with mode
two for expiratory innovative and using
the Lean Startup techniques in this area
this is a fact coming out of what we see
on the market as we speak we also see
clearly that when we're doing this this
is also a great way which is now clearly
understood by top executives in many
companies that using these type of
techniques is actually a great way to
get a higher valuation and get a
different perception among customers and
the people looking at your companies
that is also why this type of techniques
becomes important for traditional
industries and companies coming back to
my earlier point around the valuation
for example and if you then look at my
proposal and Gardiner's proposed
so for what you should bring with you
into your organization both to drive
internal aspects but also to drive
external aspects with regard to develop
capabilities and opportunities number
one actually plan for four different
scenarios you have your strategies in
your organization's think out different
scenarios where you could potentially go
and which opportunities you have there
based on that check out other industries
your normal competition but also other
industries what they are doing to get
the inspiration to get new energy to get
new suggestions then include that in
visiting startups because that brings in
a totally new set of people experiences
opportunities and totally as we know a
can-do attitude have the sky is the
limit for many of those companies which
is great to bring with you into
organizations which might have a very
long heritage of of culture and
leadership and then the last aspect do
the experimentation part drive that hard
because if you bring this in using the
techniques and so on
you will actually get people with you
internally you will also be looking at
competition new types of organization
get new energy and blood into your
organization you visit the startups you
see how they are working and when it
comes to visual boards etc and so on no
here are case you don't get the the same
type of management structures etc that
is a great inspiration for traditional
companies and then when you combine that
one into experimenting and also
discovering that failing is not
something that is wrong it's actually
meant to fail sometimes because that's
the biggest learning but that is hard
for many traditional industries where
people are finding out that if I fail I
screwed up the money but maybe it is
actually so for a CFO it's better to
fail early and save money instead of
failing late but that is hard learning
for many so this is for suggestions and
and tools that that we in gardening can
urge you to use because it drives
internally within organization but it
also most likely will generate a number
of very good effects on your product and
services for the organizations and
companies you are working with and the
most important part is actually that
green button don't talk about it only
but bring it forward and start doing it
because that is what generates energy
into the organization and generates
energy to move people's perceptions and
mind thank you for your attention and
now I know a number of you will go out
and look at car sharing companies
because that unmodern you cannot be
thank you for this morning we have time
for monetary questions and a number have
been asked through the app one question
is do these changes to require layoffs
of stubborn non modern and conservative
employees it's a fantastic finish damage
question and I think it's number one I
think it's a great great questions I
think it is basically like this if you
have a situation where you have those
type of of staff then you're dead anyway
so I mean it becomes an executive
decision either becomes a slow death or
you actually do something about it and
that is why I highlight for example
these techniques now towards in because
that is about moving people's mind
because we should also understand that
if you have a long successful career in
a traditional industry in a traditional
company then you're being brought up in
that one and and then it's actually up
to the management to work heavily in
good time in order to move people's mind
and culture to avoid those aspects but
absolutely if it doesn't work it might
be a win-win for people actually to find
a great career in another industry which
is a little bit more traditional
so both yes or no thank you I think
we're out of time so thank you thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
