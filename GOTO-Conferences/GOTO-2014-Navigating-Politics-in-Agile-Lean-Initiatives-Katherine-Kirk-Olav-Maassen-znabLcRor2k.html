do it once I said Shawn oh how about
your languages so why am I here I've
been friends with Katherine for many
years now too many I mean I have been an
agile coach made a change recently I'm
now a director of sales which we now
call it evil sales guy but I've been
through the agile transitions trying to
move organizations to a more agile way
of working become more effective and
that's upbringing and I have more of an
options approach to just things yeah so
let's get started
why navigating and navigating politics
so as Katherine introduced andrew
coaches as you who here's an agile coach
or has been an agile coach who's a
developer who's a developer in an agile
project cool so as you may have
experienced that if you work in an
organization that's now transitioning
into something agile there's a lot of
resistance and even if you become
successful and you can ask answer
coaches who've been doing this for many
years if they revisit previous
organizations where they've been it's a
challenge to have that change remain in
there although it's been very successful
there are other power structures that
are changing the things that you're
doing so we need to find a way of
dealing with it and that's the focus of
this presentation so it's based on both
our experts from both our perspectives
of both of our experiences we have links
in there of things that we have looked
up and added our own material to it you
will see inconsistencies you will see
things that are not quite polished yet
you will even see conflicting ideas but
will present them
and then it's up to you to decide and
our aim is that you go away with this
and have an opinion about what we've
said yes we do clearly disagree on a few
things that'll be interesting so the
agenda we have an introduction into
politics we look into waterfall
technology angeline hierarchical
structure then we'll do the summary and
then we'll look at how it deal with it
so first summarize the part beforehand
and then how what have we done to to
make it better while we're doing it so
we hope to show you why politics
increases when you put in an agile
linting so politics I sort of went when
I got interested in this because every
time you do a project you think what's
the problem here and it's generally
people and then you think well if we
could just remove the people everything
would be amazing and I was thinking well
politics seems to be a problem and it's
a pattern I'm seeing in all the teams
that I'm dealing with and I thought how
long his politics been around and so I
just did a quick search and found even
Aristotle was writing about it two and a
half one there about thousand years ago
so it's a problem that's quite a long
term issue for me but not all of I have
been looking at politics in terms of the
Oxford definition up here activities
aimed at improving someone's status or
increasing power within an organization
and the other thing that I've got down
the bottom a nice gray light gray so you
can hardly see it is that we have to
remember people died holding on to
political positions you just have to
think about history and current wars so
we have to I think as an industry start
taking this whole idea of politics quite
seriously because it can influence the
outcome of an agile lean application for
instance this is something that really
did happen to me
we had a portfolio board in 2010 a
Kanban portfolio board and it was
getting great results
for the teams and then the executives
came to us and said can you please take
it down and
transfer it to a spreadsheet because
it's forcing the executives to be open
about their priorities and it's causing
conflicts in their team at that higher
level and literally they did do that
they took it down physically and put it
into a spreadsheet and add it on a next
a couple of meetings per week in order
to politically play and land-grab right
because what happens if you make
priorities transparent then everybody
has an opinion you can see a clearly
structure of how you do your
prioritization or if you make that very
public you're exposed all of the
political play and all the possible
maneuvering now you've formalized
everything on how things are decided and
you remove the power that certain people
have over helping the organization in a
particular direction and they resist
that change so in my view Oliv I believe
that politics is a symptom so I come
from an Eastern philosophy Lusaka call
viewpoint and I think it realtor it's an
activity that results from a motion like
frustration pain or fear right where I
actually think that politics is a
natural part of what we do as soon as
you have an organization that is more
than one person you will have politics
you will have a way a game that's being
played of who decides what's doing that
in how much how much they would do that
I think you mean the word interaction
myself fair enough
you'll have interaction so when you talk
to people they think politics is evil or
a symptom whereas it's the same group of
people who are complaining about the
fact that if you do an agile transition
you're not getting the influence that
you want so you actually want to play in
the game but you're ignoring are you
saying that it's not supposed to be
there so it's a reality politics is
there so if you if it's there play the
game and it will help you get the
results that you want
whereas I come from the perspective that
there is something that you can use to
harmonize different people's positions
and it's called reality sorry that's my
view right
so there's some research being done on
power by Paul piff and it shows that if
you play for instance a game of Monopoly
that is unfair
so you have two players and one person
get four times as much money as the
other player if you interview that
person after the game what they'll do
what they'll say is that of course it
makes sense that they won and it has
nothing to do with the fact that they
make four times as much money it's just
the way that it was supposed to be well
if that happens on a small scale you can
imagine what happens if you do that at a
larger scale so we think it's natural to
have more power if you're in a position
of power
interesting alves that same research is
that the people who are in a position of
less power so less influence are better
at reading facial expression so they're
they have more of an empathic link with
other people and even people in power
can actually do that if they imagine
themselves of having less power so
there's some and some effects that are
in place that if you have power you kind
of start to care less about people
already how to become less sensitive but
you can train yourself to become or stay
sensitive to other people
one thing enough knows myself and that's
from the same research and I see that is
that if you're in a position of power
your wording will change so if you in a
collaborative stage you'll ask things
more politely if you're in a and that
that's what I've noticed myself I'm not
paying attention to it I'm a director of
sales now I have some direct reports and
I will use more directive language in
certain cases so this on a subconscious
level they've seen that in the skewed
monopoly they do that they see that and
if they do to research in in
organizations so apparently that whole
power thing makes that changes people I
have to say giving you some feedback
here all of that you have become much
more arrogant since you've taken on the
Director of Sales wrong yes so we have a
case study example right here
all right technology industry ah and so
I came from an Aboriginal I was brought
up in an Aboriginal tribe because my
parents were hippies
and when I came into white society I
then eventually came to Technology I
discovered this whole idea of
psychopathic behavior and when you're in
technology apparently this attracts
psychopathic leadership you may know of
a few people yourself ah and so there's
a lot of jobs like CEO sales people
media types that are often found in the
technology industry and here's a book if
you want to do a little bit more reading
called snakes in suits which explains
this whole concept if you're interested
yeah and if you want to know how to spot
a psychopathic behavior there's a whole
checklist by that author that has 12
categories but these just five which are
people are superficially charming
psychopaths are really really charming
but if you go under a layer deeper they
tend to be quite rude manipulative lack
of empathy lack of guilt so they will do
anything to get their results but they
wanted they'll manipulate people and
they will play nice just to to get what
they want and they don't feel guilty
afterwards the other thing to remember
is that psychopaths I only make up 3% of
the population and they are also very
apt at mimicking empathy which makes you
sometimes do get a misunderstanding of
that so that's been an interesting
discovery for myself but you can
actually turn off compassion a normal
person can turn off compassion and
whereas Psychopaths can't feel
compassion and there's a wide spectrum
of psychopathy so it isn't just that you
know you're a psychopath and that's it
sometimes people are slightly like a
psychopathic or not and normal people
can turn off their empathy for others
whereas the psychopath has a physical
limitation they don't that the part of
their brain doesn't light up at all when
it comes to others so the interesting
thing that I noticed when I came into
this society is there's this historical
legal and financial structure which
encourages psychopathic old-style
management behavior and that doesn't
mean the people
in the company are psychopaths it just
means that the way that it's structured
is psychopathic and you can actually
watch the show the documentary the
corporation it's available on YouTube
which where they diagnose a corporation
in a court of law because it's seen as a
human being in a court of law they say
well what type of person is a
corporation and of course they come up
with its a psychopath so as I said
normal people can't earn compassion off
and think like a psychopath but a
psychopath can't go the other way around
that's going to be interesting a bit
later if you go back one and this is
sort of proven in there there was a
little study where two hundred people
two hundred and three people were deemed
as having management potential and now
put into a group and they were studied
for a while it found out that they had a
higher rate of psychopathic behavior the
other thing that's interesting which
adds to this equation because all of
these pieces of information that we are
giving you are going to come together at
some point and prove how agile and lean
caused difficulties with politics that
we have a bunch of introverts apparently
in our industry I am one of them but
I've learnt to sort of deal with the
outside world and you can actually see
you can read about it in this quite the
power of introverts in a world that
can't stop talking but we're becoming
much more popular now for example Big
Bang Theory and there are a couple of
books out there if you want to search on
it saying the benefits of introversion
and how it can actually give value to
companies so that's a good thing so if
you look at where Angela's coming from
angela is here as anti movement towards
waterfall waterfall ancestral winston
who's knows about winston Royce okay
just a half minute introduction Winston
Royce is the one responsible for
waterfall now he's not responsible in a
normal sense he wrote a paper in 1971
describing an ideal process which is
very much like a waterfall however the
Department of Defense in the u.s. at
that time the biggest IT employer liked
it very much said this is the standard
going to do that on page 2 of that same
paper Winston rosette and this will
never work
and we've suffered from that for 40
years he made some recommendations and
how things can improve program design
comes first document design do it twice
planned control and monitor testing
involved the customer which all sounds
very agile but we've never actually come
to that page and implemented that part
you don't want to turn the page on No so
Waterfall is become very successful
because managers like it you can plan it
you can control it if the firts like it
as well because you don't need to
interact you just get your document you
get your stuff done that's cool
so nothing wrong with wonderful as you
were saying so psychopaths don't have to
collaborate they just exert their power
and introverts can apportion blame or
avoid confrontation by doing
documentation or saying that's that's
somebody else's problem so there you can
see why we really took to the idea of
waterfall quite quickly but this is the
biggest problem is that our industry
consists of people working with people
to make tools that help people interact
and so even when we had this structure
of waterfall
despite waterfall there was a lot of
interaction and it started and even
waterfall had to make interaction work
and as we see you know the industry
started to have an incredible amount of
change which is now getting to the point
where we've talked about continuous
delivery canoes integration and so on
and so on and so on
so this had the effect of obviously
creating these little cultures called
agile mean ah yes
so in my view because I have been grown
I have been brought up in an Aboriginal
tribe I the word tribe where I grew up
actually meant the equivalent of
nationality so you can't really turn up
to someone and say I'm so glad you're
Australian it's something you're born
into so for me I've had to do a shift
and understand that in this
environment the word tribe sometimes
means peer group but I wanted to point
out that there are different tribes in
different environments and it's just my
little rant so in my particular tribe we
were in the desert in saying if you look
at the Australia and you put your finger
right in the centre of Australia and go
little bit left it's pretty much there
that I grew up there's a lot of space
limited resources harsh context and
whoever was best to lead at the time did
we had a bunch of specialists hunters
foragers elders and perhaps facilitators
and healers who would interact on a day
to day basis in family groups but
generally have a peer group that they
interacted with periodically sort of
like conferences where they would get
together share skills knowledge do some
strategic thinking but as I said the key
thing was that if you had to survive in
this harsh environment the way you
needed to do that was to have a bunch of
specialists collaborating together in a
family group because you needed one of
everybody in order to survive so in my
head and someone please tell me if there
is an official term for this I sort of
think of it like a rotational hierarchy
this is the family group here who
collaborate to survive and lead when
required so when we're hunting the
hunters in charge when we're foraging
the foragers in charge and we kind of
follow that person because they have the
expertise however that particular person
will use their peers when they go off
and have their conferences if you like
to say their ceremonies in which where
they can compare with and see I get
their value of their sense of mastery
from right and this is not just in
tribes we see that in Western society as
well in my spare time I'm involved with
a search-and-rescue dog group as a group
leader and what we have there is a bunch
of volunteers who are trained to do
search-and-rescue work with their dog
but they have their professions as well
we have a fireman in there we've got a
policeman in there we've got a nurse in
there we've got structural engineers in
there and although I'm officially in
charge the only thing that I do when I'm
there is make sure that whoever has the
right knowledge in that particular
context leads the group
so that's the same kind of rotation
aerial leadership to make sure that
you're successful as a group so when you
look at that Darlene that's pretty much
how it operates in my view so although I
don't think of that John lien as a tribe
I do think it has a tribal way of
working and so we have a bunch of
specials a tech design facilitator etc
they aren't competing against each other
they collaborate together and get their
sense of mastery and value from the
external peer group the reason that
introverts will suffer through
collaborating is because with their
external hierarchy or peer group
knowledge elevates their position and
gains them acceptance so they're willing
to suffer through collaborating together
in order to get knowledge so that they
get a sense of mastery with their peer
group that they measure themselves
against which is what they feel attached
to separately from the actual small team
that they work in I think I said that
one so we can see here clashing
structures so we've got a static old
style corporate structure which comes
from a legacy of class systems and
factories which is in place legally and
financially so it's going to be very
difficult to remove and that seems to be
overlaying this new structure of working
which is rotational there's its I should
mention here that political science has
done a hell of a lot of research in this
area and it is well worth going on
having a look at things like Halak recei
adhocracy and header aki so we don't
need to reinvent the wheel so here it
comes
why why why does politics increase well
if you look at the traditional structure
you might have fortnightly meetings so
the introvert sphere is if you put in a
Darlene suddenly there'll be people go
from say one fortnightly meeting to 13
alright here we have the bosses hoorah
so in our traditional structure the boss
you know says something and we all go
and do it but when we put in agile and
lean
we say maybe we will do it so this is
the this is where we're headed
this is what Oliver and I notice is that
you have psychopathic self-interested
behavior generated as we discussed you
have a bunch of introverts with
avoidance tendencies you add to that a
hell of a lot of high pressure change
from the industry itself then you add a
very collaborative and interactive agile
and lean process and it has to be that
way because we're constantly adapting to
the rapid change around us so we need to
interact about it and then you encase it
and put pressure from a traditional
static hierarchical power structure
right over the top and it is no wonder
when we squeeze all this together that
it becomes a hotbed of politics it's not
our fault
it is the context so how do we deal with
it well there's already some tools
available within agile be the DTV this
whole list of things helped us to manage
the politics available out there but
it's not enough no so I've noticed that
we do we have started as an industry to
develop rules things like safe as ways
and means of dealing with structure so
there's this this chaotic structure but
the more structure and rules we put in
place the less innovation and the less
adaptability to rapid change there is so
I have been trying to explore and find a
more simplified strategy that could help
us on how and when to apply these tools
that it could benefit in terms of
politics so I looked at in a rapidly
changing industry which relies on
innovation I mean even Apple recently
it's not innovating fast enough
apparently for all of us users and it
deals with tricky technical and people
problems so the thing that I saw
personally that we needed help to get
insight because without insights without
realization we cannot innovate but we're
stealing it more and more often in order
to innovate at the rate of demand in our
industry we also need help obviously
dealing with people and that's not going
to go away we see that thousands of
years ago people having trouble with
people and hello we're still having
problems with people so for me I've
investigated Eastern philosophy so I
study Buddhism to find ways of
eliminating suffering in the workplace
and the reason I do that is because
Buddhism focuses a lot on caring about
people which sounds nice and hug you but
it's actually considering people
problems so I'll have a bit of that and
I found that was what was particularly
useful was Mohave Vipassana with passing
areas about facilitating insight there
are models within it that help you
facilitate insight and I need that right
so the other thing that I found was maja
see he lived in the last hundred years
so it's a very recent form of Buddhism
he got very sad that there were ton of
lay people out there who were trying to
work in the field and wanted to have
insight and enlightenment but were too
busy so he decided to strip away all of
the ceremonies or everything he could
from Buddhism and come down to the basic
practices that anybody could do and give
them the right to have insight you
didn't have to go off and meditate on a
mountain with a bunch of you know spirit
guides so in my head what I kind of came
up with and all I've got his different
viewpoints is I will reference a doline
tools and practices and I will pull them
out in a strategy format which I'll show
you it's just very loose and so that I
can respond contextually to any
political situation that comes up the
reason being that people are all
different and the different interactions
of different people means you can't come
up with a structure that's too rigid
when you deal with this type of person
then you behave this way it doesn't work
and I found that tools can have multiple
effects so I can ban bored if any of you
have done can burn you're displaying
what is to a group of people now if what
is
is can I swear here yeah no I'll be
polite but bad then the people looking
at it
are gonna feel bad or sometimes they may
not because they realize that they're
going to be changing this into something
good but just visualizing a problem does
not necessarily give you a great
reaction you're not going to look at
something go wow that's a load of crap
you see and so we can't assume that just
because we're using these tools that
it's going to give the reaction that we
expect because people react differently
so I went and had a look at approach the
way we approach when we're going to do
the tool who we're going to do whoo-hoo
we're going to show the tool to or
utilize it and how we're going to
utilize it I think becomes key to
adoption in order to ensure that it's
successful so the strategy and if you
want to know this in more details I said
you can go onto YouTube and watch my
talk which basically goes through these
steps in much more detail the strategy I
have is there are 1 2 3 4 elements to
the approach you need when you're trying
to deal with politics
the first one is equanimity you need to
be able to bring clarity openness and
curiosity without negative emotion to a
situation so you can just sit there and
see it for what it is with no aversion
and the reason we want that is we want
to see the situation that is clearly so
that we can deal with it in reality to
get effective action so we need to know
where we are in order to know how we're
going to get where we want to go for
instance if I said to Olav I would like
to go Holland and he said to me where
are you and I said I don't know how can
he help me get there we need to know
where we are the second thing that the
monks talk about is generating insight
and when they talk about that they
saying right understanding so we need to
have a genuine right understanding about
something so that we can have an
effective response
Jeff Patton's ideas very into
thing the whole idea is eternal quest
building the right thing versus building
a thing right
you need insight to know which of those
you're going to use but this third thing
has basically turned me into a a blonde
that talks about compassion but I'm
actually talking about it in terms of
compassion as a database of information
that we can use to understand whether or
not a people solution will work that's
what I mean and you will now have the
hug so the thing is compassion helps us
generate effective action when we're
dealing with human beings when we're
dealing with people this is the thing
that Psychopaths can't do so it
establishes the likelihood of success
with a system of people who are
interacting with and for people the
fourth thing that I have here is
sustainable actions and pace if you want
to oh well politics is never going to
end
is it really reactions to tools is never
going to end
people are going to get attached to
stuff people are going to get aversions
to things people are going to be
ignorant
so whatever solution we have needs to be
sustainable in some form that's a long
slide so I'll keep going an example of
this equanimity is I see I eat a lot of
junk food right it doesn't really give
you any action oh great
an insight would be I understand why and
no I shouldn't eat junk food still not
much action but compassion is different
because what it says is I feel how much
this affects my body my family and my
future and in that it instigates action
a desire for action so the Buddhists
talk about this as that's why compassion
so the Dalai Lama most recently said
that compassion is the radicalism of
today interesting consider that we're in
a psychopathic business environment so
you can look this up there's some reefs
right professor singer in cognitive
neuroscience and it seems to map
directly to Eastern philosophy that I've
looked at
she says that empathy can lead to
burnout whereas compassion motivates for
instance if olive is apathetic and I
empathize with him I will become
apathetic
where is compassion what do you mean
Katherine oh you were signing out you
know I want to help you here and
compassion is where I look at Olav look
at look at that problem and I think to
myself how can I solve this situation
yeah and I develop a plan of action
it's a motivated active since so I want
to help him get rid of his empathy why
he didn't answer my emails for three
weeks about the presentation that I was
about to do with him
yeah that's kind of thing go back one
yeah so here's the interesting thing
remember we talked about we need grit
and determination we need ways to make
what we do resilient compassion this
lady claims increases activation in the
brain networks associated with
affiliation and reward we actually get a
little reward for being compassionate
and that becomes something we can do
over and over and over again see
psychopaths and you can read at a
McNab's book he's written it with a guy
from Oxford they say you don't need
empathy
you don't need compassion it's a load of
crap right he says just ask yourself
what am I here to achieve and empathy
doesn't help you get there so he trained
CEOs that's what what Andy does but here
is where psychopathic behavior fails us
remember we're in an industry that
people interacting with people to make
tools for people to interact right so
it's a little bit different for us
Psychopaths can't access that database
of compassion in order to understand
what people are intended solutions or
initiatives might be like to experience
you can make up whatever
approach you want to make up but if
people are going to adopt it great it
means nothing they can't use compassion
tools to increase the likelihood of
success of a people orientated solution
that's interesting that was very very
interesting to me you can talk now
eleven well thank you very much I could
get to share the stage so my way of
dealing is that while I use a lot of
agile tools in communicating with people
if you talk about retrospective sprints
that doesn't help me if I want to get to
a higher understanding within the
organization and help them understand
what we're trying to do so I believe
that we should have or at least what I
do is I use options thinking and I used
that to explain what we're doing and by
being aware of multiple options and this
is actually what's underlying many of
the agile practice that we have we tried
to postponed it the point at where we
actually commit to a certain thing where
we have to decide on a certain kind of
action let's just plan for two weeks and
then we'll adjust as we get feedback
which is basically just postponing parts
of the planning which is a good thing
but the options way of explaining it
helps us to get into a conversation with
people who are not used to talking about
technology in teams and that kind of
thing so I've worked together with Chris
Matz who's supposed to be my better half
I just found out we got him to me right
and we came up to this let's call it a
model which is just three lines 14 words
options have value meaning that if you
have the option to still do something
that is more valuable than just the
thing of doing it so for instance you
can now book a flight to visit Cuba that
has a particular value to you but there
might be a regime change later on
no and you no longer have that option
available to you
so there's value in the fact that you
can choose at a later stage options
expire
at some point an option isn't there
anymore so you have to be aware at what
condition at some point happens which
could be a timer it could be the regime
change that that option that you wanted
to have is no longer there so you have
to be proactive and make sure that the
things that you talked about and that
you tried to plant that you do that at
the right time and last thing is never
commit early unless you know why and
that is about if you know when a certain
point is where there's no reasonable way
back you at least have to know why it's
either because the option expires or if
you commit to something now so you put
it in this particular kind of
architecture it will allow you more
choice later on or it is because
otherwise you cannot do that anymore it
would be very costly so as long as
you're aware of things you can't commit
to things but do it consciously the
other thing is that as Kathryn said
politics is not going away it's been
here for more than 2,000 years it will
be here in two thousand years it will
still be here before I argue with you if
you go back one slide can you apply that
in a people sense which one well knowing
about real options how does that help
you with politics people interaction
politics right it helped so real options
help me helps me in interacting with
people where I can for instance a
director wants to have a particular
choice so as soon as you present him
with a problem he wants to have a
solution so you propose a solution okay
let's do that however you can use this
as a way of saying as a solution instead
of finding a solution you can say let's
find out more information let's keep
that option open until we find more
information and we'll there's we're
going to find the information in this
particular way so instead of writing in
with a solution I provide him with
actually multiple solutions with options
and we'll decide at a later time buying
us more information and that will help
me get over his resistance if I
propose a particular solution yes but
what happens if he just he sees he was
being indecisive if he's so if I
actually this pose that's if you do the
option use to a extreme then you're
postponing everything so you're trying
to not commit to anything and this is
really where the third line is never
quite literally unless you know why if
that's a danger with that particular
person then you at some point you have
the experience that you commit to
certain things but at least you know why
and that point you I will try to find
the things I can commit you that have
still have the most flexibility from my
perspective I'll let you off for now
thank you so your thought is there will
always be politics so multix will be
here for the next 2000 year and not
playing politics is not an option if
you're in an organization it doesn't
matter where you are you are affected by
politics you are actually playing in
that game and it is a game but it's a
serious game this is a social game and
not playing is not a possibility but I
think Kathryn has different opinion I do
I have a different opinion in that in
Eastern philosophy there is one thing
that binds everybody and that is their
shared reality and so you can heart you
can find ways and means to harmonize the
situation based on data and the reality
for instance both sides say the agile
teams and the executives have a common
goal to make money right eventually
right by the end of it and so that can
become the criteria by which you can
harmonize the current reality that is a
reality right now how do you achieve
that reality well you utilize agile and
lean tools influence our organization by
getting towards your goal yes but I
would hesitate to use too many options
so there is politics involved however
you want to spin it it's
the way it's a different view oh we have
some questions
then you'll need options so if you know
that politics is going to be around
anyway and you want to have a chance at
influencing what happens in your
organization or within your team learn
the way to play the game of power and
power is an ugly word and we don't like
it but we do like the effect of it so as
long as we don't do it publicly we like
it as soon as we're in the group and we
talk about it it's evil so how do you
play it correctly well one is master
your emotions as soon as you start being
emotional you start becoming
irrationally start being let by your
feelings a playing in the cards of the
other players in comedy that's so we
don't disagree that much there's part of
that what's part of playing politics
correctly resonates very well with
Kathryn saying distance yourself from
the present look at what's happening now
and connect that to what you want to
achieve in the future and what you've
seen in the past not from a guilt
perspective but learn from your
experience that's inside just saying no
appearance matters so it matters how you
do things so you can protest openly that
will affect the position of the other
player in the game however if you do
that privately you have a better chance
of having success compassion and then
there's patience as waiting if you want
to achieve a goal so as an agile coach I
would like a company to become
successful and I think that they can do
that by using agile methodologies and
putting agile in place if I want to have
that change in one week or six weeks not
gonna work so I need to allow the
politics to play its part I need to
influence people I need to make sure
that things will get people get to their
own conclusion that agile is the best
way of doing it otherwise it's my idea
and it will be shut off anyway greed and
determination and then there's see the
circumstances not
and evil so see things as they are if
somebody objects to your plan it's not
because that person is evil hasn't evil
goal there is something that why he
thinks that that plan is not good enough
to help this organization get to the
next stage so let's get back to getting
alignment on the goals that's also by
influencing the right people this whole
social game it's a game plate with
people so you have to be nice Catherine
I'm trying Oliver and be indirect so not
direct Catherine or directly in summary
is ever-changing technology industry be
always aware that people are interacting
with people to make solutions and
software for people to interact so
although it's a technology that industry
that we're working on it's really about
people consider that bigger picture when
you're suffering from politics I think
well at least this helped myself and I
suppose it helped you just sort of see
it in this form that we have
psychopathic self-interested behavior we
add to it some introverts we get high
pressure change we're putting in some
collaborative interactive agile and lean
we encase it with a traditional
hierarchical power structure and that's
what's we're suffering from as an
industry and the thing about it is that
I would like to look at this with
equanimity and compassion and get some
insight about what to do about it this
is these are just ideas these are just
discussions we're having in order to
create a solution so this is the
overview of the strategies that we've
used as you see there overlap that using
different words slightly different
motivations but it's trying to get to
the same effect
so finally ah this is just a two
different perspectives this is something
that we've experienced over our working
career that we've looked into we
presented it this to you we hope that
you'll take this with you I hope that
you either violently agree or you
violently disagree it's the way that
collaborate Katherine and I collaborate
we do actually care about each other no
worries and look into this look into the
power of compassion look in there's
scientific material about there that it
makes sense now I'm not a big fan of all
that hippie stuff that we do I don't
like all that hugging in there but there
are scientific data that actually shows
that it's very effective so look into
that why have you got this at the end I
tried to trick you in saying that
develop compassion for power so no well
there is power structure in
organizations so and it's not just one
person or oh this is because you're
Director of Sales I see we have to have
compassion for those in power you have
to do it in the evil ads approach we got
it all right so there is there are ways
of steering an organization and there's
looking to the science behind that as
well it will help you become more
effective in what you want to do and
with that we want to think each other
and you guys we'd love to get feedback
so use the conference app for that or
contact us directly we're here for the
rest of the day and otherwise well you
can find us on Twitter exactly let's
have a hug
thanks guys please chat to us after do
we have time for questions two minutes
if anybody has any questions do the
Oprah Winfrey thing can you switch back
to the kind of psychopathy evaluation
slide this one no there was a checklist
for what makes you psychopath
it's just five
no it is yeah kind of you know I'm
looking at this around kind of yes yes
yes yes yes so where does that leave me
now there are spectrums of that
compassion has equanimity in it and you
can mistake that for being careless or
that you don't care but the fact that
you see problems human problems and you
want to solve them
that's compassionate these things this
is just something that I think you put
up there but you're making me answer for
which I kind of agree with and kind of
don't right so this is just a the top
five of things that you can recognize
easily so don't worry about yourself
there's seven other factors that you can
rate yourself at so it's really things
that you can look for if you see that
kind of behavior that might be triggers
for you just think okay that person
might have a higher number on the
psychopath scale but it's not that
you're a psychopath at that point I was
controlling but on a more conceptual
level what do you do when you spot
people that rate high like that in an
organization and you yeah you know you
have to kind of start dealing with them
or or working around them I noticed a
catherine once answer that firstly you
value them so I'm not saying they're bad
people but you need to know that they
don't have access to the compassion
database so you need to set up
structures within an organization and
tools within an organization that will
give you that information and that
person needs to understand that they
don't have this ability to see this
except whether or not a solution will be
successful when it's in relation to
people so I think it's not about saying
Psychopaths are all bad and we don't
want them because they can be fantastic
to bring into a very messy political
situation where they cut through to the
point but we have to just mitigate
against them occasionally because they
can start making decisions which harm
people and are in their own
self-interest which is not necessarily
in line with what we're trying to do is
in a corporation
I thought so some other questions up
there if not oh yes oh so the final
question no just an explanation for the
list so I've studied that in one level
deeper so over the plateau paths can be
chained in hysterical histrionic in
narcissistic and an obsessive compulsive
there is also as I have a list on my
computer I have them from from the
statistic manual of the psychological
American Cancer Association this is very
thick book on there you have the
clinical diagnostic criteria I can show
you the book and this is a mixture
between half of them is from
narcissistic and superficially charming
is hysterical yeah yeah and McCann
better better understanding if you study
all the personality disorders this are
11 and and I talked about in my keynote
about artistic ones you have also one of
them so and the others have difficulties
to deal with you and and in principle
it's a fine idea to study all the eleven
personality disorders from a
psychological organization really thank
you very much all right thanks guys
have fun we'll get to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
