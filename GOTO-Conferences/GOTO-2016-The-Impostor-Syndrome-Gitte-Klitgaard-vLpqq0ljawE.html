call me kita click God except the dots
I'm not only clip there which it's
totally not but it's kind of cute um
some here to talk about the imposter
syndrome and first I will show you the
obligatory slide yes we have this app
and you can also ask questions and then
the questions will go into the track
host and he can read them out and if you
don't do this we can also have questions
afterwards or if you don't feel
comfortable speaking in here I will also
be available afterwards so sometimes I
have these slides about me sometimes I
don't and whether I have them or not
people say they need the other ones so
I'm lazy fired on Twitter if you've been
following the Twitter stream from go to
Amsterdam you may have noticed that I
tweet a little bit so beware ever if you
follow me I do tweet a lot I'm a natural
coach and basically what we do is we go
around and we hug trees and that's what
I do for a living
I used to be well used to be pro camera
and a tester I found out that what I'm
really really good at is actually
working with people and what I'm really
really even better at is working with
geeks because I get them so I started
becoming an agile coach or does it show
very well but I'm actually I'm actually
Hawking a real tree in Barcelona on this
picture so I do this I go out into
organisations I prefer working with the
teams because that's the one I relate to
most but I also do work with managers I
do introduce all kinds of processes I
have taken the oath of non-elite Ian's I
do not say that any process is wrong at
least until I tried it in that situation
I think that all processes are wrong
some are good just like models we can
use them in some situations so I'm a
pragmatic agile coach I am also a
speaker I sometimes code speak this is
from a talk about having the courage or
workshop about having a courage to be
yourself so kind of a two topics one is
a bit more agile once I talk about
retrospectives I talk about why do I
isn't
Gordon why change is hard and then I
have the other part which is I talk
about the things that very few people
talk about so I talk about having a
courage to be yourself I talk about
stress and depression and why it kills
us and I talked about impostor syndrome
so this is a fairly new one
I wasn't sure anyone would liked it but
like one hour after I did it the first
time I was hired to do it in two more
places so apparently this is something
that relates to a lot of people I also
offer free hugs this is from a big
conference in Germany I was talking to
this guy and the woman comes up to me
she just talks to me and then she goes
away again um so this is interesting I
do this because I think we pay way too
little attention to each other we don't
see each other we just walk past each
other when I give a hug I give my full
attention to that one person so it
doesn't have to be a physical hug
because a lot of people don't like
hugging it can also just be giving my
attention to that one person and I think
this is something we like a lot in our
work life and in a daily life so this is
why I offer this um I'm a little bit
crazy so I do have a be brave tattoo
which is because you have to have the
courage to be yourself I was almost 40
before I found out that it's okay to be
a geek it's okay to be a grown-up and
like Star Wars and I just got my new
Jedi robe so I have to wear it in this
one and yes it's from Jedi robes that
come you can buy this is Luke's of
course and I'm an end I'm very much in
and I like to teach the kids that you
can be anything you want you can still
play as a grown-up until my nephew was
seven he thought my job was to be a
pirate and he was so disappointed when
he found out I was not and because I'm a
girl he thinks I'm one of the good
pirates because only men can be evil
pirates I haven't told him about Bloody
Mary yet but he will
so for today I'm going to talk about the
gist of the impostor syndrome I am going
to talk about why I am actually talking
about this and then I'm going to go a
bit more into what it is and what's
actually good about them pasta syndrome
so we tend to take all of these things
that are different
depression neurodiversity
Asperger's imposter syndrome and see
them as something bad but in each one of
these there's something good for
instance with depression it turns out
that depressive people are the best at
estimating they give the most realistic
estimates you would think that they
would give the most negative estimates
but it actually turns out that
depressive people have a much better
view of reality than other people so the
gist of this is basically this I don't
know it's not really a good picture but
this is a cat in the middle with two
Huskies so that is basically what the
impostor syndrome is at some point point
somebody's going to find out I'm
actually not a husky so this is Rosie
she was raised by these two Huskies and
she actually does believe she is husky
and it was just a picture that her
owners put up so so this cat will not
believe you if you tell her she's not a
husky except as he doesn't speak human
language either so basically um this is
from the coach coach book everyone else
is better than me I'm not as good as
people think and one day somebody's
going to find out this is something that
a lot of people suffer from especially
intelligent people what I do is actually
not really that good I was just lucky to
be here at some point somebody's gonna
come up to me and figure out I'm
actually not a Jedi this is actually not
really Luke's rope it's just a copy and
this I'm sorry it's not a lightsaber
it's inflatable which makes it really
nice to travel with but it's not a real
lightsaber and that is actually how you
feel the thing is that people feel like
this most of them will actually be a
Jedi they just feel like this is how I
am I'm just plastic and something I
bought in a shop I'm actually not a
really good web developer I was just in
the right place at the right time I just
happened to do this a friend of my told
me to have a PhD counselor who was a
professor for more than 40 years said he
feels like at some point something's
gonna come up to me he's going to tap me
on the shoulder and saying I'm sorry
it's been a mistake you should never
been a professor for that long you don't
know what you're doing so this is
something that's very common in a lot of
us and yet we don't speak about it so
why am I talking about it my kind of
agile coaching is very much by intuition
I listen to people and I suggest what I
think they should do of course a lot of
it is based on me studying computer
science me actually being in a
development team me being in a lot of
organization but most of what I do is
based on my intuition and I know a lot
of agile coaches who knows all about
systems theory and complexity theory and
psychological favorites and everything
and I keep thinking I'm actually not an
agile coach actually I don't know enough
about this I don't know enough about
queueing teeth to theory I haven't read
the goal yet I'm supposed to be reading
Thinking Fast and Slow and at some point
somebody's going to come up to me and
say hey you know what you're not a real
a child coach
you just do things paying tuition you
don't know what you're doing um this is
because in 2011 I met the agile tribe in
Germany and I felt for the first time in
my life I found out that yes there are
people like me there are people who want
to make the world better there are
people who think dragons are cool
also grownups and I think pirates are
cool and Star Wars is cool and that is
okay it changed my life from being grey
and hiding in the corner to now entering
in a room and as you may notice I'm not
really grey and hiding anymore though my
rope does hide me a little bit so I
started wearing colors and stuff and I'm
like I was so lucky I was there but
actually I was not actually the reason I
was there because I was a crew at go-to
even before long before what's called
go-to in the good old days I started as
a student crew ended up being there for
15 years so my last time as a crew was
in 2014 I would have students staying at
my place student crew because I mean I
was at home anyway I had an air mattress
and some some duvets because
in my house and this one gay guy stayed
at my house and we talked and he heard
about this agile coach camp and he
father would be something for me so
actually I was not lucky to be there I
was there because I shared my home with
a stranger I was sharing which is part
of what a lot of agile is we share we
help each other and that's why I ended
up there but still I kind of have this
feeling I'm actually just lucky what
happens when people find out I'm
actually not a speaker I mean I've only
been speaking for three years and I did
twenty five talks and at some point
somebody's going to find out I'm
actually not a speaker I'm just me and I
do have this feeling I know it's my
sound a bit pretentious but that's
actually how I feel and the reason I
started doing this talk was because I
was invited to speak at London in Kampen
days so see it comes up to me and says
hi I must say I would like you to speak
at my conference but like okay hi I'm
Peter who are you and it tells me about
this conference and I say okay so what
do you want me to talk about I don't
carry I hear you're good speaker so a
guy I never met before comes up to me
and tells me this and I'm like and
I've been wanting to look more into the
imposter syndrome and so I decided I'm
going to do a talk about it because I'm
not the only one who feels this way
there must be a lot of other people feel
this way and but we're terrified to
speak about it so if nobody else will
speak about it I will that's kind of
what I do so what is it um some facts
about it it was described first time in
1978 by two psychologists who found out
that there were a lot of high achieving
women who are talking themselves down
there's still debate today is this
something that only happens to women is
it something that happens to two men as
well I believe it happens to men as well
especially after my last talk when a guy
came up to me and said I almost cried I
didn't think anyone else was feeling
this way so I don't care about what the
all the surveys say men suffer from this
as well
some service actually say that up to 70%
of the Western population has been
suffering from this at one point in
their life 70 percent have been feeling
this way so the definition it's about
high achieving individuals who has an
inability to internalize their
accomplishments and a persistent fear of
being exposed posed as a fraud so it's
also called a fraud syndrome the reason
were not the reason what what happened
is that no matter how many times you get
proof that you're really really good you
get a pay rise
you get good ratings when you give a
talk yet people come up to you and thank
you you are not able to internalize this
you are not able to take it in and
actually believe it yourself and what
you are thinking what I am thinking
sometimes is at some point it's going to
find out I'm not as smart as they think
I am I'm really really good at
pretending to be smart and pretending to
be an agile coach and a speaker and at
some point somebody's going to find me
out and what they found out during the
survey was also it's a they went into
high achieving women they have faith in
their intelligence and a lot of high
achieving women have no confidence I see
this very often really really high
achieving women who will say no I'm not
really good enough when I asked them you
should go speak at conferences we want
more female speakers not because female
speakers is a virtue in itself but
because we want to have a diversity we
want men women different colors
different well even all genders this
non-binary it's a spectrum we want all
kinds of people to be speaking because
we are all kinds of people and by having
the speakers of all kinds we will be
able to give a much better message we
will hear it from different parts
because we all think differently but a
lot of women lack this confidence and
what I also see is a lot of men like
this confidence they're just really
really good at bullshitting most of them
a lot actually if you see people who are
really really confident a lot of them
are just really really insecure inside
and they even more afraid they're going
to be find out so the result was that
actually these women had a lot of
diligence
it's a horrible word what actually means
is they work a lot what they do is
because they think that somebody's going
to find out that I'm actually not really
good I'm not going to be able to live up
to my last results they work and they
work and they work and they do things
really really well we really thoroughly
and allowed them we'll be perfectionists
so this one of the characteristics which
often also leads to a burnout because
you try to be perfect you try to do
everything so nobody is going to find
out that you are actually not really
good at what you do so if I just work
really really really really hard
nobody's going to found out that I
cheated them and again this feeling of
being phony this feeling of I'm not
really how people perceive me I'm not
really good at this I'm really not a
good manager I'm not a good developer
I'm not a good test or whatever it's
just something people perceive they
often use charm I'm sorry you can't
really see the pictures I tried to put
in as many cat pictures as possible this
is a cat and posing as a penguin you'll
get the slides afterwards so often they
found out that these women use their
charm to try to get more recognition and
more knowledge meant and often they
would go to their superiors whether it
was a manager a CEO a professor whatever
they would go to the managers and almost
beg to be acknowledged beg to get
recognition and when they got this they
would actually blame it on their charm
they would blame it on I'm actually
really likeable and again I've tried
this myself so the reason I'm here is
because Captain Kirk came up to me in
London so I know catchman from other
conferences came up to me and says hey
do you want to a talk and go to Berlin
at my track
and part of me is kind of like yes this
is really important we need to talk
about another part it's like maybe it's
just because Katherine likes me maybe it
is because I'm a nice person
and what I also know what my logical
brain is that nobody always very very
few is going to put me on a stage at a
big conference where people actually pay
to come if I'm not a good speaker I'm
going to be in a panel also in Berlin
nobody puts me on a panel with Linda
ricing if I'm not a good speaker that
scares the out of me someone's
going to find out I'm not good enough
before that happens and still I keep
thinking it's because Kathryn likes me
and that is also one of the symptoms of
imposter syndrome there is often very
little display of confidence because if
you show confidence then people might
pull you down if you show that you're
confident in something people might
actually go in and look at you and find
out that you're not really good at this
so they avoid displaying confidence and
a lot of them self or from burnout and
sleep deprivation and I think we see
this very much in our industry as well
we see a lot of people burning out and
some of it is caused by sleep
deprivation because you can never ever
do all you want I'm still struggling
with this I want to do so many things
I've started setting no to the things I
don't want to do but saying no to things
that you want to do is horrible there's
so many places to go so many books to
read so many people to meet so many
things to learn and I want to do
everything and that's one of the reasons
we burnout it's because we want to do
all these things and what people who are
then passed a symptom what often happens
is they feel like they have to if I
don't know all these things I'm not good
enough I'm not going to be able to keep
my job
my wife my husband whatever I'm not good
enough if I don't do all of
things because if I don't do all of
these things they're going to find out
I'm a fake and throw me out so this
leads to burnout and sleep deprivation
which as you can see on one of my talks
on the internet the big Internet can
lead to stress and depression and some
people start killing themselves and
stuff it's actually big problem in
DevOps at the moment is that young
people are killing themselves so in the
u.s. they are talking about it being a
phenomena
like they have in Japan which is
work-related suicide this is a big big
problem and impostor syndrome is one of
the things that can lead to this so this
from the coaches coach book which is by
Jeff watts
this is how people feel inside if I can
do it it can be very hard I find this is
often something that we have is that if
I can do it it's not very difficult
because it feels easy to me but maybe it
feels easy to me because I did this ten
thousand times
maybe it's easy to me because it's
natural because my brain is mathematical
maybe that's why when I was studying
computer science I was I hadn't coded
before computer science and I was
working so the guy rubber master thesis
would have been coding since I think
since he was born at least he was that
good at coding and I kept looking at him
and seeing them I'm really really poor
coder but actually I'm an OK coder but
what I'm really really good at is making
sure we get everything that things are
tested that we actually deliver
something that people want and that
people need I'm really good at making
requirements that are not it has to be
as easy as possible to use try
implementing that and that is actually a
real requirement from one of my first
projects was the system has to be as
easy as possible to use which is quite
difficult to test or verify or code it
has to be fast those are some of the
things I'm really good at and what I'm
really good at is making a team gel
helping teams work together
and to me I kind of feel like well I
don't really do anything I just listen
to people a little bit and talk to them
and figure out what they didn't need and
that's basically all I do it's not that
hard and that is kind of also one of the
symptoms of the imposter syndrome if I
can do it can't be that hard I was so
lucky I was just there at that time if I
hadn't been at Dien London came back ken
Mendes when Catherine had come in would
I actually be here maybe maybe not
does that mean I'm not a good speaker
well you have to decide that afterwards
of course but people feel this way I was
just lucky to meet this guy I was just
lucky to be there I was just lucky that
the thing I knew something about
happened to become popular I don't
understand why everyone thinks this much
of me I'm just me I mean I'm just a
little Danish girl from nowhere in
Denmark why do people think about this
and that is again one of the things I
still need to do X I still need to read
this book to actually be good I still
need to program in this language I still
need to whatever things that happen in
your head when you have to imposter
syndrome maybe if I read these ten books
I will be good enough maybe if I start
coding in Ruby with one hand and see
what the other I'll be a good coder
maybe maybe not maybe you are a good
coder maybe you're a good coder because
you can't program in more than one
language at the time maybe being able to
focus is actually a good ability as a
coder so these are some of the things
that pop up into people's head and so
many people have this at some point in
their life and it damages us a lot so
what's actually really good about this
so I'm going to take a step to the side
and tell you about the dunning-kruger
effect so I don't you can read it but it
says so I've got what they're called in
English
Calvin and coups I say it's a fallacy
the kid needs 12 years of schooling
three months is plenty look at me
I'm smart I don't need eleven and half
more years of school it's a complete
waste of my time hmm how on earth did
you get all the way to the bus stop with
both feet through one pant legs
hmm I fell down alone why what's your
point
nothing I'm just curious this is the
dunning-kruger effect some people who
are not that smart think they really are
so basically the dunning-kruger effect
means um gee I can do this if you are a
novice you'll be like oh I this this
knowledge here from novice to expert and
just a confidence so basically what
happens is of course like if you don't
know anything you probably know that you
know anything then you know a tiny bit
you kind of like I want to spline and
now I see I know everything I am an
expert at this this is the darling
Kruger effect then what's happened to
whoa there's more to this than I thought
you go down jae-hoon I'm never ever
gonna understand this hmm it's starting
to make sense and then you go to trust
me it's complicated the more you know
the more you know that you don't know
the more you know in an area the more
you will know that you will never ever
ever be able to understand all of this
area you will know that the amount of
information the amount of things you can
do is so vast you will never ever know I
used to think that agile was about doing
scrum about doing the processes I
totally love scrum in the beginning I
mean I call myself semi artistic because
I like small boxes um and and I could
get those small boxes and still get my
freedom then I found out no it's really
about values okay I looked into values
panel is what I do
it has nothing to do with that it's
really about people and man is that a
big subject people spraying phil ozz we
just heard a talk earlier today about
philosophy about psychology about how
our brain works about how people
interact
big big big big field so the more I know
about agile the more I don't want I
don't have any clue about agile and that
is one of the things that leads to the
imposter syndrome which also means that
only intelligent people suffer from the
imposter syndrome so if you do have the
impostor syndrome if you do feel like a
fraud you're intelligent you're actually
really good at what you do and all the
expert exercises yeah all the research
shows that only intelligent people
suffer from the imposter syndrome so if
you do feel like fraud remember this
so this is me and my friend Toby we
actually both feel this way I'm not
really good enough for them pasta
syndrome because then passes on my for
smart people
so I'm actually not good enough to think
I'm a fraud so that's kind of like the
double impostor syndrome and we both
have this and like I said before this
one workshop we do where we talk about
exploring your own courage which is a
three hour workshop where we look into
what is your courage how can you be
brave and help these people understand
that everyone is actually brave in their
own way and we help them take tiny steps
for the next thing and it's a really
really effective and efficient workshop
it's amazing what people get out of this
just by creating a safe space and we're
kind of like yeah but we're not really
doing anything creating a safe space
you're kind of just here and putting up
some rules and stuff and but now I've
done it like six times and every single
time I get awesome feedback and still I
feel like I'm not good enough for the
imposter syndrome so how can we use this
to our advantage
so Marc Kilby is a coach from Florida
and he did a blog post so all the links
to the cat pictures and stuff is in my
slides so you can find them afterwards
and also to this blog post so the first
thing is that when we suffer when we
have this fear what we need to
understand is that this is because we
are growing this is because we are
moving into new areas this is because we
are learning so actually it's good to
feel this way you have to realize that
what you do is unique nobody in the
whole world did what you did nobody left
your life which means that whatever you
do you bring in your own uniqueness no
matter what gender you have education
you have what culture you come in from
you bring in something totally
told unique and even if you would take a
person with the same age and gender
growing up in the same area you would
still be you so no matter what whatever
you bring is unique and this is
something I had to read like 10 times
before I did this talk and impostor
syndrome because I'm kind of like I am
NOT a psychologist I don't know very
much except what do you read in so the
psychology of magazines or on the
Internet but half of it is probably a
lie but what I do have is I suffer from
the imposter syndrome a lot of times I'm
getting better I'm learning that okay
maybe so many people who that would not
lie to me
but still I suffer from it and what I'm
trying to realize is I'm unique and what
I can give to you is my story
I can explain it from my point of view
you need to recognize your
accomplishments and this is the really
really hard part because what if you
remember the definition it was you are
not able to internalize your
accomplishments but you need to go and
you need to recognize your
accomplishments and one of the things
you can do is write them down sit down
every evening and look at what did I
actually do today that made a difference
right at least five things and yes no
matter what you think right now you did
two five things today that made a
difference for someone whether that
someone is you or that someone is
someone else that doesn't matter you did
something today you did an
accomplishment today when you do really
big accomplishments go in write it down
make a blog post you can also go tell
someone that also helps sometimes but
it's more important if you can
acknowledge it by yourself I have this
little Chinese box which is a wooden box
that my grandfather bought in China and
every time I do something and people
tell me something good if it's physical
on paper I put it in if it's online I
print it out and I put it in there and
when I have a really bad day I take this
out and reading from people hey that
workshop you didn't courage now made me
submit to a conference I pick out these
things and I look at them and that's one
of the things you can do is start
looking at what feedback you actually
get and start giving yourself good
feedback and keep pushing your
boundaries if we don't push our
boundaries we are not going to get
better people think that if you stay in
your comfort zone it's just going to be
the same size it's not to be able to
learn we need to step it step into what
some people call the learning zone some
people call it the growing zone there's
also the danger or the panic zone which
is where you really go out on a limb and
like I used to say or say sometimes
there's a really really fine line
between being brave and being stupid and
sometimes you will cross that line and
be in a danger zone but you have to go
into the learning zone to be able to
grow and if you're not feeling a little
bit uncomfortable you're not in your
learning zone the issue about staying in
your comfort zone is if you stay there
it's become smaller if you have a phobia
and you don't challenge it once in a
while it will become bigger and bigger
and bigger and that happens with
everything so if you stay in your
comfort zone if you never ever feel like
you're out on a limp maybe you should
stop pushing your boundaries and when
you feel like you're an imposter you are
pushing your boundaries and there's also
see when people say just fake it until
you make it and try some things out you
can actually also show vulnerability I
know this is not very nice but you can
say hey this is my first time speaking
I'm scared shitless but it's not my
first time speaking but you could do
that as we will see first time and then
try it out and push your boundaries and
improve what you have passion so instead
of looking at I'm not really good at
this I'm not really good at that look at
what why are you really good where's
your passion where are the things that
you really want to do where are the
things that are not hard to do the easy
things because the reason they're easy
is because you like them one of the
reasons there is is because you like
them and your brain likes them so if you
look back
for instance there was some subjects
that you like to know some subjects that
you hated I would guess that would be
for most people usually with the
subjects that you like it's also because
you find them easy because your brain
likes them our brain really likes to
save energy
which means that it tries to do the
things that saves energy these are the
things we are good at so where you have
your passion where you really like to be
is probably where you're good at and try
and make this better and grow your
network because one of the things we
know when we become experts is that we
know that we don't know but what we also
know is that somebody else knows so if
you know someone who knows something
that you don't know oh I'm gonna get
then go ask that person so if you're
working at a client instead of saying
hey I know everything saying crew this
area's not really my expertise but I
know someone who knows so if like this I
go out and I work with people and I tell
them agile does not work if you do not
have some of the technical aspects if
you do not do automatic testing if you
do not do at least continuous not
necessarily deployment but continuous
builds adults not going to work for you
you can have all the nice processes in
the world but if you do not have the
technical expertise it's not going to
help you you cannot test in scrum you
cannot do a question testing every time
if you have to do it manually so I can
tell people about these things but I
cannot help them I cannot sit down with
them and show them what it's like to do
TDD I can still do pair programming but
I cannot do TDD for instance but what I
can do is say hey I know some people who
knows about this I can call them in so
by growing your network it becomes okay
that you don't know everything it
becomes okay that you are not the expert
in every area because you know someone
who knows what is also important about
this that these people is going to help
you these people are going to go in and
they're actually going to tell you that
you are okay that's it at least my
experience is that the more people you
know the more feedback you get
which means that when you feel like your
fraud like I did a month ago when I
realized what did I say yes to and
I wrote on Twitter okay I know I'm gonna
talk about them stop processing him but
I actually have it right now I know that
I have it but it doesn't help I feel
like I'm really stupid that I have gonna
give this talk and people come back to
me and saying yes I tried this and and
nobody is going to hire you for a talk
if you're not a good speaker at least
not two times so you get this feedback
from people and one of them will even
say hey maybe I should help you I did a
lot of talks so by having your network
you can first of all ask other people
for help with the things that you don't
know but you can also get better so by
having them pass this Windham it helps
us to see that we don't know everything
and if we use these 1 2 3 4 5 6 steps
it's going to help us in to become
better developers analysts speakers
managers whatever we are so by feeling
insecure and like a fraud we can
actually turn this to our advantage so
basically um what it's all about is that
since 70% of people suffer from this you
can just take a look around this is 7
out of 10 which means that unless Dutch
people are really really confident there
should be a shitload of people in here
who tried the imposter syndrome at some
point it may be you it may be the person
next to you but it's something that
happens to a lot of people and yet we
don't talk about this we don't ask for
help we don't show our openness I
believe very much in openness I believe
that being brave part of this is about
being vulnerable it's about saying I
feel shitty today or I feel good today
for that matter we tend to talk about
professionalism as something where that
we just put on when we go out the door
yes I'm going to be professional now I'm
going to put on my penguin suit and then
I'm going to go to work and I'm going to
be a good consultant
and what do you do then you spend so
much energy pretending to be somebody
else we actually do pretend to be
somebody else if we put on that kind of
professionalism so by being vulnerable
and by being open we at least will not
feel like a fraud in that way we can be
whole people and that also means we can
then say to put people next to us hey
I'm not feeling well today I did this
talk and I'm not sure it went well what
do you think would you look at my code
with me for instance or you could go to
your manager and say I actually need you
to acknowledge me I need you to tell me
when I'm doing good
if you need this tell your manager we
don't do this and often a lot of
managers I've had managers who said well
if I don't tell you anything you're
doing okay that's not helpful for me I
logically know that if I'm not told
anything I'm doing good that doesn't
help me research shows that for every
negative thing that somebody says to you
you need five positive things to just
become up to a neutral and I think this
is also one of the reasons we suffer
from this because we are evaluated all
the time
we are told negative things all the time
we are told to be perfect and this is my
one of my law exam notes cause this is
one of them reasons I think we are we
become this we try to be so perfect
because that is what we are thought we
are supposed to be in school
everything we are taught we are supposed
to be good and this is the way we get
recognition but we should get
recognition for just being us for this
being fun for this being kind for this
being open of being a good buddy of
course you should also get recognition
if we do something good with our brains
or with our hands or whatever but
remember to tell people these things and
more importantly remember to tell
yourself I think this is really really
important remember that what you do
matters
Bernie Braun who is a really really
amazing American scientist says we are
all perfect
with all the imperfections I love this
we are all unique we are all imperfect
and that is what makes it perfect
otherwise we would just be clone
warriors and we all know it's the bad
side so wrap up many people suffer from
this I do a lot I've been working with
it I see a lot of people suffer from
this and not asking for help if you
suffer from this go in and read a little
bit about it and start acknowledging
yourself and asking for help so I love
connecting so in my slides I have my
LinkedIn my native wired blog which I'm
supposed to write on
I do also sometimes my email I'm also on
sing because I work a lot in Germany um
and remember to rate the session see I'm
one of the speakers not like Michael who
forgot to put the slides in remember to
rate the session um and in the slides
that I will that will be online there'll
also be links to well the Husky cat very
important but also to blog posts and
actually the dunning-kruger eyes from
this cool page about how to be a
saxophonist but they had the most
interesting drawing of the
dunning-kruger effect so
we have what 10 minutes for questions
yes hello first question we have is how
did you actually know this feelings
which were experience was experiencing
was called in pasta syndrome how did you
discover this so how did I discover that
what I feel is then passed the syndrome
somebody told me and ever since I was
really small I had this feeling of being
a fraud so up until I was about 15 I
didn't really have any friends I was
really really good in school and
everywhere there so the only way I would
get praise was to be good in school and
I kept thinking at some point somebody's
going to find out I'm not really good at
this
at some point people are going to find
out I'm a fraud same happened when I
went to university and I thought this
was just me this was just because I
wasn't good enough and then at some
point a friend of mine told me about the
imposter syndrome so I was being closed
but coached by her and she says I think
you suffer from the imposter syndrome
and I looked it up but I like holy
maybe I do um but it actually took me at
least five years to admit that this was
it because if I admit that I suffer from
the imposter syndrome I also admit that
I'm intelligent which means that I'm not
a fraud which means that what my brain
makes me feel is wrong it's like so
it took me a long time to actually say
yes I suffered an impostor syndrome I am
really smart and I doubt myself
um but I only found out because somebody
told me and that is one of the reasons I
want to give this talk thank you then
the next question is say you suspect
somebody suffering from this the other
way of starting the conversation over
this so if I expect somebody suffers
from the impostor serum do I have a way
of starting it conversation yes I go say
you want have some coffee one of my
magical powers is I'm a really really
good listener for so I when I listen I
don't
people and more importantly I don't
listen with the intent to answer often
when we listen to people we listen with
the intent to answer I actually listen
to people with intent to hear what
they're saying
it makes a big difference and a lot of
people don't realize this so if I expect
someone to suffer from this I would then
go over and have coffee with them I
would have to talk a little bit and then
I would ask them if they knew about this
if I see some of the symptoms and I so I
am NOT a coach coach uh whatever that is
I'm an agile coach but I do have
one-on-ones with a lot of people and I
see so many people suffering from this
developers managers testers all levels
in all organizations and one thing that
I also am so I'm brave as I said so I
tell them I say hey it seems like you're
suffering from this just as it's
somebody if I see somebody who I think
is stressed I go and say to them I tell
people what I see in a nice way but I
tell it to them and I think this is
really important too if you see someone
doing this go over to them saying hey
you wanna have coffee and then you talk
to them thank you and the next one is
how do you know the difference between
the impostor syndrome and just being an
impostor ah ah how do you know the
difference between and being an impostor
and having the impostor syndrome well
people who think they have them passed
the syndrome are usually not imposters
except if you do impostor ring for a
living like the movie with Leonard
DiCaprio catch me if you can
he was an impostor and if he was feeling
bad at it he would be an impostor
suffering from the imposter syndrome but
most people who think they are imposters
are not so from the outside you cannot
always see this
I do believe from the impulses that I
met which is a handful that impulse is
actually really really good at what they
do otherwise we would catch them earlier
if they're really really good at what
they do there's a 70% chance that is
suffer from the imposter syndrome
but I don't think from the outside you
can always tell this from the inside you
definitely can because if you feel like
an imposter you're probably not then
there's a follow-up question actually
for this and how do you know if you're
suffering from this impostor syndrome or
just a functioning psychopath a
sociopath if I'm what a functioning
sociopath I functioning samba so how do
you know the difference between if you
were an impostor of suffering than
platinum or your high-functioning
sociopath um that's a really good
question I don't believe highest
functioning sociopaths believe they're
imposters I believe they are very aware
of what they do I've only met one maybe
two and they are very very aware of what
they do they're very aware of what
they're good at and they do it whatever
they takes so from the outside what you
will see with this high-functioning
sociopath is they have a lot of
confidence some people suffer from the
impostor syndrome seem to have a lot of
confidence people have been telling me
that it's actually really really hard to
tell that I have it because I seem
really confident so I don't you need to
get close to people you need to listen
to them you need to see the small times
often I find that if people are too
cocky
they probably suffer from the imposter
syndrome they're probably feeling
inferior and they need to make themself
wide and strong and look all so I work
in IT so it's usually men were and
usually guys who go burrow and I'm
better coding than you do and you can
never ever delete code in refactoring
one guy told me this until I told him
well I just talked to Martin Fowler last
week and he told me you could that
helped a little bit one of the mandates
of being a speaker is you can actually
go talk to the people but what I found
out was that he was actually feeling
really really inferior and having a
woman come in and actually knowing more
about the factoring that he did even
though I hadn't coded for ten years was
a big problem for him
so he was being cocky because he was
feeling inferior so if they are too
cocky they usually sell I believe the
second-fastest emblem or they actually
at least having a lot of confidence
problems sociopaths are usually not
cocky they're just really really
confident um there's a fine distinction
there okay and then what is your
favorite story of somebody overcoming
the imposter syndrome my favorite
stories are meeting overcoming the
imposter syndrome me except that one I'm
on stage in 2006 when I was at IBM my
manager told me you have a goal this
year your major goal this year is to
speak up when your whole team is there
that was my goal in 2006 this is ten
years ago so I started by going out and
speaking into colleges telling young
girls that yes you can be a woman in AI
t that was okay after speaking to a few
people today I'm at the point where if
you tell me okay can you speak tomorrow
in front of 3,000 people are they sure
what you wanted to talk about part of
why I feel confident is because I found
out then I'm not alone I found out
there's something called impostor
syndrome I also found out that I'm not
the only one in the world who wants to
make it better that being a hippie is
actually okay I used to think that that
was something stupid but being a hippie
is basically hey we want to have a nice
world I want people to treat each other
nicely so actually getting my Network
helped me overcome my imposter syndrome
and I haven't overcome it I have it once
in a while every time something new
happens the first time I had to give a
guest lectured university I was
terrified and it's so stupid I mean it
was in front of first-year computer
science students they knew nothing about
agile they basically knew nothing except
what they learned in school but I was
terrified the first time I did a keynote
I was terrified
the first time I had to do a talk with a
microphone I was terrified I'm kind of
like okay only really good speakers use
microphones because they have these big
rooms the first time I was filmed I was
terrified so I do still
from it but by working with it by
talking to people by being vulnerable
and saying hey I feel really really
not confident right now I have a look on
most of it so my favorite story is
actually me that's all the time we have
I just like to remind you again to write
the session and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
