everything must change I'm going to talk
about strategy I use this slide because
normally when I talk about strategy
everybody thinks these people are going
to turn up and they're gonna tell you
about how you know how you should
whatever the latest framework is like be
agile agile in your development agile in
your operations agile for your business
agile for your agile I'm gonna talk
about it in terms of then Xiao Peng
a very famous Chinese economist and
leader he talked about crossing the
river by feeling the stones so what
we're gonna do is go through what
stretch actually means in this lens so
I'm gonna start by asking you all a
question what do you think strategy is
like in the boardrooms of most companies
do you think it's a game of chess or is
it alchemy gut feel and whatever's
popular in the Harvard Business Review
can you hear me better super so what do
you think strategies like in most
companies alchemy combination of both
Wow gosh now it's loud okay so uh who's
for chess hands up
okay who's for alchemy and Oh dominated
by realists whose cowardly custard
standing in the middle sorry a couple of
you right super so I'm going to go all
the way back in time to Sun Tzu and
that's where we're going to start do you
know what Sun Tzu wrote art of war
fantastic he talked about five factors
that mattered in competition the first
factor is understand your purpose your
moral imperative why we do something the
next factor is landscape I understand
the environment you're competing in then
understand the climatic patterns so in
the case of combat it's
whether then understand doctrine which
are universal patterns are pickable to
everyone and then you're finally into
context-specific gameplay or leadership
now we often think of this as a nice
linear sort of path it's not and the
best way of explaining this is well one
of my favorite games which is paintball
so you start off in paintball you want
to take the building the first thing you
need to do is understand the landscape
so the obstacles between you and where
the building is unless you're a bunch of
newbies in which case you just charge in
there and get shot to pieces you know
epic fail
so if you understand the landscape you
you develop some sort of strategy we're
going to do some form of covering fire
and we're going to charge up the middle
you apply some doctrine you break into
two small teams and then you act and
then what happens is the climate changes
suddenly you're under fire because
somebody's hidden in that building with
their tactical sniper rifle taking you
out a distance so what happens is
doctrine kicks in again you return fire
you die for cover you come up with a new
strategic play we're gonna use
suppressive fire on the building and
we're going to flank them and the game
continues now the point about this is a
cycle and the best way of understanding
the cycle is with the mad majors work
John Boyd he called it an udder loop so
you have the game you observe the
environment you are Ian Tate around it
you decide what you're going to do you
act and then you cycle around John Boyd
was a famous US Air Force pilot now if
we combine sunsoo and John Boyd together
you end up with the basic strategy cycle
I have my purpose which is the game
whatever I want to be the best tea shop
in Kent or or the best whatever it
happens to be I
next understand the landscape so I
observe the environment I learn about
climactic patterns I use doctrine to
organize myself and then I did time in
context-specific play and act it's very
simple okay so part of the problem
certainly in business is this issue of
landscape how we understand our
environment and I'm going to explain
this problem using three examples biani
Holson chess world and Thermopylae
now beyond a wholesome was a Viking and
this is how Vikings used to navigate
with stories from Herman head due west
wards half and you will of sailed north
of hat land etc that simply means this
okay very simple now biani
headed off from Iceland heading towards
Greenland got blown off course
eventually got control of his boats
apparently found himself off the coast
of Newfoundland Newfoundland wasn't in
the right place according to his story
ie there was no Newfoundland eventually
found himself off the coast of Greenland
but again it was in the wrong place
according to his story so he started to
sail away from it until he eventually
noticed the landscape that he recognized
and landed now we've all done this every
time anybody asks you directions
somewhere if they've got a map you point
out where to go if they don't have a map
then you give them a story it's up the
road at the roundabout take the first
left along the road take a right take a
left and they drive off and you're left
with that moment there I send them in
the right direction
maybe I'm evil maybe they're out there
doing a biani Horsham so quick question
what would you use to navigate a ship a
map or a story map that's obvious enough
so what do we use to help navigate our
business stories perfect right so next
example chess well I want you to imagine
you live in a world where everybody
plays chess
and how well you play chess determines
your ranking in this world thing is
you've never seen a chessboard all
you've seen are these characters on the
screen and you play the game very simply
you press a button your opponent sees
what you've pressed they counter you
counter they counter and the game
continues until it's a draw or somebody
wins now what will happen is people will
take these sequences of moves these
games put them into their big data
systems and come up with magic secrets
of success so if you press Knight I
should respond with rook Queen Bishop
okay well write books on the secret of
the Queen and things like that and then
one day you'll play chess against
somebody who will see something truly
magical they will see the board and so
you will move and they will counter and
you will move and they will counter and
you will have lost and you'll be there
like what the fiddlesticks happen there
how did that happen
the first thing you're going to do is
copy down that sequence because
obviously it's a magic sequence and if
you press those buttons you'll win every
time
and you're loose then your start going
well maybe it's the speed at which they
press the bun
maybe it's cultural maybe they're a
happy sort of person or you lose because
you exist in a low level situational
awareness environment which is all about
sequence copying they have high levels
of context specific awareness so quick
question what would you use to learning
chess would you use secrets of success
magic sequences or context specific
gameplay understanding of the
environment what would you use super so
what do you use to learn in business
really you're not like oh look at Ober
we should be like uber or Amazon you
sure it's not secrets of success well
okay so I'll give you another one
Thermopylae this is the mister please
ancient politician Greek general now I
had a problem
the Persians were invading and so he had
choices he could defend around Thebes
defend around Athens what he decided to
do was to block off the streets of
Arthur Museum
force the Persians in along the coastal
road into Thermopylae it's a narrow pass
or a small number of troops could defend
against a large force so there was 140
thousand Persians around about four
thousand Greeks including 300 Spartans
that's why we get the story okay so I
want you to imagine you're part of the
Athenian army so part of the Greek
States and you're standing there you
know ready for war for mr. pleases in
front of you he's saying look I'm gonna
give you purpose here we've got to
defend against the invading horde of the
Persians and then he says I actually
don't understand the environment III
don't have a map I don't understand the
landscape but have no fear for I have
created a SWAT diagram strengths a
well-trained Spartan army a high level
of motivation not to become a Persian
slave weaknesses the ethos might stop
the Spartans turning up a truckload of
Persians are turning up opportunities
get rid of the Persians get rid of the
Spartans were a theni and we actually
hate the Spartans and the threats the
Persians get rid of us and the Oracle
says a really dodgy film might be
produced a few thousand years later okay
it's a quick question what would you use
to determine and communicate strategy in
battle a map with position and movement
or a magic framework like a two-by-two
diagram you know what's coming what are
you using business excellent okay so if
we go back to this question of chess
play versus alchemy if you look at
navigation learning strategy and
situational awareness chess navigation
is visual as Maps learning is context
specific strategy is all about position
and movement
and it's what we describe as a high
level situational awareness environment
alchemy is more about storytelling
secrets of success and magic thinking
it's what we call a low level
situational awareness environment so if
you look at something right in the
military and ask why does the general
bombard a hill they don't tell you
because 67% of other successful generals
bombard Hills you know I I read in
generals weekly the bombing Hills was
the latest thing they don't tell you
that bombing a hill would make a good
story and they don't say because that's
what uber would do they use maps maps
tell you where you can attack the why of
strategy is a relative statement why
here over there and then you're into the
how what and when of action so military
very much on this side business I'm
afraid to say that most of you are over
here now normally when I say that to
executives I used to be the CEO of a
software company bought by cannon I
built for startups people normally
respond we but we do have a strategy
well they do they have strategy
documents when you take one of these
documents and you rip out things like
implementation details operational
details purchasing decisions a tactical
choices BYOD or otherwise known as bring
your own disaster this is all the how
Wotton went of action the why we do
staff tends to be very vague most of the
time it's because other people are doing
it so 67 percent of companies are doing
big data social media cloud we should do
the same or today because this is a few
years old it's all IOT VR and AI oh look
everybody else is doing AI we must add
some AI
so at this point executives normally get
a little bit annoyed I this is my fat
cat I'm not very good at doing angry cat
so I just added some red eyebrows to
symbolize them getting angry and they
normally tell me we're not mean copying
well that's interesting so I spent about
a year going around listening to
executives talk about strategy and I
started to record what I call business
level abstractions of a healthy strategy
or Blas for short
here are the common Blas digital
business big data disruptive innovative
collaborative competitive advantage
ecosystem blah blah blah and then I took
all these strategy documents combined
them together and created a blur
template so our strategy is blah we will
lead a blur effort at the market through
our use of blur and blur to build a
block and then I combine the common
blouse on the blah templates an
auto-generated 64 strategies so I
thought we'd go through them number one
our strategy is customer focus we will
lead a disruptive effort of the market
market through our use of innovative
social media and big data to build a
collaborative cloud-based ecosystem blah
blah blah number two how strategy is
innovative digital business we will lead
a great effort remember these are all
randomly generated gibberish so I sent
this around about 400 companies I got
three basic types of responses and
number one this is more or less the
exact wording from our business plan
number two I've seen two of these used
already my favorite was number three are
you for hire so a friend of mine has put
this all online this is strategy as a
service so if you ever need a strategy
just type in the URL it will
automatically generate you one based
upon nothing whatsoever and if you don't
like it just press refresh
at this point people start getting
really rather annoyed with me and they
start telling me it's all about
execution strategy isn't actually that
important this is based on Jamie demon
statement I'd rather have a first-rate
execution and a second-rate strategy
excellent it's like culture eats
strategy for breakfast
fabulous nice sound bite thing is I like
data so I spend a bit of time in Silicon
Valley he looked at 160 Silicon Valley
company is supposed to be the cutting
edge of technology and competition
looked at the level of strategic play
awareness of their environment versus
the use of open as in open source open
data open API is to manipulate the
market to their favor the bigger the
bubble was the more companies in that
group so loads are high
situational awareness load too high in
terms of using open to manipulate a
market now if execution Road these
companies would be successful if
strategy Broz these companies would be
successful this is what the data
actually looks like companies at the top
right hand side had a positive market
can't change over a seven-year period
companies at the bottom had a negative
so at the bottom of companies like open
by default there's open everything
without thinking turns out not a good
idea
much better to open by thinking so
demon's doctrine I'm afraid as Martin
said is as flawed as it is popular it's
a bit like culture eats strategy for
breakfast wonderful unless you want to
look at data
at which point people start getting
really angry at me and so we're now into
well how come we're successful then
that's a fair point you know business is
a cat fight and the the honest answer is
it doesn't matter if you can't see the
environment if you suck as long as
everybody else does because then you
gain no advantage and there's a
wonderful study by Pfitzer this looked
at several thousand CEOs and looked at
the performance the CEOs
determined and no different from random
chance I you could just anybody to do
this to do the job basically now at this
point I must have met conversations tend
to get very very fiery but you look at
leadership studies today it's pretty
frightening I mean this is a Harvard
Business Review this is from 2011
November issue how ear lobes can signify
leadership potential
we've degenerated to that sort of level
it's actually a personal interest
because I've actually set up a small
company which is amp selling executive
ear lobes so if at any point you feel
you need to have more leadership
potential you can just buy one of these
add them you know and and fill the power
but this is the state of management
research now obviously what we want to
do is we want to get out of this world
of low situational awareness and into
this world where we're actually chess
playing but that requires us to have
some sort of map of the environment well
normally what happens is people say we
had maps it's fine we've got plenty of
maps let's look at a chess board what
makes a chess board useful for learning
is that it's visual its context specific
ie it's the game at hand you have
position of pieces relative to some sort
of anchor in this case it's the board so
this piece is at g1 this piece is at c2
and the other thing critical thing is
that you can see movement it's the same
with a geographical map it's visual is
context specific so the battle at hand
you can see the position of pieces
relative to an anchor in this case it's
the compass this is north or south this
and you can see movement that's how you
learn in military now unfortunately the
diagrams that we use in business don't
have those characteristics anyone eise
have you ever seen one of these business
process diagram right
visual yes context-specific yes position
sort of relative to an anchor the
customer just about movement no doesn't
show you how the environment is changing
from our point of view of a learning
tool it's fairly useless this is another
one a trend diagram it's visual this is
another one this is a Tube map diagram
again it's visual it's not context
specific it has no position it has no
movement now at this point the
conversation normally calms down a bit
and the reason for that is now I've
given somebody else to blame the problem
is it's the whole of the business scores
we've not been teaching you how to map
so how do you create a map an
organization is a massive things people
capital activities practices it's a
complex mess and what we want to do is
turn it into some sort of map which we
can learn about so the first thing in
organisations consists of value chains
so I took one of my company's online
photo service back in 2004 relatively
small few million users it was
medium-sized for those days but tiny by
today's scale start off with one of
those dreadful box and wire diagrams
identified what the user need was that's
the anchor so what do our customers want
photos storage printing from this
determined what the chain of needs are
so each of these components need other
components a website needs a platform a
platform needs compute compute needs
power and that gives me position
relative to an anchor that's part of the
way there I still don't have movement so
again it's still fairly useless from the
point of view of learning and the
problem is companies don't stand still
so Nokia used to be a paper mill became
a plastics manufacturer so things are
evolving so somehow we have to capture
that movement so how did components
evolve how do they change
so I know things like electricity appear
like the Parthian battery 400 AD and I
know it somehow it evolves and becomes
more of a commodity over time I started
off with this piece of work Everett
Rogers diffusion of innovation so
Everett Rogers notice that things
diffuse in society from early adopters
tell a guard's it was made famous by
Jeffrey Moore he was actually speaking
last speaker today and this is the
non-cumulative form Jeffrey Moore added
the chasm do you all know this stuff
wonderful right so the question I wanted
to know was how do we go from novel to
commodity so I started off going well
obviously it must be novel over here and
at some point it becomes a commodity
that must be simple so I took diffusion
curves all different sorts of things
from fridges to the Internet just picked
one say smartphones and just after this
question why how many people have one
327 million the US
sorry 327 billion smartphones in the
u.s. how many people 317 million right
is the smartphone of commodity what do
you think yes or no yes who says yes who
says no wow that's a real change okay if
you go back a few years just a few years
when this was done it was more even mix
bar of gold does everyone have one in
the US no yes
yeah well not anymore believe me so okay
is it a commodity no yes okay the point
about this is you can't use adoption to
actually measure change sometimes things
become a commodity when one percent of
the population habit sometimes you have
to get everybody owning two of something
before it becomes a commodity so there's
no simple way of going at this
percentage point it's novel then it
becomes a product it's a commodity it
doesn't work like that
but I know things appear in diffuse and
I know that somehow I think appears it
diffuses and then it evolves and that
thing diffuses and what I want to know
is how things evolve so I set the
Parthian battery how we improved
electricity and looked at the different
diffusion curves for this and what
happens is the first instance appears it
diffuses to 100% of its applicable
market which happens to be a different
market to the second thing the more
improved version it's like a phone a
better phone in a better phone a better
phone so everything diffuses to a
hundred percent adoption but of
different markets and they do so over
different time spans so can we actually
predict anything I can't use adoption
seems I can't use time well here's the
good news we know as things evolve they
become more ubiquitous we just don't
know to what
and we also know they become more
certain more complete more well
understood so when something appears for
the first time we find it confusing like
the telephone we used to have to write
guides about how to use a telephone
which way to hold it or electricity
provision you know this room is equipped
with Edison electric light do not
attempt to light with a match use a
switch but over time we don't have to do
this anymore
so I look to publication types and what
happens is we start off with the wonder
of something like the wonder of radio
then publications change and they talk
about building construction awareness
they have a builder and crystal radio
set then they change and they talk about
operation maintenance feature
differentiation my radio is better than
your radio etc and finally we talk about
use like the Radio Times so what I did
is I took this point a point of
stability when we shift from one
publication type to another from
operation to use found out the
applicable market call that the point of
ubiquity
then plotted back through history for
all different sorts of activities then
overlaid the publication types and this
is what appears if you look at the
ubiquity versus certainty you start off
with the genesis of a new act
custom-built examples products rental
services commodity and utility services
so if you take something like
electricity you start off with the
Parthian battery systems like the
Hippolyte pixi siemens generators
eventually Tesla Westinghouse utility
provision of electricity 1886 start off
with computing z3 Leo 1946 then you get
lyons electronic office first products
IBM 650 rental services like Tim share
commodity hardware and eventually cloud
everything evolves through that same
pattern okay but we need to know
causation in the cat fight that is
business anytime anyone gains a new
advantage some new big gun like an
e-commerce site everybody else wants to
follow suit we're copying so we want to
keep up and that drives ubiquity demand
competition but at the same time vendors
want to supply this stuff and any time a
vendor introduces a new thing like
kitten body armor someone will make a
better version and that drives supply
competition certainty so what you have
is demand and supply competition drive
this process of evolution so now how do
you create a map it's really simple you
start with an anchor user needs
understand the value chain so the
position of pieces in terms of being
visible to the user and invisible and
then you simply add movement to it the
evolution access and you place things in
their right spot that was the first map
I created in 2005 ok so I have a map it
has visual context specific position
anchor movement it's like a chessboard
exactly like a chessboard so what who
cares just spent 25 minutes explaining
how to map well if you look at this game
purpose landscape climate doctoring
leadership if you understand the
landscape you can start to learn about
climactic patterns so these are the
rules that influence the game so if
you've got a map the first thing you
notice if you take something like
platform it's evolving through
competition becoming more of a utility
and of course it has a past - everything
on your map is evolving which is why
situation normal ever think must change
is always going to be the case as long
as there's competition the next thing
you discover is the characteristics of
the thing change doesn't matter whether
it's money penicillin or computing it
starts off in this uncharted space where
it's chaotic uncertain unpredictable it
evolves and becomes industrialized
ordered known standard stable dull all
characteristics change and because of
this there's no such thing as
one-size-fits-all management methods so
agile in-house development very strong
in this uncharted space because it's all
about reducing the cost of change is
about experimentation but it's very weak
in the industrialized space because
you're about reducing deviation now
empires of scale and of course those are
both weak compared to something like
lean in the middle where you're just
learning and trying to reduce waste
doesn't matter whether we talk about
project management or purchasing there
is no one-size-fits-all method so now we
can make a little basic few predictions
I've got my map 2005 I can anticipate
that everything's evolving very dull
so if I need climatic patterns I can
start to learn doctrine
so dr. on universal approaches take a
bowl over there so it'd just be a sphere
a let's have a time to organize
themselves boxing want a diagram they
turn it into our map suddenly because
they know you can only one size fits all
they they write this stuff we should
outsource like for eternity provision
potentially out services this stuff we
need to use off-the-shelf products this
stuff we need to build in-house so you
learn to use appropriate methods that's
the first bit of doctrine now in the
past we had no matters because we have
no max we use the yoga we use the gara
in government or everything should be
Six Sigma then all when I worked here
everything should be agile or we used to
outsource too much when you take the
entire products and outsource them with
no understanding that what was there or
at least how evolved it was so some
parts will get efficiently treating
because they're commodity right in some
parts would incur extensive change
control cost our projects would smile
and we think that with a fight with the
vendor and the vendor would explain you
know to wear a fort because all our
costs came on the bits that we didn't
specify correctly well we couldn't
specify yeah sometimes we have to expand
we have no choice it's a great practice
self riding up anybody experienced with
building self-driving cars right so if
some of you these probably look quite
obese terms they probably don't need
much pee so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the diagram and quickly
convert it into elvish so we're all on
that base letter all right
we axles this bit it was a disaster
should we outsource this thing what do
you think well we make these decisions
with box and wise all the time
I can go turn it into a map keep it in
elvish we outsource this citizen this
ass though shouldn't outsource this
there yes the monarchy why didn't we
think this was the disaster
it's not suitable so it's exactly the
same diagram that we've now just added
me it's very weak it now has context let
me get into more practice fixed parts
than expensive simple and tiny scale
complexity the rest people came up with
a lieutenant colonel down Ward the US
Air Force came up with ideas add more
features they more useful more good
added more features became really
complex as they used to anyone and
that's roughly when they built it and
they went well that's really bad what we
need is to break it down into small
components and make it best compact it's
more useful so when they built the
Intelligence Agency supercomputer they
of my fist as doctrine and they worked
out the best way to build this was by
1753 playstation freeze and wireless
again and no explaining the games the
delivery vehicles
apparently they built a game they lose
we've got a harvest Hawk by these
combinations 18 months you know anything
about the military hardware that
incredibly fast see if you use
appropriate methods you won't quite fix
it break things down into small
components they you start organized all
right you smarter a small teams and then
caught it to pizza
I was itself a structures when you start
to miss obscure but you need to say
engineering over here an engineering
here but they're not the same so you
start to applying multiple
attitudes the structure known as a
pioneer settlers found planet you
discover unique multiple coats
than a same organisation then you start
to design around the concept of an
evolution so pioneers developed a novel
a new settlers turning into useful
products town planners industrialized
those components
this stuff is 20 years old and if you
don't read more about that there's a
wonderful paper by dchp open source for
boiling frogs which talks about how for
organizing people with radical
disruption so it's all online so we run
the search dchd Bonnie Prague standing
on front way wonderful okay so I
understand my purpose right now I
understand Alliance think I have to say
quite active patterns I can orientate
your doctor I now getting to the
leadership it context specific gameplay
so normally we talk about things like
this lets you browse our business
surgeon placing this surge pricing
context specific or is it universal we
don't a needs one ask those questions
but if you think about surge pricing is
it a quick delivery doesn't work force a
funeral part you know Norman turns up
with his mother and you say sorry we run
on the dead it's really expensive in
America unfortunately surge pricing is
complex specific so when you look at
your map you can anticipate because of
common climatic patterns that things are
evolving you can actually manipulate
bits of it depending upon the context
you can use open approaches to drive
things the more of a commodity you can
use patterns to slow it down the evening
used to constraints and pricing
mechanisms there's about 35 economic
patterns about 30 different things with
doctor ever had a hundred
two different ways of manipulating a
market to your favor and as you go round
that cycle you'll earn more and more of
these say more prediction another patent
I mean was componentization but as
things evolved it would enable higher
order systems with their I also need a
plan all the systems create resources
about your work so electricity and even
radio television including a platform
would enable other things to appear and
a point about this is now I can see
multiple ways that I can attack so in
2000 followed I build the first pieces
service platform as a service or do I
wait for somebody else to build them and
build these services on top of that so
why here over there no different from
this why defend Thebes or block off the
streets of Artemis iam that's an
important thing to note about the
strategy cycle there are two why's the
why of purpose as in defend the Greek
states and the why of strategy as in
movement why here over there they are
fundamentally different things so when
you get people say you should focus on
the why you need to ask them which why
are you talking about they are not the
same so back in 2005 I decided to build
the first platform as a service I've
been at the road kappa streets
javascript-based front and back end pure
utility based billing right down to the
function we had a bunch of weak signal
techniques we expected somebody to come
out with a computer service so we could
build on that infrastructure as a
service I thought it was going to be a
Google turned out as Amazon we had a
particular ecosystem model particular
method of play called innovate leverage
commoditize where we would enable other
people to build on top of our API is
monitor the metadata and use that to
identify new patterns to exploit and I
knew we had an Ursa in the market so we
could drive it with an open approach and
that's an example of context specific
play so then you act and that's what we
did we launched the world's first
serverless platform as a service in old
street kalpa Road 2005 and it grew like
hotcakes
fantastic and then Amazon launched and
we were like yes brilliant we're going
to rule the world
unfortunately the parent company got a
big American consultancy firm in who
said that cloud was not the future in
fact the three things we did cloud 3d
printing and mobile phones as cameras
were not the future the future was 3d
television so we should shut it all down
and spend a billion there I had big
arguments they decided to do that who
owns a 3d TV right super there we are
so Zemke was dead I gave the models to a
friend of mine he built something called
Cloud Foundry uses them with the client
foundry that's worth about 2.8 billion
so use shows that it's context-specific
play works in different environments and
gives me 2.8 billion reasons to hate
consultants so then I went to a bunty
anybody heard of Ubuntu super so we used
exactly the same play we were 2% in the
operating system market within 18 months
after we've mapped the environment
worked out where to attack spent last
less than half a million we were 70% of
all cloud computing you may have noticed
2008 no one had heard of a bunted well
very few 2010 we were everywhere and
they are brilliant at this sort of
gameplay then I started working on
something called better for Less
so I paper for UK government which
helped in the transformation the
formation of things like GDS ie these
days I do a lot of national level
competition on what the multiple
governments that's a quick recap
strategy T is iterative it's a cycle
it's not linear path purpose I
understand your landscape if you
understand your landscape you can learn
climatic patterns you can learn about
doctrine you can learn about context
specific play you need to learn by
playing the game you have to act and
really important to understand your
environment which is the thing most of
us fail to do
if you can't if you don't understand
your environment you you are in the
world of alchemy sequence secrets of
success of others let's be like uber
let's be like Amazon you won't be able
to distinguish between what a climax
patterns doctrine and what's context
specific now mapping is really simple
it's all Creative Commons this technique
is over 10 years old I start with user
needs understand your value chain and
simply add movement and that that's all
there is to it
so iterative loan by acting understand
your environment
that's what crossing the river by
feeling the stones is all about and at
that point I'm going to say thank you
alright so while our next speaker is
getting ready we have a question or
challenge for you sure so Simon was the
big question that you want our audience
to think about and discuss with their
neighbor okay so alright so good one in
2000 and 2004 I was the CEO of a
software company and I realized I was a
fake CEO and I explain why because I ten
years before that I'd been in the arts
hotel and the CEO of her company I was
working for handed me the strategy
document they'd asked me does this make
sense
I looked at it I had no clue what I was
doing but being young and I said oh yes
it makes sense because it had words like
innovation ecosystem and things like
that
wow that looks good ten years later I
was the CEO and we'd written a strategy
document it was pretty much the same as
everybody else's because we had no
perhaps and so I handed it to one of the
people working for me and asked them
what did they think of that and they
said all that looks good
and so I suddenly realized they didn't
know what they were talking about I
didn't know what I was talking about I
was the CEO so i felt like i was the
fake CEO that's
now I had missed all those strategy
meetings where they taught me how to
understand the landscape map and the
environment it took me another five or
six years to eventually realize because
I'm a bit slow there almost everybody
else out there is a fake CEO as well so
I suppose that's my question are you a
fake CEO thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
