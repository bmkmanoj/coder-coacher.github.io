talks this morning raff gave a really
awesome talk on the sort of underlying
technology for drones and Lucas
highlighted a lot of the applications
that drones can be used for and in this
talk what I want to do is tell you a
little bit about the evolution of a
platform that connects those two things
so connecting the technology to the
actual application and you know what it
takes to actually bridge that gap or you
know what we've done so far for that so
just really quickly about era where as
Lucas ever venture-backed roughly 70
person startup we're located in San
Francisco and we're building a hardware
software and cloud platform to develop
commercial drones the the story I'm
gonna kind of tell this as an
evolutionary story and it starts my own
personal story in grad school where I
was doing aerial robotics research at
MIT these videos are not nearly as cool
as raps videos as a just to make set
that straight but basically you see a
couple Foam planes there and these are
custom-built we were doing some adaptive
control work on those we have a bunch of
quad rotors flying around this was back
in 2008 when motion capture systems are
just starting to be used similar thing
you know flying a bunch of drones at
once and what we were doing was
coordinated control algorithms and this
was a really the early days of proof of
concept of those algorithms in terms of
actually flying them in a controlled
environment 2010 things getting a little
bit more sophisticated this is a mobile
battery swap in a recharge station and
so basically the drone lands on the
station and fully autonomously the
battery gets swapped and the discharged
batteries are automatically charged and
that enabled us to do actually
completely persistent missions without
any interaction indefinitely so we've I
think we ran a mission in here for over
24 hours and with no human intervention
that we started playing around with the
actual you know variation of
pitch of the multirotors and so you can
see a in addition to controlling the RPM
for control the drones also messin with
the pitch actuation and this could do
some pretty neat things flying super
smooth trajectories again this is in a
motion capture space and then could also
enable you to do so that you see here
the drone is actually flying upside down
and a half flip could also enable you to
do pretty cool things like really tight
flips so flipping over without any sort
of jump or altitude loss and then some
other cool acrobatics and then my in my
own research basically did some learning
from demonstration where you could teach
a drone something by just moving it
around the algorithm would find the key
points of that demonstration and then
actually re execute but with the
autonomous system as opposed to the
human who is just moving this thing
around so what all these things have in
common and the reason I'm showing you
this is that when you're actually flying
these things things go wrong all the
time this is a little blooper reel of
things in our lab and the reason things
go wrong is because these are
implemented time and time again and
we're trying to implement the same
software with you know for research and
there's no platform for it so what I
learned was that designing building and
flying hardware and software for flying
robots is soul-crushing tedious work and
what I really hoped would happen is that
someone would make a platform that makes
autonomous flight easy but still
customizable so some this is Jonathan
Downey is the founder of air where we
medicine undergrads and what he was on
the MIT undergraduate UAV team and
basically what he saw was that most of
the teams were just putting blackbox
auto pilots in here and these are the
things you could buy off-the-shelf that
were in military drones and he designed
a completely modular autopilot from
scratch we also worked together on the
Boeing a 160 program and it was a
similar thing there's lots of really
expensive black box hardware that exists
but there was no truly customizable
framework so so we eventually got to
talk
and what we you know and this is this is
an email that we kind of sent back and
forth and the basically what we're
calling out here is the the idea that a
product should give you good position
orientation data but allows you to auto
your own autopilot yourself with an
emphasis on flexibility and so what we
ended up doing was creating a series of
auto pilots and basically and we
Jonathan started a company called
unmanned innovation put a core team
together and the idea here was that you
had customizable auto pilots and there
were sort of three three components to
this really early system the first was a
core board and this has sensors and a
coprocessor for data fusion and
estimation this is a thing that would go
on every single drone and because it has
the core sensors that are common to that
drone in the middle we had a gum sticks
which is an early linux computer that
you know was a the size of a gum stick
and you could write your own flight
controls applications on here and so the
idea was that the core board enabled you
to get the data that you needed without
doing the all the estimation yourself
and the gum sticks board was where you
can write your own flight controller and
do the work and then there was an
application-specific breakout board that
depended on your specific application
and so in this case this is an
application-specific board for
fixed-wing vehicles this is for
multirotors and this was a really tiny
one these things had different radios
different different types of actuator
breakouts and we even put it together we
did a demo on this another this is an
earlier version of that variable pitch
actuation I showed you earlier so we put
this together and this was solving the
problem of researchers essentially to
have a platform that you could easily
just drop your own autopilot code into
because that was the problem that we
cared about so we ended up going to a
trade show this is the big this is
called a vsi trade show and we went
there and we we pitched this as look all
you have to do is drop in your own auto
pilot code and you know and you can do
all the applications you want and you
can imagine how many customers we
actually got from this
really no one that wanted to buy it
notice because people didn't actually
care about writing auto pilot code they
wanted to use the drones to collect the
data that they cared about so so this is
sort of an evolution of of building out
the platform and and this first thing
all we had was really an autopilot
hardware and software that people could
customize but that was not nearly enough
for anyone to do important things with
with drones so we said okay well MIT why
don't we add you know extensibility to
many different types of aircraft so
we'll do the work of customizing this
for different types of multirotors and
different types of fixed-wing and so
here you see just a few this is an
octocopter this is a quadrotor this is a
really long endurance quadrotor that can
fly for 60 minutes this is another octo
and this is a fixed-wing vehicle these
are all drones that are used today for
commercial purposes but have different
types of flight dynamics and require
different software to actually run these
so what we did was take the original
concept of that of that heart of that
sort of monolithic flight controller and
we broke it up into something that was
modular so now in the center we have the
flight core this is the thing that again
has the inertial sensors that has
barometric pressure sensors but now
instead of everything being on one unit
we separated the hardware so that it
could be applied to more than one
different type of vehicle and so for
instance a GPS module is now a separate
an airspeed module which multirotors
don't need airspeed modules but fixed
wings do so why not make that a separate
piece of hardware same thing for the
actuation module the different drones
have different numbers of actuators they
have different types and interfaces and
then an air data link module this is
essentially the radio that connects the
vehicle to the ground and this is
different by application so by country
these have different frequencies you
might be inspecting a tower where you
only need half a kilometer of range or
you might be inspecting a pipeline where
you need 15 kilometres of range and so
we broke this up into many different
components and then we essentially made
it so that it's really easy to drop
these into different pieces of hardware
so you can drop multiple actuator boards
and just daisy chain them on the with
this hardware architecture you could
replace the GPS
with a really high accuracy one if you
were doing surveying you can change the
state of like module everything was
really simply plug and play and this is
what enabled different applications you
know to specify the exact hardware for
different applications
so just to go in a little bit to the
actual technical underlying architecture
here as a sort of building block for the
application framework that I'll present
a little bit later this so this is a
essentially a block diagram now of each
one of these different pieces of
hardware and every blue box here you see
is either a software thread or a driver
and so when you're trying to make a
platform all these things need to be
totally interchangeable and the software
complexity really explodes quickly and
so in the importance if you're familiar
with robot operating system this is a
development framework that the robotics
community has adopted and what it is is
essentially just middleware it allows
software components to publish data
subscribe to data and make remote
procedure calls and so the sort of
concept here is that this block for
instance is the inertial estimator this
is the thing that takes the sensor data
and fuses it together and creates a
state estimate this needs to subscribe
to data that's being published from the
GPS board and and then the output of the
inertial estimator goes to control
algorithms the the controller needs to
know where it is in the world so that it
can do closed loop control in the
vehicle
and so what we found was that a really
key part of building extensible systems
is the middleware that you put in
between all of the different software
and hardware components and in this case
these not only are is the middle we're
connecting threads that are sitting in
the embedded code together they're also
connecting different pieces of hardware
together over different buses and
topologies so a lot of our development
effort actually went into making this
middleware layer that would enable
different hardware and software
components to talk together seamlessly
and the sort of theme here is that this
is something that as a user of
commercial drones you would definitely
not care about and you would never want
to do but it's a really important
underlying piece of the framework that
really should only be done once and be
done well so we implemented this modular
framework and
we are able to fly lots of different
types of drones and to do them in a
similar way so that there's only one
flight controller it's very easily
tunable you see a few videos here of
different types of commercial drones and
you can use the same the same framework
that you used for for multirotors to be
used for fixed wings as well and it all
relies on a modular underlying
architecture that you shouldn't have to
develop time and time again you should
just be able to use it for your
application so the next sort of step in
that evolution is this multi vehicle
architecture so we went from having
something that is just an autopilot just
has flight control code on it to
something that is modular and can be
extended to different types of vehicles
so then the next question is well people
actually have to use these things and
when humans use machines they have to
have an interface for using them and
what we noticed was the user interfaces
for drones this was roughly three years
ago were fairly terrible I guess you
could say so there's lots of busyness on
here tons of text that you have to put
in lots of colors this one is especially
egregious these are and this is supposed
to be the real-time interface for the
human to understand what's going on with
the robot to the extent that they need
to and these are also the interfaces
through which the human has to program
the robots behavior so this is a really
really key element of the autonomous
system that's often overlooked and so
the next step in the platform was to say
well people have to use these systems
well why don't we make a really
streamlined user interface that allows
people to use it very simply so we
essentially came up with two pieces of
software one is called a ground control
station this is the real-time interface
that allows the human to plan autonomous
missions upload all of the data to the
aircraft upload contingency procedures
that enable the aircraft to know what to
do if a radio link is lost and then
configuration management software the
configuration management is and again
one of those things that seems boring
but for a platform that can control many
different types of vehicles if you
configure the vehicle improperly this is
one of the leading causes that we found
of flight incidents
actually configuration and so designing
tools that enable you to smoothly
operate the vehicle but also to
configure it are again things that are
required for an underlying platform that
you should never have to develop
yourself if you want to use drones so I
have a quick video here of the just to
give you a flavor of what the the air
where ground control station looks like
the first is a really intuitive flight
planning interface you set a geofence so
this black line around here is the is
essentially the fence through which the
aircraft can not fly and that's that
goes all the way down to the embedded
software level what you saw there real
quick and I'll play this what you saw
here is not only the geofence but also
contingency plans so these are the
pre-programmed flight behaviors that if
your aircraft loses GPS or if you lose
datalink or if it flies outside of the
geofence you need to tell it what to do
so these make it very easy to configure
those and this is something that was
typically very difficult to do in
previous autonomous systems so now what
you see here is a user changing for
instance this photo survey path it's
very easy you can configure the survey
to collect the data and the idea here is
that you want to set it up so that when
the person arrives at the site all they
do is press a button and the vehicle
will take off and collect the data that
it needs to take so you see a plug-in
interface that's configurable and really
there are only six buttons here and this
is this is another important thing as
lucas mentioned in his talk the number
one cause by far of aviation related
incidents is is human error is typically
pilot error and so for unmanned systems
it's even more difficult to control the
vehicle because it's flying somewhere
and you're on the ground and you don't
have much insight into actually what's
going on so the the philosophy and this
is the trend that most drone technology
is going is to automate as ruthlessly as
possible so that the operator only needs
to step in when absolutely necessary so
in this case the operator only has six
buttons one is to activate the vehicle
another is to pause the vehicle while in
flight another one is to abort and this
is an extreme case when you need to
bring the aircraft down right now return
to home and land land now and then a few
launch
goto buttons and these are the only
inputs that the human actually has to
the system and the system is programmed
so that once it takes off it has all the
information it needs to not only launch
collect the data in land but it also
knows what to do in contingencies and
again it will never fly out of this box
so the video that Lucas showed earlier
of the guy flying his you know his
consumer drone over an airport is
something that can't happen with this
system cannot happen because you've
programmed this geofence and at the
embedded level that geofence is enforced
by the underlying flight control
software again this is a safety feature
that is absolutely critical for
commercial drones but that you would
never want to implement yourself if you
just want to use the drones or do
applications with them
so again just coming back to the
middleware middleware is really
important because now in addition to the
autopilot and the various pieces of
hardware now you have a ground control
station that also has lots of software
components and they need to talk over
the same thing so the next sort of step
in the evolution this platform was a
streamlined user interface that allows
humans to actually use these systems for
real applications so now we'll get to
the sort of relevant part to this
conference which is the application
framework what you see here is a is
really a system that will just fly the
drone but flying the drone is not enough
no one you know hobbyist want to fly
drones for fun but businesses want to
actually use drones to collect data and
so to collect data you need sensors you
need to customize the actual flight path
of the aircraft you need to tell it what
to do to put it in the position where it
will collect the data that at once and
then you need to actually record the
data somewhere and we found that with
the system that we have here we couldn't
actually do that we could just fly the
drones and so it would require you to
add on your own application specific
software so the next sort of step in the
evolution of the platform was the
application framework so on this side is
the side that I sort of already
explained this is the flight what we
call flight critical this is a closed
real-time operating system it has custom
air where a flight software on it it's
sort of the hub for certified flight
hardware and it's important that the
flight Hardware be extremely reliable
and certified and you don't want that to
be customized from application to
application ID
I don't want you messing around with the
GPS code or the inertial estimation code
it's also compliant and certifiable so
that's the flight critical side and this
side is relatively closed it's closed
because again we need to ensure
reliability and it's closed because
these are things that you probably
wouldn't want to change from application
to application now on the other side
this is connected with the data bridge
to what we call the application core on
this side is completely open so this is
Linux whatever distribution you'd like
with app management we've put middleware
on here that basically enables apps to
talk to each other via simplified
publish/subscribe and RPC mechanism so
this also and with that simplified
mechanism allows different apps to talk
together and I'll show you an example of
a vertical inspection application for
the actual software that you would
develop this this offers tight but
protected integration with the flight
control system so this is one of the
trickiest bits about making a platform
that people can use for commercial
purposes with drones is that as you if
you're in rafts talked earlier you
probably you know there's there's lots
of theory that goes into how to actually
control things autonomously and it's
it's very delicate to the way that you
tune it the way that you respond to
different types of disturbances and so
the but the applications still need to
tell the drone where to go if they still
need to control the drone so what we've
done here is created a high-level flight
control interface where all of the
low-level closed-loop control is done on
the flight critical side and again
that's closed to the application
developer but the application developer
can command the aircraft by requesting
control of it and there's a priority
queue of control and then offering high
level maneuvers or control requests that
go from the application side to the
flight controller and any app can do
this and the way that we're able to get
away with this is that these requests
are very high level so these are things
like launch or fly to a waypoint or land
or do a photo survey they're high level
behaviors that the app gives the
parameters to but doesn't actually need
to do all of the low-level closed-loop
control for itself and this is this is
really important in actually making
these systems customizable for peep
who aren't drone experts or you know
professors of flight controls there's
also on board apps that are again in an
open framework that allow you to connect
to user interface plugins on the ground
control station and and really here
we're trying to embrace open source for
applications while still ensuring safety
and so you can't application developers
you know moving into the future for
drones we don't expect them to be drone
experts and so we want to enable them to
have a sandbox where they can develop
applications and test things but not
have to worry about risking the safety
of the drone so here's an example of you
know the software as an app developer
that you would actually write for an
application such as vertical inspection
so so in this application what you want
to do is autonomously fly a drone around
a cellphone tower today the way that
cell phone towers are inspected is
extremely manual you have people
climbing up on ropes it takes about half
a day to do one cell phone tower and
it's actually very dangerous in the
United States this was one of the most
dangerous jobs in 2014 with almost 20
people dying just climbing on cell phone
towers with a drone you can fly around
you're collecting the same data the data
that the tower collectors are actually
collecting is just point-and-shoot
cameras so they'll climb upon the on the
tower and they'll take pictures of
things and then the pictures will be
manually catalogued into a very ad-hoc
report the drone offers a much better
way of doing this if you can fly around
this tower autonomously you can take
enough pictures to generate a 3d model
of the cell phone tower and that 3d
model can can then be annotated that
there's sort of interesting constraints
for these inspections the reason they do
the inspections primarily is so that
when they want to put new equipment on
the tower they need to analyze the
structure of the tower itself so they
need to know what is the wind loading
from the current antennas that are on
there can I put more on there what is
the weight loading so a drone has the
ability to fly autonomously around the
tower generate a 3d model you can
annotate that model with the different
different antennas that are on there
with the lengths of cable you can do
precise measurements and this is
something that you could never do with
the manual inspection so how would you
use the the air wear platform to
actually develop an app that would
autonomously inspect the cellphone tower
so
you would start with the sensors that
you need and in this case you'll need
scanning laser and this is a basic range
measurement that is scanning and this
will allow you to stand off from the
tower and to ensure that the vehicle is
not actually going to bump into anything
because if these towers go down it
represents millions of dollars of lost
revenue for every day that the tower is
in operational so failure is sort of not
an option here so what you would do is
write a driver for the laser scanner
that spoke the specific language of the
laser scanner but then publish the scan
data in a in a way that all the other
apps can understand and again this is
the importance of middleware so you'd
write a driver for the laser scanner and
it's publishing laser scan data it
publishes the data to a flight control
app and what this app will do is
subscribe to not only the laser scan
data to know what are the obstacles
around it but also the navigation data
that's coming from the drone itself so
your app needs to know where it is in
order to fly around the tower and to do
that what this app will do is subscribe
to for instance the GPS data it will
subscribe to the velocity data it will
subscribe to the laser data and it will
fuse all that information together seems
like a complicated process but in
actually in our own prototyping all the
apps that you see here we just developed
in Python and using a really high level
interface to everything else so you take
the scan data do obstacle avoidance take
the navigation data and from that what
you need to do is publish commands that
go back to the autopilot but the system
makes it easy to publish commands so
that you can for instance launch and
then transit at a minimum altitude so
that's one of the maneuvers that an app
can request of the flight control and
what that lets you do is as an app
developer specify a safe altitude and a
location that you'd like to go to and
what the flight controller does is take
care of all of the low-level dynamics of
flying up to the safe altitude and
transiting over to where you need to be
you can then send it a maneuver to
descend at your location and ascend and
what you can do during these is take
photos so the next app that you would
write is a driver for a gimbal and a
camera so lots of off-the-shelf gimble's
exist that will point a camera lots of
cameras that exist that will take photos
and what you would do is write the
specific software to talk with those
things but again present those
capabilities to the rest of the system
so as the flight control app is flying
up and down the tower its commanding the
gimbal to point at the location on the
tower that you'd like and is completely
configurable and also commanding the
camera to take photos at intervals that
can be configured beforehand so as an
app developer I've been able to write
apps that talk to my specific sensors
this has these sensors again have
nothing to do with the actual drone
itself these are the sensors that are
important to me in my application so I
can write drivers for those I can write
a flight control app without really
knowing how to do flight control I just
need to know high-level primitives and
then the the sort of last element of
customizability as an app developer
would be some type of user interface so
this is the same ground control station
that I showed you earlier but what we've
implemented is a plug-in interface so
that you can develop plugins in a
separate project compiled them to a dll
and then drop them into a folder that
gets loaded at runtime so for instance
in this application we designed a
plug-in that enables you to configure
the inspection by walking the drone
around the tower and placing it down and
saying okay I want to inspect this
column right here okay I put the drone
down this is going to be my landing
location so it allows you to not only
configure the drone at the inspection
but it will then enable you to control
the inspection so it has a button to
actually launch the inspection or to
pause it or to return home and land
because the battery is getting low and
so you'd write an app for this and with
this app framework you can write the app
completely independently of the ground
control app that we've written to be
reliable and really easy to use and
streamlined and make and then this app
again through the middleware that we
provide has access to the data that's
going on on all these other apps so this
is an example of how you can write an
application for a fairly sophisticated
task which is to fly around a tower
without really knowing too much about
the underlying drone technology because
that you shouldn't have to in order to
get the data that you want so that's the
the sort of next you know element in the
evolution of the platform with the
flight flight hardware modular so that
we can fly more vehicles we have the
ground control station software and now
we have an application framework that
allows developers to come in and develop
application specific software without
being experts still
this turned out not to be enough because
one of the major pain points for
companies and Lukas touched on this in
his presentation was an actual workflow
so there's not only one cellphone tower
that I have to inspect there's 800,000
cell phone towers in the United States
so for a company to realistically scale
drone operations there needs to be
planning and workflow software that
enables them to plan a job and then
assign it to one of hundreds of
operators with drones and then to get
that data back in an organized way and
so that leads us to that to develop a
cloud platform and so what you see here
is the air we're cloud platform and
there's a few relevant features one is
that things are organized by jobs and by
project so as a cloud planner I create a
project and this project in cat holds
all the jobs for say a customer of mine
allied tower or a farmer who wants to
inspect different areas of their farm
within that project you can create jobs
and these jobs may be different things
so on a farm it may be mapping a field
with a multispectral camera or may be
inspecting a fence line or may be
surveying the lake to see what the water
level is so I can create a job with this
play here there's also some some other
things like managing my fleet and you
know if you have a fleet of drones
managing them actually becomes quite
difficult because they break they need
to be inspected and I can also manage
the personas so I can assign pilots or I
can assign people who are allowed to
change the configuration of aircraft so
this is an example view of a job and
what you specify is not only the data
that needs to be collected but also the
safe region that the drone should be
able to operate in and so in this case
the planner is highlighted what we call
a geofence over a farm and that gets set
at the planning stage and this is
another really important feature of
safety is that in order to in order to
ensure that drones will not fly wherever
they want to or to allow operators who
may not be following the rules the
geofence the limitations of the drone
are set before it even takes off it's
set in the cloud by an authorized
planner and and then what can happen is
that that geofence can be
through a compliance workflow so this
can either be sent to a regulatory
authority for to check for other drone
operations that may be happening in that
area or it can be sent to your insurance
company to say this this is the area
that I'd like to fly in does this
compliant with my insurance policy so
you can tie this safety into different
elements of actual commercial drone
operations and then what will happen is
that this job gets completely planned in
the cloud it gets assigned to an
operator on the ground so the operator
doesn't know anything about the data
they need to collect they just know how
to collect it and so that will get
synched the operator will download that
entire what we call a flight package
they'll press a button the data will be
collected and then once the operator has
collected the data it will all be
reattached to the job in the cloud and
this is one of the major pain points of
commercial drone companies today is that
these things collect a massive amount of
data you can collect hundreds of
gigabytes of photos over the course of a
week surveying a farm and so organizing
all this it becomes really important so
the thing that the air work cloud
enables you to do is automatically
attach any data that you collected
during that job back to the original job
that was planned so at the planning
office now
I've abstracted the problem a way of
sorting and sifting through all the data
that I was collecting with my drone and
I could say okay well I plan this job
this data magically appears once the
operator is collected and uploaded it to
the cloud and now I can start to do
analytics on it to get closer to the
paying customer who wants the data and
in this case and I you've probably seen
a few of these before but this data you
can put into planning tools there's lots
of these tools that come off the shelf
this is an example tool called picks for
D that will do process called
photogrammetry to take two-dimensional
photos and create an extremely detailed
three-dimensional model of the sorry an
extremely detailed 3d model of the farm
so from this thing you can measure water
levels you can measure crop Heights you
can do multi spectral and DVI analysis
you can see if your fence lines are
broken you can see if dams are broken
this is an actual farm in Petaluma then
we were able to see trees that had
fallen over a road we were able to see a
dam that had
big crack in it we're able to measure
the exact water levels of the of the
creeks and and reservoirs and one of the
important things about this is that you
can't just put images into this
processing algorithm you need metadata
for the images so for in this case what
you see is that we've initialized the
algorithm with the exact position and
orientation that the photo was taken
this also represents a real pain point
for commercial drone operations however
so let's say I'm the operator I've taken
a bunch of photos with my drone if those
photos aren't tightly connected to the
flight logs that told me where exactly
they were taken then the data is
essentially useless and so one of the
really important parts of collecting
data for commercial operations is having
everything packaged together in a way
that it's compatible and can be post
processed so in this case the error
cloud will take the flight logs that
record when each picture was taken and
output a file of metadata to say that
this picture was taken at this exact GPS
location it was taken when the vehicle
was pointing in this direction and it
was taken at this time so metadata is
really important and so this is sort of
the final you know the final element of
the this platform so we've gone you know
from sort of nerdy hardware that you can
drop your flight control code into to a
modular system that now can fly
different types of aircraft a user
interface that will enable the human to
interact with the robotic system in a
streamlined and safe way an application
framework that will enable developers to
come in and customize just the parts of
the problem that they care about by
developing apps and then finally a cloud
management platform that will enable
enterprises to plan the data that they
want to get assign it to operators on
the ground and then have the data come
back in a way that's usable for
analytics so this was the this is sort
of an evolutionary look at how the
platform evolved but for people who
wanted to actually do we want to make
money operating drones this is probably
not the best way to look at it and so a
different sort of an alternative
interpretation of what happened and this
is I'm not an engineer I'm not a
business major but I can imagine in
planning out how to make money from
something you start
with raw ingredients and in this case
this is an aircraft with sensors and
what you want is to somehow get to the
paying customer so how do I take the raw
components and make money from them and
so for commercial drone operations you
can sort of view that evolution that I
just showed in a different context so I
take the raw ingredients and a service
provider will then integrate the
aircraft in the sensor so they have to
take the aircraft and the sensors put
them together into a flying package and
then they need to plan the job so the
farmer calls up I need to do planning in
the next step I need an operator to
actually go and collect the data so you
need a data collection workflow so we've
gone from raw ingredients to an
integrated aircraft to a job plan and
now a data workflow but having the data
is not enough you then have to do
analytics on the data and then create
reports and data processes and that then
finally gets to the paying customer so
in terms of commercial drones this is
the value chain of how money gets all
the way back through to each component
of this system so we started thinking
about this and if you look at that sort
of evolutionary that sort of technology
evolution that I just showed you of the
platform you can actually think about it
in a different way you can say that each
part of the platform is actually
addressing a part of this commercial
drone value chain so you've in in terms
of the actual integration of aircraft
and sensors this modular framework makes
that really easy to do in terms of job
planning you've got the air we're cloud
that can easily take a request from a
customer to then plan a job in terms of
the actual data collection workflow this
is something that we've now standardized
you can create projects and manage users
you can set up the vehicles using the
configuration software create jobs you
can get approvals create flight plans
actually fly and acquire the data with
the ground control station sink that
data back to the cloud and then offer
that up back to the service provider in
the first place who will do analytics
create data products and get that to the
customer so this is sort of an
alternative way of looking at it and and
this is the people like Lucas and Ariel
tronics are starting to look at the
problem this way which is how do we
provide valuable information to
customers who are actually going to pay
for it and it's sort of in contrast to a
lot of the hype that's going
with drones which is you know how do we
do cool things with drones this is
really the way that it's going to have
to be looked at in order for drones to
pull proliferate and these are the types
of tools that we'll need in order to
make that happen so in terms of actual
application developers there's lots of
places on this value chain where
application developers can add a ton of
value and so just just to name a few the
integration of different aircraft and
sensors so I walk you through that sort
of vertical inspection application
there's lots of places in there where
software developers can add drivers for
different types of sensors or can make
algorithms that autonomously inspect
things like cell phone towers or bridges
there is lots of area for improvement
right now in approval so for instance in
the United States the FAA they don't
really know what a cloud is they still
think the cloud are things that planes
have to fly around but there's lots of
places where software developers can
come up with workflows so that a flight
plan can be automatically approved by
say the FAA or by an insurance company
or by your organization so there's lots
of plugins that can be written there
creating flight plans there's lots of
areas of custom agent automation here so
taking a really large area to be
surveyed and breaking it up into lots of
different missions as an example of an
application that could be written flying
and acquiring the data also an area that
needs to be customized by the
application there's lots of lots of
opportunity here for app developers to
come up with new and different ways of
collecting the data for instance we've
we've only shown you sort of flying over
a field when you have GPS but there's
lots of interesting applications where
you might want to fly inside so let's
say you wanted to do a structural
inspection of oil and gas infrastructure
there's lots of pipelines that need to
be inspected oil derricks where you'll
be flying under the derrick where where
you don't have GPS and you'll need to
use vision to actually navigate the
drone there's lots of areas there where
getting the data in different ways is
still largely an open problem lots of
lots of work to be done in syncing with
the cloud and by this I mean that
there's so much data to be collected
that it can't possibly be all sent up to
the cloud
there's there needs to be pre-processing
that happens on the actual aircraft to
pull out the relevant features of the
data and reduce the size of that data
set to something that can be transmitted
over sometimes a really lousy link in
the example of oil derricks there is no
internet connection the only thing that
they have is a SATCOM link that is
extremely low bandwidth so to get data
quickly from an inspection of an oil
derrick to somewhere where it can be
processed requires a vast simplification
of that data to only the relevant
features so lots of automation and
machine learning that can be applied
there that sort of ties right into the
analytics all the data needs to be
analyzed somehow and that's where you
know a lot of app developers can come in
and in making the actual data products
there's another place where even after
you've analyzed the data putting it in a
report that is understandable by a
company who needs to use it is often
fairly difficult so these are areas
where app developers can can jump in to
the sort of world of commercial drones
and thinking about it in this way which
is essentially a value chain we found to
be extremely helpful in shape where the
best effort should be so I just wanted
to sort of conclude the talk with going
through a few the applications we've
seen a few today but some applications
that maybe haven't thought about or that
you know are not possible today wildlife
surveying is one that we've we've done a
little bit of so the way that wildlife
are surveyed today is literally with a
pilot in a plane and then a person with
a clipboard and a pair of binoculars
it's extremely expensive it's dangerous
it's hard to keep pilots because they
get bored because they're just flying
over wildlife sanctuaries day after day
and so it's difficult to actually
collect data about you know endangered
species from an aerial perspective we
actually took a team and we went to
Kenya to the old Pecha - Conservancy to
monitor endangered white rhinos the
northern white rhinos and what we what
the the was essentially they they hired
us to go out there and do was an anti
poaching mission so we would go out
there find the poachers determine how
they're getting into the park but once
they saw the data that we were
collecting from these drones they said
well we could use this for much more
frequent collection of data so we can do
these
surveys purely from drones and we can do
them every week instead of every year
because it's really expensive to hire
Manta pilots and this would give them
much more actionable insights avalanche
rescue is another one you know right now
this is extremely dangerous you have to
send a helicopter out why not send one
drone or why not send 20 drones you can
we did a rough cost analysis for the
cost of one of these typical helicopters
you could buy it was between 20 and 30
highly reliable commercial grade drones
not to mention that cost of operation is
orders of magnitude less and the risk to
human life also much much less bridge
inspection this is how bridges are
inspected it's kind of scary because
this machine is often required to
inspect the underside of bridges the
bridges that we drive on every day and I
had sort of thought back and I can't
remember one time when I've ever seen
one of these machines in my you know in
my own actual driving which is a little
bit scary because it probably means that
bridges aren't being expected very often
because it's difficult to do there's you
know technology that would enable you to
use a drone to inspect bridges and again
there's some parts of this problem that
are still open like how do I fly under a
bridge that doesn't have GPS but there's
all the sensor technology that is there
there's research that's been done in
actually navigating and now it just
needs to come together into an open air
into a commercial drone solution quarry
counting Lucas Rd actually went through
this but surveying is the old way of
doing quarries it's very time-consuming
you can fly a drone in a few hours do
exact volume metric analysis of the
quarry there's people who are doing more
interesting analysis on these to where
you can analyze the shape of the roads
and do statistical data to not only do
better accounting for the rocks but also
save fuel for the vehicles that you're
that you're driving around structural
assessment is another huge thing in San
Francisco where we're located there's
earthquakes fairly often and so there
was an example in the research world of
a team from UPenn who took a drone after
the large recent earthquake in Japan
took a drone to a structurally damaged
building fluid around and were able to
generate a very detailed 3d model of the
inside of the building that could then
be used to do a structural assessment so
they could do this first they could also
search for survivors while they're doing
it and assess the structure of the
building before you actually go in and
put people in harm's way so another
application for drones that hasn't seen
wide-scale use but the technology is
there telecom satellites is another
really interesting one it's very very
difficult to put things into space it
always will be
and always has been and now people
looking into using high altitude long
endurance drones to act as essentially
planetary satellites so instead of
putting a payload into space and once
it's in space it's there forever you
can't recover it why not put it on a
high altitude drone where you can still
use solar energy to power it
but once the equipment either breaks or
need to repair or is outdated you can
just land the drone instead of leaving
the equipment in space so another
interesting application area gas leak
detection is another sort of area where
right now it's extremely manual that
this is literally how utility companies
go around and measure for gas leaks it's
a person with a little probe that needs
to they need to put it right next to a
gas meter there's technology now where
you can put very sensitive guest sensing
equipment on a car and drive around a
neighborhood well why not put that on a
drone that can fly over entire
neighborhoods and find small instances
of where there might be a gas leak and
then target the inspections to those
areas and then finally another another
sort of interesting application is
cruise ship safety so people fall off of
cruise ships all the time and it's a
it's often very dangerous imagine when
someone goes overboard on a cruise ship
deploying a drone right instantaneously
with an IR camera to go and look for the
person so that it can be located right
away and help can be sent so these are
these are not applications that you
typically hear about in sort of the
mainstream drones but examples of places
where things in real life that you might
not think drones can be applied to but
the technology is there and it's really
just waiting for application developers
to take drone platforms and technology
and turn them towards really useful
things that we haven't thought of
so that was all I had and I'll take any
questions thanks buddy for explaining
very clearly any questions yes
thanks buddy my name is Shem
well question I have is a as far as
Edward is concerned I think 4f a
clearance it will be much easier for you
Bart as far as other companies are
concerned what do you think is the
differentiating factor in terms of cost
and stability of the platform especially
the autopilot I saw a couple of years
ago I think in here where it was pretty
expensive so that was my question we're
so we're we're trying to bring down one
of these I'm trying to do it err where
is change the cost structure so
typically the way that drones have been
purchased is you pay a really large
upfront amount for the technology so
you're paying for the hardware and
you're paying huge margins on it because
that's where companies are making their
money but we're starting to shift to is
a per use based model for pricing and so
that means that we're trying to get the
hardware in your hands for as as low a
price as possible initially but then
essentially share the revenue that
you're making with the drone so charge
on a previous piece it's much like
cellphones so this is exactly what
cellphone companies do they'll subsidize
the initial purchase of the equipment
but then you're paying on a
month-by-month basis for actually using
the data and using the services and so
that's where we're trying to take the
actual revenue model so that we can
structure the cost of these systems in
alignment with the people who are
actually using them and making money
with a month over a month so but it's
still a bit so it's it can be fairly
expensive but you'd be surprised at how
low this sort of initial cost can go
there's an especially if you think of
inspections sometimes she needs very
expensive sensors as well you know we
hope that the price of sensors goes down
as well good cameras can set you back
ten thousand no hyperspectral fifty
thousand dollars and when you're
thinking about it's really not the it's
not how much you paid for the system
it's how much money you made with the
system and that's the thing that's what
we're working to enable people to make
money with these systems in a way that's
scalable
so hopefully the initial cost won't
matter as much if your if you're making
or saving other companies millions
dollars a year so get a good business
plan tip any other questions yep thank
you so much for the inspiring talk but
apart from the technical technological
we love this presentation I'm also
interested in what you achieved so far
as a start-up so you mentioned that you
couldn't sell your first product so
looking back to the timeline that you
just showed to us I mean how did it
developed I mean at what point in time
that you started to get some interest
and you started to sell your products to
do customers in the market so of that
timeline I showed you the 1.0 product
came very late and so right now we're
and only I'd say about four months ago
we did our first release of the entire
platform so now we're actually still in
the process of evaluating market fit we
have initial customers who are starting
to integrate we don't make the actual
aircraft right so the first thing that
needs to happen is that aircraft
manufacturers need to adopt the platform
and start using it and that's the stage
that we're at right now but there's lots
of uncertainty so there it's it one of
the reasons why I showed this is because
we're constantly thinking about
connecting the dots to the technology to
the actual application and the customer
but that's still something that if
anyone tells you they're making you know
tons of money with drones they're
they're lying to you that they're you
know there's still lots of questions
that have to be answered there's
compliance issues that need to be
approached and we're really still in
sort of the proving stages of how you
can take an application like this and
use it for applications I'm so it's
still it's still very early days I'd say
yep yeah yep
do you have already have gotten FAA
approval or so oh I was still working on
that the the actual rules
the FAA hasn't come up with the rules
yet they've released a draft set of
rules it's called an NPRM basically a
proposal for rulemaking which you know
could take people estimate between 12
and 24 months to actually get put into
law what we have done is taken that
draft set of rules and integrate many of
those features into the system so that
by the time those rules become law which
they're expected to be what will kind of
be ready for that but the a lot of the
things that you see the geofencing the
compliant that the sort of approval
workflows of the actual geofence these
are things that are already in existence
in in countries in europe and around the
world that we've we've integrated into
our platform so that making your system
compliant will be as easy as possible so
if you have to take your geofence and
send it to an agency via the cloud we
have the api is to do that and we're
working with for instance nasa who has a
project called UTM which is unmanned
traffic management and they have a cloud
server that's sitting there waiting for
approvals to come and so we've been
doing some testing with that just
another one you had that planning on the
mission planner programming interface do
you have you planned into support
programming of third-party sensors
integrated with the drone and setting
parameters for those and changing timing
when something is triggered on the
third-party senses and so on
yes that's fallen that that's sort of
the way it works now so that you would
develop an application you know specific
software that would drive the sensor and
then in a cell phone tower example
that's actually how it works so that the
control app was triggering the camera to
take photos the camera the camera app
was actually just listening for someone
to tell it to take photos so that's sort
of the the architecture of the system
okay but it one last question can you
share a little bit about the fund that
you guys just started oh yeah
yes that's my interesting - yeah so what
we've done is gather some venture
backing and created what's called a
commercial drone fund and so what this
basically means is that we are looking
out for companies who we think have a
lot of potential in the commercial drone
space and and typically small companies
companies they're just getting started
and you know have a you know an idea or
an early prototype for product and we're
connecting them to Silicon Valley
venture backing through this commercial
drone fund so if you have a company you
have an idea for a company and you're
looking for funding in the drone space
you should contact go to our website
there's a page for the commercial drone
fund and we're looking through all these
picking out things that we think are
promising for the industry and then you
know connecting them to - to Silicon
Valley venture capital so trying to
trying to seed the market okay thanks
buddy
thanks very much
