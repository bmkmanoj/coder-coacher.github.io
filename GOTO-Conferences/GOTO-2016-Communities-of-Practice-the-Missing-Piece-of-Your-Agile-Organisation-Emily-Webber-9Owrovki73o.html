hello I feel like I should be doing a
talk on London shopfronts now which was
one of the first ever talks I gave so
I'd like you all to imagine for a moment
an organisation where there is a project
manager and that project manager he's
called Andrew and he he's working on
fairly traditional projects he's got
water for he understands all that and he
he does really well and in the
organization there's also an agile team
and for whatever reason the agile team
lead the delivery manager or agile
project manager whatever name you might
call it leaves so there's a bit of a gap
and the powers that be the managers
decide well Andrews great at doing this
stuff and you know agile is is the same
as other project management it's just a
different methodology so what we do is
we take Andrew out from here and we put
him in that team over here so they do
that and Andrew thinks great new
opportunity I've heard about this new
agile thing it's fantastic and he reads
up a little bit and he thinks okay I've
got it
just different way of doing things and
it doesn't go particularly well and
there isn't anyone else in the
organization that he can talk to the
only person he could have spoken to was
the person that's now left so he
struggles and he gets quite miserable
and unhappy and the team gets quite
miserable and unhappy and they stop
delivering things very well because
they're vibing off of his unhappiness
and eventually he leaves now Andrew
isn't a particularly a real person that
is based on quite a number of people
I've seen and I'd like to ask you all a
question if this works it's not working
okay
so hands up if you've ever left an
organization because you feel
unsupported quite a few hands gone up
there are you not alone study carried
out by an organization called benchmarks
said nineteen percent of people say they
leave organize they leave their jobs
because they're feeling unappreciated so
I was reading a book a little while ago
this book called social by Matthew
Lieberman it's a fantastic book and one
of the things that said in it that
really resonated with me is absence of
support is taken as a sign of mass
rejection by the person that's not
feeling supported it also goes on to say
that public speaking a reason people
don't like it is one way to be rejected
by an entire room all at the same time
so please be nice we need to be
supported at work it gives us the
confidence a safe environment where we
can make mistakes and there's some facts
here with this sad panda there was a
study carried out by Warwick University
in the UK that said that unhappy people
so they got a bunch of people they made
them happy or unhappy by showing them
funny videos or making them talk about a
sad moment in their life and those
people that were unhappy were 12% less
productive than a control group and
happy people were 10% more productive so
there's a link between happiness and our
ability to do work so this is a good
stat if you ever need to get anything
from your company maybe that pool table
that you were after so a sink or swim
it's not a management technique tactic
we should be aspiring to as they're not
actually been in that an organization
when they've just been thrown in to get
on with it I know I have and you can
either some people manage it and some
people don't so what I'm going to talk
to you about today is how to avoid this
how to avoid people being unhappy and
leaving and some other great reasons why
you need communities of practice in your
agile organizations or actually any
organizations
so my name is Emily Webber I have a
habit aside from collecting pictures of
shop fronts in London
so I looked back when I when I became
independent consultant I think I looked
back over I think some of the things
that I'd done during my career and
during my life and I realized that I
have this habit of connecting people
I've habit of setting up communities I
think I can't really help it I have this
I think this idea that we are better
together and this slide collecting logos
that might be my habits so on the left
here that right sorry
on the right is a number of things that
I've done outside work that a community
based things that I just can't help
doing so I run a couple of meetups
one of them's on a bench in a park this
year Hackney one that's down here this
was a community website that I set up
for people in the area of London that I
lived in at the time and that was just
about was about getting people together
and thinking that actually as a group of
people we were more powerful and we
could get things done on the other side
is some of the organizations that I've
worked with where I've built communities
of practice or are in the process of
helping them build communities of
practice just mentioned GDS before which
was where I worked for a while getting
people together and a lot of the
learnings from there are taken to other
places too so communities practice as
described by Etienne Wenger trainer and
his wife Beverly Trainor they are groups
of people who share a concern or a
passion for something they do and learn
how to do it better as they interact
regularly it's been popularized by Artie
quick show of hands who's seen the
Spotify engineering videos quite quite a
few people that's really kind of pushed
out this idea of communities of practice
and communities of interest
so communities are practice I tend to
tend to make them about people that are
doing the same role they are non
hierarchical this is really important
they're quite like a team but they don't
have an end date and they're voluntary
and voluntary is really important
they're also longer term and more about
organizational structure and a bit more
kind of strategic than a team all right
can anyone tell me what this picture is
heard so much you have silos here in
Denmark okay so you know that you have
silos in your organization when you say
things like this and I've done this
myself so you say often say procurement
/ rubbish commercial of rubbish that
seam over there they're rubbish and that
means that you're you stop talking about
people as individuals and you start
talking about them and some modernist
groups and that's much easy to
disassociate them as people and it's
easier to blame them quick show of hands
who has silos in their organization
those of you that don't do you just work
on your own so communication can be very
difficult it causes a G plication of
work it causes frustration it's actually
one of the things that makes it really
difficult to do a j'l when you're in a
large organization because you end up
going yeah it's all great and we're
doing all this stuff and then suddenly
security swoop in and say you can't
release that you're gonna have to go
through I've been working in government
you're gonna have to go through these
many number of forms before you can do
anything so this is the old world when
we lived in functional silos or I like
to think of them as may be typing pools
and I used to live in this world I was a
project manager don't tell anyone
that's a secret I was a project manager
I worked i sat with other project
managers we had developers the
developers sat on developers
the designers sat with designers and it
was great for learning from each other
and it was great for communication
between each other it was great that you
know we could we could really get good
at our craft because we spent a lot of
time together not very good for team
working not very good for the teams that
are working on an individual outcome so
we mix that up and we have
multidisciplinary teams we kind of make
those little silos and so that's great
for team working but you've kind of lost
that getting together and talking that
you had before then we put some programs
around that so we've got our team silos
and our program silos and then what
you've got is you know the developer
that works over there doesn't ever talk
to the developer that works over here
because they're so far away from each
other so they're not really getting
together on any occasion so we need to
put some structure around that structure
not terrible word to help get people
together and this is where communities
of practice come in so it cuts across
teams it cuts across programs sometimes
it cuts across organizations and the
really important bit here so up the side
towards the program and the team that's
the what you do that's the day-to-day
what you're doing and you know gives you
the direction of why you're doing it but
this bit across the community is that
how you do it so I like to think of this
as keeping you honest so if you've ever
been in a situation where you're the
only person on your team that does a
particular role and you've got maybe
program manager program director or
someone product owner trying to make you
do things in a way that you don't think
is quite the right way to do things this
is the group of people that you can then
turn to and say is this crazy am i all
right in thinking that I'm pushing back
on this you've got this you've got this
group here so this is kind of real
matrix management as well what it also
allows you to do is scale we all love
scale all right everyone talks about
scale the real
the place that you really want to get to
with a community of practice is that
that group of people own the quality and
standards of what it means at doing that
role now I've been in places where
you'll have a center of excellence that
would be a bunch of people that dictate
how people do a role and they might
write some guidance and there so this is
how you do the role you have to follow
these these rules but what the community
of practice is about is that those
people that actually do the RO and
understand it owning what that means and
getting better all the time the other
thing is the authority board or the
sign-off boards actually if you're
putting if you have the team's talking
the people in the community talking on a
regular basis and sharing what good
looks like then you can push that
quality into the teams rather than
having to do it afterwards so quick show
of hands who is in a community of
practice great quite a few kids who is
setting one up for you more very popular
at the moment which is great for me as a
consultant so before I talk any more
about communities of practice I'm just
going to talk about sense of community
and this is important for any community
and it's worth bearing in mind when you
are setting up a community of practice
and probably worth thinking about with
your teams as well there are four
aspects of sense of community excuse me
those things are membership so
understanding the criteria for being a
member understanding whether you're in
or out how can be quite easy on a team
because you know whether you're on the
team or not or not always and having
that a safe environment that safety and
that safe to ask stupid questions close
the door and talk about stuff that might
be sensitive the next thing is influence
that the members have influence over the
community and the community has
influence over its members the best
picture for fulfillment of needs I find
is an ice cream so people members need
to feel rewarded for being part of it I
mentioned communities of practice of
voluntary people have to feel that
they're getting something out of it or
they won't take part in it
and finally emotional connection which I
always depict as being in the pub so
time to bond shared history and shared
participate participation or something
that people can identify so those four
aspects for any type of community not
just a community of practice but it's
worth bearing in mind so why are they
essential so I've mentioned that people
need to feel supported in their roles I
often when I talk about communities of
practice talk about support networks
first because AG organizations are full
of people and people are everything and
if they don't feel supported then they
won't hang around or they're biddy
motivated so that's really important we
also learn better when we learn together
and learning is one of the most visible
bits of value that any community of
practice will have just to explain
whilst I was at GDS our community of
practice was a group of delivery
managers that met on a weekly basis for
an hour
I think they've mixed it
now they meet every other week at the
moment and often would get together and
do something around learning so we were
passing information between each other
and learning together now actually quick
question is anyone here on a training
budget do you have training couple of
one two three do people have training
budgets what you have yeah yeah let us
know and we sign it off maybe so lots of
organizations think about training of
individuals or professional development
as an individualistic activity it's
something that people do but groups
don't necessarily do and so what happens
is individuals get trained in different
things the things they're interested in
and then you have this disparity in the
in the community or not community in
that role of people within the
organization and the other thing that
I've seen is that sometimes training
budgets come from different places so
some people have asked asked access to
this stuff and other people don't so you
have you know people growing at
different rates so if you do have a
community of practice obviously it all
magically goes green and everybody
learns from each other and you can start
thinking about that group of people and
the skills development of that group of
people as a whole and it doesn't have to
be just sending people on training
courses or sending them to conferences
it could be that actually one person the
community knows something about
something and other people don't so they
can bring that knowledge in and share it
with other people and find different
ways of doing that the other thing so
social learning theory which out Albert
bandura talked about in 1977 is all
about how we we learn from mimicking
other people so we learn as children
from copying what our parents do and I
saw this in action a little while back I
went to visit my brother and his wife
and their two kids and one of the kids
she was going around cleaning everything
this
spray can and she was just cleaning
everything and I was thinking why is she
doing that that's quite weird and then I
realized that her mother is obsessed
with cleaning stuff so she's just
mimicking that I asked if I could take
her home she could do my house my
sister-in-law wasn't too keen on that
didn't really happen so we learn we
learn from each other and we need time
to practice so I was talking to a friend
of mine recently and he's a developer
and he had this at this moment of
Epiphany
iffen II and I thought that's great I'm
gonna steal that and what he said was
thinking about this thing that
footballers so footballers they train
loads they spend loads of time
practicing and then they have they have
an important game they don't you know
you wouldn't hire a footballer and just
make them do an important game every day
so it's not fair as developers this
match day every day you don't really get
that time to stand back and practice it
so another one for you all to take away
for your managers they treat me like a
footballer so you need a safe space to
practice in just people here do things
like coding Carter's practice like that
one so the types of things that you can
do within your community for practising
presentations and talks from internal
and external speakers one of the things
that I recommend a lot to communities is
when they have their sessions together
that if they can't go to conferences and
actually wonderful conference is like go
to record all the talks so they can
watch them together they don't have to
be there they don't have to pay to bring
someone in time to practice skills in a
safe environment I often say to people
that run what lots of workshops that
they can practice those workshops with
their peers in that safe environment
before taking them out to clients or to
their real team things like games and
workshops and exercise
but learning and also visits when you
have a community you can visit go and
visit another organization that does
similar things to you it's easier when
you're a government department and
you're not
you haven't got commercially sensitive
things on the wall it's harder when you
you don't want to go and see your
competitors
I had one organization where there
that's great but we can't bring other
people in because they can't see
anything we can bring them in and just
talk to them downstairs so learning from
other people and other organizations
it's something that you can do as a
group
now not all knowledge can be written
down so many times and I've seen this
same with an organization that I'm
working with at the moment the
communities are practice for them sit
within knowledge management and it's
been a knowledge management term for a
very long time and what they tend to do
is they confuse communities of practice
with tools so they build or they buy
some kind of networking platform and
they put people they get people to sign
up and they think that the community
talking on there is is shows that
they're talking to each other and they
forget about a human side of communities
of practice so I wouldn't be an agile
coach worth my salt if I didn't have
either Japanese words or taiichi ohno on
the screen so here's a picture of Tai
Chi owner say knowledge is something you
buy with the money and wisdom is
something your choir by doing it and I
turn this into the knowledge iceberg so
the knowledge iceberg at the top has
explicit knowledge this is the stuff
that you can write down the stuff that
you put on that wiki that no one can
ever find that stuff so the stuff that
you can write down the processes that
may be repeatable and then under the
water you have this implicit knowledge
or tacit knowledge and the tacit
knowledge is the stuff that
lives in our culture and lives in our
people and you can't really write it
down so it might be the thing sometimes
it seems like that person on the that
person over there in the organization
knows how to get things signed off
really quickly but they can't really
write that down because that's just you
know knowing how to pick up the phone
and talk to someone so there's lots of
there's lots of bits that live within
our culture and we need some kind of we
need some kind of structure to help that
live in them in the brain of the
organization rather in the people
individuals so it's not exercise this
talk another question who had who left
their last job within five years
okay keep your hand up if that was four
years three two one
couple those either longer than that is
very impressive so on average people
move jobs every four point four years
so says Forbes and those people that are
a bit younger so born between the early
80s and the 2000s it's more often and I
would suggest that in in digital without
very buoyant job markets that we move
quite often more often than that and
when they leave they take bits of your
organizational brain with them I often
have conversations this has happened in
a few places I've been so setting up
communities of practice and that's all
good and the organization's have a mix
of permanent employees and contractors
and they say well we're not going to
invite the contractors to the
communities of practice because we're
not going to they're not being paid to
learn they're here they're being paid to
do a job
and I say okay well then how what point
do you ever get that knowledge transfer
that knowledge from those contractors
into the organization you end up with
this perpetual contractor cycle because
you're never actually getting that extra
benefit and bringing them in I actually
saw
a an email just on this subject the
other day where someone said the
contractor can't take part they'll be
called upon when we need knowledge from
them something like that so a question I
would say so when was the last time you
had a good hand over see you joined an
organization and well you join a new
role and the person there before said
I've got great I've set away set aside
five days we're gonna sit down and do a
really good handover we can have five
days to do this and then you go and try
and find them and they've been called in
to some meeting so they've got some
stuff they've got to do because they're
gonna be leaving in five days they've
just got some loose ends to tie up and
then okay so a couple of days of
meetings great we've got three days and
then on the third day they like wasjust
something's gone wrong over here I'm
just gonna fix that great right we've
got two days and then on the Thursday
and while I need to go for lunch with my
team in the pub because I'm leaving and
they don't come back from that you know
okay not really had any hand over here
and then on the Friday well I've kind of
checked out I don't really care at this
point they're going to go and join
another company so they sit down with
you for 20 minutes and in 20 minutes you
need all the knowledge that's in their
head downloaded into your brain there's
really soup successful handovers they
always work so we don't want that we
don't want the let's just get everyone's
knowledge out of their head in 20
minutes
it's not going to work okay so
collaboration we all know collaboration
is good right and collaborate
elaboration leads to better practices I
don't like to use the term best
practices sounds really final it sounds
like one of those things that you can
write down I like to say better
practices because we should always be
looking for better ways to do things
and so there's a guy called Sandy
Pentland and he wrote a book called
social physics he's done a lot of
studies around the amount how successful
companies are based on the amount of
time that people in those companies talk
to each other he didn't experiment swear
he's put like little electric devices on
people that would see how many times
that they talk to each other and those
companies that talk more are more
successful and he also talks about
collaboration not being about working to
it together but actually about people
building on top of each other's
experiences so collaboration isn't just
that person past that person it's
exponentially more than that because
they're building on top of each other's
each other's knowledge and experience
and that's why teams of people have this
collective intelligence that's greater
than the sum of its parts
so we've moved from silos to sharing
knowledge and sharing knowledge is
something that happens particularly
early on in a community when people
start to get together they start to
share knowledge with each other and the
more they do that they start to talk
about common problems that they've had
and start to look for solutions to those
problems which leads them to using the
collective knowledge of the community to
create better practices now I have
Illustrated this for you with one of the
best Venn diagrams you'll find on the
Internet so here we have our silos and
here we have some knowledge sharing
which is great leads to less reducing
duplication and then we have this magic
so this is a graphic I stole borrowed
from tents Oh graphics it is available
as a t-shirt from the Threadless I know
how you all love Threadless t-shirts so
this is where the magic happens and this
is where the collaboration and the
better practices and the center of
excellence and the types of things this
is lovely this picture isn't it
who wants the duckbill platypus now at
home so the types of things that I've
seen communities are practice doing that
starts to create real value for the
organization and this is the stuff where
you start to be able to measure it and
show what great or great things it does
and take off the is it creating value
box so design communities crank design
patterns so things that other designers
or other parts of the organization can
use seeing product owners creating
training for the organization I've seen
lots of communities creating training
actually and is a real tangible
financial benefit there if you're not
sending people out to expensive training
courses developer communities creating
code tests and interviews for new
developers or as Camille was talking
about earlier developers creating
actually owning and creating those
career ladders and a large Bank in the
UK had their agile community ended up
creating an agile transformation
strategy for the organisation so it's
been said of spending all that money on
highly paid consultants they actually
did it internally did it for themselves
okay so I'm going to give you some tips
on getting started and then I'm going to
give you a couple of pointers so
something I've done recently going into
a new organization asked if communities
of practice are already forming so what
tends to happen is these things form
start forming by themselves people who
are looking for support from other
people or tend to reach out to people
like them
and they would start to pop up so if
they're forming you can build on them if
you see see them forming and you want to
be part of them you can you can go and
ask to be part of them if they aren't
already forming there might be reasons
why they're not there might be cultural
reasons that's stopping them an
organization I was working with recently
they have the dreaded utilization rates
and you want to here have utilization
rates sorry about that
how much of your time do you spend
making it up I just put just put a
little bit here and I'll just put a
little bit here and it will add up and
it would be okay
managers may be trying to suppress
people do doing things that isn't
delivering or what they think is
delivering and there may be other
reasons why they're not forming next
thing to do get people together
regularly and it starts things forming
when I say regularly what I say to new
communities is that they should get
together once a week and the reason for
once a week is that if it becomes twice
a week that's once every other week if
you miss one of those then you don't see
anyone for a month and it starts to
become a really long time as it makes it
really difficult for anything to form
and this is a quote from somebody who
was in a early community workshop when I
got some people together it was about
knowing that they weren't alone and
actually what happens a lot of the time
is there be someone over here doing a
role and someone over here doing a role
they didn't know that each other we're
doing that role and they didn't ever
have that chance to talk to each other
so getting people together as a great
place to get people to start talking to
each other creating a community charter
who here has a team charter or set of
values and principles in their team's
only a couple
if you don't then you should so this is
your vision and things like the way
you're going to behave towards each
other and some of the values that you
live to so did this recently with a
client I used a workshop called the anti
problem so I got them to talk about
what's the worst community what would
the worst community look like and gotten
sober they kind of came out with zombies
it's up there somewhere
came out with all the things that would
make it terrible so in being judged
people not taking part that kind of
thing and that actually led them to
creating their own manifesto which is
the anti delivery community manifesto so
they created this as a group and now
this is something that they can kind of
hang their hats on and always work
towards and call each other out if it's
not working very well there is a link on
here to the blog post that they wrote
about this another thing that you can do
and you should do is create a shared
backlog of work so those things those
shared problems that people have the
things that they want to work on
creating shared backlog putting that in
Trello and working on that some of your
meetings it's a great way to build
community I'm going to do the hands off
again who here does regular
retrospectives not everyone but quite a
lot of people which is great so the same
with a community if you're in a
community of practice you want to make
sure that it is meeting people's needs
so you want to be retrospect seeing
regularly that might be it's not going
to be every two weeks if you're only
meeting every week because that would be
a bit intense but on a regular basis
just checking in to see if it's still
meeting people's needs or what it is
that you need to do to change it and
create the community that you want it to
be okay so a couple of other tips I'm
going to give you before I stop too
they take time to work so it actually
takes quite a lot of effort to draw
people together particularly when the
they've got their projects and they the
thing that drops out it's the same with
retrospectives the thing that drops out
when you're really busy is the thing
that could probably help you in the long
run be less busy so it's that learning
that stops that retrospect seeing that
stops and those communities of practice
that stops so it takes time and effort
this is a graph that I use in a maturity
model that I have in my book and also
free to download on my website which
I'll give you at the end a community
goes through a number of stages and the
energy the really important thing if any
of you are doing this and it's quite
early on just after forming where people
have started to get together and get
excited about this thing there's a dip
in energy and you suddenly go it's not
working and that's just because the new
shiny thing has stops it needs to it
goes through this dip and that's really
normal but conversely on this graph is
that the dotted line which is the the
kind of input that it takes to make it
happen so this might be from an
individual it might be from a group of
individuals preferably a group rather
than one person so it takes a lot of
time and that means that people actually
need to be given time one ongoing
debates I have at the moment with an
organization is about reducing
utilization rates or at least creating a
job code so that people can actually put
their time on community activity and not
just bury it in something else somewhere
along the line communities must be
empowered to make things happen so this
doesn't actually have to happen at the
beginning so you can just start getting
together and and making things happen
but at some point you're gonna need some
recognition from your organization in
order to change things now I was
speaking to somebody at Barclays Bank
recently
and they have Barclays have communities
of practice fairly established within
their organization and one thing that
they did when they started actually
their first community of practice was
around no sequel and they had a bunch of
people over there doing some
investigation a bunch of people over
there and they weren't joined up so
someone saw an opportunity to join up
people that were doing the same thing
and let them learn from each other and
it was it was a safe to fail environment
because they didn't really tell a senior
management about it they just kind of
went about it and it worked
it was great they got some good results
from it and they did this again with
another two communities and they worked
too so then they went and pitched this
to the I think the CIO as a thing that
needed some backing and at that point
they managed to formalize them a little
bit more get some money put behind them
and also get each community had ended up
with a senior sponsor so somebody on the
big table that would support them and
fight their cause not everyone will want
to join in and that's okay you can't
make everybody do it that's fine you
have different types of community
members you need core community actually
someone asked me once how small kind of
community be and I think the answer I
said was three people three people is
the community and that's fine so you
have core people and those are the
people that make it happen you'll have
active people people that will come
along regularly occasional those people
would dip in and out a peripheral
members tend to be your lurkers and if
any of you a part of any online
communities you all know that those
you've seen those lurkers would just be
there maybe you'll be one of them and
sometimes their dip in and what tends to
happen is particularly with online
communities actually is that people move
in towards the middle when they're
looking for more support maybe they need
something extra so they come in you can
exist without most of those layers you
can
exist without the core but everything
else is alright and then just one other
bit of advice don't become your own silo
so you've you've built this community
shut all the doors you create this safe
space and then you don't want to become
your own silo as well so what I often
recommend is the early days that people
fight do you find a safe space and close
the door and understand what membership
looks like and keep keep the community
to that membership but then they do
other things that open the door as well
so one thing I had whilst I was at GDS I
had lots of people saying well I want to
learn about I want to learn more about
agile delivery can I come to your
community and I found myself saying you
can't come to these meetings because we
need we need our safe space but what
we're going to do for you in stairs is
offer you some some open space where you
can ask us whatever you want in this
space over here and we would do that
learning we'd do that sharing but you
can join up with other communities too
so finally just a bit of roundup
communities practice can help you scale
create support network for members can
accelerate professional development
share knowledge and create better
practice increase collaboration and
create value for the organization do
remember it takes time and effort not
everyone will want to take part and
that's ok they will need at some point
to be empowered in some way and it needs
that sense of community to make it work
always put a picture you book up
consultant 101 that's it there it's nice
and small
so it's not intimidating and you can
read it quite quickly it's actually it's
narration 1 I wrote it in an agile way
it is iteration 1 thank you don't forget
to rate
okay I've totally forgotten to look at
the questions that have been submitted
so would anyone like to ask questions we
have some time left hi great talk I'm
wondering if you can talk a little bit
more about the differences between
building communities that practices
inside an organization like you
mentioned Oh letting that team come to
some of the meetings about this or
whatever and then talk about communities
outside an organization like meetups etc
like what are some of the similarities
or differences okay so so I I tend to
talk about communities inside an
organization but I also run meetups
which I I don't think I don't think that
I've got them to the point where they
feel like a community and some of that
actually is about that that sense of
community stuff I realized the other day
that in the meetups I run there is no we
don't actually let the members influence
the direction of what we're doing we
kind of go this is what we do and we
haven't actually asked you if that's all
right yet but you turn up so that's okay
I would say that it's probably it's kind
of it's it's harder to build stuff
that's outside of an organization
because there's it's kind of less
imperative to go along particularly if
you have people around you that are
doing something similar similar to you I
think if you're in an organization where
you are the only person within the
organization then you tend to kind of
reach out to those to those a bit more
so they're probably a little bit more
you've probably got a lot more
occasional people in those than you have
active members it's probably mostly
caught and occasional probably yes I
hope that helps okay I've managed to go
access to the question is now how do you
define communities in an organization
where the roles are deliberately blurred
so there's no QA role or developer role
good question and something that I'm
dealing with at the moment so I've
stopped talking about job titles and
started talking about roles and within
that particular organization and for
those people that our core members
suggested that they find a way to
describe those roles without using the
job title and then if people identify
with those so they're doing they sharing
the same challenges and doing the same
things that they are then part of that
community of practice or a quick one
hopefully our communities are practice
the same as Spotify guilds I said this
to someone at Spotify and they won't
know so let me remember that's okay
Spotify have chapters and gills and
their chapters are a little bit more
like communities of interest so that is
people that are interested in specific
things and they are more active their
guilds I think are quite like
communities of practice they also have I
believe lie management that goes through
the gills which is similar to the model
that we had at GDS and that lie
management was through communities of
practice so yes I think so
okay and two questions that are kind of
two sides of the same coin
one can you build a community without
buying from management and second how do
you get people to participate and fight
for their right when they get pressured
by deadlines focused managers so yes you
can build a community of practice
without support from the organization it
will become harder at some point because
you won't necessarily be able to change
those utilization rates or get money or
the things that are good but if you up
to build one without support for
management you can then use the success
of that to sell it in and often showing
something being successful is far better
than talking about how it might be
successful
second question how do you get people to
fight for their right when they get
pressured by managers focusing on
deadlines so that's where I think
seniors support comes in and if you can
find someone that believes that
community's a practice or a good thing
get them onside and get them to support
you I would say have you got any tips on
creating communities of practice in
distributed teams like I'm doing at the
moment yeah so face-to-face is always
best we all know this this is good so
one of the things at the moment I'm
trying to build communities if a
challenge tronic build communities
practice in teams that are distributed
across the country so at least in one
country not in many countries spend get
some time where they can be face-to-face
if you can if you can't get everyone in
the same room then if you can send one
person from over here it's over there
one day and kind of mix it up a bit so
people start to get to know each other
and videocalls a good audio calls are
terrible if anyone's been on a huge
audio calls they just kind of not
listening you switch off you don't know
who's talking but also other tools as
well so when you're not meeting slack is
great and one of the great things about
slack is it has that random Channel and
the random Channel is the bit where you
have those conversations that aren't
necessarily work-related and helps break
down some of those barriers and helps
build trust so it's difficult but it's
much like just to be distributed teams
it's possible and final question does
the community need a leader of some sort
so I often talk about community leaders
and you can have leaders a appointed so
it might be someone like when I was at
GDS I was a head of role but actually
one of the things I wanted to do in that
in that role is
kind of step back and let the community
people from the community lead the
community so it's that I'd say it's that
core team that end up leading the
community lots of different things that
they might do just things like you know
making sure meetings happen and
interesting things are happening and
that people are motivated to take part
so lots of different things there but
you kind of you have you know a group of
leaders rather than a specific leader
