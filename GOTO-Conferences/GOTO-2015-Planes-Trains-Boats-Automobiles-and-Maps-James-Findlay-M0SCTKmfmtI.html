few questions about relevance so I know
you had a late night last night but
there's a bit of audience participation
so who here thinks that digital services
and technology are relevant in the 21st
century the show of hands yeah pretty
much everybody okay now are we as
digital technology people relevant today
yeah the jury is a little bit out on
that one now what do our businesses
think not sure I'm going to be a little
bit bold ooh juries definite definitely
out and how many people think that a
high-speed rail network in the 21st
century is relevant whoa okay a little
bit higher than normal not as
controversial as I thought so I'm going
to talk about government IT so thanks
Barry for actually warming me up a bit
about some economics as well I'm going
to talk about maps and I'm going to talk
about visualization of data so got UK
government technology well it's had a
pretty bad rap over the last few years
certainly in this country as we saw
earlier it's not it's a universal issue
now the government digital service which
is just down the road they use this term
but there's many differences between the
private and public sector so normally
when you're interacting with the
government service it's at a very
emotional time of your life certainly is
for me when I'm paying my tax that's a
very special emotional moment but also
you interacted it some other quite
dramatic moments of your life it could
be interacting with a criminal justice
system that means we have to make sure
that the services that we have
are relevant and frankly government IT
has been pretty rubbish over the years
we've got our own version of Medicare we
have the national program for IT cost
hundreds and hundreds of millions of
pounds the litigation as the consequence
of the failure was not far short of a
billion pounds so we've got our own
story to tell here and that's not just
for internal IT if you were trying to
interact with government IT take prison
visits for an example you'd have to call
up you had a window of just a few hours
for booking a prison visit in the whole
country if you missed that slot you
didn't get a visit all government IT was
provided by five companies over ninety
percent as was mentioned earlier it was
fractured our services we had hundreds
of websites it made no sense you're
entering the same information to another
government organization over and over
again basically just reflecting the
silos of the bureaucracy behind them as
opposed to actual service that was
required or that you were trying to get
access to users who the hell are they
you know this is about us this with
government we tell people what to do
that's the most important thing and
actually it costs a ridiculous amount of
money that's about one percent of the UK
gdp for rubbish IT so economics what has
GDP got to do with all well Liza
Minnelli she had a pretty good view
about money makes the world go round and
it's true but here are some interesting
pieces of information they turned the
millennium UK as a percentage of world
gdp was about just below five percent by
2028 is going to be two-point-six
percent and in the same period the Asian
markets and in fact all the bricks are
going to be expanding so if you're not
from the UK you should still be a little
bit worried because all Western
economies are in decline so by 2028
Europe will be about fourteen point six
percent
so David Higgins he's the chairman of
high-speed to limited and of course he'd
say that but you have to ask yourself
why but now everyone forgets the United
Kingdom is an archipelago over
ninety-five percent of our trade by
weight comes by see 14 and a half
thousand teu what's that that's about a
30 ships Second World War convoy in one
ship the new masks eat Triple E Class
our vast imagine that hitting our
transport infrastructure not only that
you only have to travel not just here in
the UK but around most countries now the
strategic road network is chock-a-block
the first two lanes usually blocked up
with with trucks and lorries with
everyone compressed into the other lane
so it's not just about I'm sure we all
experience sniffing someones armpit on a
commuter train or struggling with the
delayed a train due to very aging
infrastructure some of it over 100 years
old and we're going to read it a
critical point by the mid 20s mid-2020s
the west coast main line which is the
primary route for a lot of freight is
going to be full and that's not just for
passengers there is no spare capacity
for freight and as we heard earlier
money makes the world go round and
there's a another challenge we have a
growing population and it's increasingly
urbanized so that's going to put more
demands on the transport infrastructure
lots of other segundus services of
course but on the transport
infrastructure and one of the other
challenges we've got to create a
capability
for the next generation and generations
after that can compete not just in the
UK market but globally and the other
challenge is we have to rebalance the
economy through job creation and moving
a London southeast centric economy to
other parts of the United Kingdom we're
very lucky that we have a global mega
city in the form of London on our shores
and we have to maximize that and make
sure the distribution and the benefits
of having one are distributed and the
other challenge we've got to do is to
create that capability by having
apprentices people that do create a
significant amount of graduates and
another thing for the wider community
particularly in urban areas where as we
saw the statistics of telling us we're
going to have an increasingly urbanized
population we have to regenerate those
there's been successes in London
regeneration around Kings Cross but we
need to generate more regeneration
across the whole of the country but all
of this comes at a cost not just
financial but environmental and a human
perspective and we live in a democracy
and it's important that we have an
informed debate about something that's
so profoundly impactful one of the other
challenges that we have there's an
expectation that this will be the
fastest design and legislative process
this country has ever seen for
infrastructure of this type we've got
some massive innovation targets and one
of the challenges we have is that for
phase 1 and phase 2 the only way we can
actually achieve some of the
efficiencies is through innovation
through 5d modelling of our data
so we don't sit in isolation from the
rest of the transport infrastructure it
needs to ensure that we fit in a wider
strategy so what has maps got all about
technology and transport and the like
Simon Wardley I had a serendipity moment
in about twenty twelve and probably the
most important point here is he's this
destroyer of undeserved value Barry
mentioned about value and he says that
he said something quite profound to me
he talked about situational awareness so
I'm an ex-military person and that meant
something very very specific to me and
what he asked was why is everyone doing
it so sixty-seven percent of successful
companies do cloud big data social media
but one of the things you have to ask
yourself is why why does a general
bombard a hill is it because a report
says sixty-seven percent of successful
generals bombard Hills or is it they're
thinking about situational where
awareness the how the what the why aware
the when and in military terms where can
we attack why attack over here as
opposed to over there how do we attack
to do what when to do it now Simon
covers it's quite a complex area I'm
just going to try it quickly gallop
through just for around user needs the
value chain the context and some tactics
where you use lean and agile and
appropriate way and the context of this
it will be hs2 but first of all really
simple we all know that we need to
understand what they actually need
but you also need to understand the
relationship between all the components
that support that need and then you map
it you map it against where it is from a
maturity or evolutionary perspective and
what on earth has that got to do with
hs2 technology and lean well this was
the box and wire diagram I'm sure you've
seen hundreds of these in your your
careers in 2012 but this is what it
looked like once we'd mapped it and what
we noticed it seemed a bit obvious I
guess in hindsight is that the 3d
visualization was absolutely critical
and this was after discussing it with
the business not sitting in isolation we
then went through Simon's sort of
methodology approach we identified the
differentiation and the need we
identified everything else was really
that's hidden from a user perspective
and there's lots of things right for
efficiency but the challenge we had is
that our current system was treated as a
single entity from a commercial and
technology point of view we broke it
down into units we applied the right
methodology agile works quite well into
the unique and novel end of the spectrum
Lean Six Sigma works of the more
ubiquitous industrial end of the
spectrum as well those things that were
of high value business value not value
to us as an organ I we decided we
haven't got a bottomless pit of
resources that we'd focus on some
high-value items everything else was
utility we'd outsource it we decided
where we do it how platform-as-a-service
data service anything as a service but
we also used open data open standards
open api's as an approach and we
prioritized
so what happened next I'll talk about
each of those from a government
perspective you heard earlier we
consolidated everything WK now is the
single platform for all government at
services and departments there were 25
digital exemplars go on the website have
a look you saw a picture of the website
earlier and the other thing is we broke
down the oligopoly we've started huge
disaggregation of government contracts
over fifty percent of the sales on the
digital marketplace and g-cloud are now
with SMEs and overall there's been
significant amount of money put into the
SMEs which is the lifeblood of any
economy in a country Gulf kaise you
heard is now online and every service
digital service that we now design in
government is based around the user need
and it's cheaper so hs2 we don't sit in
isolation and
in a remarkable mo piece of cross
political what's the best way I have to
be very careful of alignment staggering
I've never seen anything like it is that
over the last seven eight years the
ports in this country have been dredged
to accept the new container ships we've
been investing there's a huge strategic
road investment program that's going on
so you might have been impacted if you
know the British roadway system the hard
shoulders which is where sort of people
pull over if they've had an accident or
in trouble they're rarely used what
we're going to do is going to open those
by default and use technology to ensure
that when there is an instant you
treated appropriately and as a
consequence there's no major
construction requirements the impacts
that low but you've instantly increased
capacity and of course the other part
where how it's been to fits in I'd love
to say that it's about getting to
Birmingham 15 minutes faster if only
that were true it is true why would you
build a Victorian railway in the 21st
century but actually you have three
types of users on our road rail network
you have intercity passenger local
passenger and freight so crudely to
increase capacity you get one of those
users off onto something else that's
something else is the high-speed
passenger railway network which
increases capacity on the existing
network for freight a network rail
they're funded in five year cycles and
from about seven eight years ago they've
been dropping the tracks or under the
tunnels and bridges to increase capacity
for freight from the ports that you can
use standard ISO carriages to maximize
the freight capacity on the network the
other thing is is we're investing in the
capability there's going to be a
high-speed rail college two campuses one
in Birmingham one in Doncaster and the
user is going to be at the heart of the
design vision for high-speed to
but the other thing is it's not just the
high-speed rail network it's 350 km/h
it's also high frequency 18 hours per
hour every three minutes and the only
way that they can achieve that is
through technology and innovation and
like other government agencies we have
to fit within the wider as a technology
strategy so this is at where we were on
premise very expensive infrastructure
using the wardley mapping and this is
where we are headed we delivered the
first digital piece of legislation in
British history in record time we're
saving with our migration to close the
cloud services over ninety-five percent
of our costs of having on-premise whilst
it's the largest most complex piece of
legislation in British history it's also
the most open you can use non
proprietary software browsers whatever
you want any operating system you can do
full text retrieval of the entire piece
of legislation we're releasing data sets
on to data Gulf UK predominantly line of
route geospatial data we got external
accreditation around our maturity for
visualization of data 3d and over ninety
percent of our infrastructure is now
based in the cloud based on user
feedback both from the public and the
Parliament we created interactive map on
our website and we're also working on a
street view of the line of route to help
with the conversation and virtual
reality proof of concepts so we're
looking at vr using oculus rifts and
looking at holographic stuff to it
improve collaboration with the supply
chain the future Tim O'Reilly I don't
know if he's a relation
he talked about government as a platform
a very long time ago that's been
embraced in the UK we're going to be
creating platforms which people can
build from create an ecosystem around
government platforms komal tech services
user centric virtual reality I've
already mentioned and we're creating
hopefully the first digital way Railway
ever so in summary it's all about
capacity it's about improving our
capability so that we can compete
globally and collaboration so that it
can be as efficient as possible and of
course it's cheaper faster and better
and it was underpinned by mapping using
Simon's technique and if done right we
can make a massive difference and it's
incumbent upon us particularly when you
know make a project I high speed to that
you do do it right and you treat people
with respect they deserve particularly
having a high impact to both them their
businesses and the environment um I was
going to answer some questions because I
might not be here for the panel but I
just thought I'd provide a little bit of
evidence this is the third iteration of
our visualization of the data that we
submit to the parliament in this country
this latest iteration it links back to
the various and you can see the
references in the top left or to do to
the design drawings that were submitted
to Parliament which are formed part of
the legislation but one of the user
feedback that we had is it's great we
published all this data on data.gov but
it was didn't feel as accessible as it
should do and we are visual beings
through visualization it makes it far
more real you can start seeing some of
the impacts or some of the mitigations
and you can start trying to drill down
what is the access road what does that
actually mean what is engineering
earthworks what does a balancing pandu
and that provides
a more informed debate around the
subject so I'm not sure about the time
we run over a little bit so I'm happy to
take a couple of questions I'm going to
hopefully I've got to go to a meeting
but I hopefully come back later tonight
if you want to sort of NAB me so yep so
I'm going to try and get back for that
but I'm happy to take some questions so
that's going to be a sorry so what's the
role of the college for high-speed rail
so that's going to be looking at trying
to create some of the stem type skills
that that we have we're working with the
local universities and Industry to make
sure the skills that come out of there
whether it's apprenticeship engineering
type skills whether its technology
skills will be fit for them to go into
the workplace so it's basically around
science technology and engineering the
skills that we're focusing around any
others right phase one I think to
Birmingham it's about a hundred miles
and then up to Leeds and Manchester I
think in total it's about 250 300 miles
max and it's 250 miles an hour so it's
not the highest speed rail in the world
but it will be a highest frequency and
what's fascinating is that we have
attracted some inward investment of the
consequence of some of our thinking some
of the innovation that's going in from
Japan so they've moved some of their
it's the first time they've moved any
engineering manufacturing outside in
Japan ever they moved the hitachi
rolling stock to the northeast of the UK
a few years ago so that's very exciting
