we're going to introduce two I'm going
to introduce this topic somewhat
obliquely
I'm gonna go back to the panel session
that I was involved in yesterday where
we were talking about the agile
manifesto how it came about where it
goes that kind of thing and something I
didn't talk about during that session
which was my biggest disappointment with
how the agile movement has gone since we
wrote the manifesto there one of the
good things about the agile movement is
that before the agile movement began we
had this world where we would try and
take some big block of documentation
representing a year or two years of work
and try to turn it into software in kind
of one go and what the agile movement
has done has said well we can break down
that big block of software into the
individual little pieces that we call
stories and we can build the software
story at a time this incremental ism is
a good thing and it leads to lots of
useful benefits we can see where we're
going we're able to change direction etc
etc etc but this model which is still
which is now kind of pretty common still
has a big problem in it from my a
dualist hopeful perspective and that
problem is the direction of this error
it's still perceived by many people that
these stories these requirements
whatever you call them they develop my
business people or by analysts and they
are given to programmers who then code
them up and that is not what we had in
mind at all well we had in mind was a
different kind of world where
programmers and analysts and business
people would would work together to come
up with these stories they'll go for a
collaborative process of coming up with
these things
now a good example of this is something
that Jess shared during that same agile
panel he's talked about a case at Amazon
where a programmer had said oh I think
it would be a good idea to offer
recommendations to people when they're
checking out with a shopping cart and he
got opposition including from the VP of
Marketing who said no nothingness slow
down the shopping cart people will click
away or something and we can't prevent
shopping because what is the most
important thing in America
do you remember shopping that was a
couple of years ago but you know some of
you still remember but this guy he was
working at Amazon he just did it anyway
he built it and they ran the a/b tests
on it and they found that actually got
more revenue that way and that's an
exact lovely example you know the lowly
programmer coming up and out thinking
the marketing VP right and I hope that's
a story that appeals to many people here
I mean after all we are the more kind of
engaged developers we don't want to be
just told what to do we want to take a
bigger role in it so we want to be in a
position where developers are at least
part of the influence and coming up with
stories but that needs a couple of
things to do that the first thing it
needs is knowledge we need to be aware
of our domains and we need to spend time
learning about them and sometimes young
developers to come and ask me Oh what
should I learn should I learn JavaScript
should I learn know sequel databases
should I learn functional programming
accept etc and I often respond by saying
well it's not specific technologies you
should know about the most important
thing in many ways is to learn
fundamental design principles things
that correspond to multiple technologies
and the bencher over time another thing
that's really important is to learn
about that the domain that you're
working in now when I was working in
healthcare I found it really interesting
to understand how doctors fought how
they organized information and when I
went into the city of London I learned
about her foreign exchange traders
worked
and discovered that maybe foreign
exchange trading was not something I was
they're really very interested in but
knowledge is important you have to have
the knowledge in order to play this
conversational role you know the fulfil
what me and the other agile ists were
hoping for in the early days but it's
not but once you begin to get that
knowledge and you begin to play a role
in coming up with the future then
there's something else that comes into
the play as well and that is
responsibility as you begin to know more
about what you're doing and have an
impact in what you're doing you take on
responsibility for what you produce
there's an example of where that comes
in that people from people don't think
about is the topic of dark patterns does
anyone ever come across dark patterns
you know so dark patterns are things
where the user experience the user
interface the computer software itself
is encouraging users to do things that
aren't in their benefit in their
interest let's go back to the shopping
cart let's say you see some nice
beautiful electronics Iggy's MO and you
say oh I like that click buy and then
the software decides oh we'll slip in
for a small extra fee some extra
insurance on that it doesn't ask you it
puts it in the shopping cart on your
behalf you might be able to see it and
think about it and think oh could I turn
that reject it later on but it decided
to put it in there for you there are the
examples of that as well one example is
printer cartridges you've probably seen
that now that the same printer cartridge
on a Windows computer at some point it
has certain accounts two pages has
printed and at some counters we'll just
say the cartridge is empty and will not
let you print if you install or put the
same computer and run it with Linux
attached to printer the Linux drivers
will let you print and print and print
until the ink is actually completely
empty so what we see there as this other
dark pattern where the developers who
wrote the printer driver for Windows
implemented a feature there was maybe in
the interest of
employer but not in the interest of the
users of the product and the point is
that as you gain this knowledge you take
on this responsibility if you want we
want to play a role in shaping how the
software we produce effects we have to
take that responsibility and my view is
the developer who wrote that code for
the printer cartridge who said it's you
know running out of ink when it isn't
there every bit as responsible for the
consequences of that as the person who
told them to do it it's not enough to
just say oh I was told to do this I'm
not responsible you have a choice and
you have a choice as to how you work and
how you live and you have the
responsibility to ensure that your users
are well treated and to reject dark
patterns and stay instead I should be an
advocate for my users and I guess
sometimes to get developer thing but I
need a job my boss made me do it and we
come back to that later but an important
point that I want to raise early on is
we are incredibly privileged as people
who work in the software industry in the
Western world we all earn above-average
money and who generally is quite easy
for all of us to find new jobs so I
think it is actually quite a weak excuse
I would almost say to say I had to do it
because I need to earn money by the way
the reason I walk forwards like this
when he's speaking is because there's a
terrible echo back there and if you're
further back it's almost impossible to
hear what the other person saying so you
have to kind of walk to the edge of the
stage when you can hear properly
you probably have enough sound trouble
with me right I remember what he said in
Copenhagen so so we've talked about this
in terms of when we thought about this
in terms of the common interactions that
we've seen in software development we
have users that have needs we we have
some analysts who may be a programmer or
maybe a separate business analyst who
looks at those needs turns them into
intents basically packages and the
stories passage them to to the
programmer who writes the code and we
want that to be a more collaborative
circle where it's not so directional but
all
kind of working together but when we
think of this notion that we are
responsible for what that software is
doing we should also be thinking while
the responsibility doesn't just go as
far as are we doing the right thing
there are users it also means are we
doing the right thing in terms of the
world itself that is it's important for
us to make a judgment on the impact of
as the work that I'm doing as a software
developer actually doing good for the
world
now when I say doing good for the world
it's easy to get kind of very
highfalutin about this and think are the
only thing that would be doing good for
the world would be helping hospitals in
India or something but I I tend to not
look at it that way I look at it simply
as am i helping people provide services
that are actually useful an example for
this and I gave a talk something along
these lines a few years ago and somebody
called came up to me afterwards and said
well I don't really do anything that's
good for the world I'll just write
printer software and even before I could
reply the guy behind him piped up and
says but printer software is good I've
just bought a house I had to to sign
lots and lots of paperwork it was really
helpful for me to be able to print that
paperwork out myself
instead of what I otherwise would have
had to do so the point is it doesn't
mean something ground and and
magnificent as it were it's just the
ordinary thing of saying am i doing
little things that are actually valuable
to go back to the finance case if you're
writing software that's helping people
sell subprime mortgages that you know
are a bad idea for the people that buy
them then by helping your users do their
job better are you really making the
world better now actually I don't want
to answer even that question although
I've kind of cast it in a way that
sounds very obvious because it's
actually not important whether I or
whether Eric thinks you're doing the
right thing or the wrong thing by that
the important thing is that you take
make that thought to yourself you think
about that you decide whether what
you're doing is worthwhile or not
because you are you what I do think is
that you have to take responsibility for
that choice you are responsible for what
your software does to the world
now if touch that so far that in terms
of individual cases what happens for an
individual bit of software but there is
a broader picture as well which is we
have a whole profession of people
writing software creating software and
doing enormous things to change the way
in the world that we live in the process
and in doing that we have to think about
the the total impact of what we as a
profession do what impact it has upon
the world and I think there are a couple
of grave challenges that our profession
has at the moment the first one I'm just
gonna mention but we're not going to
talk about in any detail and that is the
serious problems that have been
highlighted by a couple of other
speakers here about the lack of
diversity in our population the fact
that you know most of the audience are
white guys like me and Eric and that
causes problems elsewhere in the world
as well when we see some of the nasty
hate campaigns that have been put out
that have gone out on some of the social
media forms against people in minorities
or historically disadvantaged groups we
have to think about how how does this
wonderful social network and the world
that we have how can we prevent that
kind of stuff from happening because
when that kind of stuff happens it is
our as though professions responsibility
so that I think is a serious problem but
the one are we going to focus on today
is a different but equally serious
problem and to introduce that which
you're going to know what it is from the
title of your overall talk I'm gonna set
you a little reading
this book is arguably the most important
book written during the 20th century it
certainly had a huge impact on our
thinking of the world and our vocabulary
all sorts of terms in English language
who have transplanted to plenty of other
languages including I'm sure Danish have
their roots in this one book his vision
was like most future predictions
sometimes amazingly accurate and
sometimes not so I mean he did
accurately predict that almost
everywhere you look
there'd be TV screens what he didn't
predict is that the Dolby showing
advertising and and a wire people said
oh it's not as bad as it was made out in
1984 because the TV screens are just one
way and what he describes here obviously
is there to weigh that back channel that
serves surveillance what he couldn't
have dreamt of is that we'll have all
these little devices that provide
two-way communication and in addition to
providing images and sounds also
precisely track the location of
everybody so he just thought about the
stationary screens he did not predict
the fact that we have mobile phones well
another thing that he didn't predict was
the role of the net the idea that in
fact we would live our life in the
physical world but also in a virtual
world but so much of what we would do we
would do online and what we do online is
tracked to an enormous extent a lot of
it by commercial organizations every
step you move around the web unless you
take very careful care to prevent it
there is advertisers have got their
little tracking pixels in there that are
clicking on you so that they can show
you ads but of course that same
technology can be used for lots of other
things as well
when we talk about this kind of thing
people often react by saying well it
doesn't matter to me I don't really have
anything to hide and even if I do have a
few things that I wouldn't write to
with you lot nobody important is really
interested in keeping a watch of me
anyway so why should I care but the way
I think about it is that this argument
is flawed because it focuses on the eye
on the mean where does this matter where
does this kind of surveillance matter it
matters for people who are the kind of
people that annoy and the bother those
are powerful
what are these people like well one
example is an investigative journalist
you're there you you work on your city
newspaper you discover that the mayor
and the chief of police are involved in
some serious corruption so you want to
try and investigate them but you know
the chief of police perhaps has access
to surveillance stuff somehow because
he's got a friend who works in a
national security group and I can find
out perhaps that this investigative
journalist hasn't a drinking problem or
the substance abuse problem doesn't
affect his work but it can be used to
discredit him or perhaps that his family
some you know a sister perhaps has some
serious problems that wouldn't want to
be made public that can be used for
pressure this is not just hypothetical
during the civil rights movement in the
US during the Montgomery bus boycott
there's a lot of financial support for
the act for the people that were
involved in this that came from the NA
cease n-double-a-cp
I was getting that acronym cloak
clobbered and one of the things that the
state of Alabama decided it wanted to do
was to get membership lists of everybody
who was a member of the n-double a-c-p
in order to pressure them in order to
stop the flow of funds to the people
that were fighting the the bus at the
facility problems with racial
segregation and now also of course
brings in that second class of people
who are gonna get clobbered by this
those that are activists who are trying
to promote social change even in America
now people aren't gonna stand up and say
all equal rights for African Americans
whose
think they may think it they're not
going to say it publicly but back in
those days it was okay to say it
publicly and there's a lot of motive not
of progress that still has to be made on
that problem in America and in many
other parts of the world but that
progress isn't going to be made at all
if activists are able to be shut down
because you can either attack the
activists or you can attack the people
who are providing funds and resources to
the activists and surveillance is a good
way of doing that but it's not only the
bothersome people what is also missing
from that sentence is it's very absolute
there's no element of time involved and
as an example that I know Tim brings up
in his talk and at the same time I know
not everybody was there so I quickly
repeated here during the course of this
year in Uganda in Africa the government
seriously tried to introduce legislation
that would make homosexuality criminal
and the law was phrased to a degree that
even if you only knew about somebody
else being homosexual and you are not
denouncing him you yourself would become
criminal so now think about cases
somebody says I have nothing to hide let
the world know that I'm that I'm
homosexual that's just something that is
part of my identity and then a law like
that passes but the Internet doesn't
forget that information is still there
so something that you felt you didn't
have to hide today may very well be
something that you may have to hide in
five years time so the point really here
is that even though we individually may
not be in that situation there are
people that are and those people in fact
are essential to the operation of a free
society if we don't have investigative
journalists rooting out corruption how
do we know whether to vote for Pete how
to vote to people you know the mayor may
look like a good guy unless of course
you find out that he's doing this bad
corruption how can you vote
intelligently how can we how can we take
on the advantages of activism but of
course so many changes in free societies
over the last hundred years we were all
back across that time women are treated
a second
citizens for racial minorities are
treated as second-class citizens
homosexuals are considered to be even
worse than second-class citizens all of
those changes occurred through
bothersome activists who caused trouble
who would be the kind of people that
will be shut down if with along with
this kind of surveillance so I think
we've talked quite a bit about the
problem we talked about the society and
the users for the next 15 minutes I want
to switch back to us the people who
actually create software and I assume
that almost everybody in this room is
actually involved in one way or another
with creating software the example I'm
going to talk about because it's obvious
and it will be more obvious for obvious
reasons later is email communication as
Martin said really really underpins a
lot of what is needed to maintain a free
society so how does it happen the
creators of software is there a
developer that says let's build an email
solution that's not how it starts what
it really starts with is usually people
are employed in organizations and
organizations are making money so maybe
there's somebody access we think we
found a way to make some money by
writing an email solution and then the
development team starts building one but
in most cases and especially if we talk
about the large organizations
corporations there's another level in
there they are the shareholders and I
could go on for another half hour end on
the problems with maximizing shareholder
value but in either case what we're
seeing here is that there's a very very
different motivator at the top there are
some people are saying make money for us
we don't really care make value create
value and that then trickles down in
building a solution
so it happened here on the right hand
side we have the creators of software
they produce software that the users
need and that impacts the world but the
needs of the users is Martinus outlined
mainly to have secure communications
encryption a one thing that's what the
users need if you ask all the users and
many of them are not aware are you
actually ok with all your emails being
really more like a postcard because
everybody who is involved with the
delivery of an email can actually read
all the contents or would you not rather
have something that is like a letter
that you would have to physically open
that you can't casually scan I guess
almost all users would say yeah I want
that why not
the problem is the creators of the
software they write software as a
commercial effort and they need to make
money so monetization model that we're
seeing today is that email is being
scammed the content is scanned to
produce advertising to give the users in
quotes free service but obviously
service isn't free because it means that
the needs of the organization that is
producing the software have now diverged
from the needs of the users so what
about the bothersome people what about
the people who are saying I don't care
about free email I'm willing to pay I
need secure email our developers saying
you know what somebody else is going to
do it it's ok I have no responsibility
I'm just doing what my company does
we're writing that kind of software
somebody else is going to do it the
technical people sorry the business
people have a bit more refined for
capillary they say something like this
is not our target group and then if you
look at the stakeholders they were we
start talking about free markets blah
blah blah Nisha's is cetera et cetera
but in the end for all of them are
saying in different words is it's not my
problem even if they accept the fact
that somebody needs that software they
say I have no responsibility in this I'm
doing something different so if we let
this stand and say ok you guys are fine
the free market somebody else will serve
the niche how do we get to secure email
it's actually quite hard to write an
entire email solution from
scratch so basically what you need is
collaboration most initially met lines
were proprietary software not so easy to
collaborate on I'm thinking about
Outlook mail app Eudora for the guys and
for the people in the audience remember
that and you could collaborate a little
bit by writing plugins and that is how
some people use encryption today on
their email for a while it looked really
positive we saw more and more
open-source software and this means
collaboration was getting easier
something like Thunderbird people could
really collaborate on writing an email
client for all the people who were in
the niche the both of some people
unfortunately what has happened recently
is a trend that really really reverses
all of this we see this big trend to
software as a service to solutions that
are running on servers that are operated
by somebody else webmail a lot of people
are not going to do a show of hand but I
know that a lot of people are actually
using webmail rather than applications
that run on their computers there are
there are a variety of reasons but I
really want to talk about the impact
that that has one problem obviously is
the data is no longer on your computer
the data is somewhere in the cloud
all these little data bases all these
different webmail providers they hold
the data now so if we talk about
surveillance from state agencies they
can just go to these entities get access
to your email without you being aware of
it and reading them the real problems
always that that picture is not really
totally accurate the real picture is
probably more like that there's not that
many companies that are actually
providing the majority of email to the
world's users the figures figures are
hard to get because everybody is
measuring something else so if you we
did some research internally we got
varying figures so what I'm going to
present now is one set of figures that
are somewhere on the average if you do
research you may come up with slightly
different figures just take it as a
ballpark do not take them absolute don't
quote me on saying it is to the point
that percentage but roughly speaking the
market share of the big five email for
as globally is somewhere around 42
percent so if you only impact five
companies you can read 42 percent of all
the world's email accounts it gets
actually much worse when you start to
look into countries and from Germany the
figures in Germany are like this if you
get to the top eight providers you get
eighty-eight percent close to 90 percent
of all email you can read by simply
having a deal the legal arrangement
whatever you want to call it with eight
companies in the US the figures that I
have say is even worse you only have to
talk to four companies to get close to
ninety percent of all the emails for
people in Western you are actually for
everybody outside the United States
there's another kicker in this because
you might think okay that's bad enough I
don't have the figures for Denmark but
let's say Jeremy okay I'm having I'm
using web mail I'm using provider in the
cloud software as a service likely
somebody will get access to it my state
the progress in all the other cases for
people who do not live in the US there's
a slight additional problem namely that
at the moment the US government is
claiming that they own or they get they
can request access to data from a US
company even if the data is owned by
somebody outside the US and is processed
entirely outside the United States I'm
not sure you can probably read that
right the Obama administration contends
that company with operations in the US
must comply with warrants for data even
if stored abroad of course the big
companies fight this tooth and nail and
Microsoft is going through all the
revisions in court
Google is watching this quite closely
IBM recently built a big data center in
Germany is saying if you host your data
here we will comply with German law so
this is really followed the article here
it's no date or third of September so
this is a story that is unfolding at the
moment but the current thinking the
current position of the United safe
government is if it is the US company no
matter who owns the data where is
thought we can demand access so you
don't only have your own car
and that can talk to the companies you
also get the US government that can look
at your data well I personally think
this will get sorted out I mean the US
legislators and government they know who
pays their campaign effort so you know
things will get happened but the
worrying thing is that they even thought
that this was a good idea in the first
place but even if you say okay I have
nothing to hide just look at me I think
that's just really the wrong way of
thinking about it I think through some
way that I don't exactly understand
we've come to the point where we almost
are trained to think privacy is a
special need the default is total
transparency and I put this Do Not
Disturb sign on as a kind of token but
in the end the default is everybody can
observe everything and I have to fight
to not or to have my privacy Tim had a
really really nice example in his talk
privacy is the default privacy is
something that is something that we have
achieved through civilization there's
something good and that should be the
default the surveillance is the opposite
the tracking should be something that is
out of the norm now let's assume for a
moment it actually were a special need
let's follow that train of thought you
still have the problem of the bothersome
people so if we all say I don't care I
have nothing to hide I can continue
writing my email in plain text and to
bother some people they will actually
write their email encrypted so they are
safe aren't they the problem is mass
surveillance works really well there's
Bayesian filters and all sorts of things
as part of the Snowden revelations has
become known that I think it was GCHQ
the UK spying agency is keeping all
emails that are encrypted indefinitely
other email is just kept for a while but
encrypted email even though they cannot
read it as an important point the basics
the fundamental encryption hasn't been
broken that's relatively safe but
keep it nonetheless because it's
suspicious anyway so this Eric guy sends
an encrypted email to Marcin let's keep
it maybe there's something in there
maybe in 10 years we have to compute
power to actually decrypt those emails
so what's happening is that merely by
using secure transport you're making
yourself suspicious so again you're out
of the norm there's something wrong with
having that level of privacy and the
people who are saying has nothing to
hide
actually make the problem worse because
they make the other people really stand
out and I want you to read another quote
that explains what other serious problem
is involved in that regard
so the point really is even if you are
not directly impacted you're saying I
have nothing to do with this the fact
that you know that there is surveillance
is actually impacting your behavior that
was also in the Oval quote already it
said something like that out of habit
you're actually changing your behavior
because you know you're being watched so
what we hope for is that we can go from
this picture to this picture not
everybody even has to hide or encrypt
all their emails but in that picture
there's probably two bothersome emails
people who are bothersome people that
really really need a special degree of
privacy I was also quite good to hear
timbre talk about the fact that privacy
is more a dial it's not binary it's not
either totally private odel privacy or
no privacy it's a bit of a dial but the
people who require a stronger level of
privacy they don't stand out anymore
because people this this slide deck we
emailed back and forth over encrypted
email it didn't really need protection
we're doing this publicly it's being
recorded on video and it's going to be
downloadable but the whole point was
we're just making it the default we're
making it the default that privacy is
there and thus make it less obvious who
targets are and it raises the cost of
surveillance if they've only got to
decrypt a small amount of email then
they can put the efforts on that and
they have their target but if lots and
lots of people are encrypting their
email then they've got to decrypt all of
it because they don't otherwise know and
as a result they're less able to
actually do the kinds of surveillance
that concerns us and that allows the
bothersome people to be more protected
and then there's the other problem as
well with all the algorithms that I've
talked about that can find the email the
problem of false positives so oftentimes
people are saying oh we need to scan all
the emails to find the terrorists if my
research is right there's about 5.6
million people who live in Denmark if
you have a test that is 99.9 percent
accurate it'll identify how many five
thousand people as terrorists I don't
think there are five thousand terrorists
it's probably the
smallest number of people of the 5,000
are actually really somebody that has
something to hide so the phobia is even
if you don't have something to hide you
might still be identified as a false
positive the vast majority of all
communication that will be identified as
dangerous or something that needs
further follow-up the vast majority are
going to be false positives I want to
show you one last slide on the I have
nothing to hide and it's basically it's
bit harder to explain I'm basically
trying to make a trajectory to
trajectories actually things that have
happened already and then I want us to
think about what happens if things
continue along those paths what happens
when those lines actually intersect the
first one is opaque pricey I guess many
of you are aware of the practice and
it's something that a lot of industries
are doing these days
I think almost everybody who is booking
travel for example flights or hotel
rooms does not necessarily expect that
the price is always going to be the same
if I booked a hotel room in the hotel
that I'm staying in here now in May it's
going to be a different price in June
and maybe I get a different price
because I'm a member of some program or
not then Martin who might be a member of
another program or maybe I get a
different price because I booked through
a website or not the hotel website so
the prices for goods are very opaque
it's not transparent anymore why I'm
getting a price and why the price can
vary so wildly it's actually quite good
for many companies and again you can
talk a lot about free markets blah blah
blah why that is a good thing I don't
want to discuss the value of that I just
want to establish that that is something
that is happening it is happening
everywhere the other one is a bit more
difficult to describe so I need a couple
of pictures for that I'm not I guess not
all of you know who Jeremy Hammond is
Jeremy Hammond is a hacker in the press
sense somebody who infiltrates computer
systems and gets information out what he
did among other things he had
this company Stratfor it's a private
intelligence company in the US and
Jeremy Hammond was caught and actually
sentenced to ten years in prison for
hacking those websites
it's another side story the important
thing he published via WikiLeaks a lot
of the emails he got from Stratfor and
that's the example I want to show you
today this organization most of you are
probably aware of petaa it's an animal
rights organization it's an organization
that really wants to ensure that animals
are treated with dignity it's not really
in any by any stretch of imagination I
would say a terrorist organization
something that is going to do something
really bad to society nonetheless there
were under surveillance and the
interesting thing is this email was a
request by coca-cola somewhat in the
context of the Olympics in Vancouver to
get some dirt some bad information about
PETA I let you read that respect
and even then you could say okay let's
fair play they're commercial entities
Peter is an NGO nonetheless their public
organization coca-cola is an
organization they have every right to
ask another private organization like
Stratford to do some research it's
nothing else than a private detective I
mean in a very very positive way of
looking at it but nonetheless you could
say there's nothing wrong with that
picture where I think it really veers
completely off Traxxas when we look at
the response and the actual email the
response email is not in there but it is
quoted at the bottom and you can see
that the same woman and who sent the
email includes this and this guy Frank
Burton he's actually Stratfor's vice
president for intelligence and what he's
saying is he says the FBI has a
classified investigation on petty
operatives I'd see what I can uncover so
the point here is that somebody who
works for a private intelligence company
like a detective in layman's terms
actually knows about a private
classified police investigation that he
knows about is quite bad already I think
but the fact that he's confident that he
can get further information about that
operation I think that is really the
scary part so what I think that
basically means is that what we will see
in the future and that's my second
trajectory will see seeping of protected
data into the commercial sector so a lot
of times when people say all of this
mass surveillance it's not so bad it's
only the state that is collecting the
data the state is acting responsibly
with legislation this is being monitored
and guarded I think that's actually
quite impossible to guarantee there's
lots of people who work in the
intelligence community the number of
people in the United States who have
top-secret access is staggering it's
like hundred thousands of people who
have that access and if they only one
percent of these people are crooks one
percent of these people have an axe to
grind
they can easily leak a lot of data into
the private sector so I think it is
pretty much given
the data that is being collected by
state agencies will find its way into
the private sector and I'll put that
together with opaque pricing and let's
actually throw something else in this
whole argument oh it's only metadata
let's assume they can't read the text of
the email they can only read the
metadata but let's assume a large
treasure trove of emails is seeping from
displaying agencies into the private
sector let's say to an insurance company
what the insurance company does is it
finds all emails that are where the
sender and the receiver have the same
last name the assumption being obviously
that they are in the same family and
many forms of cancer are hereditary so
that means if for example the subject
line of that email contains references
to a cancer treatment they can say in
that family there's probably a risk that
people will be diagnosed with cancer at
some part in their life and what then
happens is because of opaque pricing the
people don't actually even recognize
what's happening that the insurance
company is raising the premium they have
no information there's this totally
opaque they don't tell you that they
don't tell anybody that but what they
base you do is to say okay based on the
metadata only our filters and our
analytical Big Data models have
determined that family is at risk of
cancer so 5% on the premiums and nobody
can compare it
make sense you could ask okay that's
pretty depressing maybe I actually have
something to hide or maybe I really
don't like all that information to be
out there and you Martin Eric you're
talking about it are you doing anything
about it and we are trying we've started
a little less than a year ago with our
own contribution and that is called
pixelated it is an open-source email
solution we are working on it a couple
of weeks ago we have made the source
code that we have so far available on
github at this stage it is not in a form
that allows you to actually use it
productively every day but our hope is
through announcing this project finding
more collaborators and bringing that
forward and creating an open-source
email solution that can be used by many
people and that will one of the key
things of course include encrypting
email what we are not going to do is we
are not going to host this because as an
American thought works is ultimately a
u.s. American company as a u.s. American
company we are quite aware of the
implications of hosting this ourselves
so what we also pay particular attention
to our puppet scripts and other ways of
actually setting up the servers so that
many many more organizations can once
again install email servers in their own
organization and do not have to use a
webmail solution that puts them at risk
of surveillance so the encryption and
the decentralized operation are the two
key things that we're looking at with
this this is our contribution I'm not
saying that that will definitely work
out I am however quite hopeful this talk
is not about this product and it's not
ready to be used yet but I do want to
mention it because there's an
interesting thing in there and that
comes to our role again as software
engineers you may think ok great some
people are doing something about it but
I can't participate because I'm not an
expert on cryptography what we've
actually learned in the progress of
doing this is cryptography was actually
a smaller problem all the encryption
libraries actually
to varying degrees but in general worked
pretty well the actual underlying
encryption has not been broken so crypto
was not the hard problem for us it was
something that we needed to do a little
bit of research on but use it but what
is the hard problem is the user
experience to get that right and that is
something there is a company we actually
do quite well we are with home that
skill with many many client projects and
we actually understand his experience so
I'm trying to say here is if you think I
have nothing to contribute maybe think
again maybe you do have something to
contribute to those solutions because
the actual hard parts are not the parts
that really need a lot of work at the
moment there was also interesting or
important though for us was the choice
of license we all great fans of open
source software and sharing and the
majority and the default if you ask our
legal team is always use the Apache 2
license because it is actually pretty
safe as someone who gives out the
software but it is also enabling a lot
of people to use the software but we
have chosen for this project though is
the a GPL even the GNU Public License
which is more viral we didn't feel or
sufficient for our needs the GPL of
course means if you make a modification
to the source code then distribute the
software you also have to distribute the
new source code but we are building here
though is software that we expecting
organizations will use to host email
solutions problem is the organization
will make a change but they're never
distributing the software because they
are running it on their servers it's a
software as a service model obviously so
the a GPL is a license and again that is
something that we as practitioners as
the industry really need to be mindful
of the a GPL says if you are modifying
the software to provide a service to
third parties then you have to make the
source code the changes that you made
public this of course is a statement
that we want to make of course we know
if an organization really wants to
change the source code in such a way
that it is against the interest of the
users and remember that's what what
Martin really set up so well if somebody
wants to work against the interest of
the users they will not
stopped by our reference to the AGPL but
what we want to say quite clearly is
with that software we do want to see all
those changes in the open having spent
time talking about email solutions I
quickly want to come back to us to all
the developers in the room and to
summarize basically what the key
question is that is underlining or
underlying what we've been talking about
let's assume you have those two people
who are writing software and they have
done some market research and they have
found three ways that they could write
software and there's various amounts of
varying amounts of money to be made from
a lot of dollars on the left-hand side
to some dollars on the right-hand side
rightly so they may chase the big
dollars but what can happen is in the
process of doing so they uncover that
there's one of those dark patterns that
to actually achieve that business model
that would give them the maximum
financial gain they would have to
implement some dark patterns and this is
exactly the point where we believe it is
our responsibility as the creators of
software to be responsible for the
choice we make them it is very possible
to say I don't care let's just plow
through I implement the dark pattern I
get maximum money the alternative
obviously is to say no I'm not going to
do this
oops I'm not going to do this but that
of course means you will not reach the
solution with the highest game you will
end up somewhere there
and in the end Martin started with the
agile manifesto I'm not as good a
wordsmith but I tried my hand and I try
to summarize it with a statement that
works in the same way as the agile
manifesto and I'm saying being
responsible over maximizing game doesn't
mean that we shouldn't look at
maximizing game financially or whatever
for our companies or organizations but
when it comes to the crunch then we have
to ask the question do we need to
responsible first and then maximize the
financial game or do we maximize the
financial game and just don't care and
as a final thought so what is it that
you can do I hope some ideas have come
from this one level if you're interested
in taking part in open source projects
look for some of those projects that are
trying to do things that will increase
the degree of privacy on the net
exploited is one example I'm sure
there's plenty of other stuff going on
and remember it's not ricard core crypto
programming skills that the only ones
required a lot of it is very simple
things like user experience like
ensuring that there's documentation
plenty of stuff that is kind of regular
work that can be done to achieve that if
you want to contribute that way you also
contribute simply by using these tools
by saying self yep
but maybe I will use an encrypted email
approach and starting getting into the
habit of using encrypted email by doing
that increasing the amount the
proportion of email that's encrypted on
the net it makes it harder for mass
surveillance to take hold and of course
that's not just true of email it's true
of other things
Tim brainy's talk said try and make sure
all the websites are HTTPS to ensure
again the amount of encrypted traffic
goes up a good way as a result of that
and I know I'm guilty of that one as
well I've got to get round to doing that
with my site I'll tell my web
development team when I get home to do
that it's a bit weird when I talk to
myself but I'm weird anyway
and not just use it yourself but educate
the people around you your family your
friends get them at understanding what
these kinds of issues are about help
them perhaps to use encrypted email
themselves it is in the end a lot of
people get very depressed when we talk
about this kind of stuff and when we
look at this stuff it can easily get
pretty depressing I mean you think
yourself oh how can we resist this whole
flood of stuff that's going on but when
you look at history you can cheer up a
bit I mean there are a whole load of big
movements that looked kind of impossible
and you go back 100 plus years and the
way in which women were treated as
second-class citizens denied the vote
often denied the ability to hold
property over time and it took many
decades to pull it off but the vote has
been attained steps and steps and steps
are still a journey to go it's no way
that women are still equal even in the
Western world but substantial changes
over that time and it happened because a
lot of people made the effort to do so
it's not going to be easy it's not going
to be quick but the only guarantee
that's out there is it if we do nothing
then bad things will certainly happen
and just one last remark to this when it
comes to mass surveillance this is on us
as a profession on us technologists it
is actually quite bad that we
implemented email solutions that were so
naive I would say that transmitted
everything in plain text that we created
a protocol in the form of HTTP without
transport layer security that allows
everybody in this room to look what
everybody else is doing on the web we as
technologists have often taken the easy
way out we've just implemented the first
thing that works never mind
looking for security and shipped it and
then the use and then we blame the users
and we tell the users yeah you have to
install that plug-in and you have to do
this really complicated fingerprint
comparison if you want to send an
encrypted email and we then bore them at
length with the difference is about RSA
keys and DSA keys and the normal user
would just say I don't care about this
you fix the problem which is really
really need to make sure that we as a
profession when it comes to mass
surveillance are the ones who can make
the difference we need to make all these
countermeasures encrypted email
transport layer security we need to make
that so easy to use that normal users
don't need to do anything special to
just keep using the software and we make
it more secure we cannot ask the users
to jump through some hoops and with that
yep it is our responsibility our choice
