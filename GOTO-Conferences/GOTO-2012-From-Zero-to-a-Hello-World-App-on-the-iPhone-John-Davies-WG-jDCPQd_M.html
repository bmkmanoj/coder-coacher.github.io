iphones now yeah this is really small
isn't it so one of the things I did well
this is going to be fun right so one of
the things they did when after selling
the company I was obviously director of
iona and these two sent me all over the
place to do talk to clients and bits and
pieces like that and I used to
effectively sit on planes so I decided
I'd learn how to program the iphone
which was just out this is 2007 so I'm
going to see hello world and I learned
to program the iphone so i found a few
little companies people that I worked
with before restaurant guides the pub
guides very favorite of mine and
effectively created those programs and
it made enough money to employ people
which was sort of good so I'm just going
to burn this in here you see how crazy
it before so I'm going to replace that
I've got to kill the other never do
demos live now I can't see the screen so
there we go stop tasks create replace
okay right this has vastly improved over
the years that Apple have basically had
this out it's it's wonderfully simple
you can type hello world in virtually
any language but if you do it on the
iphone it's just that air of
satisfaction of having it on your little
gadget and of course it's it's just much
easier than you might imagine apart from
the fact you don't normally do it on a
vga screen so anyway hello world I put
it in we can decide where they wanted
portraits upside down side side raise
etc and obviously there's not enough
space to even see anything on here I can
put a little icon in I can't because I
can't even see my desktop to drag it in
and we'll just click I can't even find
the buttons now okay so we've got a
hello world application so what this
does there's a whole bunch of templates
Apple has got a sort of a rather amusing
I'm cheating here because I'm going to
because I knew I was short of time the
little cheat sheet here so the way it
works is there's a there's a graphical
tool and effectively there's the
programming partner the programming part
is obviously objective-c now if you've
never programmed objective-c you'll
learn it it's pretty quick it's it's so
Java esque its object oriented there's a
few nice features about it so a few
things will drive you mad but you know
part from that it's you'll learn it in a
few weeks and you'll be fairly efficient
you can read it very quickly now if
you're putting buttons and things on a
screen effectively buttons and have
listeners as you fairly obvious and
anything that needs to be updated on the
screen needs to have a pointer to it or
a reference to it that we can update it
so I'm going to put a little button on
the screen and some text and obviously
the button needs a listener and the the
label which we're going to write to
needs a pointer so I'm going to create
an outlet which is a uilabel and I'm
going to call that my label okay and
then I'm going to create now this is the
dot H file for those familiar with C
will be very obvious in Java world
because the compiler is not going
through all of the Java it's it needs a
dot H file to for its definition so
here's the action list now i'm going to
call do button that should do the trick
so my coat on at the ends good now i'm
going to go back into my storyboard this
is the bit where I can do all the design
don't we had a much larger screen there
should be somewhere here a little iphone
oh that is the iphone
the iphones got a better resolution than
vga they go i'll stick a label somewhere
down here this is going to be rather
weird anyway so here's the label here's
the button so we'll just say click me
and click the button that'll do now we
can change the fonts week and also some
nice clever things if you could see it
on the screen the advantage of a vga
screen is of course everything's nice
and chunky you can actually read it
disadvantages obvious now along here on
the side I look it's more of it I've got
these things called what they're called
actually there are little sort of
references which I can now drag them
across to my program so here's the label
so i'm going to say referencing outlet
to the label i drag it across to my view
controller which was the dot H that I
had and I've now got to the options here
so i click on my label and effectively
that references across here's my button
and I can also reference the button
because I might want to move the button
I'm out to change something on the
button I'm I want to change the color or
something like that I don't want to do
that here cuz we don't have much time I
have a whole bunch of different things
in buttons you can click on the button
so you get the press you get a press
when you dragged into it it's a bit like
sort of mouse over and all these other
things so the one we typically use up is
touch up inside which sounds rather
sexual but it's just the way my mind
works sorry and we we basically get onto
the the Empire so now if i copy my
template of my function and actually
create a method here i can now say my
label dot text equals we as an @ sign to
in front of the quotes to so that we
know its unicode rather than a ski hello
world that should do
what will happen now if I run it with a
little button now it's all sort of moved
around because unfortunately the as you
well know the iphone screen is very high
resolution and it exceeds this if we now
click on this hello world there we go
there's some really nice things I'm out
of how we do have a little bit more time
so what I've got in here get rid of my
skype chat before we get some really
embarrassing moments because I have some
colleagues that have rather bad language
and things so I've got some little bits
of pages here so I can cut and paste
some of these this is cheating i'm sure
you know so what I'm going to do I'm
going to cut and paste this and I'll
walk you through it just got a couple of
minutes go back into my right so I got
my do button there's some interesting
stuff here there's I have the ability to
really really quickly execute something
after a delay so I've got this as you
can hopefully see here let's perform
selector and it performs the do thank
you method that do thank you methods
thank you it sets the text to thank you
that runs after five seconds I should do
this in order already we have another
one which moves the label now the
animation is built into the iphone and
it's it's really nice the way it works
so we just look at the move label at the
bottom effectively we set up a new
center point and we set up what it's
going to do before the animation what it
does after the animation then
effectively we we kick it off and we
tell it how long we want the animation
to last this is how you do the page
turns and the sort of nice flip ups and
flip downs and things and then also we
can change the color of the background
for example and these will kick off one
after the other so again if i run this
now we have clicked me says hello world
moves changes the cutter and then says
thank you there we go
right well we swap over laptops and bits
and pieces so any questions on the
iPhone side of things yep one of the
front sorry there are lots of tests in
there I was free we started with the
test obviously which I would do normally
I spilled up all my tests hello world's
test button etc we wouldn't see much of
the hello world in 10 minutes but yes it
one of the buttons on there does say
create tests and it's actually quite
good any more questions you're going to
program my phones now you basically have
to pay a little tax to Apple about I
think it's ninety nine dollars you get a
year's license you then obviously get
all the Xcode stuff you can download it
you can program iPhones iPads Mac et
cetera there's loads of resources on the
internet it's very quick I've got three
sons 9 11 and 14 I've tried them with
logo I've tried them with Python I've
tried them with all sorts of different
languages we went out and we bought
raspberry PI's and all sorts of bits and
pieces but this is the first time where
they can actually program something
where they can still sit in front of the
TV and play with it so it's sort of
working nothing else no questions at all
ok thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
