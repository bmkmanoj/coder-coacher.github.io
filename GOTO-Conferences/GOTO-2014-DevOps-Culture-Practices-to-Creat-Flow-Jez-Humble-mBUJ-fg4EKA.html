her chef's Kanpur month ago and I
actually created it for go to Audrey's
last year because Jean Kim was going to
give this talk and he created the title
and the abstract and then about a month
before he's gonna give the talk he he
didn't have time to work on anymore so
he made me write it and give it so this
is actually jeans talk but one that I
designed and I'm gonna give you and it's
really about going back to the roots of
lean which is the Toyota Production
system and looking at how that can
inform the adoption of DevOps because
really DevOps goes back to this whole
kind of lean lean thinking and so we
start with the whip history and then go
into how you can actually apply this in
real life and the focus as you might
expect is on culture and practices not
on the things that people actually tend
to focus on which is tools and kind of
tactical stuff because that's the wrong
thing to focus on and this is the right
stuff to focus on so the social
production system comes originally from
the production line of building cars and
this is a picture of a Toyota factory in
the UK and here you go that here's the
cars rolling down the production line
and the toy production system talks
about how we can make this process more
efficient more responsive to user needs
and we get things like you know pull
based systems managing working process
Kanban all these concepts that are
applied software development originally
come from the production line however
there's a problem with this I mean that
this is actually manufacturing real
things in real life in the context of
building software based products and
services where's the production line
right we have a metaphor that we can
somehow apply this thing and the
principles that govern how to make this
efficient to this completely different
thing and actually it's important to
bear in mind that this is a metaphor
there is no actual production line here
there are no cars going through this
office unless something very bad is
happening normally that's a sign that
there's something wrong with your
development process if people are
literally driving cars through it so how
do you actually apply those principles
and that kind of philosophy to this
completely different thing and people
have tried to unpack that in a bunch of
different ways so there's a great book
by Charles Betts called architecture and
patents variety where he says well you
know actually the way people often think
about it is the factory building the
factory in designing the factory in the
production lines is like our product
portfolio life cycle and then what what
the cars are if you like the individual
manufactured products that come out of
our service portfolio and that's one way
of kind of taking that building cars
metaphor and applying it IT another way
to think about it is that actually the
factory is the life cycle of one
individual service that gradually
evolves over time and then the
individual transactions when I you know
buy something or request a service those
are they're like the cars coming off the
production line the individual service
request is like that the asking for a
car to be built and that coming off the
production line and so you can certainly
think about it in these ways and there's
fruitful things you can get out of these
metaphors for you know the product
portfolio or the IT service portfolio
and there's a great book by a guy called
Don Rhine at CERN called the principles
of product development flow which you
know takes this metaphor of you know
lean as product development and derives
a great amount of very very interesting
stuff from that this is a really great
book for people who are geeks about
process and product development and
managing product development and and it
draws on a lot of lean ideas although as
Don points out when he was writing about
this stuff 20 years ago no one would
really the term lean had not even been
invented at that point so he he kind of
predates that one application of that
metaphor that we see a lot in software
development particular is the idea of
the Kanban board or the storyboard and
here these individual things which are
pieces of work like stories or bug fixes
or whatever those are like the cars
moving
the production line and what we do is we
think about how to improve the
efficiency of the delivery process by
you know creating a pool system here by
looking at how long it takes individual
stories to move across the board
but it's not a perfect metaphor a lot of
the stuff that goes into the Toyota
Production system about improving
efficiency is based on knowing what
people are doing and seeing what they're
doing and actually looking and seeing
what they're doing and seeing how people
actually looking at how they can improve
their own process there's its concept of
going to gamba in lean which is actually
visiting the factory floor and timing
people doing things and talking together
about how that process could be improved
it's very difficult to do that in this
environment you can't just you know talk
about well we're going to time how long
it takes to build a test for this story
and go and sit by the key ways and be
like let's not stopwatch how long does
it take you to build the acceptance test
I no one does that because that would be
a bit creepy and people wouldn't like it
and the variability is really high and
it's very different for every person so
even the concept of standardization in
this context is really really hard and a
lot of the ideas that go into the Toyota
Production system don't obviously apply
when we think of you know the concept of
cars moving on the production line being
like stories on a story wall so it's
important to bear in mind we've got a
lot from this idea of Kanban as managing
stories or managing tasks bugs whatever
but it is just a metaphor and it's by no
means a perfect metaphor
so what other metaphors could there be
for the production line in software
development well in 2006 me and a North
who is presenting today I think just
pretend to the session before me and
Chris Reid who's also here today we
wrote a paper hi Chris here's Chris so
Chris and me and Dan wrote this paper in
2006 for the agile conference in where
was it you remember Minneapolis I think
when he effortless and
and decided he was going to call this
the deployment production line basically
because of this metaphor and it only
occurred to me much later that actually
that's that allows you to apply a lot of
lean principles to what we're thinking
of but the key concept in this was that
actually what what we're looking at is
the basic unit of work being a change in
version control and a change in version
control creates a build and the build
progresses through the deployment line
to production and when it hits
production it delivers value to people
and and and so that's a very different
metaphor from all the other ones the
idea rebuild is very concrete and it
turns out you can get lots of
interesting stuff out of this metaphor
of production line as process for
deploying changes and the individual
unit have changed being version control
change leading to a build so what work
can we get out of that in order to
understand what this gives us that's
different from the other metaphors we
had to go back to the roots of Toyota so
who knows what Toyota was building
before they were building cars textile
stuff yeah pretty much
so Toyota wasn't originally called
Toyota the family who created Toyota is
actually called the Toyota family and
their breakthrough products was the
Toyota automatic loom type G and this is
a picture of it so this I think was in
the 20s I can't exactly remember but
around that so you know nearly a century
ago now and the key breakthrough in this
particular product was that it could
detect when there was a problem so if it
ran out of threads or if the loom kind
of got caught up or something like that
if there was any problem in the process
of producing the fabric the Lu would
automatically stop and notify the
operator that it had a problem and this
created a huge improvement in
productivity first of all it became
impossible to produce defective products
because the moment anything happened
which would result in a defective
product the machine would stop secondly
up to the point in which this machine
was created anytime there was a problem
the operator would have to be watching
the loom sitting at the loom watching it
to manually validate that what was being
produced was actually good and a notice
immediately that there was a problem and
stop it there and then so you had to
have a person for every loom manually
inspecting the output running tests if
you like manually to make sure that the
product was actually good and when you
have a system that detects problems
itself and stops itself you only need
one person per room of looms you can
have one person whose job it is to
monitor all the looms because they don't
have to do anything they just have to
wait for the Loom to detect a problem
and then they intervene themselves now
this is a game changer in terms of
productivity for manufacturing textiles
but it turns out that this idea is
central not only to Toyota manufacturing
of cars but also to software development
and it's so important that of course
there's a Japanese term for it and
anytime there's kind of an important
lean concept you have to know the
Japanese term that's very important well
I think that the history of this term is
kind of interesting if you go and read
Toyota sorry Ono's book on Tai Chi
owner's book on workplace management he
kind of talks about the history of this
term that they came up with so this is
the Japanese word for automation it's
actually Chinese characters and then
this is the Chinese character for a
person and so what they did is they said
well we've got automation automation is
you know the automatic loom but we need
people in order to be able to intervene
when something goes wrong and if we take
those two concepts and put them together
we come up with this term and what's
happened kind of in in in the language
is that this character turns into a
radical which is added here which is how
this word is different from this word
we've got this could have an extra
radical here representing the addition
of people to the process and that gives
us automaton emotion which is sometimes
translated as automation with a human
element and the idea is that we leverage
machines and people for their things
that they're particularly good at
machines are good for performing
repetitive tasks humans are good for
solving problems
and the way we produce the high quality
products is that we use the machines to
do the boring automated work repeatedly
and we use the humans to solve the
problems and we create systems in which
those two elements can do what they're
best at and by combining them that's how
we build quality in to whatever it is
we're producing and so this is central
to the Toyota Production system this
concept of judoka and in particular the
idea of the automatically detecting
problems and notifying users lives on in
the concepts of the hand on cords and
the display ball that tells you when
something's wrong so who's heard of the
hand on cords so in a Toyota factory
there's a call that you can pull which
lets people know that you've got a
problem so basically if you're on the
production line and these marks on the
ground basically are the time in seconds
that it's taking for this car to move
past this person's workspace and if this
person hasn't completed the task that's
supposed to complete by the time it gets
to here then what they'll do is they'll
pull the and on cord and that will
summon a manager to come and help them
and if they can't get the problem fixed
together then they can pull the undone
cord again and it will actually stop the
production line now these two concepts
are really revolutionary about 20 years
ago
GM created a joint venture with Toyota
and it was the first time Toyota had
been in a joint venture with another
company and they created a plant called
Noomi in Fremont in California and the
nume plants was had just been shut down
by GM because it had the worst workforce
the union admitted that it was the work
worst work force and it had the worst
management and produced the worst
quality products and so they shut down
the plant and they said well we'll use
this for our first joint venture and
then Toyota did something kind of
radical they actually rehired all those
people and sent them to Japan to train
them to create the new me plan which is
the joint venture so they said we're
going to hire all these people who were
the worst workforce in GM in the USA and
we're going to use these people as the
basis for our new factory kind of a nuts
thing to do
you know this workforce was known for
doing things like they were so pissed
off with their jobs they would do things
like pretty empty coke bottles inside
the doors so that the doors would rattle
when you shuttin that open them
that's how miserable and discontented
they were with their jobs so they're
entered a pan and got the kind of toyota
training and they came back and when I
think a few months of starting up the
new me plant the new me plant was the
most productive workforce in all of the
USA in GM's portfolio and they also
produced products in terms of cars which
were as high quality as the cars that
were produced in the Toyota plant in
Japan and there were several things
which I think so if you there's a
podcast on this and this American Life
podcast on the new me plan which I
highly recommend everyone listens to I
mean this American life is great anyway
but the new me podcast is really really
brilliant and two of the things that the
people they interview the people who
actually were working in the GM plant
and went and got the training two things
that were different firstly you know the
idea that if something goes wrong you
can pull a cord and a manager will come
and that manager will then help you that
was kind of a revolutionary concept
rather than the manager coming and
shouting at you and then trying to fire
you that the manager would actually help
you Wow and then the other revolutionary
concept is the idea that a worker has
the power to stop the line so in GM
factories traditionally what would
happen is no one the line would never be
stopped right what would happen is the
cars would come off the production line
many of them would have defects they'd
put them into a lot and fix them later
and there was a huge lot full of cars
piling up that had defects of various
kinds and then with its hoist production
system anytime you find the defects if
you can't fix it in time you pull the
cord the production line stops so that
was a revolutionary concept so one thing
people don't get is how often the and
long cord is pulled so how many times do
you think the analog all gets pulled in
the Toyota factory any guesses
once a month hire hundred times again a
day hire thousand times again day hire
so it's actually about three thousand
times a day that the end encore gets
pulled so their production line doesn't
stop every time the unknown call gets
pulled by the Berlin Wall gets pulled
three thousand times a day on average
it's a lot more often than people think
and that demonstrates the level of
collaboration within the organization
between the people and doing the work
and the management it's a very
collaborative environment so this idea
of actually stopping the line of having
a system to detect quality problems at
the moment they occur rather than
waiting them for them to get out
so users has an analogue in software
development and the analog is continuous
integration so who in the audience is
practicing continuous integration on
their team okay keep your hands up keep
your hands up keep your hands up this is
your exercise for this session keep your
hands up all right so put your hands
down unless all the engineers on your
team are checking into trunk about once
a day or more often than that
so if that's not true if developers are
trekking into feature branches that
don't get then merged into trunk months
a day or if they're checking not
checking in that off and put your hands
down otherwise you can keep them up okay
so we've lost about two-thirds of the
people so if every check-in doesn't
result in building unit tests being run
put your hands down otherwise keep them
up okay so we lost a couple and then
when the build breaks if it then doesn't
get fixed within about ten minutes
put your hands down if the build is
often broken for more than ten minutes
put your hands down otherwise keep them
up okay so there's about ten people in
the room who are actually doing this
integration so round of applause for you
guys that's awesome continuous
integration is really hard it's not
running Jenkins against your features
branches and then ignoring the build
when it goes red it's the practice of
making sure your software is always
working
the moment you find a problem you fix it
straight away if the bill goes red and
everyone ignores it it's like you know
them the Loom detects a problem and
stops and the operator goes there
 you out a load board textile
it's got breakages in it you know all
like letting the car go on down the
production line and we'll put it in a
lot and then we'll fix it later you know
that's what you're saying basically is
that you know well never mind there's a
problem but whatever I'm going to carry
on writing code because that's what I
like doing so the practice of continuous
integration is best described in my
opinion in a paper by James Shaw which
talks about integration on dollar-a-day
and this is the process I'm writing some
code I finished what I'm doing I run the
build and test locally to make sure they
work and they passed yay so at that
point I'm going to merge front trunk to
make sure that my work harmonizes and
merges correctly with the work that
other people are doing on my team so I'm
going to pull the front trunk into my
local where I can copy and then merge
and run the build and test again to make
sure that that works that's how doing
this twice is how we distinguish my bug
from a bug caused by the merge at that
point I want to push into trunk on
version control because I want to share
my work with other people version
control is primarily a sharing mechanism
it's a communication tool before I do
that I'm going to walk over to this old
workstation in the in the corner of the
room and I'm going to see if the rubber
chickens there is not there I mean
someone else is checking in I have to
wait for the rubber chicken when it
becomes available I take the rubber
chicken walk back to my computer I check
in push into trunk and then walk back to
the old workstation and then I check out
from trunk run the build and tests on
the other machine to prove that the
thing actually works on a machine that's
not my machine
not just my machine yay if that's true
and it works
I put the rubbish chicken down bring the
bell ding hooray I'm done not done done
but done in the sense of works on the
machine that's not just mine if it
doesn't work I don't get to ring the
bell builds roads I've got two options
option one try and fix the problem I've
got a couple of minutes to try and find
the file that I forgot to check in or
whatever what's my option to rollback
absolutely correct the most selfish
thing you can do as a developer is to
leave broken codes on a broken build on
trunk because that means everyone else
is working off something that's not
known to be good so yeah if you find a
problem and you can't fix it straight
away pull your change out of version
control
that's very very important and an
underused practice so yeah in order to
be able to do this we need to make sure
everyone's checking into trunk at least
once a day and that we actually pay
attention when that thing goes red so
the problem is the rubber chicken does
not scale so what does scale
well once again despite giving this talk
last night I've forgotten to add the
right slide into my slide deck which was
a clear failure of judoka there so see
if I can get it here
this should be quicker than last night
because I actually know where it is now
yeah so hey this is what this is what
they do at Google and I find these stats
pretty staggering so 10,000 developers
in more than 40 offices more than 2000
projects under development
pretty much everything except chrome and
Android is checked into one enormous
perforce repository and everything is
built off trunk and all the developers
check in to trunk they get about 20 plus
code changes into trunk per minute and
at peaks at 60 about 50% of code change
every month everything is developed and
released from trunk all bills go from
source and they run about over a hundred
million test cases per day here's
another slide I stole from Google they
have about 200 thousand test Suites in
their codebase they run ten million test
Suites per day more than 60 million
individual test cases per day and
growing more than four thousand ci
builds a day so this is the equivalent
of the loom that detects the problems
straight away after you check them in
this is what Google does that's the
equivalent of the thing that was
invented by Sakichi Toyoda
in the 1920s for building textiles but
in 2014 for building software scale same
thing basically and it relies on having
extremely good test automation that's
very comprehensive and we can run it
very very quickly and get feedback
straight away and crucially once we get
that feedback we actually do something
about it and fix the problem rather than
just laying the build stay read and one
of the things that is a practice at
Google is that if something goes into
trunk and it's broken anybody else can
revert that change so if you break
someone downstream of you that person
can revert your change and that's okay
so that concept of collective code
ownership that everyone owns the codes
and that anyone can revert someone
else's bad change from trunk that's just
part of the culture and that's very very
important
however just having those basic tests
this part of your CI process is not
enough and the kind of the Google's
scale stuff for shadows that so just
having a basic CI build you want that
build to run in a few minutes because
you want to get the feedback fast but
that feedback is not going to be
comprehensive which is why you need a
bunch of other tests acceptance tests
and then further things like user
acceptance testing performance testing I
mean this is a very simple diagram but
your process would be more complex than
that there's a number of different
validations you have tried before you
can get stuff to production and so the
question is how do we build this where
do we start how do we evolve it and in
order to answer those questions I'm
going to give you a case study from a
company that did this at scale and that
company is Hewlett Packard and the team
that did it is the team that built the
firmware for Hewlett Packard's laser
jets so the HP LaserJet firmware team is
about 400 people 400 people distributed
across three continents there's a team
in porto alegre in brazil there's a team
in Boise Idaho and there's another team
I think in either Delhi or Bangalore in
India and so sorry dilly or Bengaluru in
India and so 400 people distribution
across three time zones and they had a
problem their problem was that they were
going too slowly they were not able to
keep up with even the new versions of
the of the hardware that were coming out
let alone building new features for new
products they were on the software's on
the critical path and this is a common
reason that we see people adopting
continuous delivery is when software is
on the critical path that's when people
start saying we need to get better at
doing this and so the first thing they
did well actually it's not the first
thing they did before they actually
tried to engineer their way after the
problem they tried hiring people firing
people outsourcing people all the usual
things that big companies do and when
none of that work then the marketing and
product people came to the engineers and
say please help us fix this problem
using engineering which is how you know
things are really bad when people are
asking the engineers for help and so the
first thing they looked at is what are
they actually spending their time doing
and so they found that out
basically using a pretty lightweight
informal system of just asking people
what they were spending their time doing
and this is what they found
so to understand why this is true you
have to understand that every time a new
line of devices came out they would
create a branch in version control for
that new line of devices so they had a
number of different branches every time
they add a feature or make a bug-fix
they have to port that bug fix or
feature across all these different
branches so they were spending 10% of
their time doing code integration 20% of
their time doing detail planning 25% of
their time porting code between branches
25% of their time on product support
what does that tell you that large
number on product support what does that
tell e quality problem right 50 was
saying there's high on manual testing
you subtract this from 100% and what
you're left with is 5% which they
claimed was time spent innovating rather
than what I would have been doing which
would been lying down on the floor with
a large bottle of vodka they claimed
they were innovating so this is pretty
bad and what do they decide to do well
they decided to do what it's actually
the riskiest thing you could possibly do
and who enter kamil thorniest talked
before mine yeah so they did a big
rewrite which is a nuts thing to do that
I don't recommend but they succeed is
for reasons which we'll explore a bit
later on and the key architectural
decision they made was they architected
the system for testability and they
architected the system to be able to do
continuous integration so they
subordinated their architectural
concerns to building quality into the
product and what that meant was making
sure that the software was everything
was built of trunk and they had
automated tests in place for everything
so that meant a complete rewrite because
they had to change the way that they
would manage the diversity of the
product portfolio that the firmware was
deployed to so basically what happens is
they put feature toggles in place so
device boots firmware boots wakes up
what am i oh I'm a printer so I'm going
to switch off these scanning features
and switched off these network features
and just have my printing features or
Hardware beats firmware boots what am i
oh I'm a scanner so I'm going to turn
off the
so basically they manage the kind of
heterogeneity of the hardware using
feature toggles so they could build one
binary for every device off of trunk and
everyone could work off trunk and what
that allowed them to do is practice
continuous integration they started
practicing at ease integration and
started building test automation and
pretty soon they found that the build
was read all the time and so the guy who
was VP of engineering he kind of follows
that HP managed from practice HP
management practice is called management
by walking around and it's basically
going and walking around and asking
people awkward questions which is
actually it turns out very close to the
kind of Toyota Production system go to
gamba go and see what people are
actually doing that was his management
style he would start saying how can we
stop people checking bugs into trunk and
people would be like well obviously we
would not do that if we knew and you
know brush him off and think that he was
an idiot and eventually someone came up
with what was actually a pretty smart
idea so after two years worth of work
they evolved from their basic CI set up
a very powerful deployment pipeline
which I'm going to show you emphasizing
that this is after two years worth of
works this is not something they came to
you straight away but basically all of
their developers had their own
individual queue on git they would push
their individual changes into their key
one gate that would trigger a build and
two hours worth of tests running against
just that individual change if that
passes all the changes got backed up and
promoted to stage two and that merges
all the changes that got through stage
one and runs build and about two hours
worth of tests against just that batch
if that fails if there's a merge
conflict or a test failure developers
get an email they configure the
workstations so that developers can
press a button and reproduce the test
failure on their workstations by using
virtualization and an emulator that
emulates the hardware platform when
you've got a build that goes through
here that gets from rated to level two
which is run two hours of tests that are
run on an emulator they built their own
emulator for the custom Asics which were
their kind of very complex logic devices
that power printers and multifunction
devices so writing their own emulator is
a pretty sophisticated bit of work and
then if the bill passes level two then
it goes to level three which is run on a
bunch
logic boards that are actually in Iraq
so the logic boards powerup download the
latest version the firma that's past
level 2 and then they run automated
tests by like sending signals to the
logic boards so this is pretty
sophisticated stuff I actually carry
round a copy of this book I don't have
it today but I normally carry it around
to clients so that anyone who complains
that test automation is too hard I can
spank them with this book because if you
can build test automation for firmware
on logic boards nobody has a problem
that hard so that you know this is a
solvable problem it's just are you going
to put a sufficient work into fixing it
so this is pretty sophisticated thing
and it took them a long time to build if
you go through here you go to level 4
which is overnight 24 hours worth of you
know in fact 30,000 hours worth of
automated tests that are massively
paralyzed and you get feedback within a
day on the quality of your software so
this completely changes the economics of
the software development process and
this is something it took them a long
time to get to and it required a lot of
investment but here are the results
after three years they're spending much
less time on continuous integrate or on
integration because they're doing it
continuously they're able to massively
reduce the amount of time that they
spend on planning and I haven't got time
to discuss why that is but basically by
having a more predictable Chakra
development process they built up trust
with the product side of things and so
the product people require much less
detail in terms of their planning so
they said we're gonna let you change
your mind at any time and in return
we're going to create much less detailed
plans and they built that trust and that
helped them reduce the amount of time
they're spending on detailed planning
they're not porting code between
branches anymore they're working on one
main branch product support goes down
from 25 percent to 10 percent what does
that tell you improving quality yeah
high quality much less time spent on
product support testing goes down and
they increase the amount of time they
were spent innovating by a factor of
eight now the smart people in the
audience will notice that these do not
add up to 100% and the reason for that
is because they were spending 23 percent
of their time on managing the automated
tests
building them triaging them getting
feedback on them so there was a
substantial investment involved in
creating this massive increase in
productivity yes sorry yeah so CP is
just their process for triaging bugs
you're welcome
and so this changes the economics of the
software development process and the
reason I love this case study is because
they measured these numbers and then
they wrote a book and you can go and buy
this it's a fabulous book and this is a
slide you I just you know you can get
you can download the slides anytime
someone asks you what the value
proposition is of continuous delivery or
the return on investment you can just
give them this slide so I only have 50
minutes left what I really want to focus
on is how they got from A to B they did
not plan this very complex deployment
pipeline that they built that was not
something they knew they were going to
create all that was part of their
planning evolved over time as did their
whole architecture as did their whole
approach to building the system and what
drove it I mean this is kind of
extraordinary what drove it is they
independently invented the continuous
delivery they were doing this before the
book came out they also independently
invented something called the
improvement cutter so this guy Mike
ruther is a really brilliant researcher
he's a researcher at the University of
where's what what state is Ann Arbor in
Michigan so he's at University of
Michigan he's a professor he wrote a
book called learning to see which is
about Valley Stream mapping he's
researched Toyota for many years he
wrote recently two years ago this Shingo
award-winning book which is fabulous
highly recommend it and part of his job
was to help us manufacturers try and
reproduce what Toyota was able to do in
their factories so he would go and see
what Toyota was doing and then you know
US manufacturers would employ him to try
and teach them how to reproduce Toyota's
results and he would say well they're
doing these things maybe you should try
doing these things I mean it was more
sophisticated than that but there was an
element of that
and then he would go back to the toy
factories a couple of years later and
see what they were doing and noticed
they weren't doing those things anymore
so that was kind of embarrassing because
it told these companies to go and do
these things and they weren't doing them
anymore and then he'd say well now
they're doing these things maybe you
should try that and then go back and
then two years later they weren't doing
those things anymore either and so it
turns out you know this is actually a
very important element of complexity
theory this idea that we can take a
practice from one complex system and
Transplant it into a different complex
system and expect the same results to
take place is false the whole point of
complex systems is that if you take the
same series of things and Transplant
them you will get different results this
is why methodologies do not work
methodologies are basically post hoc
rationalizations of something that
happened to work in a particular complex
system at a particular time and if you
take that and put it in another complex
system you won't achieve the same
results and so what you see if you look
in high-performing organization and you
look at the practices that they're doing
to see if you can copy them and improve
your performance what you're seeing is
not best practices what you're seeing is
countermeasures to the particular
problems that that organization is
encountering right now and if you try
and copy countermeasures to a different
environment they will not produce the
same result what you need to do is learn
how to effectively put countermeasures
in place and evolve those
countermeasures and that is basically
what Toyota knows how to do better than
anyone else and this is formalized in
what might rather cause the improvement
cutter and the improvement cutter is how
you learn how to be able to put those
countermeasures in place and this term
Catto is kind of important has then
who's seen into the dragon
okay so enter the dragon Bruce Lee movie
Bruce Lee movie I'm sorry Bruce Lee is
flying into the evil guys Islands got an
island of course still waiting for my
island anyway evil guy has an island and
all the evil guys henchmen all
practicing their judo moves on the
islands I can't do judo so this is going
to look ridiculous but they're basically
you know doing the same
over and over again ha and that's what a
cat is katha is taking a basic move and
practicing it over and over again it's
like doing your scales if you're
learning music or any kind of basic
repeated thing there is a unit of
whatever the larger practice is that
you're doing and so the idea is you got
to learn the basics first and then you
put them together and improvise and
combine them and you know create things
and so well as insight was that people
who are doing the work are always
practicing how to improve the quality of
their work that's a habit so learning
how to run experiments to try new things
to improve and put countermeasures in
place and see if they work is a habit
that everyone at Toyota is doing every
day and the job of Management is to
create the environment in which people
can practice this habit of trying out
new things and improving and he
basically in this book and I'm trying to
summarize this book in ten minutes which
is pretty difficult and I really
recommend you go and read it this is
basically the cycle of how this works
first of all we understand the direction
so we look at where we want to go in
like a couple of years so for HP
LaserJet firmware their vision was they
wanted a ten times increase in
productivity that was their vision
measurable it's a goal it's gonna be
hard to achieve we don't know how we're
going to do it that's the direction then
we grasp the current condition how are
things right now and grasping the
current condition is here this is the
current condition right and then the
next thing you look at is what's the
next target condition and this is a
horizon of about two to six weeks out so
we look at where we want to be in two to
six weeks and then we do not plan how
we're going to get there because we
don't know how we're going to get there
because we're doing innovation process
improvement innovation and anytime we
innovate you can't plan exactly how
you're going to do it because then it's
not innovation and this is really
crucial the people doing the work have
to try and work out how they're going to
achieve the target condition through a
process of experimentation PDCA is
plan-do-check-act it's the Deming cycle
is basically the scientific method
design experiment run Nix
and gather the results work out whether
that thing is something you should carry
on doing or whether you should stop
doing it and this cycle is at the heart
of the Lean Startup and it's at the
heart of process improvement and it's at
the heart of product development and
then based on this you're going to
there's a feedback loop to the next set
of conditions that you're going to try
and establish the next month and also
it's your overall vision so that
feedback loop is really important you're
not necessarily going to achieve all
those target conditions and so and in
the course of trying to achieve them
you're going to discover a bunch of
stuff that's going to make you reset
what your next target conditions are so
this all kind of sounds a bit abstract
so I'm going to give you an example of a
set of target conditions than the HP
LaserJet firmware people put into place
so they called these things they called
their iterations mini milestones and
they had them every month and this is a
table of their mini milestone objectives
for mini milestone 30s there's like two
and a half years in so rank zero they
wanted priority one issues open less
than a week and level two test failures
fixed within 24 hours and level one they
had a quarterly bit release they were
the priority one changes trade requests
fixed they wanted the reliability error
rate at whatever the release criteria
was and you can see they've got a whole
bunch of measurable target outcomes they
want to achieve by a month from now and
this was pretty much the entire planning
for the whole of the next month for the
whole program of 400 people fits on a
single page these are the measurable
outcomes we want to achieve in the next
month for the whole program and we don't
know how we're going to do this the way
we're going to find out is by people
trying a bunch of stuff to work out how
we're going to get there and then based
on the results we're going to you know
for mini milestone 31 there's going to
be a new set and it might include some
of the same things or it might be some
different things and we're always
changing what we measure and what we
care about based on the outcomes of what
people tried last time so for example
you know people always want to know what
things to measure and there's lots of
things you could measure I'll give you a
great example we once did a project
where we wanted 80% test coverage from
the people right
unit tests and we got 80% test coverage
which was great
almost scarily quickly and then we
looked at the tests and we found that
all the tests contained at the end
assert true so they were calling all the
methods in the codebase and they were
asserting true which created 100% test
coverage and some totally useless tests
and this is you know a very common thing
you put a target in place people will
always find a way to achieve the target
but it may not be the way that you
expect and so actually working out
whether the target produces the right
behavior and modifying the targets and
the things you measure as part of that
process is very very very important the
crucial thing is the people who actually
work out what to do
are the people doing the work the people
actually get to come up the ideas for
how to achieve those outcomes are the
people doing the work they're their
ideas the ideas are not set by
management you're going to try these
things go off and do it the people who
are doing the work come up with their
own ideas and that's so important
because it means that you're you know
it's much more exciting to push through
an idea that you came up with than it is
to push through an idea that someone in
management came up with it's just not as
exciting to implement someone else's
idea and by trying your own ideas and
finding out what works and what doesn't
you learn how to get better of what you
do and that is crucial to any cultural
change within an organization is the
people doing the work you've got to work
out how to get better at what they do
themselves and the process has to
encourage people to work out how to get
better themselves and that's how you
create a learning organization every day
in this model people are asking what are
we trying to achieve right now what's
the actual condition we're facing what's
preventing us from reaching it which one
of those things are we going to address
right now what experiments are we going
to run to try and fix that problem and
where can we go and see what we learn
from that that's how they ended up with
this very powerful deployment pipeline
by basically a bunch of things that they
tried
to see if they works and gradually it
assumed this shape so they didn't
implement deploy continuous delivery by
reading the book they implemented
continuous delivery by trying out a
bunch of stuff and they kind of
independently came up with it because it
turned out to be a good idea so can a
couple of concluding thoughts me and
Jean Kim and puppet labs recently ran a
survey last year of the DevOps survey so
some of you might have filled in the
DevOps survey that we put out end of
last year one of the questions we asked
is to what extent your organization is a
high trust culture and there's a really
nice model for working out whether your
culture culture is a high trust culture
by a guy called westrom so westrom was a
guy he was inventing investigating
safety in healthcare and he came up with
this typology of organizational cultures
for looking at safety in healthcare but
it actually turns out the this typology
is kind of useful to think about any
organization and what we found out in
the survey is that this is very highly
correlated with business outcomes so you
can actually predict business outcomes
to some extent by where people fall on
this model how do you get from A to B
how do you get if you're pathological or
bureaucratic how do you get so
generative well it's very very hard I
don't have a silver bullet but an
important part of that is giving the
people doing the work the power to
change their process and modify their
process and try new things and then not
punishing them when those things go
wrong this whole idea that failure
causes inquiry not failure is covered up
and new ideas of welcomes not new ideas
are crushed that's a really important
part of creating a high trust culture
which is how you create a culture of
continuous improvement which is how you
innovate so in terms of leadership
really all these problems start and end
with leadership and there's a division
of labor the leaders decide the outcomes
with a short horizon and the short
horizon is really important because you
don't know whether the outcomes you want
so actually the outcomes you want
and you'll typically find that your
ideas about specifying outcomes produced
the wrong behavior so you've got to have
a short time horizon so you can validate
them so the leaders decide what needs to
be done but the people doing the work
decide how it's going to be done that
division of labor is essential leaders
should not be deciding and managers
should not be telling people how to do
their work the people doing the work
should decide how they're going to do
their work and then the job of managers
is to help the people who are working
for them to run experiments and try a
bunch of stuff and basically run the
scientific method and then crucially
we're going to update our outcomes our
visual in our metrics based on what
we've learnt in the process of trying a
bunch of stuff so finally the job of
automation is to help us to detect
problems so that we as humans can go
into a problem solving which is what we
good at use computers to do their things
the things they're good at which is
performing repetitive tasks you use
people for things that they're good at
which is solving problems always work in
small batches because when you're
working a complex system and you try
something out it's going to rapidly
diverge from what you expect to happen
and say you want to limit the possible
downside of things going wrong and get
tight feedback loops what you want to
measure improve ultimately is customer
outcomes and too few people are focused
on measuring the customer outcomes
continuous delivery goes from idea to
measurable customer outcome and if
you're not measuring the customer
outcome of the improvements you're
trying then you've got no way of knowing
if they're actually improving the
quality of the product that you're
building and then finally if you want to
learn how to implement DevOps or
implement continuous delivery or pretty
much implement anything the answer is
you do it through continuous improvement
and to quote my ex colleague and friend
Mike Roberts continuous is a lot more
often than you think
finally I just want to quote Jesse
Robbins Jesse Robbins as the co-founder
ops codes he was master disaster at
Amazon he's a firefighter in his spare
time and basically just a massive
overachiever Jesse Robbins has a rule
Jesse says don't fight stupid make more
awesome and so if you're wondering what
you can do to make your organization
just a little bit better the way you do
that is everyone comes into work every
day and thinks how can I make life a
little bit more awesome for everybody
else around me and if all of us did that
every day that's how you build a great
culture and a great company
