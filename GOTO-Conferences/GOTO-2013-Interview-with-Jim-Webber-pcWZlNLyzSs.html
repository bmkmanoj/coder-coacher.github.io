here with jim weber the chief scientist
at neo technology so Jim you were
recently recognized as a distinguished
speaker at the go to conference written
congratulations on that thank you when
was the first time you spoke in a try
for conference the first time I came
across a trifle was shortly after I
moved back to the UK and in living in
Australia for several years and I became
involved with the first kick on London
back in 07 and I've had a good
relationship with both corn and cosecant
and the various other offshoots are both
on their infancy side and on the
trifling side since then they thought
allowed me to add my opinions and runs
on distributed computing and more
recently data for the full us five or
six years which is very good of them I
think if you were going to take a guess
how many presentations do you think he'd
given a competition now this should know
because when you're on the trifle CEO
made the announcements about who was
getting this ah this activity I guess
there he actually did manage to bring up
the stats on all of the speakers that
have done is I am he impressed upon me
that he was at application running on
near future so I really do feel now on a
bound up to reproduce those stuffs as if
I've got my own copy of that database in
Benedict my skull violate around it's
around 40 presentations through the
years you North America Europe Asia
Australasia i'm looking forward to one
of the days when try thought makes it to
Antarctica or Africa because there's the
only consonants I don't think I've the
pleasure of speaking in so with giving a
lot of presentations how'd what effect
does that have so has it changed how you
look at hard problems has a change how
you explain things like what doing a lot
of presentations how does that change
aspects of what you do so I can't say
that I've ever given any full thought to
this but it has had its way when i first
started presenting at user groups and so
on when i was younger as if I first
started when we were doing transactions
middle where I perhaps was a little bit
less confidence and competence in front
of an audience and so I would try very
much to deliver a matter of fact and
probably deep detect technical a piece
of content to that audience sometimes I
think perhaps embarrassingly delivering
such hardcore technical content simply
to make myself feel better about my own
inadequacies as a presenter I think over
the intervening years that's changed for
me somewhat where I think now
particularly as a general development
conference like my ghost recon you
realize that you have a bunch of quite
sophisticated attendees but it's not to
say that those attendees of ever have
ever experienced the technology we're
talking about so I think you have to
create compelling presentations which
have something for the people who are
your technology users and unlikely to be
attracted to which your talks but also
for people who are are curious competent
technologists and so nowadays I try to
weave a narrative which has something
for for the curious and something for
the the already competence and mostly
why I've learned is if you want people
to enjoy using the technology or to
pique their interest you have to keep
them entertained while you're speaking
and I think that's a realization that
came to be gradually the the most effect
I can have is to make a piece of
technology that I think is important I
seem appealing to others and then they
might latch onto that the technology
used
rueful face which I guess ultimately
means I'm I'm in it for the laughs it's
interesting one of the things that I've
found is people and this is probably do
an evolution people at their core seem
to be driven by stories it's stories
that we latch on to stories that we
identify with and I think that makes the
difference between books that are
popular and books that are textbooks
where you have a whole bunch of facts
and figures and there's not necessarily
a narrative the wine sit together
whereas if you have this story with your
beginning a middle and end and all sorts
of all good pieces of story then it's
something of people remember and go on
with and I look at reality TV and the
rise of reality is a great example of
how you can basically take anything at
all and package it up and put a story on
it and an astonishing number of people
will care because otherwise I can't
explain how anybody would want to watch
12 people dressed like they were from
the 80's competing for the heart of
washed-up 80s rocker and have a go four
or five seasons so have a total metaphor
rhythm familiar to me but I get the
general idea and yeah you're right i
probably not the strongest person to ask
about this i mean the likes of i've done
more for example i think
much more clear about this notion of
storytelling within our craft but
whether that's a big kind of macro level
where you're discussing when you're
presenting stories to an audience or at
a micro level where you have your own
folklore in your delivery teams I think
you're onto something there this notion
of story is critically important I think
most tremendously important to that is
you need a critical mass of people to be
involved with that story for it to
perpetuate and I've been on projects
where the modern critical volume of
people who participated in that story
either through lack of numbers of of
software professionals notes of small
project will all perhaps in sadly
through super simple disinterest that
the stories would be told and then you
find yourself revisiting design
decisions and asking what is it like
this and actually I think the value of
story to software is that it subtly and
in a very convivial way a reinforces by
certain design decision why certain
approaches have been made for a system
without how to formally go and read the
other the big dry documentation that the
folklore teams develop i think is both
fascinating and critically important for
that success it's interesting just a
suddenly my brain went racing I was
thinking about good teams teams things
where people while and whether that kind
of storytelling
so brain kind of yeah I don't matter
probably probably a bit better for us
well yeah okay great if you don't have
story time and it's informal stuff right
it's like Oh remember the day when we
did blah blah blah refer the bubble what
put a home here that kind of you know
kind of coffee room answer is incredibly
important if you don't have it you end
up rediscovering that story by bumping
into the same mistakes and stories are a
cost saver and I wonder if that's one of
the big attractions of architecture a
case study presentations particularly
when you have a good storyteller that
tells it is I feel like those benefit us
as developers as architects people that
build things as part of a creative
endeavor that if we assume the person on
stage is a reasonable person then you
would think that if you were in that
position given those constraints trying
to achieve a particular goal you would
probably end up at the same thing and so
by walking through the history by
walking through the story you end up
learning a lot more as a developer
whereas when it's just you know we have
this box and points of that boxes to
sell a box in this three-tier
architecture below what well why yeah I
do you think so there's not just the
kind of all tradition going on there
which vastly predates of course and the
discipline of software engineering
software craftsmanship or plate hackery
where we like to call it however I think
it's also a sense of particularly in
enterprise IT we're being the first is
quite a risky thing experience a very
nerve-wracking thing
to be the first to build something I
mean we saw this morning here in Chicago
you are a Chicago to earth but have been
he talking about building tools very
sophisticated tools for the myriad of
diseases under under the umbrella of
cancer and what he announced was a bunch
of incredibly what we think I was
pending bleeding edge tools info J
closure jruby puppets all these things
mix the other than being one in one
project which if you were Enterprise IT
planning kind of person and one of your
developers have come to use it let's do
this you would have been nervous at best
but now the violas kind of said well
actually I did this in this project
these technologies went on for about a
year the project have this kind of
envelope now I little bit still you know
it as owner is very very very are
bleeding edge but least you know
someone's done it dash rather the safety
blanket of knowing that someone else has
done what you're attempting to do
embalming you to be able to repeat it
and hopefully you know have a modicum of
a vision that you can rightly repeat but
improve and what's gone before you but I
think that motion of iterative it self
improvement within the community early
view very healthy going back to the
stories there is two major areas that
are more of that you've worked on over
the last few years is a lot with rest
and now along with graphs what's the
story there how did you go from where
you started through rest into
integration what what's the linking
threader so the linking thread really is
distributed systems so my first job
where island university was in
distributed transaction processing with
a startup called Arjuna and so that's
really where I learned about
distribution systems dependability
although we were focused on transactions
are called idiom for distribution for
distributing fault tolerant systems the
guys I was working with there were
world-class experts in building
distributed photographer future systems
other then that went with me into a
period of time that some thought works
as a real are consulting again on
distributed systems in the early days on
some of the kind of kind of a hasten
hesitant to admit it now but kind of the
earth the early so grab services that
kind of stuff and then and then
interests so the kind of distributed
systems narrative has been with me for a
long time you know the kind of
transaction processing stuff which is
very personal to databases been with me
for a long time but the connection
between the kind of even if the wife
occasion and the connection and actually
the rest thing brought together dis
routing systems because the web is the
largest distributed system we know and
it brought together graphs because the
web is nothing more than the largest
graph structure we've ever modeled on
the planet those are links between pages
of course a constitute ER and network a
hypermedia network it was that notion of
large-scale graphs which started to
appeal to me thinking about resting
about the relative distribution system
because all we're doing we interact with
the web is creating new parts of that
graph or modifying existing parts of
that graph when you start to
conceptualize the web not in a very
human terms about you know images and
forms and that kind of stuff but in
terms of simply manipulating a data
structure using the idioms HTTP provides
you can pull it down to a couple classic
algorithms and data structures problem
which dead of course has a very strong
our connectivity who I do today which is
building databases that are themselves
and are using graphs as the primary
storage mechanism so in effect I like to
think of a graph database like neo as
being kind of a small graph that them
then often we're going to take that
graph days that's in the database and
projecting out ones on to the big graph
that is the
where we'll be combining for sorts of
other data hopefully in the future
increasingly from graph data sources but
today we're dominantly from tabular data
sources that we have to manage and punch
a little to get it that projected
alcohol to the B press those the web so
I think I'd be a surprisingly
monoculture when I reflect on it notnot
are not deliberately but the kind of
disparate systems stuff and under
current data structures stuff have being
with me for a long time interesting so
I've never thought of the web as a
directed graph like a directional graft
in fact what bothers the now famously
said it's not dumb either we don't you
anymore hggg which is giant global
growth and the Semantic Web movements
have been trying having modest success
in trying to make the web itself
bootable to marking up api's well links
and relations and so on so there it can
be queried as if it really blur
something like a bigger more later
version of nephrogenic interesting so
then I'm wondering how much kind of back
and forth theorists there were I look at
the lot of semantic web is something
which has been going on for a long time
has promised much for a long time now
seems to be showing some of those
promises and you look at things like
Google now that was pretty damn
impressive and I wonder how do you see
cross-pollination working there so how
does neo4j design feature set it said
will reflect the developments on the web
and how do you see the cave builders
neo4j reflecting some of the things that
have come up so that you rather the
Semantic Web work has been from our
point of view of commercial
technologists it's felt like a slow burn
I'm pretty sure that the researchers
working on it have been anything but
under it
well they've been working on this
technology or suite of technologies
actually as it is but you write the same
web stuff is kind of coming to life now
we're starting to see commercial product
offerings around RDF triples tools and
so on we've seen commercial offerings
are around triple data in particular
being used the BBC use them for recently
for the olympics coverage of the pic
stands that kind of thing so that kind
of semantic web inspired technology he
started to come to fruition but using
that the graph databases have mostly
come from another direction so they
really haven't been considering you know
how do we take the web and boil it down
into a database they've been carrying on
bottom up which is of course of really
useful data how do I make it locally
useful then potentially project that you
follow on to the web so keep the web
wrong and boil the web and what I'm
noticing is the valleys technology to
color conversion because they broadly do
the same thing if you have a trivial
store there often you want to do pattern
infancy on it through from sparkle and
if you've got a graph database unlike
your vajay you what to do pattern
inference on it using our beer language
if you can use called cipher see there's
definitely some convergence going on
there but i think that convergence is
going to drive notable collaboration at
the moment for example here for j
extends its love to the Semantic Web
community by saying well we have a
library through which you can throw RDF
triples others and sparkle queries but
we are not a triple store and we aren't
very much our primary analyze a very
much graph-based so if you are going
from an algorithmic background so if you
remember you know algorithms 101 near
for Jade looks intimately familiar to
you whereas if you're coming from an AI
reasoning kind of San web background you
look at near 4j it really doesn't have
those same affordances in terms of
triples
something you're used to I happen to
think that the graphs are have more
expressive power than triples and I hope
to be able to open to the balance will
shift more in the favor of native graphs
fondant native triples but I think there
is now now that both technologies are
coming to commercial for sure I think
we're going to see some interesting
crossovers and with with any data store
that is upcoming like graph databases
calm stores etc the 800-pound gorilla
for a lot of time has been relational
databases so which what I'm wondering is
there seem to be different types of data
can be best represented in different
ways and up until now you have things
like ORM which let's not get started on
that there's it seems everything was
getting stuffed into the relational
database whether it applied or not now
that there is this idea that well maybe
we can use different data stores for
different things which types of data do
you think are best suited to a graph
database so i think the choices you
point out one of the dimensions which is
the shape of your data i think the other
dimension to considering is the way it's
going to be accessed where it's going to
be used so for example if your if your
if your data is going to be discreet
what founder and subtle aggregates
something like a shopping cart system
you could store that in a graph database
you absolutely could but the way it's
going to be accessed is going to be
effectively a key value look up so
you're not going to get any of the
benefits of the collectivity
graph database provides and you're
probably going to get some of the
drawbacks your graph database is because
of the expressive data model tend not to
be is operationally scalable as the KP
stores or the constants as far as what I
do think that the that the column stores
there are incredibly uncontroversial
tools in our toolbox so I would
absolutely if given the choice valve I
building shopping cart system do I build
it in here for Jade or do I podium
Cassandra I'm going to build in
Cassandra and you know i love neeraj a
closed-in neo4j I live and breathe neo4j
refer building shopping cart do with
Cassandra who's Cassandra is the right
piece of kit for however when it comes
to analyzing shopping history that's
where near for journey comes into its
own because it says that your history of
you or your review of your transaction
events and the line items that each of
those transactions contains can we map
back to taxonomy zuv products and so on
and they're being able to analyze you
and people like you in n dimensions
where n can be arbitrarily large is
doable in a graph database in fact our
can't even be pleasant in a graph
database doing that in another kind of
database of aggregate database or a
relational database it's going to be
potentially achievable but it's going to
be unpleasant it's going to be hard work
and you're going to find yourself
effectively layering on your own home
brew graph layer in order to do that
kind of verification and further
analysis so I do you think it's kind of
a horses for courses thing in fact
nowadays I see the kind of polygons
solutions again becoming less and less
controversial from an ear for Jane
perspective you know we've seen
situations where people use something
like Cassandra to absorb unpredictable
burst of light load and then where that
kind of you know bulk but unrefined data
is pumped in its more steady rate into
near 4j where the graph is built hours
had changed it mutated that the graph
becomes the authoritative source of
truth for its systems in dentistry and
in fact this current that that virtuous
cycle as that kind of unrefined data
comes into the graph kind of causing all
mutates and so on and as questions abs
are made of the graph Dave Hall back in
mutated structure saw so the graph
really becomes a near real-time view of
truth what's going on in your business
whereas something like cassandra is used
to make sure that you never ever lose
something important that happens as it
flows into your business i think that
combination is very compelling
interesting your description it kind of
reminds me of like with the relation
database how you'd have transaction log
and you have the thing on disk and so
you could basically you would have stuff
that would get piled up it will go to
the transaction log and then if you're
doing replication out based on the
transaction log you'll be reading off at
a certain point in doing that so it's
essentially like it's a buffer and
that's some amount of eventual
consistency which is actually how our
today's neeraj a clustering worked it so
again it's in the expressive power me of
Jays in the graph model by terms of the
kind of underlying tech if you were a
relational database guy you look at the
HSM I reckon I recognize the big
building blocks in this now they're not
incredibly dissimilar than why you from
I'm used to in in building relational
stores the same guy classic- structures
are underpin do in the same way that
they have been Oracle it's simply that
the data model in neo is not are
troubled by unpredictable intermediate
sets in the same way that relational
databases tv-g our interest it seems
also there's been a lot of focus in the
last few years on social apps and it
seems that social interactions are
modeled pretty well by a graph system do
you think that as this kind of social
capability expands that that's going to
lead to more demand for for graph
database two types of what do you think
are the main drivers of adoption of
graph of a social to be phenomenal right
i mean everyone wants something social
whether that's simply a social network
to keep people engaged with it with the
property on the web whether that's a
social network
recommendations for smarter point by
buying choices or that kind of stuff on
the way you're the social stuff it is
critical if that's for the longest time
people thought about neo as being the
kind of Facebook for the rest of us
coming infrastructure for what it's
worth graphs actually really it's me
it's mainly a double-edged swords
clatter of really bored and an idiomatic
modeling tool for many many demands but
of course what most people know others
graph on the first it counts the
technology is facebook so our Facebook
has a social growth facebook has graph
search and your google down has got our
graph it's like okay so people are
looking primarily for what those very
famous and uses of graphs are and then
figure out how they can replicate
similar functionality in their own
infrastructure and I think that for us
is kind of a gateway and I said it's
been a blessing and a curse because that
gateway has been brilliant forgetting
neo4j deployed in people in people's
infrastructure for those social things
the flip side of it is is that people
sometimes think that you're kind of
Lincoln thinking oh I've done the social
thing with us for Jay and they will pick
up my relational database to do you know
the kind of transactional analysis or to
do the protein folding or whatever it
happens to be that's that's being a
protective curse for us try to persuade
people a grasp of just associate simply
the lot of a graph theory examples lean
heavily on social because we've got
those kind of data sets but really grab
something graphs started off solving a
geospatial problem and still to this
date your party's RT indexes are very
very very very well represented in graph
databases so I think our challenge now
and the graph database community is
explain to folks how problems other than
classic social can be handled with grabs
and we're having some success there but
I think it's still in evolution of graph
processing craft store
graph query it's still relatively early
days was but I can find it quite
charming and brilliance when I bump into
people that are using here for Jade in
ways I haven't thought of and
particularly when it's a non social
thing so I explains me a couple years
ago how they were using near 4j for they
were there talcher they're using the
agenda network management how does that
work I think I'd like to know about are
you stupid big our network is a graph
and you connect the rooters and the
switches through the machines to the VMS
that run on those machines and then we
do all kinds of one of them things like
if two people phone up and say my
application has gone down we can do
common ancestor analysis very quickly if
I that was broken or we can do future
spectrum analysis and look for single
points of failure in the graph and which
customers it will affect and whether
it's worth doing something about it
based on their value tools I'm like oh
yeah it's obvious now you told me and
that to be honest I feel quite dim and
probably this is silly for me to admit
on camera I never fail to be amazed and
surprised when people tell me what
they're doing with graphs because even
though i say strongly the graphs are
very broad idiom and someone tells me
something i haven't thought of before it
often takes me a second or two to think
I'm like warm moments that you can kind
of nap how the rough will look in their
domain oh yeah you can use that to
maximize ice cream sales in Greenland
that makes a bunch of sense that we had
all that kind of unlikely things that
people are doing with graphs that the
thing that the tick will be recently
visitors are conocophillips in annoy oil
gas provider and they're using graphs to
mid grass with genetic algorithms that
the folks are moving credo help them to
do this using crafts of genetic
algorithms to figure out how to flush as
little water as possible down their
pipelines that ordinarily
oil and I haven't even thought about a
lot happier course mapping a a gas and
oil networkers event as a graphic very
straightforward but I haven't thought
about that one other dimension which is
applying genetic algorithms so to seeing
how various approaches might work and
then given a good working approach as it
Richard Lee refine it such that you
don't have to shut down an entire
network and flush it as such you can
shut down all is possible part of the
network and flush it when you want to
make changes to what it's carrying and
that was fascinating so we always said
that was more than a couple of seconds
of thinking about it because our the
guys had to explain to me are their
fitness functions and sell for their GA
why didn't I think about marrying GA s
and graphs may even have some of the
same letters right a silent but if cliff
now that of course now that I've been
tourists how that's obvious but I keep
having Brian I keep having these now oh
that's on to his moments and as long as
they keep climbing had a really happy
guy because it means there are people
out there innovating in wonderful
wonderful ways that me being down in the
week simply shopping bits to inform this
I don't get to see and when people tell
me it makes me a happy bunny it's
interesting that that oh now it's
obvious thing that reminds me of a story
that I heard it might be apocryphal as
well Christopher Columbus he was tryin
he was tryin to make an example about
after having come back from discovering
you know the new world he was sitting
round table and a bunch of bunch of the
people that were there we're talking
about how oh wow you know
it's obvious you know if you just keep
going that would eventually we found
something and so what he did to prove
his point was that it wasn't necessarily
obvious until first discovery is he
asked somebody to bring him an egg and
he said okay well I'd like each of you
to try to stand the sight on that and so
they all tried for 10 to 15 minutes try
and get the sake to stand on end nobody
was successful and so he took the egg
and he taps it on the bottom to crack
the shell slightly then estate still he
said now once I've shown you it's
obvious you could do that but before
that it was not necessarily obvious so I
guess that's one of the this one of the
things about being somebody that creates
technology or the egg in this case you
create something and it may not
necessarily be obvious with all these
applications are but it takes somebody
to go in and do something completely
crazy and then afterwards like wow yeah
that's really neat i mean think that
once that initial link has made that
connection between those two notes then
it's yeah i write a whole other yeah
then other normal business things kind
of come into focus it's AIT's a it's
delightful that's amazing what you can
do with some of these things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
