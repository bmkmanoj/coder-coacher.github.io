obviously was in Stockholm last week for
our large summit event and I guess it
might be a few people that were here at
that this is a little bit more of a
technical talk I'm going to be talking a
little bit about patterns in use cases
for service architectures but before I
do that I'd just like to know who here
is using AWS lambda or has built
something using lambda today okay
minority of people so this should be
pretty interesting definitely for the
rest of you I'm going to talk about a
few detailed use cases for lambda which
should also contain a little bit of
content that's interesting for the guys
that have used the user service before
my name is Ian as I've been introduced
I run the evangelism function for AWS in
Europe Middle East and Africa and I was
going to do something today that I've
never done before which is include a
slide which causes everybody to groan in
the audience but before I did that I
thought I would just say at the
beginning of this session I'm hiring
evangelist for the developer relations
team AWS in Stockholm and Berlin so if
anybody here would like to talk to me
about that after the session I'll get my
my plug in first today instead of at the
end ok so you can find me on Twitter
here and a stay up to date with AWS
service announcements on this account as
well as our as our main accounts of
course so what is lambda well
lambda is actually the third in a
triplet of AWS services that developers
are using to build large-scale
applications without servers now of
course there are servers involved in
this ok there's no magic it's just that
we provide a set of abstraction layers
that allow you to work directly with
service endpoints to deliver
functionality in your apps without
having a provision any service so you
have nothing to manage no operating
systems no containers and no
infrastructure you just work with our
service endpoints we provide the
opportunity for you to execute code and
also to persist data and objects in a
couple of different services that we
provide probably you're more familiar
with s3 it's been around over 10 years
dynamodb it's got a 4 year history as a
non relational database with consistent
and very good access performance so very
durable in nature and then lambda is a
little bit newer that's actually been
around for a couple of years
we announced reinvent in 2014 and it's
seen really good adoption and it's
really that adoption I want to talk
about for the rest of the session today
now all of these services have some
simple characteristics in common simple
to access they're very scalable in fact
as developers you have nothing to scale
you might have to ask us to raise a few
service limits but really there's
practically unlimited unlimited amounts
of capacity here and I'll talk about
that a little bit later when I come to
one of the example use cases that I've
got they're very reliable so we
obviously manage the underlying
infrastructure we abstract that away
from you and we just provision the
amount of capacity that you need as you
need it and they offer low latency which
means they can be used for interactive
apps web and other applications that are
more interactive in nature focusing on
lambda itself for a second what is I
think most interesting about this
service is the way in which the metering
works so you're essentially billed for
the memory footprint that you use in 128
megabytes over time chunks of 100
milliseconds okay and there's a very
very small very subset charge for each
chunk of that capacity that you use we
also provide a pretty generous free tier
on this service so you can invoke a
million lambda functions and consume so
four hundred thousand in vacations and
consume a million seconds of execution
time per month forever with this service
so it's not a free tier that runs out
you can just consume that baseline
amount of capacity for as long as you
want I'll give a example later of a
customer that's built a web application
using this service and the costs are
incredibly low for the Emmaus traffic
that they drive and one of the reasons
for that is the majority of their app
ones in this free tier component they
only use a small amount of incremental
capacity on top of that so how our
customers are using this service today
and really one of the predominant
patterns is use of lambda to power the
backend of service web applications and
this can be at any scale I hope you'll
also notice it has a really broad range
of different customer types that are
using this service today one of the most
interesting ones this organization
called legalities
and our local lytx violent this is
amazing that the numbers involved with
us are pretty phenomenal so we kind of
think about this as normal today but
just want to remind people that these
numbers are not that normal they have
2.7 billion mobile endpoints connected
to this application and they have 37,000
mobile apps that are registered and they
use lambda to gather and aggregate usage
statistics in applications that mobile
developers have chosen chosen to deploy
through a couple of different app stores
if you're talking about being able to
support usage numbers like that it was
just unheard of that you would build
apps that big even five years ago but
today with with the cloud at the back
there's the opportunity for elasticity
and the platform that can support that
and I want to spend a bit of time
talking about one specific example of a
service web application that is built on
lambda not this one this is another
example from the US but this one so
probably everybody here is heard of
David Greta he's a French DJ and he's
working in partnership with UA for the
European governing body for football
obviously to produce a track so a record
for for the Euro 2016 championships this
summer okay and they decided they wanted
to make this a mass participation event
and what he's done is got a million
individuals to record their voices
singing along to a track that he's
created okay so there's a web app that's
been produced actually by these guys
this is a digital agency from the UK
called parallax quite a small company
and they act as a digital fulfillment
agency to the prime agency that have the
digital marketing contract with UEFA
with Chelsea and with a few of a big
football clubs okay and what parallax of
bill is a single page web app that looks
a little bit like this when you load it
so how's the streaming video in the
background you can scroll down the page
and there are a number of different
functions here each one of these
functions is expressed as a restful api
endpoint and the entire application is
delivered in a completely serverless
manner so there are no ec2 instances
there are no relational database
in fact there are no persistent service
components at all at the back end
apart from DynamoDB and objects that are
stored inside s3 and the flow for the
application looks like this so there's a
page life cycle that's established when
you load the app the first thing that
happens is you obviously download that
initial HTML and JavaScript asset that
comes directly out of s3 with the
CloudFront distribution in front of it
they then assess the language of the
browser that's been used to pull down
that first asset and they reload a new
copy of the page which is localized okay
they have support for five or six
different european languages turkish
chinese japanese and korean okay so you
can see that they've got a global
audience for this app and this talks to
some of the scaling factors that we're
going to talk about later users can then
insert their details so you're recording
your name and also which club you
support and that data is going to get
used a little bit later on for something
else but it's persisted immediately
inside DynamoDB via another lambda
function which sits behind an api
gateway okay and after that you move
down the page a little bit you can
optionally link the session to Facebook
you then grab the video asset which is
david greta explaining what you're going
to do so he talks a little bit about the
track and he plays back the audio track
together with some of the voices doing
the singing and encourages the people
visiting the application to record their
own voice now tried to do this demo live
another audience like this I discovered
one thing which is that software
developers do not like singing in public
so I won't be turning around my laptop
and asking you to do it okay but I
didn't try it before and didn't work out
that well so what happens is the the
people are using the app mostly I guess
in the privacy of their own home where
they're not going to be too embarrassed
about singing then do the audio
recording that's captured as an mp3 file
by a browser side component it's pushed
to s3 and at this point a social media
image is generated so they create this
okay which is built using a lambda
function that composites together an
image that the applications grabbed off
Facebook normally a profile pic it
overwrites there
artwork on top of that image and it then
makes that available for you for sharing
they use an external social sharing
endpoint which you can see here which
allows that image to be shared on the
use of social networks and then they
store some details about the user at the
end so they can later on draw a
competition prize for me that's
participated in the event
okay so that's the app built entirely
without any compute capacity everything
is a browser side component or a
collection of services running on
various AWS endpoints okay so some
metrics they could have built it like
this okay so this would be a traditional
entir model and there was some obvious
disadvantages with that the main
disadvantage with it is in any kind of
public campaign like this you're working
with forecasts right you know you've got
a set of anticipated usage data that
comes from the customer in this case
their custom would be UEFA and UEFA gave
them some numbers about how big they
anticipated traffic volumes to be but of
course with the campaign you've got a
ramp you start off with provisioning and
testing then you'll start to get
substantial usage on the service you've
got to build out this infrastructure at
day one to cater for that usage peak
right that's the normal deployment model
they calculated that this would cost
them around about $12,000 a month in AWS
service charges to build okay because
they had to build it to scale with this
peak volume that they're anticipating in
month 2 of the campaign they built this
which looks more complex but actually
the vast majority of what you can see
I'm here as service endpoints you've got
your lambda functions here and we're
illustrating the different API resources
that are being made available via this
API gateway we've got our static assets
and our social media images that have
been stored in s3
we've got transactional email
confirmations going out with our email
service SES and then we've got our
persistent data for those subscribers
being held back in dynamo DB so there's
nothing running there in terms of ec2
capacity or in fact any services that
have to be scaled beyond their actual
usage level
so if option one is $12,000 a month does
anyone want to have a guess at what
option two is in terms of the initial
ramp up so say month one of usage nine
dollars thirty cents okay so that's
about a thousand times cheaper than
option one and then of course they
started to get really busy you know as
more and more people started to come
onto the campaign and actually the the
French FA decided that they would put
the application on a train and run that
train around France with a physical
recording studio on it still using the
same app and back-end but taking this to
different cities parking it in stations
and getting people to come onto the
train and record their own voices which
is kind of quirky little real-world
aspects of the campaign so they started
to get really busy and when they got
really busy it cost them one hundred and
seventy three dollars a month okay for
the same output as they would have got
with this twelve thousand dollar
infrastructure stack over here so it
just completely breaks the connection
between infrastructure resilience costs
where you would have to buy two of
everything distribute that across AZ's
and also breaks the connection between
volumes as Adrienne said you can scale
up as big as you want but you can scale
down to zero when you scale down to zero
your cost will also be zero for the
variable component there's a small
amount of data that's specific in dynamo
and there's a small amount of data
that's in s3 but those aren't material
costs it's relatively short-term
campaign okay I want testing by the way
they when you start with lambda it's
worth noting out that you have a hundred
concurrent function limit in your AWS
account so if you want to lift that you
have to ask us just do that via our
limit increase process that we have a
lot of you will have used it already if
you're using ec2 in any significant
volume they tested to five thousand
concurrence using a load generation tool
that they'd developed and they were very
able to deal with that and the
counterintuitive thing about lambda is
the more volume you have the more
frequently you spin up the functions the
faster the functions perform so actually
loading and continuously running the
same function over and over again means
that it gets cached on our
infrastructure and the spool up time for
initiating new copies of that function
will be substantially lower than a
old start talking about maybe 250
milliseconds to cold start a function
whereas if you have that function cast
on the infrastructure it's practically
instantaneous to launch it and start
sending traffic so that's a little bit
on Web Apps
another common usage pan that we see is
serverless data processing and there can
be quite a lot of different ways in
which this is implemented a very common
one would be something like image or
video transcoding where you want to have
on-demand actions to transcode images
that might be uploaded this part of an
app or you want to do something with
video and with video there's some really
interesting techniques emerging the guys
at parallax have been experimenting with
concurrent frame rendering so you want
to build a piece of customized 3d
rendered video that actually got a
parallelization model where they have
one lambda function rendering each frame
so they'll spawn 25 functions for each
second of video that they want to create
render each one of those frames and then
composite those back into an mp4 for
play out okay and they've tried
rendering in real time where they'll
have a small run in maybe five or six
seconds of pre-rendered video in the
background as that starts to play in the
browser they then custom render the
custom components of the video that
might have the individual social media
image in it so it's personalized by the
time the four or five seconds of
pre-render have played out the six or
seven seconds of custom renderer ready
to go they just stream that into the
browser it looks like one seamless video
experience to the user but part of it is
concurrently rendered using lambda
functions in the backend this particular
use case here is about intrusion
detection so they're using lambda
parallel processing of security events a
little bit like really implementing
something like EMR or Hadoop inside
lambda functions but they're processing
events in parallel operating logic on
those events and then obviously in the
case of this intrusion detection service
they're doing things like triggering
alerts on the basis of what they find in
security events again it's all done
using parallel lambda functions at the
back end okay who knows what this is
ever used one it's anyone ever used the
Alexus skills kit which is the extension
system for this where you can write your
own voice enabled out well that's
interesting normally in the room this
size I'd find at least a couple of
people that have experimented with that
so we described this as a
voice-activated speaker and you can
basically talk to a service endpoint by
using this device you could say you know
Alexa play me some rock music and it
would be connected to a music service
and would start to stream audio out of
the device you can order stuff on Amazon
with it predictably you can add stuff to
shopping this with the right back-end
technology integrated with it you can
also do other things Capital One in the
US they've got an application that
allows you to check your credit card
balance and your minimum payment by
talking to a speaker in your house what
they do at the back end is integrate the
Alexa service with Capital One's public
API using your account credentials to
read data out of your account and voice
transcribe that and speak it back to you
that's quite a new service and there's
quite a few auto manufacturers in the
u.s. that I've got applications as well
at they've built using this and well you
probably saying why is this relevant to
lambda well every thing that echo does
every extension that's been developed
for it is actually a lambda function at
the back end okay so what we provide
with the service is something called the
Alexa skills kit which is a development
environment for people that want to
build voice enabled apps when you talk
to the speaker we have the voice to
speech engine we transcribe whatever you
say to them whatever you say to the
devices we pack that up inside adjacent
object and we send it to a lambda
function that you've specified
effectively routing it on the basis of
the first couple of things that you say
we have a natural language detection for
a lot of services but also you can
extend it by doing things like Alexa
tell nest to increase the temperature
and the fact that you've used that tell
nest prefixed would indicate which skill
you wish to use to process that next
block route it into a lambda function
execute whatever logic you want there
and take third-party actions or what
turn Voice back to you to be spoken to
you via the speaker I'd encourage you
all to take a look at this it's really
easy to get started with and despite the
fact that the device is not available
here in Europe yet we do have a lot of
developers here that are working on the
platform particularly in Germany in the
UK where we've done some hackathons with
this device it's pretty popular so who'd
be interested in that by the way we came
to Stockholm and did something on
voice-enabled would there be any
interest in that okay cool I mean we
will try and set that up it would be
good to do I think and obviously behind
that we've got other IOT services as
well this is something that I wanted to
just talk about and then do a quick demo
where to show you how easy it is to get
started with lambda functions and also
to change and modify them so this is our
IOT platform I don't know how many of
you are familiar with this we launched
it last year reinvent 2015 and we got a
portfolio of components here that
connected device application developers
can use to build services on and we have
a lot of people that are using this
today big ones here in Europe would be
people like viola the water network
operator in France they're building
network management and folding fault
detection services using AWS IOT at the
backend to do that the components are
quite interesting so we've got a device
side SDK which is JavaScript in CST KS
that sit out on the devices that you're
building and I'll show you one in a
second on this camera that I've got here
we've got a mutual TLS system using
x.509 certificates and public private
key infrastructure to make sure that you
can secure connectivity to and from the
devices it can be really important in
things like health informatics and
safety critical systems where you don't
want to have anything unauthorized
communicating with your device and
obviously don't want to eavesdropping on
what could potentially be private data
this gateway which supports this
protocol called mqtt which is a
lightweight transport protocol for
reducing the power footprint of
lightweight devices that you want to
connect to endpoints it's about 170
times more power efficient than HTTP
because there's no key generation the
keys are pre shared and that really
reduces the amount of power that it
needs and we've got this rules engine
this essentially reads the contents of
messages that are coming off your device
flee
can perform routing logic on those
messages on the basis of their content
so messages coming with certain
parameters inside them could be sent to
different endpoints and then this shadow
this is a mechanism for allowing
developers to work with devices that
might have intermittent connectivity one
of the best examples of this actually is
quite near to here in Norway they have
Telenor connect they're a IOT business
unit of the state operator they're they
connect sheep to the internet okay and
they do biometric monitoring on the
sheep really they're looking for ill
health in their livestock so that they
can maintain the health of their herd
and so fleet then their herd and make
sure that those animals have got good
well-being and also productive in terms
of producing whatever the product is
that the farmers producing and with
these sort of radio networks that are
literally out in the field that can be
very kind of difficult to work with
you've got topological features like
valleys and trees that get in the way of
the radio signal using low-power radio
so you can't kind of drive it over a
wide area and this shadow allows you to
work with devices that aren't actually
connected you can read and write state
from a virtual representation of the
device in the cloud and then when that
device is available again our
client-side SDK will perform a
synchronization opportunity action
rather and be the push device stay out
or refresh the stay in the shadow once
connectivities reestablish that's also a
pretty important feature okay so next is
this I'm going to show you show you
something here
okay okay so this is is this okay if
anybody's seen one of these this is a
AWS we call it a reinvent button an IOT
button but they've got some commonality
in terms of the form factor with another
Amazon device which is called a dash
okay now if you've been in the u.s. you
might have seen one of these dashes what
we do with the the dash version of this
device it's a prime product that Prime
subscribers in the US can get we
manufacture them in conjunction with
FMCG manufacturers so like tide washing
power powder or Gillette razors or nappy
manufacturers we'll have one of these
devices with their branding on it when
you press the button on the device with
the appropriate branding it will
basically buy that product from Amazon
okay and then they'll ship it out to
your house and we have a mechanism to
prevent repeat ordering when you can't
actually register another order for the
product until you've taken delivery of
the prior delivery okay so it's a way
for FMCG providers to kind of position
something physical in the homes of their
customers and hopefully get them to be a
little bit more loyal what we see with
the washing powder one is the people
stick it on the front of their washing
machine and it's right there when they
need to buy more they can just press the
button it's pretty yeah pretty cool this
one's a little bit different okay
what's inside there is a triple-a
battery which gives enough battery life
time for this button to be pressed a
thousand times and also a Broadcom arm
chip a Wi-Fi radio and a tiny amount of
solid-state storage on there we have our
C SDK and an x.509 certificate and a
private key okay and that end point will
communicate with our IOT service so can
actually initiate lambda functions by
pressing that button okay and I'll show
you how that works in in setup on the
back end so in our IOT console you can
see here I've got a few different
entities here this is the button itself
so the representation of that thing
inside the service platform this is a
certificate which is installed on the
button and it has a public/private key
pair associated with a
the public key for the certificate
that's on the button is installed on our
gateway so that we can communicate our
encrypt our outbound traffic to this
button and on the button there's a
corresponding private key so I Paulo
sponding public key which we hold the
private key for on our Gateway so we've
got this mutual TLS authentication
encryption then we have a policy that
allows this particular entity to work
with one of our API endpoints and then
we have a rule it's worth digging into
the rule so the rule corresponds to that
rules engine that I showed you on the
platform architecture a second ago and
you can see that when this button is
pressed a couple of actions will will
take place one of them is an SN ik SNS
action which for debugging will deliver
the payload of the event coming off the
button into an email address that I've
set up to capture that and the second
one is a lambda and action and you can
see that this particular lambda action
triggers this IOT button function and if
I jump into lambda in the same region
you'll see that I have a couple of
functions here one of them is called IOT
button function and you can see the
event source for that is configured to
be that button rule so that's what it's
expecting to receive each trigger event
and payroll payload from and there's
also some monitoring here and you can
see that I've already activated this
particular function once earlier today
in testing I have a little example of
the function code which is here so this
is what's actually inside this lambda
function this particular functions
written in Python as you can see here
we're importing some stuff which should
give a clue as to what this particular
function is concerned with which is
using the Twitter API I have a set of
secrets that I drag in for another from
another module and then I have a status
being constructed here and posted to a
Twitter API that uses those API
credentials that I provided there and if
I jump into my Twitter account
so the framerate on the camera was not
great but you can see that that button
is flashing there it went white and then
it went blue and then it went green and
that indicates that it's been successful
and if we take a look at my Twitter
account now just reload that you'll see
that I've got a new post there which
says test post on it and that
corresponds to the status to post which
has been built here okay so that's been
driven out by that function I'm going to
switch around these two lines comment
out the test post and post something
that's a little bit more enriched so I'm
going to drag in some data out of the
event payload the serial number for the
button which is sent across and also
just know at the time and also this
click type variable which again comes
off the button so it will differentiate
between one press a double click and a
long press and it will deliver that in
the payload so it's multifunction you
can use it for a few different things
I'll save out that and I've got a small
script here which is used for deployment
so just repacked the function and the
modules that are associated with it into
a zip file and then I used the AWS CLI
command to overwrite the pre-existing
function using it say RN with the new
package that I've just built there and
deployed it effectively into live and if
I hit that again you'll see that the
button begins to flash again it's
changed color to green and if we take
another look at Twitter
you
behaves or do a new release without
having to push new code through an app
store well if all of the functionality
in the app is delivered in the backend
using a set of loosely coupled endpoints
with lambda behind them you can
independently Rev that without having to
push any new releases down on 20 devices
that you might be supporting okay so
that's a very quick demo of AWS lambda
in action together with our IOT service
okay so I'm gonna close up now cuz I'm
out of time I'm being trying to count on
the back telling me that I need to get
off stage so the other way that we see
this getting used is as an integration
or automation extension tool for other
AWS services and this is super
interesting so which created event
triggers for lambda which come from
other AWS services obviously we got
dynamodb streams we've got s3 so that
you can trigger functions on the basis
of data but you can also trigger
functions on the basis of other events
there's a couple of really interesting
things here Capital One the built a
compliance tool called cloud custodian
it uses these cloud watch events
essentially every time you make a change
inside your AWS account you can trigger
one of these events and with this open
source project that Capital One is built
they evaluate what you've changed
establish whether you've gone outside
configuration guidelines at their
specific specifying in order to maintain
compliance and then they'll remediating
issues that you might have created
automatically using logic in the
functions that's pretty cool and with
config rules we do something similar
natively where we trigger events on the
basis of resource changes so you might
have modified a security group or
created a new iam user for example again
you can trigger custom lambda functions
on the basis of those events and you can
auto remediate those and again there's
another repo on github under the AWS
labs user on github which contains
community contributed rules where AWS
customers have basically extended their
compliance monitoring and contributed
back the functions that they've
developed to do that so we also see this
pattern for using AWS lambda to extend
the automation capabilities of the
platform particularly in compliance
which is quite interesting for
me indicates that we're sort of getting
off a security footing which is mostly
manual and getting onto a security
footing which is mostly system driven
where it's all about implementing and
enforcing rules rather than auditing so
with that kind of construct it's
possible to move much more quickly
whilst at the same time making sure that
you're operating in a compliant
environment and I think that is what I
have thank you good thank you so we have
a few questions so question one when
should a service architecture not be
used it's a good question so I wouldn't
say when should the service architecture
not be used because I think it's a
potential fit for most application types
there are some restrictions with lambda
like for example the fact that a
function can't persist in more than five
minutes so if you're doing something
that requires longer term processing and
longer term maintenance of state you
might combine lambda with other services
one pattern that we've seen is using
containers maybe on our ECS service our
container service or maybe on other
container management systems and
triggering the instantiation of those
containers using lambda so you kind of
recognize that you've got a long-running
job you can still trigger it with an
event but the execution of that job
doesn't happen inside the function
because the function is time bound so
you're triggering other resources as you
need to to deal with these longer-term
runtimes okay good so how do you make
sure that your lambda code works before
you deploy it to the cloud yep so this
we have integration with cloud watch
logs so you can see debug data from your
code that's running natively inside AWS
lambda we also support aliases and
versioning for functions so you can have
multiple versions of a function some of
which might be public and some of which
might be in testing and there's a
Bluegreen deployment model for functions
there where you can quickly flip over
from one version to another and there
are also a couple of community
contributed projects that will allow you
to emulate and simulate and run lambda
functions locally on your development
environment as well so you've got quite
a few different options okay good cool
thank you thank you
