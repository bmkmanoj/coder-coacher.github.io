about scaling this morning this has
become a big issue in scrum I've been
I've been spending more time in Silicon
Valley and I spent a week there recently
visiting 12 companies and the fewest
number of teams in the company and one
of the companies was 200 so there are
literally thousands and thousands of
scrum teams I was amazed that it took so
many people to get so little done and I
asked them you know how many of you have
working software at the end of your
Sprint's and only 20% of the people
raised their hand so that gave me some
insight into there's a real problem out
there in agile and maybe that's why Dave
Thomas has the title of his talk in any
event we need to talk about what we do
with these huge scrum implementations my
company does a lot of training
consulting all over the world we had
it's been a real privilege to work with
urine for so many years we also do
publications my son will be talked in
this afternoon he's a journalist we've
done three books in the last couple of
years a building out a product called
scrum lab on our website with all the
information on scrum for the last 23
years and we also have a hardware
practice Crum is moving out into
hardware
some of the companies I'll talk about
will be hardware companies if you look
at what's going on in companies around
the world we're working with
organizations like a defense contractor
who doesn't want to be named they had a
problem because a Lockheed made it bid a
four hundred million dollar bid for a
radar system using scrum and they came
in at half price and took it away from
this vendor and they came to me and they
said Jeff the government has told us
that we will never get another contract
if we don't do scrum
if we don't deliver it half-price so we
have to do scrum we not only have to do
scrum but it has to be good scrum that
delivers at half price because if we've
been half a billion and it cost us 1
billion we're going to be out of
business so these guys have to have
working software so their approach to
scaling is quite different then you know
I've spent every every year I wind up at
Spotify rule for a while looking what
they're doing a natively agile company
their model for scaling is very clean
and very elegant they're focused on
innovation very different from the
defense contractor a more typical
organization you know one of the leading
software companies in the world Autodesk
their problem is even different they
they are worried about startups every
time a start-up gets big enough to
capture any significant market share
they buy them what they're afraid of
is the startup they can't buy the Google
of AutoCAD and they said you know we've
been doing scrum for six years recently
but it's not good enough
the startups we're buying are doing
scrum better than us so they brought us
in there we retrain all the teams all
the management all the product owners to
raise their whole scrum implantation to
the next level now one of the things
that a lot of companies particularly in
Silicon Valley are interested is in
innovation but at the same time a lot of
companies are interested in
predictability but if you have total
predictability you have zero innovation
so balancing out these things as you
approach what you're going to do to
scale your scrum is is a difficult task
one of the ways to think about where
companies are is to look at this graph
some companies are you know very strong
process follow the rules
other companies are constantly improving
their process iterating some companies
are focused on innovation and other
companies want a very specific
convergent design and if you place
people companies on this map you know
Apple is more innovative right now than
Microsoft and that's a big problem they
need to move in this dimension the
defense contractor is down here this is
an area where you know they like they
like safe they want to be safer and they
want to be more predictable and they
want to be more specific and they want a
more convergent product design and they
have to deliver a half a billion dollar
plan step by step and they have to
deliver in a specific time frame but
Autodesk as I mentioned they they're
over here more flexible but they want to
get they want to move up the innovation
curve in fact they're there they want to
be like Spotify which is way up here in
the right corner so different different
companies are in different places and
that will cause them to approach how
they scale their organizations and what
you see as when they start they start in
very different ways so the defense
contractor their first problem was after
they got over having to do scrum or go
out of business the next problem was how
do they report to the government on
their project how do they use points to
report or in value to the government and
negotiate a half a billion dollar
contract and get the government to agree
so they had to figure that all out but
if you look at Autodesk
they they're like okay our scrum teams
need to ramp up we need to raise the
whole bar on the way we're doing scrum
and doing that they need to start
floating there the impediments they have
all the way up to the executive team the
management themselves need to be
completely retrained to make sure
they're operating properly Spotify is
focused on teams and how do they get the
tea
seems to achieve a vision and the way it
works as the CEO and his team has some
initiatives some some high-level
objectives they make them really visible
and the team's self-organized around
them nobody tells them what to do very
different kind of company not very safe
okay they would never use safe and if
you look at the way they go after how do
they prioritize how do they manage
portfolios how do they break backlog
down how do they get it into release
plans how do they get it to the teams
this is a big issue in defense and
Autodesk but Spotify is really more
interested in releasing how do they
release to the customer and so in the
last year their major focus was they
weren't Spotify was already really fast
every team delivers every Sprint live
without exception but the CEO says
that's not fast enough Google Amazon
Apple they're going to kill us we have
to go twice as fast so we got together
with the coaches and brainstormed what
will we tell them they were already fast
you can't tell them to double up we
decided to sit and say you need to go to
continuous deployment if you do that
your quality of your process automated
testing is going to have to be so much
better you will automatically go twice
as fast so we got about a third of the
team's doing automated continuous
deployment now and the operations team
had to get out of the way they're not
allowed to deploy what they do is they
have a little black box they give
Spotify with a with a joystick on it
where you can select a build and then a
green button that you push and anybody
can push it at any time and the
operations groups job is to make sure
the green button always works
that's DevOps that's Spotify very
different so the way things flow is very
different in every company and we have
to figure out what their priorities are
and how to step by step go through
scaling the process into hundreds of
teams now one of the things that we have
to explain to management is we're agile
comes from you know when we wrote the
agile manifesto the reason the name is
agile there was a lot of debate about
what we would call it is because of this
book agile organizations and it's a book
about a hundred hardware companies and
what they said is we are lean and what
we've added is customer collaboration
we're going to get the customer involved
in product creation and they said it
doesn't constantly more to do that but
it does require major changes in
organization management philosophy and
operations and that means that the
leadership has to be totally retrained
in most companies because their primary
focus needs to be on eliminating waste
in the system which yarn is going to
talk about in our tract today and to do
that they need to understand a lot of
lean principles how to map value streams
how to systematically implement what
Toyota calls single piece continual
continuous flow so that's what agile is
lean plus involving the customer so in
order to do that at scale it's really
more about getting the management agile
you know lots of times the developers
are already agile but the management is
a problem so a lot of our work is in
leadership development how do we how do
we train the management in this whole
scaling paradigm how do you go through
the product cycle starting with a vision
getting the getting the portfolio's
broken down getting releases how do they
do releases how do you get feedback from
the customer and how do you deal with
this what we call the scrum master cycle
where impediments have to flow all the
way up and there needs to be smek anism
for cross team coordination okay so the
leadership needs to understand these
things how
work and how they can participate in a
way that makes it go faster and doesn't
slow it down so what we've done with
these pieces each one has inputs and
outputs and we trained people
systematically and you know at this
level this comes in and this got this
has got to go out and you've got to have
those deliverables and so what do you
need to do to get them well you know one
of the reasons or I reach it I would say
the main reason I created scrum back
twenty years ago you know we were
talking this year is the 50th year or
Moore's Law so there's been a lot of
papers on this and this is one of the
original diagrams that Moore drew and
it's a diagram that shows the number of
transition transistors on a chip and the
cost of those transistors and what he
showed is that year after year the cost
per transistor gets lower if the number
of transistors on the chip is bigger and
that's why your laptop cost half as much
and goes twice as fast every year but
what we what we were looking at in
software and this is published in this
paper many years ago is Hardware is
going up and this is a logarithmic curve
but hardware is accelerating really fast
but software is not keeping up so how do
we accelerate how do we get on Moore's
Law of software okay so you know what we
we start off with scrum we have beginner
teams and along here you got the number
of stories in a sprint and the cost of
the story average cost of a story per
sprint and as teams get better they
actually start having working software
they can get more stories done per
sprint and the sweet spot is higher and
if they go into continues deployment it
gets better and better so we're driving
this Moore's law of software curve
that's that's a whole reason for
most people don't know that and if you
have good leadership you can really make
this work so I work with a venture
capital firm we have about a billion
dollars invested and I think we have 36
we've sold off some of our companies we
sold one of them for 2.7 billion this to
salesforce.com that was really cool we
only invested about 10 million but we
have 36 companies in our portfolio right
now left and we want all of them to do
scrum the CEO of our investment firm
discovered scrum makes everything go
twice as fast he said we need to
implement it everywhere so our investors
are on a scrum team they have a search
team that scrum they have a recruiting
team that an HR team that hires people
for companies scrumming we have five or
six teams supporting our investments all
scrumming and after they ran hundreds of
sprints all the data was at version one
that was one of the companies we funded
they analyzed the data and they found
that the people that were working long
hours there was still some waterfall
mindset in and some people were working
long hours and their productivity was
low compared to this the ones doing
scrum well and the peak of productivity
for the scrum was less than 40 hours a
week so the CEO pulled everybody
together said we are no longer going to
have anybody working late hours weekends
if you're doing that you're going to be
a bad person in this company and
everybody is going to double production
off they went and one team didn't and he
said to that team he said you clearly
don't know how to do scrum we're going
to bust you up and put you on the fast
teams take your backlog with you by the
time he was done every team in the
entire organization was what I'm running
at 300 percent of their original
velocity so good leadership can scale
velocity if you look at what's going on
and the research at Harvard about
companies professor Carter has published
many books on change one of his recent
works is one is how
to accelerate you know you need to do
that you need both management and
leadership you know we have some of that
at Apple Google and Spotify but there's
a lot of chaos out there
many companies the chaos I was at
Twitter recently and they they have a
lot of money from their from their going
public about 2,000 developers the
leadership would like the ball to do
scrum I asked them what they were doing
and they said well we're doing some
Kanban I said how is it working they
said well everything is stuck in our
deployment column and I said well what
are you doing about it they said we
don't know what to do we're going to
hire 2,000 more developers so that's
pretty crazy because it would be really
simple to double the productivity of the
2,000 they have and it'd be a lot less
painful than hiring two thousand more
people and trying to to make that work
so you know if you read the press
they're having a little problem in the
press right now because of their
earnings and they need to fix that they
need to get more like Google we have
this doomed category okay Nokia you know
Nokia was number one and they're gone
why was that
that's an interesting analysis we'll
we'll hit on some of the issues that
took out Nokia the lesson today is it
does not matter how good you are it does
not matter how big you are you can be
taken down if you are not agile most of
the companies we work with a big bigger
companies are big bureaucracies it takes
well-managed but it takes a huge amount
of work to get anything done so what
what professor Carter is recommending
what he's seeing working is that really
these companies need to think that you
know for a new product development where
they need to be agile
it's a different operating system so
they can take this multi-billion dollar
hierarchy and it's generating a lot of
cash and okay just leave
that way it could be slow and and but
it's generating the money but for the
new product development they're going to
get killed unless they're agile so when
they when they make that agile it needs
to be a completely different
organization with different rules and
different procedures because the old
thing is like Windows OS and the new one
is like Mac OS and if you execute a
Windows API call against the Mac OS it
doesn't work and getting people to
separate this in their mind is really
challenging yeah I wait I went to a to
Stack Overflow and I looked up okay
what's going on with Windows programmers
trying to go to Mac well you know the
back frameworks a very different way of
thinking and if you don't get that
different way of thinking
you're constantly struggling and also if
you're trying to write MFC style code on
a Mac your app looks really bad and
people think it sucks so we have a lot
of agile implementations out there that
suck because it's a similar kind of
thing and if you can actually get in the
new mindset it's amazingly fast okay and
the same thing is true about scrum so
trying to educate the leadership about
that is challenging there are companies
that are doing this pretty well GE
decided hey we need a billion dollar
startup they started up and in three
million in three years it had a billion
dollars worth of revenue that's a pretty
good startup they have a practice called
fast works they have thousands of fast
works projects based on lean startup and
if one of those product if one of those
projects run it runs into a bureaucratic
problem the CEO comes down and crushes
the bureaucracy okay that's real
leadership
and very few companies seem to be able
to do that in fact most companies when
they're starting off they implement what
we call fragile ok you developers you
need to run faster ok
you do that over there we managers we're
going to be we're not going to do
anything different and we want all the
waterfall reports we want to know what's
going to meet the dates just run twice
as fast how many you're in how many are
in fragile fragile companies right now
we've got a lot of them here in
Amsterdam right how's that working for
you guys these are the ones that you
know go off the rails you know we've got
new managers come into these cut you
know management tends to change every
six months you get a new manager comes
in you know if it's fragile to start
with you get another waterfall manager
I've seen the band scrum that's what
happened in myspace the new leadership
band scrum all the best people jump ship
and myspace immediately went into the
doomed category right so watch out for
that there's been a lot of work and I
have a background I'll be talking about
later as a fighter pilot and also many
years in healthcare as a professor in a
medical school over 11 years so I've
done a lot of research on safety patient
safety and flight safety and the
research shows that the companies that
really kill a lot of people are the
pathological companies they're the ones
where people are hoarding information to
themselves not sharing lots of fear and
threats and if anything bad happens they
look for escape
somebody to blame ok I want to ask you
how many of you are in those companies
most of the companies try to implement
scrum initially are big bureaucracies
they want to protect the departments
protect their turf
everybody has to follow the rules if you
break a rule then you're going to got to
be brought to justice the companies that
work in terms of safety health care and
flying are the ones that are called
generative organizations they're focused
on the mission they're focused on
performance when things break down they
look at issues within the system they
systematically fix them they get better
and better so becoming a generative
organization is the key one of the keys
to scaling scrum and recently as we
begun to diagram organizations here's a
diagram from a recent paper of teams
with dependencies I happen to know it's
not in the paper I happen to know this
this is Skype they're getting better but
at the time that this this was worked
out
they couldn't deliver anything in less
than seven months make a one-line code
change and take months and get to get
anything shipped we're finding you know
we've always known we've had spaghetti
code it was bad thing but now we're
finding at least you can fix spaghetti
code but now we're finding that the
spaghetti organizations are even worse
and until you straighten those out you
can't even get at the spaghetti code
it's a mess out there the other thing is
many of the companies we work with are
driven by compliance you know if you're
building a medical device you have got
to be FDA compliant and so forth and
people think that they can you know it's
again it's the windows API forces
certain rules and they're different than
the Mac OS and so we have to go in work
with the compliance people say hey you
need to lead it totally differently in
fact you need to lead the agile
transformation by making compliance
agile how would you do your traceability
in your documentation in an agile way
recently one of the companies that
work with the compliance team says we
needed to do test-first development that
will give us better traceability and
everybody in the bureaucracies oh we
could never do that
the burocracy is trying to stop it
before they you can even think about
being agile it's mind boggling what's
going on out there but some companies
are able to make a transition and when
they do they turn this management
hierarchy sideways and the managers
become leaders as we see it Spotify
salesforce.com
the teams are self managing driving
towards the product owner and the
managers are supporting the teams okay
and the managers help refactor the
organization because to build good
applications you need to refactor them
constantly and the same thing is true of
the organization that's a new concept
for a lot of managers so managers need
to become leaders to be appraised at
CMMI level five we don't have a role in
the scrum guide for managers but we had
to have one for the CMI appraisers and
this is it they need challenging goals a
business plan that works they need to
identify and remove the impediments that
the teams are coming up with they need
to hold the product owners accountable
for delivering revenue when the scrum
master is accountable for process
improvement now it's really interesting
out there some companies have no
management today billion-dollar
companies companies like valve a big
gaming company Morningstar's a food
processing company Zappos many of you
have heard about Gore grinder the state
of Washington the CIO of Washington
wrote a constitution where he gave up
all his power to the people but that's
probably way off in the future for most
of you it's a really interesting
development going on
what we are seeing and try forcus is
evolving this way it's very interesting
is that organizations are becoming
smaller 50 to 150 broken up into pieces
and then federated if you want you know
multi-billion dollar companies and
professor Tanaka who came up with a term
scrum which scrum is based on writes a
lot about that in his books so there's a
few secrets to agile performance that a
lot of managers don't get you know
scaling down rat not up would be a
really smart thing if you we have teams
where eight people have done more
production software than 400 people at
Microsoft so maybe we could scale down
to eight instead of hiring 400 right if
you could do that that would be a lot
better scale out not up in our hardware
practice Joe justice has a nonprofit
wikispeed and they build cars and when
we express and the way they scale is
they get a shipping container with a
build team they build the car if they
need to build 200 they have 200 shipping
containers they don't create assembly
lines that's the old way of doing it the
other thing we're seeing is really
helpful is is the idea of scaling in not
out so what we do is we create a backlog
for the company and break it down into a
portfolio and then we say okay let's
form the teams around this backlog where
the company's going let the company's
self organize itself into teams it's
going to drive the backlog the key to
getting scrum implemented well we're
finding is a leadership action team
if you look at the data on agile today
you'll see this is the latest data got
just the last couple of weeks the
Standish group gave me their data it's a
summary data for the last five years for
over 50,000 projects and what it shows
is that the waterfall success rate is
11% and agile is 39% much better almost
four times better now the total failure
rate
nothing ever delivered complete disaster
is 29% in waterfall 9% in agile we still
have some of them going off the rails
but the interesting thing to me is 52%
of agile teams can't deliver software
on-time on-budget make the customer
happy
so 52 plus 9 that that's 61 percent of
people saying they're agile don't have
working software and that's the second
value in the Nu agile manifesto so we've
got some real problems out there and in
order to fix them if you have a big
company trying to use scrum the
leadership needs to help and they need
to have a leadership action team that
that takes in all the information
particularly the impediments flowing up
from the teams and then generates
actions that transforms the company and
they need to aggressively be doing that
constantly and the best model or the
best image lately and on how to think
about that is general McChrystal's book
JJ will be talking this afternoon was
asked to help with that book we were
losing the war in Iraq because the
escalation of terrorists instance was
just going out of sight and the army had
already changed into teams you know they
had Special Forces teams SEAL Teams
intelligence teams but at what they were
losing but then they figured out they
had to have a
of teams cross-functional teams linked
together where the leadership team is
cross-functional as well and there have
people either on these teams or directly
connected so you have a mesh and only
then could they get all the intelligence
from all the different agencies in one
room where they have the seals and the
Special Forces and within the hour
execute and then the terrorist incidents
went right down the war turned around
and then particularly the intelligence
organization said oh this sharing thing
this is this is too much we need to go
to back to our bureaucratic silos so you
know waiting around the u.s. for the
next catastrophe because they went back
to totally broken again so the
leadership action team has to stay on
top of this day and night forever or the
organization will self-destruct I don't
know what it is human nature is
something sometimes we call this an
agile transition team but it but it
really needs to be an ongoing team the
best some of the best implementations of
this I've seen I mentioned the meta
scope I'll talk about that in a minute
but the main thing the leadership action
team needs to deal with is impediments
floating up they need to execute against
them and most companies the middle
management layer blocks that so at John
Deere which builds agricultural
equipment and has achieved a really high
performance 800 percent improvement in
production of hardware with scrum their
leadership action team if there's a
scrum master that doesn't get a
impediment for them to fix for more than
three Sprint's they replace the scrum
master so that's an aggressive
leadership action team and so that that
that cracks through all the nonsense
within the organization but the meta
scrum is a way to operationalize this
many of our venture groups do this on a
weekly basis
the product owner leaves the meeting the
senior management's there the CEO is
like the scrum master the meeting they
go out they review where is the company
on their Sprint's where are they heading
what are the problems what are the
technical problems what's the Newmarket
issues what about the new contracts
given all that how will they how will
they steer the scrum in plantations and
all the impediments are flushed out and
the CEO makes sure by the 5:00 o'clock
that day they're all gone including
changing the management works really
well highly recommended so here's the
kind of things the leadership action
teams how many people have too many
projects going on at once I think most
of you that are not raising your hand
probably just don't want to raise your
hand how many have everything top
priority how many have managers who
don't understand scrum how many have
leadership that's worried about their
job you know might change
you know fear scrum how many don't have
continuous integration or automated
testing
nobody's admitted sometimes the coaches
are not surfacing impediment sometimes
the management or not we waste so the
leadership action team needs to crush
all this that's their job it's things
that you need to get rid of like
reporting get rid of timesheets every
time I'm CTO the my first act eight
o'clock the first day I show up I
abolish timesheets hire four teams
I can't tell you how many HR teams have
told me you know we try to hire these
really smart developers we thought that
you know they just sat in the cube and
you see you slid food under the door and
they never had to come out and talk to
anybody but oh now I now you want them
to be able to talk to someone okay we
can hire those kind of people just as
easily the ones that can't talk job
descriptions need to change focusing on
cross functionality and team
contribution we rewards reward team
performance performance appraisals get
rid of them Google doesn't have them and
they are winning what why do you have
them spaced all these things need to
change so leadership needs to reorganize
and reorient the company in significant
ways they need to deploy aggressive
scrum I wish I just came from Germany
they said in Germany the agile guys I'll
say it means developers can do whatever
they want so I showed him this picture
what if these guys do whatever they want
they're never going to get anywhere and
the faster they go the more resistance
there is so the guy in front has got to
be cutting through that resistance and
working harder than anyone else
that's the scrum master and if the scrum
master gets tired he needs to peel off
and get at the back of the line and
someone else needs to come up
that's agile means going fast some teams
seem to forget that so we're doing a lot
of work on scaling and we're doing a
webinar next week and we're starting to
do two days scaling courses in Boston
Palo Alto Stockholm in the next few
months and so those are some of my
thoughts about the big problems in agile
land and I hope this gives you some
thoughts how many managers do we have
here and the
rooms we have any managers not so many
so you developers you're going to have
to go back you got to have to sit down
with your management team that's it make
some recommendations on what they should
do okay well thanks for your attention
and I think it's time to move on to the
tracks and I hope you have a great
two-day session here go to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
