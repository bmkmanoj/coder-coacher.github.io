thing what am I talking about like I
said we need to be faster and cheaper
and safer but why is that and it really
comes down to this quote for a runner in
2006 about the way that amazon.com was
organizing itself then and the way the
AWS organized and this is one of the
things that Netflix adopted as a themes
like okay they had to do cloud well with
your copier you know the Amazon
architecture that's what we're trying to
do in 2008 2009 and we took this to
heart so that basically means that if
you built the code you own the code in
production you're a call for the code in
production and this is what this is the
change really from running projects
which a lot of enterprises do you have a
pre former project team and you work for
nine months to get SI p upgraded and
then you throw it over the water
operations and go work on something
completely different for the next year
all right and as the ownership is sort
of hand it over to operation so if you
have that kind of hand over your
typically doing project based
development the the change than the way
that a lot of people out of startups
work and a lot in the way that a lot of
web-scale companies work is much more
product based to own the product and if
you divide the product into lots of
different microservices then you own
your micro service and maybe down to the
individual developer that built this
service because the how big should a
micro service be one of the answers is
if it fits in James Lewis his head
because he's got fairly large head but
that's the sort of it means one
developer can understand everything the
service does that's about the right size
if it takes too many people to
understand it then they start colliding
on each other as they want to modify it
so it sort of break it down into Chum
so one developer mind at a time and
you've got your building a system out of
lots of micro services where everyone
owns it and you own the evolution of it
it's very hard to get locked in and
you're not throwing things over the
water operations but you need platforms
into link to support you so there's
there's a different setup there's
different tolling when you work in this
way but really what we're talking about
here is that you own pieces of the
product and the only quality and the SLA
s to your customers and you built your
organization is built a set of
producer-consumer relationships and to
end where each of those steps is is
under the lambda contact with its own
set of micro services so when you're in
that transitional state the developers
have the response of responsibilities
and one of those responsibilities is
while we're trying to go fast every want
to release the code as many times a day
as makes sense and because I'm just
controlling this one piece I don't have
to coordinate with anyone else to
re-release my micro service I can do it
as often as I want as long as I don't
break my API and I can have testing to
make sure that I didn't go anything
incompatible so I can change the
internals of my micro servers
continuously this is one way we get to
continuous delivery and quite often you
know if you do a day's worth of coding
you'll check in at the end of the day
and it will be in production you know
overnight by the next morning it will be
gone through tests and being productive
so what we're looking at here then is
you know this is DevOps and that the
developers are now operating their
systems they're doing continuous
delivery getting your code into
production you don't have meetings
there's maybe a tracking ticket but
there's no permissions tickets you're
not asking for permission you're not
going through any more than maybe a code
review with somebody else in your team
right so when you're in that kind of
environment it's very low friction for
getting things out and this is the
agility that a lot of people are now
looking for and but you need a lot of
self-service tools and everything being
ap
driven once you create the eyes you find
the tooling appears because developers
hate doing things twice they'll write
code to do it ultimate and automatically
so as soon as you get to an API driven
infrastructure you will end up with a
platform just because developers
naturally develop things to do that
whereas if you sort of have the
operations mindset you end up with run
books where everyone has to follow the
process and file tickets so we're trying
to move away from that you can kind of
measure your maturity along this path by
looking at for every release that you do
currently how many tickets are there and
how many meetings are there per release
right collect that as a metric publish
it somewhere as a graph and try and make
it go down right and the further you go
down the faster you get right so there's
all sort of chart of how long it takes
to get a release out versus how many
meetings and tickets are there's a very
good talk by Phil Phil casado is it from
SoundCloud see here I think he was going
to be here if he did have paper a blog
post on how they sped up everything in
soundcloud came out last week really
interesting sort of said their release
process was near whatever 90mm 60 days
or something or 90 days from an idea to
hitting production and they gradually
just took more and more steps out of the
process until it was very automated so
what we end up doing then is each
developer makes one change and then puts
that into production immediately and the
tool names have put something in
production now with bits of docker and
and writing coding go and the sort of
extra current technology that people are
using is that your build time is a few
seconds maybe less than a second for a
microt service and the time it takes to
put that in a container is less on a
second and the time taken to test it is
a few seconds the time taken to put that
production is a few seconds so your
delivery pipeline is maybe less than a
minute it's a plausible thing to do some
analysis of the lifetime of docker
containers
new relic showed that the most common
lifetime for a docker container is one
minute right the second most common
lifetime is 0 minutes and then there was
a long way to have is that less than a
minute they just had one minute
resolution so these containers were
appearing and disappearing in less than
a minute and then there was a way way
way lower there was one of stuff along
the axis that was stuff that last longer
than that so this is a very different
kind of work clothes and you know going
to the data center and racking up a
machine that's going to sit there for
three years when you've got machines the
instances pieces of code which are
living through a very short time spans
those are basically test environments
that have been created and destroyed
very quickly but what you're really
doing here is you're changing one thing
at a time as you put stuff into
production and if that one change you
made broke it's very clear that you
broke it it happened then it's this
change the brocade you don't have to go
and figure out which of the hundred
changes in this release interacted which
of the other hundred changes and who was
responsible for it and it takes much
longer to debug the more things you put
in a release so going faster means it's
easier to debug and quicker to roll back
and safer to try things out so there's
this whole speed up where the faster you
go the smaller changes you make the
faster you go and the fewer failures you
get sub virtuous circle and if you ever
get your pic QA team saying we need more
time for the to test this release you
ever heard that anyone ever
creating it so the response should be ok
we're going to release more often right
not we're going to give you more time
we're going to release more often and
they'll be less in each release right so
we released twice as often this half as
much stuff to test and you will find
that it's less complex and you can
disambiguate the problems right down to
continuous delivery where you're
releasing releasing and testing everyone
in parallel right so that's that's what
happens so so we're giving everyone the
freedom to release all the time but now
you're responsible for it and this is
kind of the netflix culture sort of
summary from that fiscal today a freedom
responsibility culture we gave everybody
root password but you better be careful
what you do with it right one of the
responsibilities then is how much does
it cost to run this thing in production
if you can you guess you can start a
thousand machines and Eve them running
for three weeks doing nothing but that's
not responsible so how do you run
systems in a way which is efficient and
that the several parts of that part is
the development process the lean
development process is to try things out
but fail early fail early and often the
instrument everything so you can see
whether things are working on now you
don't hypothesis driven development if
you look read the Lean Enterprise book
there's a lot in there about hypothesis
driven development this is the way
pretty much everything at Netflix is
hypothesis driven development you know
whether the idea you had worked so if
you take a hundred ideas and you divide
them into thirds the third of them would
be great ideas that will make the
product better a third of them will have
no measurable impact at all and a third
of them will make it worse right that's
just averages right the thing is you
don't know which thirds which and if you
are betray pick well these are the
winners and I'm not going to try the
other two-thirds you find this only
maybe a third of the
you kept will cook there's a large
number of counterintuitive things and
it's very surprising when you actually
get to a hypothesis driven development
how many times your initial hypothesis
is completely backwards you know I
thought this was going to make it better
it makes it dramatically worse all right
well this thing yeah well just let we'll
try this but we're pretty sure it's not
going to work oh crap that was a huge
win right that happens all the time and
you have to keep remaking these
hypotheses and trying to understand why
things happen the way they do so other
ways you can gain efficiency if you look
at what's happened over the last decade
as we went from individual machines to
virtualizing machines what
virtualization did resist study to
consolidate all the CPU power so your
machines got busier but your memory
footprint Shrek a little bit right you
still have the full footprint of every
application when you look going to
containers you're actually doing a
little bit more CPU consolidation
because you can / subscribe the CPUs but
you're also avoiding duplicating or the
operating systems so you're saving
memory there but the biggest thing is
that if you can start an entire
application in a few seconds and run it
for a minute and shut it down again
you're actually time slicing resources
so the number of in your test
environment you need many fewer machines
so it gets it's a much more efficient
way to run test environments because the
same set of you know virtual machines
that supports your test environment is
not locked down to be running things for
a long period of time you're throwing
lots and lots and lots of tests into it
and at night when everyone goes home
those tests aren't running and you shut
the machines down so you get a lot of
the savings come from consolidating and
time slicing the ability to turn things
up so this this is a one of the reasons
that we see docker container of using
containers really getting a lot of
adoption in enterprises because they
solved some of the big problems that
large shops have the other thing is to
ortho scale production to consume just
the resources you need and to netflix on
a mis with the amazon
scalar was doing this by the hour right
so every hour they would predict how
many machines they needed for the next
hour and they would scale up or down but
the the work they're currently going on
at Netflix they built a measle scheduler
which takes an underlying set of
machines that are scaling up and down by
the hour and they're running docker
containers in it that are scaling up and
down by the second so they've got a
two-level water scaling scheduler
they're working on that so Colin's going
to talk a bit about how Netflix operates
efficiently at scale tomorrow and you
know there's a lot of different things I
do there but this the idea that you're
just turning everything off is how you
run very very efficiently and then how
do we wrote more safely how do we how do
we become more rugged and you don't to
say unbreakable or secure because you
know nothing is unbreakable or secure
but if you have an iPhone it's not in a
case in you drop it it's going to break
right if you put in a rubber case it's
more rugged and then we'll rugged the
case you could drive some thinking if
some of these cases are designed to be
driven over pretty much right it's still
you're just incrementally making it
stronger and making it more rugged so
think of it in those terms so what can
developers do about the fact that you
know we're there is an increasing level
of threat happening you know it's not
going to go away it's not something that
you can pass over to operators and say
take my insecure application wrap it in
a security blanket firewall that
everything will be okay those don't work
right you have to embed security into
your system and you've got external
threat so you need to be using
penetration test tools talking about
that this afternoon you need to manage
your image supply chain something that
joshua has been deeply involved in you
know the the what's the provenance where
do where does everything come from how
do you know it's a good thing you need
to build hardened services that are
immutable if all of your the date the
code that you put on a machine is
read-only on this you know then it's
harder to get in there and mess with it
if somebody breaks into a system and you
need to understand how to use roles and
security groups and various ways of
providing detailed permission to things
so those are sort of protecting these
external threats but there's also
internal threats you have to assume that
every key person in your company could
have a compromise laptop with a low key
logger and and you know somebody from
you know some country that wants your
secrets feeling everything out of it so
you have to assume that which means that
you need to help people in roles that
have minimum privilege and manage that
you need audit logs for everything that
happens and this gets easier to do in
the cloud if you're actually having sort
of arguments about you know can
governance and auditing how do you do
that in the cloud there's the governance
and auditing people in your company
should be the first people that want to
create in a cloud because everything can
be completely audited in the cloud
you've got a strong assertion that
everything that happened in this account
you know it was in the data center when
you kind of know it but who here has a
cmdb that's fully trustworthy it doesn't
exist it sort of CMD bees aren't even
eventually consistent than never
consistent okay right whereas if you
look at you know AWS cloud trailer or or
the netflix ido service it you know it's
a consistent view of exactly the current
state of your system in the history of
it the other thing is just to encrypt
data at rest you have to use keys
carefully you have to understand the
root of trust where do you get your keys
from because if you did your keys laying
around you get compromised I think I
heard that if you if you check some code
into github a project into github with
an AWS key in it I think it's ten
minutes till that your system is
Bitcoin or something right it's about a
10 minute lag from you checking a key in
until being compromised nap right so
from an arbitrary check-in so what this
comes down to something Jerry Chen who
has developed a defined infrastructure
and that's kind of the theme for this
conference these concerns are becoming
developer concerns now there's and
there's another operable conference next
week more operated focus but the what
the operations concerns are how do you
build platforms to support the
developers to do that but today then
this this week thinking about how do we
build applications with these new
concerns baked into the application tier
and what we need from the platforms and
the components that we build us out of
all right so thanks everyone for coming
I think we're just about running a
little bit late but not to just about on
time
