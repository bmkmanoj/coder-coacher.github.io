stuff that I talked about yeah it sounds
really strange and it sounded really
strange four or five years ago when we
started doing it and I will admit that a
lot of the stuff I'm talking about is
not stuff that I invented my claim to
invention is naming it the horrible sort
of you know negative name of Anarchy and
I'm trying to work my way around that
name a little bit because we talk to a
CEOs Anarchy is not a word you like to
use they're a River targeted to somebody
the Anarchy names been inspired by Kent
Beck who called it extreme programming
and back when I was trying to be a
consultant in programming and sort of
trying to do some bad stuff I learned
very quickly you don't go to go to them
and say we're going to extreme
programming they're already scared of
programmers extreme programmers yeah
these are either animals you don't want
to hire so but you know it got popular
and we came back to give it a bland name
called agile so I'm sure there's another
name coming one these days if it
actually catches on but anarchy was
deliberately sort of controversial you
know in-your-face sort of name partly
because the company I was working for
the time we're in London we're
recruiting against Google we're crew
negates banks will pay twice as much for
a programmer because after I C++ and
you're sort of trying to find the best
and brightest to come join us and a lot
of the messages here we're actually
describing how he actually worked and
the in Turkey sort of get them in the
room so it looks like it worked pretty
well we got some people in the room so
one of these is this actually is all
very practical pragmatic sort of
approaches these are things that have
experienced and and I'll try to
distinguish things I think versus things
I've experienced but most of the things
I've talked about are things we've
experienced and I am done it starts out
with a company to call forward which was
a little a software development company
that was actually into product space
they were doing Google advertising
originally and then wound up doing you
know browser plugins and e-commerce they
cornered the market and parrot cages in
the UK just all sorts of weird things we
want to take advantage of and I kind of
follow that up with some work at all
right click should work the daily at the
mail Daily Mail which is called the mail
online with your online version if you
don't know this newspaper is the most
pocket
newspaper in the world online newspaper
if you want know what Kim Kardashian is
wearing today this is where you go it is
absolutely tabloid news but we we act
but interesting about this company was
it was it started in 1870 or 1880
something like that so it's a really
really old company is run by Lord
Rothermere the fourth Lord Rothermere of
his title so it's a conservative and
yeah it's been this business a long long
time and so bringing in something like
this strange process I'm talking about
to this sort of company sort of sets
another point here's a startup call
forward here's a company that's been in
business over a hundred and twenty years
more recently I'm actually working at a
in a California Silicon Valley startup
called outpace and kind of bringing in
all these same ideas to the table
they're innocent presentations actors
one next door it right now but young
lady it works first in outpace you saw a
presentation perhaps on yesterday
yesterday morning about you know remote
pairing that's something coming out of
space as well so these are practical
experiences of these sort companies
first thing to realize is agile is
basically a social change as I try to do
agile transformations programmers stuff
is kind of we get to write more code
it's kind of fun we get to do other
things it's kind of fun but the rest
organization it can be a massive social
change and the problem is basically if
you get to its c-level executives
understand there's a social change
coming they get it but all those middle
managers they don't they're risk-averse
in general it's very hard to get them to
do that and so your result is you get a
lot of half-baked agile projects going
out there you get into an agile space
you try to do something and you do
something spectacular and then it's not
replicated I mean they try to kill it
you know somebody wakes up it says no we
can't do that anymore you have to almost
get to the C levels make it happen and
understand as a social change in the
first place it's sort of a little story
around this stuff it sort of motivate
some of the things that are different
about programmer anarchy is something I
call story tyranny and the sort of story
goes like this
that you have a development organization
it's agile things are driven by stories
stories are really small priority was
set by the customer and basically
everything is about stories estimating
and schedules and who
showing what it's all about stories
sounds like agile nirvana but as we are
doing this with a more more mature agile
organization what we really discovered
was the programmers felt like they were
drones they're subject to the whims of
the customers sort of saying what they
need to do and with the customer not
really understanding the complexity what
we're trying to accomplish and so you
know one of the things we're trying to
address with this different sort of
organizational structure and thinking
was that it sort of kept it very nicely
by what I call a requirements hierarchy
this was inspired by one of my
colleagues back in my thought works days
quite a few years ago now where you sort
of talk about there's a requirements
hierarchy you know stories kind of
represent the fourth level you can
certainly drill down into stories in the
tasks you might roll stories up into
things you might call features or
whatever or projects and then overall
business initiatives so you take almost
everything you're working on in an agile
environment trace it back through this
hierarchy which turns out to be a huge
advantage of doing Sox compliance stuff
because traceability is huge in Sox and
agile kind of just nails it but you know
this is the level of interaction that
you know Kent Beck talks about in doing
and the scrum guys talk about
interacting with the customer at the
story level I tell you though is I go
into consultant agile you see a lot of
organizations that sort of micromanage
it all of a sudden L they're having
stand-ups and talking about what tasks
you're working on and why it says TAS
not finished and you're tracking these
tasks and who's working on these tasks I
certainly found that at the Daily Mail
when I arrived but it turns out you're
more much more efficient and this is
what we were doing it forward by moving
it up to this level we want to interact
with a customer at a feature level what
do you want to accomplish and now get
the hell out of our way because trust me
I don't know how to get this thing done
the best don't need to sort of
micromanage me do it get out of that
business tell me what you try to
accomplish I'll come and ask you
questions when I need more information
but I know how to get the software out
the door and stop trying to micromanage
me around that that's a pretty radical
change in the organization it requires a
lot of additional trust on behalf of
your customers to make that happen but
that's one our key differences so in the
agile space you basically have you know
three major types of roles I've been
talking about agile for
for a long time now and you sort of have
different roles associated these parts
of the triangle you can't things like
project managers iteration managers up
at that point in and you sort of have
the business guys the customers the BAS
and I put a QA over here because QA
basically is at the business level
writing acceptance test unit tests are
done by the programmers but the
acceptance test is much more story level
things I stick them over there then you
have all these developers sitting here
with lots of different titles architects
and DBAs and and UX experts and we did a
pretty good job through the agile years
basically sort of wiping all those
titles out replace it with one called
developer but those are sort of the
roles were kind of left over it with
it's sort of if you're really you know
top-notch agile shop so let's look at
what the roles are in anarchy so you
sort of have the customer the project
manager the BA the developer and some
sort of QA / testers so in Anarchy we
have these roles and we kill these
others and we'll go through why these
get killed in particular one we kill
this so now on the list is this one we
kill the manager of the programmers yes
this is hopefully I fit some of these
radicals ideas sort of yes good yes this
is very strange so basically you're back
to a triangle only has two points in it
which is kind of interesting so what
happens to some of these roles well you
look at the QA role and you look at what
QA has to do now I've grew up in the
environment where QA were guys who
basically clicked on screens or even
before that you know put put decks and
punch cards in to try to break your
program because they weren't good enough
to be programmers you made them QA I
mean that's how it was back in the 70s
and we into the 80s but you look at
today you look at the tools you have to
have to be a good QA and you see
programming tools you see some lady arms
you see cucumbers you seek very complex
architectures they have to test the gate
so you have to almost understand the
architectural system so you sort of say
okay let's see this they have to write
code and they have to understand
architecture what's the dirt between you
and a programmer and simply was kind of
wave their hands about oh they think
differently no I don't buy that
I think it's basically the same skills
so to some degree you get over that plus
the OL idea of acceptance testing it's
kind of going away because that's a
one-time shot as you get ready to deploy
but our systems are running in live
environments with dependent services all
over the place you need to move to an
active monitoring thing you may use the
same tools to build it but you need to
have a system that's being constantly
tested itself live in production to see
if things are still working or not
so the concept of sort of writing this
test one time and then passing it over
and saying you know I can deploy it
would be really safe not anywhere true
anymore at all not for complex systems
so the QA kind of goes away favor of
just developers picking up a
responsibility because it's the same
skills all right so let's hit the let's
see next one's maybe BA oh good one so
here's the BA right the BA is a person
that basically is going to tell the
programmer what he needs to do and the
program has a question they'll answer it
that's what BJ's do but you look at what
they're really doing they're listening
to the customer the real guy who knows
and repeating it and we ask you a
question they run off and ask that
question to give you the answer okay why
are they there again well the answer
you'll hear from the bas is well this is
your domain is too complicated for
programmers you can't possibly
understand accounting it's like dude you
want to swap jobs you understand closure
I'll swap with you any day you think
your domains more complicated our world
no we have we're perfectly capable
understand your domain concepts explain
them to us or we can't talk for some
reason they feel we don't have to be
educational skills yeah well whatever we
can talk we like the social skills ok
smell whatever it may be
yes oh but hey you know you got the Big
Bang Theory you got Sheldon we got role
models out there we're kind of accepted
for who we are now we don't have to hide
anymore so basically you get rid of this
guy because it's just playing that game
of telephone
he doesn't really provide a lot of value
I want to know from the customer what
are you really trying to accomplish I
don't need this intermediary guy set
between us let's talk to the real guys
so that's the VA kind of disappeared in
our environment all right click will
click IQ all right so let's go on I
think the next one is iteration manager
that's a time established role that is
completely made up by thought works as a
guy named Josh progression Mackenzie I
think he was out of Canada and for one
of the early thought works projects
thought we wanted to put their own
project manager in place to manage the
agile process and the customer in this
mind said i have project managers i'll
really hire your guy and it went around
a little bit and Josh finally hit upon
this oh it's not a project manager he's
an iteration manager it's way different
of course it's not different it's the
same thing but these got another roll in
there so you can sort of recognize that
that role is kind of like there anyway
you get back to ok what happened to the
manager where's that project manager
going well manager is kind of an
overloaded term meaning the actually
these guys are supposed to do lots of
different things so you'd go back to
tease out these things in fact one of
the things I did it thought works in my
last days if all works was have a
seminar about let's sort of identify all
the things a manager is supposed to do
and let's see if we can't find somebody
else to do those sort of things so if
you go back to Ken Beck's original book
about extreme programming he doesn't
have the concept of a manager in there
he has a concept of a clerk this is a
guy keeps tracking stories he calls him
a clerk 19 eration manager or some other
high balloon time he's a clerk because
that's all you're really doing and he
says it's not a very big job so we got
that clerk roll you also have a
leadership you're supposed to be the
leader if you're the manager but are you
really a natural leader of groups I've
certainly baited organizations with the
guy who really understands what's going
on can really pull the team together
it's one of the developers not
necessarily the guy who to designate the
manager so he's not necessarily a true
leader of a group either ambassador this
is a fancy term I like to put in place
because this is the guy could talk to
other people his job is to go talk to
other people and understand what their
needs are and negotiate the things you
need from them he's an ambassador
I like Conan get an ambassador because
he's not responsible for making
decisions on behalf of the team
ambassadors don't do that
they represent the team's interest if
your power to go make some decisions in
an ambassador by the team but if
something is outside of those framers
you come back to the team you discuss it
but you don't make decisions on behalf
of the team you don't give in to
schedules on their behalf you don't
commit technologies you don't commit to
dates don't do any of that stuff he's an
ambassador and you know some people are
better at that going to customers the
saying no and negotiating that stuff but
it's a role then you have sort of the
concept of a coaching and I certainly
grew up in IBM I did 17 years in IBM my
early days and management was trained to
be really good coaches you know I'm the
guy it could help you understand how to
be a better programmer because I was a
programmer myself and that's how you
promote an idea but in general the
manager is the guy you would look to it
would learn how to be a better closure
programmer or introduce yourself to that
technology that's really not his
expertise it's not where he needs to
spend his time so you want to find
somebody else playing that role if I is
one of the role that you kind of don't
like and well it's concierge so we talk
about concierge concierge is a guy who
works for you as a team and gets things
you need I need to do LAN adapter
concierge I need some check deposit
concierge
I need another type of resource
concierge he's there to service the team
he's working on your behalf and by the
way most good managers play that role
very nicely it's almost an almost
management inversion I'm there to work
for your team and we call that a
concierge different role and finally got
this power-hungry guy that's nice a a
role you'd like to have but
unfortunately that a lot of guys out
there who like the ability to tell you
what to do today or more importantly you
can't talk to him you have to talk
through me tell me your status I will
inform him of your status
he will then make the change because I
want to stand in the middle of this
conversation because it makes me
important and of course that's again I
roll it doesn't be played but you look
at these things you can sort of put a
team together that has these roles being
satisfied without being put in place and
manager or you can try to find a manager
who can do all these things especially
all the green ones and he's the best one
in the group to do all
the great ones good luck finding this
guy right that job description to try to
fill it very hard to do so we got rid of
that role as well in this environment so
that gets me down to basically there's
two roles to my triangle you either
understand some domain stuff and need it
done or you are developer and it can
make it happen those two roles survived
so that's what happened to the roles
just how successful this is of course
being anarchists themselves the four
guys had their own website not to trust
the rest of the company to do their
website one of the things they published
was how frequently they're producing
code and shipping it out they just
basically pull the github statistics
live put it on their own website the
arithmetic here I've been a while since
did this arithmetic but somewhere
between there's basically pushing
something new to production every
between three and five minutes all the
time during a 40-hour work week they got
really really fast and there's some
degrees the reason the reason we this
Anarchy process came out was because
they wanted to go faster and so he
started killing rolls and killing
permission systems and killing all sorts
of other things in order to go faster
and probably these things up like with
DevOps and other operations tricks to
sort of make sure that they went faster
safely and it kind of evolved into this
and again I just plant the name on it
anarchy because that's what it kind of
looks like some examples from from
forward we we have a system that was
written in a dotnet technology old sis
was net it was basically a system that
was providing all the money for one of
our major businesses it was energy
switching in the UK you can switch
energy plans and say where you switch
cell phone plants here you can get new
energy company in and getting you
electricity or natural gas from those
other sources so existing system was
dotnet in sequel server and I got a
business degree and business degree
basically told us really quick unknown
certainty that ok try one new technology
a new project maybe try to of you're
really feeling bold but be really
careful anything more than that you will
die it's just too much risk so we
decided we need to rewrite the system
and we just that we rewrite it in close
your ruby c++ nodejs and our
we would use my sequined MongoDB and a
whole new system for seeing CSS and it
worked fine this is what the programmers
chose to do it in and they delivered in
fact the subsidiaries been sold actually
companies beyond been sold off by
forward everybody got a really really
nice payday out of that it's a massively
successful again business school says
don't try this programmers turn Lou said
this is what we want to do nobody was
there to say no it actually worked
really really well another example from
that same project
oh we were running a ruby calculation on
trying to find the best energy plan by
law literally by law we have to provide
the right energy plan for that customer
in the order in which it makes sense for
the customer regardless of our personal
profits associated with those choices
and we do that but it involves actually
understand your energy history what
postal code you live in because
different plans and different providers
have different rates in different parts
of the country looking in all the rate
plans for all the providers that we
provide access to whether we can make
Commission's or not putting all that
data together churning it out coming out
with the answer for you we worth that in
Ruby and it was a you know we used to be
scattered throughout the entire net
structure I mean what some was in the
app server son was in the web server
some was in back to the database server
some was in some stored procedures
associated with that it was scattered to
the four winds we consolidate that in
one place so we could actually make it
work it was working so when the
programmers do they rewrote it in
closure because old closure looks cool
let's try closure and they actually
turned out to be a little smaller
enclosure and it was like yeah this is
kind of nice so what they do then they
run it again in closure because lo well
and now I understand closure let's do it
again now question what managing your
right mind will let these guys take
something you're trying to rewrite the
entire application they wrote it in Ruby
it works fine the written closure it
works okay fine
everybody getting closure it's like give
me a break guys we've got the whole
thing to rewrite here what are you doing
so the manager let them do that so so
what manager will let them do that and
the hints there's no managers now it
turned out to be an amazingly bright
thing to do we got hit by bad
Jews in the UK basically energy prices
spiked and everybody's trying to change
the old net system it started to fall
over because it hadn't been stretched in
like two years so we started rerouting
the traffic to this calculator and it
was like running a one virtual machine
we put it over the calculator and they
just handled the traffic we put more
over there but we put a hundred percent
of traffic on this other new calculation
one virtual machine it handled
everything smoothly and in fact we made
a lot of money that way instead of
crashing our system so it's like wow
Berger has made a good call I would
personally have stopped them from doing
this if I had the power I didn't have
the power it's good thing Anarchy a
click tracking we don't think we're
making a lot of money on is Google ads
and tracking the Google ads so the old
system again Ruby based we had 32
different servers running about 40
percent utilization click tracking
clicks it's making us $300 profit a
minute running this system so one of the
guys do they want to rewrite it you're
like seriously dude rewrite it yeah
because we found this new language
called node let's try this out so they
try it out
Wow now it's only 22 servers utilization
is dropped in particular latency is
dropped and we get penalized for latency
problems in Google Ads
so it turned out this was a win win and
win at every level again anarchy in
action they have an idea that you want
to try it they try it out works fine so
you're getting a sample for what happens
when you turn programmers lose yes they
make mistakes but if you think about it
with all those other positions I've
eliminated and you replace those guys
with programmers you can have actually
half your programmers make mistakes
you're still ahead of the game
financially and you don't make mistakes
half the time they make some mistakes
but not that much so you know these are
the agile best practices you know list
it out and and good anarchy fashion
these are the ones that we you actually
use which is almost none of them for a
lot of different reasons
because our teams were co-located you
know the stand-ups the story narratives
which is you know big documents about
stories retrospectives estimates all
those stuff kind of went away we got
into the thing it says we care about
results
whole thing about you know who are you
working with and what's your iteration
plan and did you actually deliver the
code that's about a blame game
we don't play blame games we're looking
for making results we would like we
don't mind people making mistakes as
long as we're learning from them and
learning from them quickly
Perry mostly went away but they paired
really needed to again they can make
that decision but they're sitting next
to each other the whole thing about unit
testing acceptance testing refactoring
and patterns all disappearing because
frankly we moved into micro services
which is a whole other story of our
experiences in that space a micro
services where you know we've had some
sessions about that lately but very very
cool technology it killed a lot of the
processes but frankly these processes
are designed to build and maintain balls
of mud if you don't Billy balls and bud
a lot of these things become unnecessary
and we wipe them out
continuous integration that kind of went
away because they're doing continues to
employ whose time having to integrate
let's just deploy see what happens
fearless and that stuff and we make
mistakes we back it off again very
strange stuff alright but that was all
the startup which is called kind of nice
but what about a real environment you
know not a startup environment where you
get a chance to pick your programmers
and all sorts of other things so I I
left forward and a few months later I
was able to hook up with mail online
again a very good solar conservative
organization said all these things
already but I basically was okay bro
coming here and establish this software
process you talk about in this company
with this sorta conservative nature how
you're going to do that so that was my
challenge so basically what we decided
was this is what I found
delivery was about on three to six
months focus items so three six months
between delivery which was actually very
bad for this business because this
business was able to turn out a new
article within twenty minutes and get
online me the editorial process
associate with this company is
unbelievable twenty but within 20
minutes after I say I need an article
it's up there on the page no article
stays on the homepage more than six
hours before gets pulled we're talking
about you know the most aggressive agile
transforming you know publishing I've
ever seen in my life
stuck with this sort of software process
which is like you know we feel like we
got to save those guys because they're
doing such an Aurora job on the
unpublishing side we had specialists we
have front-end guides we have back in
guys we had designers and we had testers
they all sit in little groups they
pointed fingers at each other we had
scrum masters all the sorts of stuff we
had stories and literally I was washing
to cart story stand-up meetings it was
like what this task right here did you
work on this task today well I wanted to
take you to finish it they wrote all
this stuff down you're like wow I mean
how much time is being wasted just
talked about they mean 30 minute
stand-ups just going through task by
task and who stands on that stuff not a
happy place what I wanted to create was
you know something would get something a
major feature out within a month I
wanted to create this concept of polity
skilled workers I didn't want these
specialists anymore I want you to be a
competent in more than one thing I want
you to take a problem at this again the
feature level and be able to say this
parts database
this parts front-end this parts got
performance concerns
know where your limits are but certainly
be able to look at the problem carve it
up yourself instead of oh it's a
front-end problem do this part but you
have to worry about the backend I don't
know how that works for my hands up
we wanted to paly skilled workers we
would have some experts but the expert
is going to float around if I need
expertise in this area today that's
where you going to sit today if you need
it over here the next day you'll sit
over there
and basically try to put teams together
of eight five eight people make them sit
together we literally had tore down the
desk we tore out all the desk and all of
the little credenza associated with that
a little bit and put in literary tables
that would literally had no legs between
them you could sit anywhere you wanted
to we put various workstations up you
had no assigned seat again sort of
trying to break the mindset there so a
lot of that changed so I basically
changed about everything I could in that
environment we kill the titles you know
they have lots of titles in fact they
have almost more titles and people about
things and titles were just not
appropriate we changed their technology
stack although we did retraining with
new technology stacks and again we
attacked the official layout who ripped
out the desk and putting tables I do
kind of manage around this particular
model I mean it's a lot of different
names for it I call it master

if a prettiest is kind of a one
productivity a journeyman a guy really
understands what you're working on
incomes competence it's a two and
master's or anywhere from five to ten
times more productive I mean these are
guys you really really want to get on
your team and find and call it into a
cultivate Oh
in my experience then I do this in quite
a few places generally can probably take
somebody whose apprentice level skill in
two to six months get them almost twice
as productive with the right training
and experiences you know basically
on-the-job training if you focus on it
if they don't make the transition in six
months it's not happening they probably
should not be programmers they like the
conceptual skills they like something
else to make this happen there's almost
no telling how long it takes to become a
master if you ever make it generally a
lot of people will jump off from journey
move move into manager titles and other
things or call themselves architects
whether they maybe never actually try to
stay a programmer but those sort of
things can happen two years is pretty
fast cycle never is a lot more likely so
we took a very people focus because it's
not about a process it's not about you
know you know naming these things or
your artifacts is about a people process
so we took a very strong people focus
around this so we basically said I had
this hierarchy of masters journeyman
apprentice that I can really apply
against what I consider to be the key
skills I care about so these are the key
technologies we identified that were
important to the mail online we wanted
to keep the list down to maybe ten to
twelve if it got more than that a way to
rip something off and we had some you
know platform stuff around iOS and
Android comes need to work on those
platforms databases which spent sequel
and non sequel understand both of those
because you need to make trade-offs
between the two certainly big data we
have server-side JavaScript which is a
basically node job was on the list I
couldn't kill it first one I killed was
Java I couldn't kill that one for some
reason actually we killed Ruby and
replace it with closure which is
interesting story itself that's a side
story and we and some concept of
software delivery that you really
understand clouds you really understand
agile processes where you have some
understand testing again testing about I
want to kill as well then win that
argument but you could take everybody as
sort of say these are the key scale
and what level you stand on this on this
scale are you a master or a guy who just
really understands how to do things or
your journeyman which meant competent I
could use this technology I may not be
the best of the world but I use it I
don't screw things up I can work all day
and not just something really stupid
apprentice okay I just something stupid
so we actually went in there and put a
new HR process in place and I went to
the HR department in this conservative
company and says I want to change the
job titles I want to change how you
specify everything what do you expect
I'm going to get from a company like
this they loved it
I was equally surprised they loved it
because they've been in a battle with
programs forever about or you're a
senior associate programmer you're a
senior associate senior associate
programmer are you going junior
programmer
oh no I'm one of these because look at
all these criteria I meet one of these
why how am I getting paid like this guy
endless arguments with these guys they
get to wash their hands with this new
process they're like hey uh please throw
me this briar patch this is exactly what
everyone they loved it again I was
equally surprised as you were so we put
this in place we basically we climb to a
title developer a developer is somebody
who is confident in one of our key
technologies now if I take job off the
list I had a lot of developers who are
no longer developers which is why I
probably stay don't list or not everyone
quit quit but you know it's it was like
you know that's coming off the list they
said what happens comes the list well
you got some time to get another thing
on the list but you better start
worrying about it in other words they're
motivated to be self-learning which is a
very key aspect of this wheres rollcall
graduate developer which means I'm not
yet competent in technology now I don't
know why I would ever hire one of these
guys I mean even at a university you
should be at least competent in Java or
something I don't so we put it there
anyway it's free
I didn't really argue too much then you
have a senior developer which is a
master in one of the key technologies
this is a very traditional structure
this is kind of wait everybody once you
become a front-end developer your career
path has become a expert front-end
developer that's your career path in
most companies but we decide we want
something different we want to create a
concept called a systems developer
who basically was confident in anywhere
from five to seven of our key
technologies this is a poly skilled guy
this is a guy can give a problem to and
walk away knowing it will be addressed
these guys are extremely valuable to the
organization these guys do not fit in
traditional organizations in fact a lot
of our recruiting success in the mail
online business because guys were like
this and we're not acknowledged by the
organization you can be Poli skilled in
some of these organizations be sitting
in the front-end department have
something in the backend you think it's
wrong and they tell you to shut up which
is very demotivating and frustrating for
you and not good for the organization we
treasured these guys so we put these on
the same page you can even become an
expert or you become poly skill we will
pay you the same because we're motivated
to create those guys and we created one
of the top just in case somebody ever
gets there saying if you're a master in
three or more we designate you as AI
master programmer Wow you know we didn't
have any of those guys they might
actually now because they sent some
really strong people but look at that
focus you have two career paths and she
gets going you go the traditional career
path I will be a fronting guy low front
end I don't want to do anything except
Java and JavaScript and and HTML rest of
my life that's what you want to do fine
be there but you also this alternative
says really understand the broader
system become a guy who says here's a
problem I want to solve the problem for
the entire problem I'd like to play with
that idea so we gave that clear career
path to them massive success with that
we did train them in how to work
together because again they were used to
sitting by themselves and pointing
fingers so he dragged him into basically
some intensive object or any
it was done off-site it was a mixture of
skills or QA people there were scrum
masters they were developers all in the
same group
some guys were tech leads your is
optional that you could attend but if
you didn't attend that you're going to
be working and the old code base because
the new code base is only be done in
this new new system so it's up to you to
decide you want to change titles and
change career paths but if you want to
back off of that fine so we had a guide
with database guy who says I'm a sequel
expert I want to be a sequel expert of
rest of my life I don't really wanna
take your training I don't think I'll
get anything
I don't know I still be a database guy
we said thank you say that way we didn't
have people quit you know QA goes
through this stuff oh my god this is
what program is about well yeah this is
what the tools are you supposed to be
using like that or use like this
understand well maybe you want to go
find another job they believe we also
allow operations guys we put into class
some of the operations guys left because
DevOps is coming and it's cloud and
there are not gods anymore so they left
so sort of the project approach again it
was here's a whole bunch of developers
and there's a bunch of tables we call
them tables to reinforce the idea that
writes this together but they were
basically teams and you would have you
know a couple projects to start with and
they were end up at different points and
you would form new teams as necessary
you slap people around to other teams so
it was a very dynamic organization one
at the time for somebody roll off
project a when the programmer decides
it's time to roll off because I'm not
needed anymore and I need it more in
project B programmers can decide these
things because they understand their
skills we as programmers know who the
best database guy in our organization is
maybe the managers know maybe they don't
but it's lazy sky sort of decide just
tell them the priorities and they will
allocate their resources accordingly
this also worked very well at forward so
how do we do it mail online well
basically we absorb twenty more hires
within a within a basically two month
period by April 15th we already actually
started delivering things with these new
teams organizing this fashion again
getting out of their way and by
September we had actually replaced the
front end completely we taken 130,000
lines of Java code killed it and replace
it with 4,000 lines code of closure and
some nodejs monitoring in a micro
service fashion to CTOs had tried to do
to his read rewrite and basically dyed
it in the process got fired for not
being able to pull it off this guy
turned in and came in and did it and got
CTO turn this around and actually
delivered this early and we talked about
it when I talk about front insight the
daily the Daily Mail one month last year
I think was March last year they deliver
it delivered 3.2 petabytes over the
to subscribers not including video we're
talking about massive massive amounts of
data we replace that with for thousands
of closure that ran faster doing that
job than the old stuff yes we do use
Akamai servers so it's not all you know
coming directly from our boxes but yes
amazingly a successful project so they
did a very nice job of that so for the
last year I've been working with you
know a start-up Becca said in California
called outpace so my colleagues are here
so we're kind of do a lot of stuff so on
the mail online with a few differences
one difference is we only have
developers we're not going to create all
these other titles because everybody's
hired in to be a developer we tell them
that up front my title developer very
try to get a CT oh I would definitely
shoot that guy
you know CTO back actually this sort of
organization if you call yourself a CTO
it's like a bull's-eye on your chest
you're claiming you're smarter than all
the programmers and need technology no
yeah you get yourself shot we we already
talked about this in an earlier session
yesterday
colleagues over here talked about that
you know we have four different time
zones we got remote pairing I still meet
developers I've never seen face-to-face
that we're working with I don't see them
face to face but like once a quarter or
once every six months we get together in
a common place it's like wow and by the
way it's not that you know I'm kind of
not surprised by them their
personalities are what I expect it with
I know I've worked with them I know how
they think I mean a surprise are
sometimes they're really taller than I
thought you know they're really batterer
than I thought as they sort of said
sometimes they have to wear pants versus
what they used to but but this it really
no really surprises about this stuff
other than how they look to some degree
which is I find really amazing this make
sure you're strong community around that
it's sort of almost an assignment within
the team of what needs to be worked on
they have their own sort of designate
leadership and do.thank stuff we're
using a lot of new technologies a lot of
these guys have never seen before we're
definitely doing closure right
micro-services most people have never
been in this sort of flat
self-organizing teams before this is all
new stuff for them and they're doing it
very very well so again it's this sort
of stuff and by the way recruiting is a
footnote to all this stuff
recruiting into an anarchy organization
or organization is really flattened has
this sort of sort of positive aspects is
extraordinarily easy I mean if you're a
programmer and you're frustrating your
job your attire your manager tell you to
do stupid things you're tired of
customer putting you in stupid
technologies this sort of organization
is extremely attractive and in London we
have people that were leaving banks
taking pay cuts from leading banks
commuting an hour and a half to come
work at mail online each way because of
the quality of the work they had and you
don't regret that decision
so this is a very very powerful
recruiting if you're if you're trying to
find some of the best and brightest
people fix your processes empower your
people get this stuff working so this is
the story of programmer anarchy and I
actually do have a cheesy logo that I
used to put on t-shirts if you haven't
seen it like power to the programmers
and that's the story so hopefully I got
a little bit of time for questions or
challenges and hopefully I made some
people surprised
