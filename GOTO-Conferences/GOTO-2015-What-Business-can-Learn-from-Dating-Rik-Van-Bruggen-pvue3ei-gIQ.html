have you can apply some of the
techniques that we've seen used in in
the dating industry which you maybe
don't know don't know but it's a big
industry like there's conferences with
thousands of people just about the
dating industry and you know it's a big
industry and they apply some really
interesting technologies like for
example here for Jay and we'll talk
about that a little bit more Sony oh
it's one of the graph databases that's
been around for a very long time it was
founded actually early 2000 by a couple
of Swedish Vikings that had a particular
problem that they needed to solve and by
now it's it's a it's a quite a mature
offering for for dealing with graph data
there's quite a few customers and of
course open source users that deploy
near for change it's one of those things
that no people are predicting that it's
going to be the next big thing right so
graphs they've been around for a very
long time and there's a lot of interest
beer brewing in it just to be clear it's
not new at all right it's it's one of
those technologies that's been around
for a very long time I don't of people
around here remember mainframe databases
you know things like navigational or
network databases that used to power the
world you know they were all based on
the graph data model but that's that's
coming back really graph databases are
all about you know leveraging the data
in relationships and connections right
when you think about it relational
databases are very empty relational
right they're very difficult in dealing
with connectedness in the data right and
graph databases want to solve that
problem because there's a lot of value
in those relationship there's a lot of
value to be had from understanding how
things are connected to each other right
so new digital process all these two
different things are happening right now
we try to leverage the relationship and
that's what we see in the dating
industry alone like I said you know
relational databases aren't very good at
dealing with relationships because
relationships require joint operations
right and joint operations between
across multiple tables it's okay when
it's about one or two tables but it gets
really really complicated when either
the data set size grows or the number of
entities grows right if you're doing a
joint over one or two tables that's okay
five tables woo ten tables ouch 20 tails
it just doesn't work anymore right so
especially at scale right so dealing
with relationships is difficult in a
relational paradigm right so we're
trying to complement that and there's
been this whole new wave of wonderful
new technologies in the no sequel space
that there are absolutely great at
dealing with scale you know if I look at
some of my colleagues downstairs that
you know are promoting the react open
source database or the MongoDB open
source database no I was chatting
through something room this morning you
know it's fantastic technology you know
it's really great technology but really
doesn't deal with relationships it deals
with volume it deals with you know
simplicity know those types of things
right and that's really where the graph
databases come in I always think about
you know the first advantage of working
with a graph is a modeling advantage
it's about you know modeling reality as
it is right about drawing networks hello
there's a door at the back as well but
you know don't worry you can you can
model reality as a network basically
because reality is network right and and
you can reimagine that very very easily
one of the nicest thing that I've seen
in in the graph database space is that
you can basically draw the graph right
so many software projects start with
a drawing on a piece of paper on a
whiteboard on a wall right you draw a
model that's how you start the
conversation with your business users
that's how you start you know trying to
understand what people really want right
well if you look at it it really is very
similar to how you would persist that in
a graph database right whoops alright so
that's the power of animations there it
really is extremely similar you store
reality as it is right there's no like
impedance between the way you see
reality and discuss it with your
business users and you store it in your
data persistence layer right that's one
of the most powerful more aspects about
it and there's wonderful implementation
details behind that but I thought I
would try to explain that to you guys
using a specific example which is the
dating industry and you know it's sort
of take you through the steps that
people go through when they're looking
for a date online not that I know from
experience my wife is listening that's
fine so and then we'll we'll take you
through it and see how it sort of
applies to business domains right so
that's the that's the idea how what can
business loan from dating right so in
order to do that I'm just going to go
over here and switch microphones I'm
hoping that this will work look at that
feel like a pop star I can't see my
screen anymore now but that's okay so
what can we learn from from dating this
is really based on what we see with
users with with a lot of dating sites
that you haven't used graph databases
right and basically what those people
are telling us is that when they try to
make recommendations for new dates new
links between people they look at a
number of different aspects but it's not
just one aspect
that will determine whether or not a
date is likely to succeed right it's
actually a combination of different
things that will lead to a successful
day and actually many of those dating
sites I don't know if you noticed or not
but many of those dating sites they make
an effort not to suggest the best date
on the first date right because they
want you to go back right that's that's
how it works but they look at these
different aspects right so I will recall
these all different graphs right the
friends of a friend graph the passion
graph the location graph safety graph
right you don't want be dating someone
that you cannot trust and the posi graph
and we go into that a little bit all
right submit Jeremy Jeremy is one of the
characters that will use in this
presentation right and obviously jeremy
has some relationships he has some
friends right and these days we can
actually load these relationships from
social networks or we can explicitly
asked our customers you know who are
your friends right and who are you
related to write when you include the
second level right you get a much
broader scope right you get a much
broader scope friends of friends right
and your reach within the network sort
of starts expanding as well right and
it's a lot of research that goes into
this but we actually know that well
first of all seven Hopsin you're
connected to anyone right the bacon
principle right but three hops and has
an enormous amount of influence on each
other there's a lot of research that
that there's a lot of similarity until
three three hops away from you so we
actually want to understand that we want
to understand those relationships at
least three hops away to see you know
what we can find as information to make
better recommendations for dating right
so we have a bunch of people you know
how do we know we're friends well we can
ask them we can read from social network
informations or we can look at some kind
of implicit linking right we can look at
properties we can look at behavior we
can we can as all kinds of stuff that we
can
derive information ship in a
relationship information from but as you
can tell it really is a network you know
it's a friends of a friend of my friends
of a friends of a friend network right
that's what we're but that's what we're
dealing with here and so we're going to
try and store and query and interact
with that network in our graph database
right not because we want to sort of
know some statistics on the population
probably because we want to make some
kind of a recommendation right we want
to leverage that information in our
dating application right like I said
earlier I this is really important and
it's gonna there's a lot of research
that has been done about this and if I
can recommend a book about this it's
it's called connected i forget the
author but they know that within three
hops you are so similar you may not know
people directly but you are so similar
and your influence is actually carrying
at least three hops away from you right
so and this is just this just research
that's been done here and this is why
you know all of the dating sites are
absolutely leverage leveraging this kind
of technology because they know you know
you have a very high likelihood of
interacting with people multiple hops
away right to illustrate that a little
bit you know if I have these friends of
Jeremy right Jeremy as friends with
Jennifer with Peter with andreas right
they have friends or friends right they
have friends or friends of friends right
but you want to actually apply that and
query that interactively right so this
is an example is where it gets you know
sort of into some specifics how you can
actually query that type of information
in a graph database I don't know if
anyone's familiar with the graph query
language called cipher right cipher is
there is the query language that neeraj
a sort of invented to deal with this
kind of graph information and really
it's kind of ascii art for graph right
you're trying to sort of draw out the
pattern that you're looking for
or and basically tell the database you
know this is what I want this I you
declare what you want declarative
language and then the data we should
just go out and fetch and try to match
the pattern it you're looking for so in
this particular case you can see very
clearly on the slide you know what
you're doing is you're you're finding
Jeremy right so that's the first sort of
rounded arcs that you see around around
a note right a vertex in in graph
terminology right that node is connected
to another node which is a friend right
through a nose relationship you can see
the square brackets those are
relationships the arrows or no larger
than signs those are that's the
direction of the relationship right and
that friend knows someone else right
somewhere that someone else we call fof
which is the friend of a friend right
and at the end of that query what we
would like to return is the friend of a
friend so if I actually go too near PJ
here i have a little sample data set
that I'm hopefully able to generate here
this is the latest version of neo4j it's
actually a beta version and the only
reason I you know use a beta version is
because and if I fail I can blame the
beta version but it's a it's a milestone
release of Nia Jay 202 and I have a cup
of queries here that allow me to first
of all create the graph right so this is
a gravy that creates the graph it's kind
of awkward all right so it's running oh
my god all right I thought it was going
to fail on the first query sorry so now
it's created the graph and now I can go
and look for Jeremy's friends of friends
right so this is the query that you just
saw on the slide right match Jeremy
which is a user his name is Jeremy he
knows a friend and that friend knows
another friend right we have a return
from the friend of a friend basically
it's going to give me a bunch of sub
graphs right that match that pattern
right if I want to actually deal with
that in a different way you see it's
actually because
the resolution is a as always very very
good if I actually want to deal that in
a different way and return not just the
subgraph what I actually want to just
have the list of names right I can just
say okay from the fof over here right
extract a property right the name
property and give me that list right so
that's the list of the friends were
friends alright so that's what's what's
happening here in that first aspect of
you know this dating application I'm
looking for the social connections
between between people and I'm basically
hopping around like I'm grabbing Jeremy
two hops down I I find people that are
connected actually in in cipher there's
some really cool tricks that you can do
to make this even easier right so if I
say here I really shouldn't be doing
this but this right so start to that
means a variable-length relationship of
maximum two hops right and that will
return me the same thing essentially
right and it's two hops away right if I
make a three hops away I will get even
more people alright so that's the way it
sort of goes yo you you can express the
pattern in it you're looking for bye-bye
you know spacing by specifying that in
cipher so that's what am i doing this is
that's the the friend of a friend aspect
right so some of the interesting apps
aspects for example are you know who do
I share friends with you know that's
another extension of the pattern right
I'd love to see you know who are the
people that I share most friends with
because those people are going to be
most interesting for me to sort of
expand into their networks and find some
kind of ordering right some kind of
ordering of people that I might be
wanting today alright so this is another
query where basically what I'm what I'm
doing here is I am trying to find the
friends of a friends but I'm ordering
them by the number of friends that we
have in common right length connect
friend collect friend is basically that
that measure as it's the length of the
path I can run that query very easily
here and here as well right I run that
over here and I get an order I can
basically start getting close to do that
recommendation as part of that first
aspect of graph-based recommendations
which is the the social network right so
that's a that's already interesting
right so this can mean can be very
important right sometimes you have more
than one type of relationship that you
want to be analyzing why not just the
the friends relationship but also the
works for relationship you know it's not
just the number of hopes that can be
important it's also what kind of
relationship do we have you know I don't
not sure if you want to be recommending
you know that someone dates their boss
right though that that would be a silly
kind of recommendation even as awkward
right that the other one you know two
hops away right maybe but it's
complicated right maybe that's
interesting but it's still complicated
for this particular situation where the
first stop hope is a works for
relationship and after that you have
friends relationships you know it's
actually much more interesting to look
three hops into the network right not
just you know two hops but also three
out and I showed you earlier how easy it
is to do that right so you can draw out
draw out these patterns you know this is
like the long notation of it right knows
friend knows friend or friend knows
friend or friend or friend right or you
can just say no star dash dash three
adult dog three that would be the easy
way to know that right that's what I'm
massaro was was indicating earlier I'm
hoping that's clear right so you can
leverage that kind of social information
now we'll start adding some additional
perspectives right because that's the
real important thing here with these
with these dating applications they look
at more than one aspect they look at
these many different aspects right so we
look at a different user in the
particular case guy guy called Jonathan
Wright a very interesting character
apparently right and Jonathan obviously
has this other aspect that he wants to
involve which is you know his passions
you know what I what is he passionate
about what are the things that he cares
about right and you know that's where
many of those dating sites will ask you
for a reported interest they will ask
you know what are you interested in
right and if obviously those things
match you know they will use that for
the recommendations like so for example
in this particular case you know if I
want to match for some specific reported
interest I can say okay look for an
interest that is foodie right so i will
say okay for me i'm interested in foody
the date that I'm looking for should
also have that kind of a reported
interest and of course in my particular
case have a gender equal to F right so
that's how you would sort of match for
those particular interests now let me
just see if I can look go there right so
here we have just adjust my Rockstar
microphone all right so here's the
demonstrated interest right so i can say
okay Jonathan no that's not another one
that's another one yup that's this one
right so the query here is you know I'm
matching for Jonathan he has an interest
called interest right and i'm doing a
second match right the second part of
the pattern which basically says well
there should be another person that
shares that same interest right so this
thing and that thing are identical right
if i find those people then I'm
obviously going to have another way of
recommending potential dates for these
people I'm basically doing another kind
of a joint operation and finding other
potential candidates right matching for
specific impress now obviously how do
you find interest well we get into that
a little bit later the third aspect you
know you've got so you've got the
friends or friends network
you've got the interest graph then you
got the location graph obviously right
and I don't know if you know about this
but you know lots of graph databases
actually are very very suitable for
geospatial information right where you
actually include that kind of geospatial
calculations into into the graph
database as well so for example here you
can have a query that says okay I want
someone that is within a certain
distance of me right if I do that I
sorry I can actually add another
perspective right so I've got the
interest car graph we've got the social
network graph and I've got the distance
the location graph that are already also
starting to play together here alright
so the safety graph well that's the
fourth one which is basically where we
will try to sort of understand you know
what are people really like whether it
really are they safe to go on a date
with right in order to do that will
actually try and dig into some people's
social network information people give
away a lot of information about their
actual behaviors by posting on Twitter
posting on Facebook not securing it you
know all that type of stuff so which is
why you know if you look at this
particular person Jonathan dreamy man he
has a very bizarre twitter feed right
and may be appropriate for Amsterdam but
it seems like a lot of his tweets are
about you know his love for some kind of
chemicals so this particular person
Jonathan dreamy man is clearly into
drugs right so that's you can actually
actually derive new kinds of interests
from this particular analysis as well
right if you do some word analysis on
these Twitter feeds it's very easy to
sort of infer new kinds of interests and
apply that to the the graph as well to
assess know things like safety I sorry /
stick it in this particular case you
know I can just say okay Jonathan
dreaming man you know has he got some
kind of demonstrated interest in drugs
right that would be another perspective
on whether or not I should go on a date
with this guy right so here we go right
so the queries are getting more
complicated right the patterns are
getting more complicated we're looking
deeper into the network and we're trying
to find a date connected to Jonathan at
two hops away and that date should or
should not have an interest in drugs
right so that's the way you would sort
of imply these new kinds of patterns and
leverage those in your in your dating
recommendations right and as you can see
actually and this is bizarre in some
ways so here we what we'll do here is
will add a demonstrated interest right
because Jonathan has an interest in
drugs right so he has an interesting
drugs will add that to the database that
wasn't there before and now we'll try to
look at the purple the friends or
friends who like drugs for example right
so here we go look for a date that is to
observe a from Jonathan Wright who is
interested to aim drugs and whose gender
is female right and I will get a number
of recommendations so like you said like
I said earlier right we're looking at
these multiple perspectives and
involving more and more parameters more
and more entities into the way we try to
recommend recommend new dates to this
particular person right other passions
you know football for example food is a
particular person into food yes or no so
that that type of stuff you can also
sort of include that into the graph
another one that's that's very popular
with some of these dating users of the
graph database technology is you know
verifying that whether or not someone
has a real profile yes or no there's a
lot of fake profiles on these dating
sites in order to do that you can
actually link out through social
networks and verify if these people
these
people are real for example by assessing
if they have a minimum of one of two
boys for example right so if you do that
you have a query signal little bit like
this one right so in this particular
case I'm starting from Jonathan looking
for a potential dates two hops away and
that they should be able to say social
network should have gender equal to F it
should have a number of relationships
right so here we're evaluating the
number of posts of that particular
person on a social network and verifying
whether or not this is actually a real
person right so that's another query
that you can run over here you know real
people with the social network right so
grabbing Jonathan walking the nose
relationship for two hops walking to the
social network and evaluating if our
which is the relationship between the
date and the social network has a number
of posts larger than two all right so if
you don't run that and basically you get
only one particular person back which is
Jennifer looks like where you're zooming
into whether or not one particular
recommendation for Jonathan you know
people that are into football gender f
two hops away into drugs so this is the
perfect date for John right so you're
drawing this kind of complex pattern for
Jonathan to see whether or not that
would be something that you would want
to recommend and as you can see over
here pull it all together this is the
query that we're running and you know
the recommendation is going to be this
wonderful lady called Jennifer so that's
that's really how people deal with these
complex patterns in the dating industry
you know they really look at these
different perspectives look deep into
the network not just one or two hops but
three or four
even to find people that will be useful
to recommend right and you know that's
the perfect date they have a date and
they sail off into the sunset so what's
that got to do with business right I'm
hoping you sort of got the picture of
the the graph landscape a little bit
well I thought I'd give you a specific
example on you know how that relates to
real world normal business applications
you know lots of organizations have to
deal with fraudulent behavior some kind
of fraud you know whether they're try to
commit financial fraud or insurance
fraud or v80 rings with that refinancing
drugs for example lots of examples that
you could think of in thrall now this is
the funny thing about fraud there's lots
of different fro types right and there's
this entire industry that digs into all
these different kinds of fraud examples
right there we could go into this 4 for
4 hours but I think the poor the point
I'd like to make is that many of these
fraud cases are not just in the
individual transaction right it's not
just one transaction or one behavior or
one interaction that actually composes a
fraudulent behavior right many different
steps are usually involved and it's a
chain of transactions that forms this
fraudulent behavior right so for example
in this particular kind of role which is
which is people what people call first
party for all right what they try to
find is lines of credits you know extend
credit and then basically form networks
of people that all apply for the same
kinds of resources and and then take
advantage of the situation and run with
the money this is a very well-known
pattern of fraud right where people
fabricate these synthetic IDs you know
have all these smaller lines of credits
and
and then mass that into something of
much more substantial value people don't
read about it a lot because you know
it's one of those things that the bank's
tried to you know shut up about you know
they don't really want to talk about
that because they're the only ones that
are hit by this this is a big problem
for lots of people for lots of financial
institutions so it's a big big problem
and enormous numbers and it's a network
problem you know we usually don't think
of it that way we think about you know
these individual transactions that
people are committing to individual
credit lines individual assessments and
that's basically what's causing the
problem we don't look at the complex
ring of fraud that is actually existing
here right so you know that that's why
they basically get away with it right
they have these strategies of you know
all of a sudden disappearing with all of
the credit lines that they've amassed
you know right and and bust out that's
how they call it they basically run away
with the money at the top of at the peak
of the credit line and then run away
with it right and Bank in this
particular case it could just as well be
no some kind of other institution is is
left with the losses right so the
discrete data analysis strategy for this
right where you look at the individual
transactions has been used for decades
right there in order to try to sort of
try to single out these individual
fraudulent cases right the problem with
it is is that you know it's it's really
not stopping the advanced frog
fraudsters right it's very simple it
stops the rookies but it never stops the
advanced fraudsters advanced fraudsters
who are of course committing the larger
fraud cases right there's a there's been
this tendency to try and have much more
continuous data analysis to try and
predict these types of
fraud behaviors and and that's what's
where the graph really could come in
because the graph database or the graph
analysis is going to allow you to look
at these complex patterns look deeper
into the network just like what the
dating sites are doing today right there
basically the dating sites are composing
these complex patterns right there
looking not just at the friend of a
friend network but also at the passion
graph also at the location graph they're
looking at all these different aspects
and that's what fraud analysis for
example should also be doing or they
should also look at multiple
perspectives to try and fry the
fraudsters right because we know that
non from fraudulent cases it mean in
this particular example they all have
the same shape or the hell they all have
the same pattern right if I look at
something like this I can also
immediately start seeing okay this
really doesn't correspond to the shape
that I just show that I should just
showed you it's a much longer chain for
for one thing right there's a lot more
participants in the chain right so I I
really need to be looking much deeper
into the network to be able to evaluate
whether or not a particular transaction
is of risk yes or no right and that's
sort of the point that I'm trying to
make is that you really want to evaluate
these types of risk assessments not just
based on the individual transaction or
you know one or two hops deep but you
want to look deep into the network and
follow the chain all the way through to
be able to make an accurate assessment
whether or not a particular card number
for example is of risk for a particular
fraud case right because it's all about
these patterns it's all about these
patterns these deep patterns that are
going into the network that is is really
increasing the risk of the front
behavior right it's let me say that
again right it so it's just all about
the patterns the deep patterns that
you really want to be looking at not
just one hop deep but multiple hops
teeth for example here in Holland we've
done this beautiful project with the
Chamber of Commerce right the cake Erica
if people are familiar with that now
when you register in you a new
organization new company you have to go
to the Chamber of Commerce and they will
actually check all the way into their
network whether or not you know you have
you are some of your mother companies
have ever been convicted if some of the
board members have opened depths or
those types of things they will all be
checked you know all the way through
into the network because they know that
basically the fraudsters the people that
are wanting to do these types of v80
carousels and all those types of things
they are basically trying to exploit the
system by wrapping companies in
company's income breezing companies to
try and evade the system it's all about
these patterns it's all about these deep
connections between data right that's
why you know we're seeing a lot of
interest you know in connected analysis
in fraud prevention and that's just one
application of you know how business
users can learn from these dating sites
because you know at the end of the day
you're looking at these complex patterns
you're looking at these cross field type
of evaluations of risk lots of people
are already doing that there's a lot of
information that you can find a line or
reference cases all those types of
things I've brought some cards here some
books that you can also go and take a
look at downstairs at the booth there's
actually a graph of the of the go to
Amsterdam schedule that you can also
take a look at if you're interested and
of course we have a meet up here in
Amsterdam if you're ever looking for
more information or whatever you
couldn't become you can always come to
one of our meetups for example on the
sixteenth of July we're doing another
meetup here in Amsterdam that is usually
really
well attended so should be found so it
grows reach out to me Rick at new
technology RM brueggen i have a blog
blog about neo and stuff as well so take
a look at that as well and i'm very
happy to answer any other questions if
that would be useful yeah go for it so
you talked a lot about looking for the
patterns and trends and traversing the
network and how do you arrive at the pet
you look for I can stairs of course a
literature social studies stuff like
that especially dating industry but it's
okay we also use graph database for
exploratory research that's a great
question and so for some reason this
thing sounds louder I don't know if
that's for you as well but so let's
let's talk about that because yeah you
know the example that I gave you there
you sort of have to know the pattern
that you're looking for right if you
don't know the pattern what you're
looking for then you know it's not going
to answer any of your your questions so
i think there's actually multiple ways
that you know that you can find patterns
the first one I think is you right it's
it's your domain expertise but you know
your business you know big you know
because you've been working in the
industry what are meaningful patterns
that you should be looking for right the
second one I think and I sort of haven't
really gone into that here in this
demonstration but I usually actually do
other demonstrations you there's a lot
of exploration that you can do if I can
just click around here right I will find
interesting stuff you know one thing
leads to another right and I find that
graph visualizations are actually a very
meaningful way for people to find
patterns that they didn't know about
right like for example I don't know I
tweeted about yesterday night you know
the IC IG it's a the invest
International Center for Investigative
Journalism a mouthful and the Swiss
leaks case this was all over the news 22
ago that case the Swiss leak case where
they found all of those hidden files of
HSBC in in in Switzerland all that
wonderful interesting stuff that was
found by you know loading the data
entered near 4j applying a visualization
solution to it called link curious right
and then the journalists were just
browsing through the the HSBC
transactions and they found these really
bizarre patterns alright so that's the
second way you can find patterns it's
you know you've got your domain
expertise and then you're looking for
you're exposing it to a domain expert
and he just walks around on the network
and find stuff right the third way
obviously is is a little bit more
complicated because it involves things
like machine learning right it involves
things like you know massive number
crunching algorithms that will do things
like clustering right graph clustering
is it's a well-known technique for
finding you know which parts of the
network belong together right or between
this you know which parts of the network
actually are most important in the
network or some kind of ranking you know
those are all algorithms that you can
apply to a graph using machine learning
techniques and they will sort of tell
you what the patterns are right my
experience that's the that's the last
part right domain expertise and visual
exploration I think are the most
important parts of finding patterns
machine learning sure it can give you
that extra percent right and often times
that extra percent is very interesting
but that's that's the third way of doing
it does that answer your question yep
anyone else have other questions I'm not
sure if I can run through the recording
it manager about the example which you
gave I just want to know on how much
amount of data was used for doing this
energy I was hoping you wouldn't ask
that now it's tiny it's
absolutely tiny it's I think it's like a
100 nodes or something like that so it's
completely tiny but that's not I
actually might be useful for you to sort
of understand why that's actually
completely irrelevant the size of the
data in a graph database very different
from other database systems does not
affect performance alone right why
because you know in all those queries
that I did there right I'm actually
making them local I'm making them local
in the graph which means you know you
you're anchoring it to a specific person
or a specific user or a specific
interest in the graph right that's the
difference between global and local
operations now the one that's a
wonderful thing about graph databases is
that finding that what finding the local
point where you start your graph search
you know that's basically an index look
up right and if size becomes bigger yes
that index lookup will go a little bit
slower a little bit slower but once
you're in the graph it doesn't even know
about the rest of the graph it only
cares about that locality about that
part of the graph that you've landed on
you know I always think of it as you
know me wearing a you know a jetpack you
know landing into the graph right and
then exploring it from that place where
you land right so yes you've caught me
the data set was very tiny but it's
actually irrelevant because that that I
can prove that to you if you want to
come to the booth later you know if I
add a hundred thousand people to that
graph it doesn't matter it doesn't
affect performance he just doesn't
yes all right when we compute these it's
like a pre computed graph right so you
actually stored it so how real time is
this if I want to just serve it in real
time yeah so no so this is real time
right so there's been sure there will
always be some kind of an initial
loading process for your graph right but
at least in the case of neo4j you know
it's a fully transactional database so
that means that you will be writing to
it all the time or I mean that's at
least what it's designed to do as you
continue to write to it right it will
always give you the lace the latest
pattern matches right so if all of a
sudden you add a hundred thousand people
to the graph right it will actually well
in this particular case it won't really
matter but it will continue to sort of
evaluate that locality of the graph if
some cool new connection is there it
will do different recommendations all
right so it's it's a real time system or
a near real-time system if that make
sense like you would do in other oltp
kind of situations it's you know it
catches the latest through information
and works without does that answer your
question anyone else you really want to
go to lunch don't you and how this
system deals with a big updates if you
have a really big bunch of data and then
you need to update a lot of things
another great question so depends is
there is the good answer but I don't
want to sound like a consultant too much
so writing to a graph is always more
expensive right so more expensive
compared to like a key value store or
you know other kinds of noise ecosystems
writing to a graph is more expensive
because you're writing data and
structure at the same time right you
have to do both right so it's going to
be more expense
so expect a little bit of an overhead
right luckily most people read their
data more than they write it right so it
you know it you're usually balances out
in the case of bulk operations you know
where you where you need to load a bunch
of data all at once you basically have
two options right do it online or
offline if you at all offline is going
to be really fast you know it I mean I
was talking to a guy earlier today that
wanted to load you know 300 million
nodes and and that type of stuff online
it would take days off line it's going
to be minutes it's going to be a lot
more faster now very very big difference
if you're doing online bulk uploads you
really need to be a little bit careful
because there's a lot of things that you
can tweak the most important thing to
tweak is the transaction sizes right if
you if you do atomic transactions all
the time right come back in a couple of
days because it's going to that's a big
overhead right if you can say you know
what I can oh I can afford to commit
every 5,000 updates right guess what
it's going to be a lot faster right so
but it depends on that you know balance
that you need to strike and you know
it's a it's it's it's too big of a topic
to sort of address here but i but i but
i hope you understand the topic right so
offline and online very different if
you're doing online please take care of
your transaction batches the batch sizes
anyone else yeah
so Bram has been a kindly reminding of
me that you need to evaluate the session
so if you're if you're kind enough to do
that there's an app for that right so
you can do that on the go to app i also
have a couple more details here we have
some books left i actually you know
because i don't have a social life i
wrote a book about attorney oh and you
know there's a couple more copies
downstairs so if you're interested you
can come and get that there's also
downloads from PDF books you know the
o'reilly book is a free downloads the
learning average a book as well and that
one o'clock there's a raffle for one of
those android watches so if you're
interested please let us know I hope
this was useful I know if I know I flew
through it a little bit but I'm hoping
it was useful and I look forward to
seeing you again
