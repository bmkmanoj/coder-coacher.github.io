they're supposed to be short talks this
is going to be a really short talk
thereby giving Patrick and Linda even
more time to be less short so what I
want to talk about is your own personal
productivity as you work so you work
hard every everybody who goes to this
conference is pretty much an amazing
awesome developer I've met two or three
of you and I can generalize to the
thousand people who are here that you
write some code and you go back you know
I am so awesome okay so I know you guys
are all awesome you're here and very
quickly you get promoted into positions
of more and more authority and influence
and leadership sometimes with titles and
sometimes even with more salary never
with business cards so what happens when
you're promoted well you get more
responsibilities and you start working
on more things and you're learning about
more no sequel this and you know web 2.0
4.0 7.0 this and all of a sudden you
start failing so you've gone from being
totally awesome to being totally
overwhelmed so what's the problem here
the problem is there's too much to do in
any given day when you have things to do
there's way too many things to do
there's way too much email but there's
also way too many tasks and that and all
sorts of things that you need to do and
so one of the things that I give advice
to people and I've done in my own life
and and other people have asked me for
advice is well how do you make sure that
you're doing the right things and you
continue to succeed in the face of way
too many things to do and so if you've
seen Stephen Covey's quadrants where he
sets out you know what's important
versus what's not important what's
urgent versus what's not urgent this is
really the key to how you decide what
you want to do in any given day any
given week any given month of course you
want to be doing the things that are
urgent and important or not urgent and
important over in fact the things that
are not urgent and not important like
reading the the web news and that sort
of thing so okay what I'm telling you
here isn't new
many people know about this quadrant
they go yeah I should be doing the
important things urgent or not urgent
the question is how do you make that
happen because everybody knows you
should be doing the important stuff but
we tend not to well I'm telling you
here's the secret and it's it's really
simple you make a list okay everybody
makes lists I happen to use paper I know
that's sort of an old technology it's
done by by cutting down trees and then
you pulp them up and stuff like this you
could also use computers and you write
the things down on paper and you cross
them off the trick to making a list and
that's the whole point of this entire
talk is you order it by importance right
so you want to put the things at the top
of the list that are the important
things and the things at the bottom of
list that are the unimportant things and
so here's a list I made one day I need
to talk to my boss on a crisis that was
important and urgent I had a couple
important things here like making my
talk and a few other and unimportant
things like you know reviewing the
projects and that sort of thing so when
people tend to make lists and this is
why I thought I'd give us a little talk
they tend to make lists in the order
that they're going to do them that day
so you start with well the first thing
I'm going to do in the morning is I'm
going to do this and then I'm going to
do this another thing and I'm gonna do
this third thing but that's not the way
you should be making the list you should
be making the list in the order of
importance to do that day
so in fact on this particular day when I
started I came in in the morning and I
started doing a couple things down here
which were less important because those
are the first things that I needed to do
that day but they weren't the most
important things I needed to do that day
okay so why is making lists
besides I think it's fabulous thing to
do a good idea well you need to develop
a habit of making sure that you're doing
that ordering by priority instead of by
time and if you make these lists every
day and this is my argument you can
reflect on what you're what you're doing
and improve on that and so one of the
key things that you need to do in that
list is you need to write down
everything you do so you make a list in
the beginning of day you order it by
importance you start working on things
and then you know shows up and says hey
can you do an extra talk for for the
conference like oh well I could do that
and so then you add that to the list so
that you keep track of it and what you
do is you've got a stack
of these things and you do your personal
agile process right so one of the things
about agile is it's a cycle where you do
a little bit of planning I mean it could
be just a day's worth of planning called
a list and you do it and then you at the
end of the day you rewrite respect on it
at the end of the week you retrospect on
it and you see how well you're doing on
those things and then you use that
feedback to improve your own process of
whether you're doing the important
things first or just the things that get
you satisfaction first I mean one of the
problems with being developers is it's
really tempting to just write some more
code and try it out again I don't think
you can be a developer if you don't have
that sort of addictive personality where
the next time I try this piece of code
it's going to work we're all sort of
gamblers we wouldn't be in this business
if we didn't because nothing's ever
perfect and so you're really tempted to
do something short and small and get a
quick win even though it might not be
the most important thing so that's what
I had to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
