because I wanted to learn how to build
computers and I wish I could go back and
ask my 18 years old self some questions
like why do you want to build computers
I really I don't know how I got that in
my head but Silicon Valley complied and
taught me how to build computers and
about six years after I'd finished my
mast I'd moved to Silicon Valley I
finished my master's degree and I was
working in a hewlett-packard research
lab working on integrated circuit design
specifically integrated circuit
testability now test means something
different in the hardware world than it
does in the software world in the
software world I still see a lot of
people get up and talk about how
important testing is and how critical it
is to success and one thing that you can
get out of that is that you know that
there are some people in the audience
who haven't yet been convinced and that
doesn't happen in the hardware world
people in the hardware world know that
they have to do a good job of testing
because shipping bad parts is a kiss of
death it's very very expensive to
replace bad hardware once you've shipped
it so people put a lot of effort in on
testing so I worked on untested bility
for for a few years and what I realized
is that I actually liked the software
portion of the hardware design process
much more than I liked the hardware
portion of the hardware design process
and so I started thinking more about
software and hewlett-packard was a nice
enough that they let me go to graduate
school and I kept trying to think well
how could I take some of the stuff i
like about hardware which is all of the
the test and testability and focus on
getting it right to the software world I
very quickly learned in the software
world then we'll fix it later if it's if
it's broken will patch it we can do that
the hardware yeah i understand you
hardware guys it's hard for you for a
software guys it's not so bad so just do
the best you can and then we'll and then
we'll we'll make it right I didn't like
that I looked for people who thought
that maybe getting software right was
important and I found a little crowd of
security people saying hey most of our
security problem
actually our software problems and so I
started digging into that and I was
pretty successful digging into that and
by that i mean i was able to finish a
PhD and that's some measure of success
and about six months after i did that i
got a call from a venture capitalist who
said have you ever thought about taking
that and turning it into a company I
said I that that'd be super cool but I
don't know how to do that he said don't
worry I have I have people who do and
that's how I got into the security
business was taking my academic work and
trying to prove it out so oh I did that
for about seven years and the company
grew and the company was successful and
it came time to decide whether or not we
were going to go down the road that
eventually led to an IPO or whether or
not we were going to sell it we decided
to sell it and lo and behold I was back
working at hewlett-packard so I thought
what I try to do today is tell you a
little bit about what I learned making
that transition into software and then
into security and then coming back to
where I am now which is back working
working on software I think though if
we're going to talk about security very
much we have to start out talking about
the NSA is that I mean that seems like
to maybe if I maybe last year we could
have talked about China or something but
now we kind of we have to talk about the
NSA so here's the deal with the NSA if
the NSA wants to know what's on your
computer they can know what's on your
computer now they have they have a
variety of tactics though that they will
use to figure out what's on your
computer their first choice is to
corrupt someone upstream of you so if
they can tap the network because the
network provider is working with them or
if you put your data on to google and
they can get google to give it to them
then they'll do that that's the first
choice their second choice is to attack
your software to attack the software
running on your machine to break the
software running on your computer the
last choice the choice of last resort is
actually what they got started doing
which is to break the cryptography on on
your computer
in order to explain why I thought I'd
tell a little parable set in san
francisco now at one point at one point
the idea was that the streets were paved
with gold in the united states but of
course we all know that's not true but i
will tell you this everyone in San
Francisco is an entrepreneur including
the people who are homeless like Fred
and Sam now Fred and Sam decide to go
into business and they decide to go into
the recycling business and Joe is their
first employee and so they cart things
back and forth between their two centers
Fred's cardboard box and Sam's tents
using a shopping cart ma'am all right so
is this system adequately secure yes
raise your hand yes come on this is fine
sign they're storing soda cans and
newspapers this is perfectly reasonably
secure for what they're doing with it so
business is good so they decide to
branch out into shipping gold bars man
clearly there are some security risks
here so what do you do if you want to
ship gold bars around who you get an
armored car clearly for Joe to drive the
gold back and forth now is this system
reasonably secure thank you you all got
it right that time that's good no this
is really really bad the armored car is
fine but the endpoints didn't change and
the end points are the software on your
computer we have some reasonably good
protocols for moving things around in a
secure fashion but the software that we
put on the endpoints tends to be really
really bad so a security one lesson you
could take from that is that a security
feature like maybe you're using SSL to
move data back back and forth is not a
replacement for secure features
so when you do authentication you do
access control maybe you do a really
nice audit log that's all good stuff and
you need to do that just like an armored
car would be part of a secure system for
moving gold around but it's insufficient
maybe is it too early is it too early
for me to digress I'll give you guys a
little digression on this oh I hope you
I hope you enjoy making fun of
mathematicians um because because I I do
and the mathematicians are the ones who
become the cryptographers so a few years
ago maybe three or four years ago NIST
had a competition to choose the next
secure hash function and one of the
entries what was called md6 well I
didn't feel like I was really in a
position to contribute to the
mathematical portion of this because it
turns out it's complicated but I wanted
to make fun of them anyway so what we
did is gathered up all of the code
submissions for them and show that the
code submissions for almost every single
hash function had vulnerabilities in it
and I had a great time I thought it was
great because I got to say haha the
mathematicians can't code isn't that
funny and it turns out it got kind of
odd so at that time the the worm that
was making its way around the internet
was called conficker and it turns out
that the the worm writers were were
amateur cryptographers or maybe
cryptographic enthusiasts might be the
right way to say it because they had
taken some of these unproven really hash
functions with no known properties and
embedded them into their worm and about
two weeks after we announced that we'd
found all of these vulnerabilities in
all of these these demonstration
algorithms they patched conficker it
turns out that not only there are the
amateur cryptographers but the worm
writers care a lot about security oh no
too fast let's talk
about the NSA again here's here's the my
favorite story or mother favorite thing
that I learned out out of the whole NSA
revelations in the last few months you
know it's not all of the stuff that
they're doing it for the first time I
wouldn't talk to the NSA was probably 19
oh maybe it was maybe it was nineteen
ninety six or so I first showed up at
the NSA and I was talking to them about
hardware at the time and I would ask
them basic basic questions do you know
what I stuck at fault is which is a very
basic thing and hardware testing and
they would all just sort of look at each
other like they weren't sure what they
were supposed to say and there was a red
light flashing in the entire time I was
in the room in order to make it clear
there was somebody who was uncleared in
their presence over the next decade they
got much much more straightforward and
they would say hey you know we're
looking for vulnerabilities in code and
we do that to protect people because
then we take those vulnerabilities back
to to Microsoft or back to Google and we
tell them to patch their systems unless
the vulnerabilities are really good and
then we keep them and they were very
very straightforward about it uh-uh
let's talk about let's talk about how we
how we got here though we've got about
Oh 50 or 60 years of computing
experience and we've been dealing with
computer security through through most
of that uh but really computer security
has its roots in communications security
which has a much much longer history so
we could go all the way back to Caesar
and talk about a Caesar cipher there's a
queen you know Caesar cipher it's a
substitution cipher you take you take
maybe an a and replace it with a Q and
etc so now that's a grade-school kind of
a cipher to write was a caesar cipher
good security for Caesar I have any
takers on that I have a lot of takers on
that ok i call that I'd call that fifty
percent well good job fifty percent
caesar cipher was a very good cipher
foresees
because most of Caesars enemies were
illiterate so as soon as you jumble
things up at all they're gone so
communications security stayed in
approximately that state all the way
through Abraham Lincoln's time where we
were sending encrypted messages over
telegram wires and it really really
though it really made started making
leaps forward with the advent of the
radio now why was the radio such a big
deal for secure communications it's
because it was the first time you could
take your fleet send them over the
horizon and give them new instructions
so now you could have your military
power on the other side of the world and
tell them what to do you need to be
really careful though that nobody else
was telling them what to do yeah so by
the time we get to World War two
cryptography has really come into its
own as it as a discipline and is in fact
incredibly important in the war effort
particularly in the Pacific now maybe we
got computing out of that cryptography
effort or major advances in computing
and in the European war but it was the
pacific war that was that were they won
lots of battles because of cryptography
and then the next major leap takes place
Oh in the in the 70s and that's let's
see that's ad lie rivest and shamir up
there in that picture in the top right
so that's that's a are in the middle S
on the end and a at the at the far side
that RSA algorithm RSA algorithm changes
things in a big big way that's public
key cryptography here's why things
change then because all of a sudden
people who've had no relationship before
can enter into a trusted relationship
you don't really need that if you're a
military because you don't go making
friends with other militaries all that
easily uh but if you're in business you
make new friends all the time so so a
public key cryptography was a big big
deal and a
us once we had Netscape then we had
public key cryptography built into a
technology that everybody can use a few
thousand years of communication security
I kind of boil it down to about one
lesson and here goes for communications
security security is hard to measure
it's really really difficult to know how
much you have there are a few reasons
for that one you don't know what your
adversary knows they might know very
little they might be illiterate or they
might have just stolen all of your coats
you can't tell secondly things change so
maybe you correctly measured the amount
of security you have today and then
things shift just a little bit one extra
submarine gets caught or one courier
decides to go over to the other side or
maybe one system administrator decides
to give away all your documents at all
of a sudden your security posture
changes substantially lastly small
mistakes have big big consequences when
it comes to communication security so
you think you've measured correctly you
miss a detail and your whole analysis is
wrong so what are the consequences of
security being hard to measure for for
communications I i I'll give you I'll
give you four of them the first one is
you've got to be conservative when you
take a measurement you really have to
make sure that you're taking the
worst-case scenario and the worst-case
scenario turns out to probably be about
the expected case because the worst case
may actually be worse than you know
second of all keep it simple I used to
have to explain really carefully that
simple is not the same thing as short
but pearl is sort of on its way out and
so I think maybe that's not as important
a lesson the
these days I don't know but simple and
simple is not short there are no
absolutes any any security person who
comes and tells you this is it this is
the thing that makes us secure hmm
that's that that doesn't pass the sniff
test security is about assurance it's
not about proof lastly security through
obscurity doesn't work you should assume
that your adversaries know everything
that you know that's enough on
communications security let's talk about
computer security like communication
security it started out computer
security started out being mostly about
government and military needs if you go
back and you read their literature from
the 60s or the 70s it's mostly about
things like access control who gets to
know what when there's one sort of
glimmer of hope that comes in the 80s
actually out of the NSA nobody knew it
was the NSA at the time it was published
but it was the orange book and it
explained here's what you can look for
when you evaluate a trusted system and
they explained the implementation of
that system is actually critical to
making a high security system now when
this photo was taken I have to think
that probably computer security mostly
meant keeping the door to the computer
room locked right um and actually you
know it hasn't evolved a whole heck of a
lot since then when you think about
fundamental strategies so there are two
fundamental ways to defend a computer
and two fundamental ways to attack a
computer when it comes to defense
there's isolation in other words don't
let your computer talk to anything else
and if you think about why we have such
thing as a process that's really about
isolating this code from all the other
code in the system a virtual machine a
sandbox a firewall all sort of take this
same position
which is the default answer is no so
isolation secondly when isolation
doesn't work we monitor so you can
monitor by handing people a prince by
using privileges handing them a receipt
that gets them through the door or you
can use what's called complete
intermediation a complete mediation
excuse me complete mediation where you
sit between whatever is making the
request and whatever is being requested
so if you think about a virtual machine
there's a hypervisor there that that
watches every time something in the
virtual machine wants to talk to the
hardware and that's complete mediation
that's the defense that's really that's
it all kamal computer security defense
comes down to doing those two things
attack there are two strategies first
brute force just try everything second
violate some assumptions i find you
could find a loophole somewhere or you
can step outside of the system so for
example when you come up with a very
good password system and then someone
tapes the password to the bottom of the
keyboard then you can step outside of
that system by turning the keyboard over
and really attacking computers comes
down to those two things just just try
it all suck up all the data maybe or
violate somebody's assumptions why do
people get so surprised about computer
security problems I mean make forgive me
I don't want to I don't want to sound
jaded I don't I don't mean that we are
destined to have all these problems I
want to introduce the idea that there's
actually a very good reason why people's
intuition doesn't match what they get
out of computer security often really
computer security breaks people's
intrinsic security model in in two
really big ways
one it doesn't match physical security
very well so physical security is is
very linear for example if you would
like to rob a bank you will need to get
a vehicle that can take all the loot
away and the amount that you can take
from the bank is limited by the amount
you can transport secondly in the
physical world we primarily rely on
accountability an accountability model
in order to keep keep our world secure
it's really not that hard to break into
my house for example because I have
windows and if you wanted to throw a
brick through the window and come into
my house you could why why wouldn't
people do that because they will be held
accountable for their actions or they're
the likelihood of them being held
accountable for the actions is enough to
deter them computer security doesn't
work this way first of all it's very
very nonlinear how many bitcoins can I
fit into my car all of them right
secondly there's very very little
accountability and because of that lack
of accountability for computer systems
today then we have to rely on prevention
to a much much greater degree than we're
used to in our physical world so that's
why people get get surprised by computer
security you know it's hard to talk
computer security has become a really
big thing a lot there's because there's
a lot of flavors of computer security
try this this is only a thought
experiment kill somebody you will find
out just exactly what your digital
fingerprint looks like if you kill
somebody because the very first thing
the police are going to do is they're
going to figure out where were your
digital devices who were you talking to
and what does your digital world say
about you and the police may or may not
beat the newspaper to to that these days
so that's all about forensics
data security is all about digital
rights management and dated keeping
databases secure and making sure people
don't get more than their fair share of
a database there's security information
management which is what your IT
department does when they when they
provision you an account then there's
they also patch machines that's pretty
important there's band-aid security this
is my least favorite kind of security
host based security such as antivirus is
a band-aid the reason we have why we
have antivirus is because the systems we
have leave opportunities for viruses
same with network security the reason we
have firewalls although actually this is
this is the way this is the way that I
explained a security software security
which I'll get to in a moment to
investors what is a firewall made out of
what's what is it what's a computer it's
got some software on it but that
software is very specialized and it's
supposed to be able to take a lot of
abuse well why is that a specialized
thing that did have it take a lot of
abuse that's that's an oddity and it's
something that's not quite right in the
world and actually software security my
favorite kind of computer security and
the reason I'm talking to you about
security is about how do you write code
that isn't vulnerable Knuth is awesome
programming is hard so we end up having
to talk about it so much right because
it's it's hard I tell programmers hey
hey it's you that's going to decide
whether or not this system is secure or
not mostly mostly programmers don't like
to hear that the historically speaking
they haven't been told that they say hey
that wasn't my job yesterday why are you
hey look I've already got this hard
thing to do canoe says it's hard and now
you're telling me I have to do more and
so they end up they start they start
trying to sort of trying to dodge it I
here's may be the very first Dodge the
first Dodge is well hey
security is really part of quality if I
have good quality control over over my
system then I've got good I'll have good
security control over it too so
kernighan as part of trying to explain
why C wasn't a disaster tried saying
well hey look guys it's your fault if
your program doesn't work right you're
not practicing what you would call
defensive programming so here's a
quality technique from Kernighan here's
a c function with it takes a file and a
message and it crashes if you pass it a
null file or a null message so you might
say well I'm going to add some error
handling to that I will I will login
error if file is null a login error if
message is null and only then will i
call this wonderful printf routine that
that you've given me turns out that
doesn't work either this is voluntas
code here is vulnerable as the first
piece of code to what's called a format
string attack where you can actually
overwrite the stack and take over the
process using input that looks funny
like that stuff along the bottom here's
what you have to do if you want to make
this secure you have to supply the
format string it's a little difference
given the input that you have for your
program it may never be relevant to the
proper functioning of your program only
to the secure functioning of your
program you could look at it kind of
like this because quality and security
do actually have a a close relationship
with quality you can't bolt it on at the
end you can't expect the QA department
will deliver quality security is the
same thing you can't bolt it on at the
end so you have to build it in with
quality we're asking is the program
going to do what it's supposed to do are
the users going to like it so with
security though the question is does the
program do some extra stuff maybe it
makes users very happy maybe it makes
attackers very happy too so we have to
shift from the user mindset to the
attacker mindset so
really it's not about what will the
mainstream do with your software it's
about what are the corner cases what are
the things that you can push this
program to do in the extreme we're also
not worried about what we stand to gain
typically when we look at security we're
worried about what do we stand to lose
here's another take at the programmers
dodge so they say okay fine the security
stuff sounds complicated you can with me
of that sounds hard okay so then we need
an expert and the expert can come in and
they can do a penetration test and they
can tell me all of the places where my
software is bad then the penetration
test comes back and it's got a very very
long list of results okay that's that's
too much that's too much I'm not going
to fix a problem with the code that's
theoretical I'm only going to fix the
problem if you can prove to me that a
bad guy can do something bad or you
might say some some penetration testing
results are clearly dangerous fine you
got me I'm going to fix the code other
code I can look at and I can say it's
clearly it's safe the biggest problem we
run into is in the middle it's where you
say show me why that's a bad thing okay
so now if we go back to to a
communication security history you can
kind of understand why this is such a
trap it's because it requires you to be
as good an attacker as your attacker
will be are you trying to play defense
or are you trying to play offense
because if you require playing good
offense before you play defense you will
lose let me illustrate that have you
heard of citibank they're too big to
fail ring a bell so
so they have money and they built an
iphone app and you could go you know
look at your money in the iphone app and
the security testers came back and they
said wait a minute you just put a bunch
of information about my money on that
phone the programmers came back and they
said no no no no no no no that's my
phone to close system it's a walled
garden if you can actually crack in
there and get that iphone or you can do
anything you want you've become that
person we don't we don't need to protect
this any more than this there's no way
for a bad guy to make use of the fact
that there's bank account information on
that on that device because they didn't
think about what else that device did of
course when the iphone first came out
you backed up your device onto your
computer which meant all of your bank
account information went onto the
computer and bad guys really good at
getting on Windows machines so that's an
example just just sort of one case about
where the exploitability trap will burn
you I'll try to generalize that to a
certain extent and talk about Bertrand
Russell's chicken because you familiar
with Bertrand Russell is that the
principia mathematica he sort of the
grandfather or great-grandfather of
computing so Bertrand Russell led to
girl led deterring is sort of where
where we are in history but he likes to
talk about he likes to talk about this
chicken and the chicken has a world view
and the chickens world view is is
created by its history by what it is
experienced so it experiences a barnyard
that has food that has shelter that has
companions and when you ask the chicken
to describe the future the chicken will
describe a future full of food and
shelter and companions because that's
that's what it knows until one day
and that's the same problem that we that
we face with computer security where as
a programmer your intuition about the
way the world works and who wants to
attack your software and what's good
code and what's bad code can change very
quickly but when it does change it's
probably too late there's all this very
negative I want to try and pull out and
try and pull out I love I love Henry
petrosky and this is a tremendous book
it's it's old right now but that doesn't
hurt it because it's not about computers
and it's not about security it's about
building stuff like space shuttles and
bridges and here's what petrosky says he
says success is for seeing failure or
put another way if you want to succeed
you have to know how you're likely to
fail okay I like I like that a lot
because now we can leverage our 50 or 60
years of computer security and how
software systems fail and start talking
about how to make strong systems my
first bit of advice on building software
that's strong is educate developers hey
do you have to if you work for a big
company do you have to take some
security training who had who like has
to take security training as part of
their job yeah just leave your hand up a
little you've your hand up whose
security training sucks yeah that's what
I thought yeah yeah it's really it's
really pretty awful generic security
training is pretty much useless if this
link makes you feel funny don't click it
iiii don't i don't see a tremendous
amount of value in that security
training for developers though looking
at what vulnerable code looks like and
what safe code looks like i think
actually is valuable the second thing
that I'll put on that list is
code review code review specifically
with augmented with a static analysis
tool and i'll talk about static analysis
here just a little bit I this is what I
this is what I did my PhD on and what I
started a company on I ended up feeling
like I didn't publish enough as a PhD
student so I ended up writing a book
about it too I believe in static
analysis even though I'm not in this
business anymore static analysis is good
because it allows you to examine all
paths through a particular piece of
piece of code and static analysis is
good because you can bring some security
knowledge with you as you look at a
piece of code I'll show you what I mean
by that so here's a little piece of
vulnerable code if you have a good
static analysis tool that will say oh
you're getting input from a network and
you're putting in a buffer all right now
you take that buffer you copy it over
into a new buffer and then you call exec
on that buffer well I'm going to call
that a command injection vulnerability
so that little bit of data flow analysis
that that we're doing there is not too
hard on three lines of code it's much
much more complicated in an inner
procedural program with millions of
lines in it but you can do a lot better
at finding vulnerabilities with static
analysis than you can without static
analysis I'll make one more one more
note on on static analysis as as a tool
if I if I could nominate a a banner
carrier for all tools it would be the
chainsaw and i think that the chainsaw
is an excellent representative tool for
two reasons first of all if you've got a
chainsaw you respect the chain saw Yeah
Yeah right I see a lot of software tools
that don't get nearly as much respect as
a chainsaw gets people aren't nearly so
concerned about getting the right result
and not getting the wrong result yeah
secondly people understand that a
chainsaw is a tool in other words you
don't put it down and it does the work
for you you wield the tool and it helps
you accomplish the job
and I would say the same thing about
static analysis tools as part of doing
code review their great as a tool but
they do not make the code more secure
for you I'll make one more note on what
can you do to make your your software
development organization more secure and
actually I posed that I inflected it a
little differently I said what do you do
to make your source secure and I posed
that question to companies on this list
and actually quite a few more uh and I
was amazed when they only answered me
they actually sat down and talked about
it with me and what we found was
actually there's quite a bit of
similarity between the security
practices in a lot of large software
generating organizations I put up Wells
Fargo I could have put up a long list of
other banks to Goldman Sachs for example
and you know those big banks generate a
lot of software as much software as the
big software makers do actually and they
all do very similar things now the banks
tend to be more concerned about making
the regulator happy and the software
developers are more concerned about what
happens when their software goes out
into the world because for instance
Google ships a lot more software into
devices via android then a big bank does
so their concerns are not the same but
they are similar similar enough that we
put together this building security and
maturity model at be simcom and you can
look at in aggregate what do all of
these companies do to be more to be more
mature about building security into
their software
I have parting thoughts that I'll
probably go through until they turn off
my microphone I hope you ope enjoyed
hearing a little bit of history a little
bit of context around building software
but if you're really more I want to go
write another line of code if that's if
that's where you are mentally let me
tell you what to do with the next line
of code that that you write be stingy
about accepting input be very very
mindful about taking input that meets
your requirements and does nothing else
if you do that well you will eliminate
maybe half of these software security
problems in your code second piece of
advice get help with security features
when you go to stack overflow and read
about how to hash passwords you do not
become a password hashing expert in fact
you you make it for you make yourself a
sitting duck so when you need to build
robust security features get some help
from an outside expert the same way
you'd go get domain expertise when
you're building software or about any
other deep subject next on my list
minimize decisions I think that's
probably good advice for for doing any
any kind of software development but it
really really matters when it comes to
security now there are two audiences to
minimize decisions for one is your users
this ssl certificate looks bogus okay is
not helpful so don't force your user
into making security decisions where
they are not going to be able to find
their way through second of all minimize
security decisions for your developers
once you've written the API for
accepting only the input you need don't
leave a developer wondering about what
they're supposed to call make the secure
way the simple way and the default way
okay just one more here's the problem
fundamentally the problem I think with
getting security right as a software
developer the problem is that the
feedback cycles are very very long you
make a security mistake your code might
be attacked it might not be attacked or
it might be attacked 10 years from now
that means that it's hard to learn so if
you really want to do a good job of
building secure software you need to
find a way that you build feedback
cycles into your system in other words
getting now I can explain this is really
I guess I can explain the title of my
talk 50 minutes later I can explain what
this means uh getting there and back
again over and over again is will make
you good at anything and it's
particularly particularly important when
it comes to building secure code thank
you the question goes like this how
would you evaluate static analysis tools
are using a bad one would just give you
a false sense of security wouldn't it
evaluating static analysis tools is
actually very similar to building static
analysis tools I mean maybe maybe the
first the first thing you've got to
decide before you build something is
that you're not satisfied with anything
that's available to you right and how do
you how do you decide in this particular
case when you're not satisfied that
something's available to you UL you need
to look at examples you need to so
here's how I evaluate static analysis
tools I I get some bad code and I get
the good code that does the same thing
side by side and I get multiple examples
of that and then I say well can I find
the bad code and can i distinguish the
bad code from the good code with this
static analysis tool if I can do that
of the time I've got a good one but that
kind of assumed you already know bad
code from good code yes you have to be
you have to know what you're looking for
if you don't know what you're looking
for then you're jacek alee just going to
buy a car the way my wife buys a car it
it's got the right color thanks and
thank you fun I can't talk I enjoyed
very much so how do you if you have a
static analysis tools that tells the
users or the programmers that oh this
software is not secure how do you make
it really explain it to the users why
it's not secure I mean maybe the
software was fine and then I go and make
a modification one particle system and
then security breaks down in some other
part of the system that's not make I'm
sorry i'm not i'm not positive I
understand so okay so you got this you
got this magic static analysis box and
out of it pops a list of things that are
wrong with your code yes add the user
needs to the programming needs to
understand why what what do i do to fix
this a list of things that are wrong
with your code doesn't actually make you
any more secure what makes you more
secures when somebody takes something
off the list and changes it and makes it
better right right and so the question
is how do you go from here's a bad thing
to something that's better right
actually that's why I put one thing in
front of static analysis and that is
developer education developers need to
be able to look at that and say oh I saw
I saw that I understand why this thing
is bad and I know the kind of thing that
you do to correct it what the static
analysis is good for is finding all of
those corner cases right this so it's
it's good for bringing some security
knowledge with it for instance where can
input arrive in your program it turns
out for instance DNS can get information
into your program in some ways that you
might not expect so static analysis is
good for bringing that knowledge with it
but once you've got a result then the
programmer has to be able to act on it
and a programmer who has never thought
about security before isn't going to be
able to do much with that so number one
education number two code review thank
you
