with i know Corey I know you were
recently recognized as go to
distinguished speaker we could
congratulation thank you what was the
first talk you gave it a try for
conference the very first tool okie was
in 1999 he was an orbit in Denmark you
expect when the go to conferences were
called the jello conferences because
they were about java an object
orientation and clinical at all had made
the trek for PhD students where they had
a possibility to talk about their PhD
projects and that's why i was invited to
talk about my PhD projects which was the
relation and the synergy between design
parents and the development of
object-oriented languages how many
conferences have you spoken on
I don't really remember i have spoken at
academic conferences like oopsla cup and
I've spoken QQ in San Francisco Joe go
to in different cities but I have I have
no recollection of how many times it
must be at least 10 so what do you like
about giving talks accomplice where are
some of the benefits first of all I
really like to get talks I like to be in
stage and I like that energy that it
gives me that surge of adrenaline I
really enjoyed it in itself and I enjoy
seeing people understanding what i'm
talking about seeing and being
enlightened or intrigue or having
questions that sometimes I can answer
them sometimes not I like that
interaction with my audience and then of
course there are some side effects of
speaking at conferences which are there
and you're recognized and when you're
recognized you get to do other things
that are funny to you get to get courses
in different cities you you get to speak
at other conferences and people
recognize you at the conference and
would ask you questions and you can have
some very interesting discussions with
people at conferences so I think there's
a lot of side effects to to speaking at
these conferences and for the speakers
would have a book out or something like
that it's fantastic marketing you also
teach obvious universal yes and how does
how does converse speaking teaching how
do they benefit each other are there
things that are different for each how
do they relate that's an interesting
question lemonade depends on what kind
of teaching I'm
more or less related I do i do lecture
style teaching for first-year students
in Java programming and one of the
things that I need to do when I when I
give a nature is to grab their attention
motivate them to listen to what I'm
saying and make them think and for that
I use the same skills as I do when I'm
talking in conferences I try to get
their interaction in trying to get an
interaction with the bigger audience
more than 50 or 100 pew is the same as
it is rhetoric conferences you can get a
hand so they can use clippers when it
comes to the to the teaching and smaller
groups like I do masters course and sort
of architecture and whether only 40
people it's kind of different and and
giving a talk at at the conference
that's more like what you do in the
brakes after the talk just talking to
people who one-on-one so they are
related but it depends on the kind of
teaching but I also teach how to teach
at the University and for that I I think
about a lot of the things that I use
when I give talks at conferences I I
spent a lot of time making
retrospectives about how my talks go and
what would worked and what didn't work
and i can do i can use those findings
when I when I teach other people how to
to teach some people say that the
hallway track at a conference is often
the best part what are your thoughts on
that like the discussions that come out
of that what are the benefits that come
around the immediate benefits are
Percival
I'm talking to each other I definitely
long-term benefits of that too I know
that things happen when people meet and
start talking sometimes I look at the
conferences as as the brakes and and and
that the talks are just things that feel
up in between the brakes you know the
talks are just a thing that intrigues
people to have something interesting to
talk about in the brakes so sort of turn
it upside down and say that the torch
arms race in the conference that takes
place and then the coffee place I know
that things have happened at our
conferences that rails were started
thoughts about rails were started to
learn from participants and you can
mention other things that started and
what I could have started anywhere but
when you when you put interesting people
together to talk about interesting
problems magic house it's interesting we
look at conferences from that
perspective where it brings together a
community it's almost like there is
multiple dynamics at work on one hand
you're coming to learn about specific
topics on the other hand your meeting
with this rich community of people that
have this diverse set of experiences and
there's a lot of benefit to attune I'm
sure there's a question of the interest
by configurable hmm I got an awesome
okay
so when when we create a program for a
conference like this we think about we
used to think about what we thought
people should learn from this conference
we thought about what they wanted to
learn but also what we think they should
learn but now that I've learned a lot
more about learning and teaching I
understand that these presentations that
they give doesn't teach people anything
people don't learn when they're those
presentations what they do is that they
become motivated or intrigue and then
when they start doing things on their on
their own stop programming in that
language or or start reflecting about
what what it would take place or or
discuss it with people in the breaks
that's where they learn they don't learn
while listening to somebody talking
about something but it might initiate
some learning that they can do in their
own interest yeah and that was a shock
to me to understand that I can't teach
anybody anything so if it changed my
changed my whole idea of how to teach
how to go about what to say what to do
you
what was your favorite talk that you
have a conference my favorite tool was
in q conundrum few years ago where I
gave talk about design patterns and
functional languages all happy need
invited me to give that talk because he
knew that I was into design patterns he
also knew that I that I wasn't
programming in functional languages but
he he thought it could be interesting to
see me have a viewpoint on that too the
reason why this was my favorite talk was
that first it forced me to learn a lot
about functional programming that maybe
I wouldn't have otherwise second I was
really afraid of doing it because I knew
that there will be a lot of people from
the functional programming field sitting
there in the audience a lot of the
speakers were there so I was terrified
and I knew it would be recorded on video
so well I had had to do well it wouldn't
just be forgotten but talk went well and
it was not just the fact that they they
laughs at my jokes on the topic made it
go well but also that it spurts some
interesting discussions both on the
Internet at the interview side where the
video is but also sometimes the
conference's I still I still need people
who come up and ask me about it and
without still working and then i have to
say unfortunately no every time not
working on it but i think somebody shoot
and I think somebody on so I I liked it
because I really enjoyed it it was
something I was afraid of but I did it
anyway and I learned a lot from it and
it spurts of discussion and I think and
then motivated people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
