slide here for a few minutes probably
wondering why are there people riding
bikes I happen to really love bicycles
and we're in Amsterdam so it seems sort
of fitting to use this image to say that
accessibility is about people the people
in this image are there's one or two
vision impaired people and L waters
who's piloting a tandem bicycle Steve
sawsan who's blind is sitting behind her
we did an activity where we paired
visually impaired people with sighted
people we went for a tandem bike ride
and it was awesome and the experience
for me as a cyclist having a blind
person sitting behind me talking about
how free she felt as we rode this tandem
bike through San Diego to me this is
what accessibility is all about you
don't always have a blind person sitting
behind you saying this is awesome thank
you for making this accessible but
people are always there and they always
need us to make websites and web
applications that are accessible so that
we're supporting them even when they're
not sitting behind our shoulder you are
here the few of you who came to listen
to me Marcy Sutton talk about accessible
angularjs I'm from Seattle in the US
where I'm an accessibility engineer I'm
actually joining Adobe when i get home
at a new position but i'm also an
angular core team member and for the
past 10 or 11 months I've been working
on angular material design at a company
where I was contractor essentially but
I've been working on accessibility and
angular for almost a year now so today
you're going to hear me talk about
accessibility challenges in angular in
material design and all the things that
I've picked up in the past year my
slides are online at marcy sutton calm /
go to con they're also on github and
they're in the footnote of my slides so
you can access them at any time
accessibility and angular does not have
the best track record I will admit and
this is why I got into it was because I
ability with angular applications has
been pretty dismal part of the community
opinion of angular was that it was
pretty terrible for accessibility to be
quite honest I have a tweet from my
colleague Paul Adam he's holding up an
image of a textbook on angular it's got
a simple HTML template with some form
controls in it but he's calling out that
angularjs web apps are never accessible
because even the books on it start with
inaccessible examples same is true with
the docs there's countless blog posts
out there where if you're showing
something that's JavaScript specific
maybe you're not going to spend all the
time to make your HTML accessible but
what happens as a byproduct of that is
that you are talking about anti-patterns
for accessibility and so each
anti-pattern that makes it into a blog
post or into a text book shows the
person writing the JavaScript that
that's an okay practice so over time all
of these examples have built up to a
culture of inaccessible web applications
but that made an opportunity I saw an
opportunity to make it better and
improve accessibility of angular
applications so that's what we're going
to talk about today a little bit about
how i got into angular i mentioned it
was i saw an opportunity and I wanted to
make accessibility better in Engler
through being loud on Twitter I actually
was invited to speak at ng Europe last
fall and through that engagement is sort
of an in a nutshell how I became
involved with the angular team and they
invited me to work on angular material
full-time so I've been working on open
source as a contractor my last day on
that was two weeks ago so it's still
very fresh in my mind today we're going
to talk about material design and
accessibility and some of the challenges
that I've found in that things that
we've made better by being a full-time
accessibility person on angular I have a
waffle it's a cartoon waffle if I giggle
it'll probably be because I'm looking at
this image of a waffle but this this
image of the waffle actually
marks an important concept in
accessibility and in client rendered
applications so outside of just angular
apps if you see the waffle this is an
important concept in accessibility and
in client-side web applications we're
also going to talk about ng Aria the
accessibility module in angular 1 and
I'm the primary maintainer of that
module I'm working on some improvements
for it there are other people who
contribute it to it as well but we'll
talk about what ng aria is and what it
isn't and what it can do for you we'll
talk about protractor the end end
testing framework for angular and how
you can use protractor to test for
accessibility in your applications and
then we'll touch a little bit on angular
2 which is definitely it was cool to see
the talks this morning on angular 2 the
accessibility story in angular is
already better than it was an angular 1
so I will touch on it a little bit but
primarily what we're going to focus on
is angular 1 and again if you see the
waffle it means it's an important
concept in accessibility material design
we've heard it mentioned a few times
already today I've been working on it
for a while material design the goal of
it is to create a cohesive design
language across all platforms so there's
an android version there's a polymer
implementation of material design and
the design specification is sort of the
inspiration and the starting point that
we use for angular material to say how
should form controls behave when a user
interacts with them or what are common
color palettes and typography and things
that will make it cohesive across all
platforms so because Google is very
committed to material design obviously
it made sense to make an angular
implementation and there is more than
one but the official angular material
implementation is material design for
angular it's at material angularjs org
that's the documentation website there's
a rich community on github lots of
github issues open
and clothes there's some poor quests and
a lot of community activity that makes
it pretty battle-tested it's a very
comprehensive framework some of the key
things in material design and an angular
that are important for accessibility the
first thing that we're going to talk
about you see the waffle so this means
this is an important topic interactivity
things that are interactive should be
reachable from a keyboard they should be
usable from a screen reader this ensures
that people who have disabilities will
still be able to interact with your app
so I have a couple examples from angular
material including a toolbar which I'm
going to interact with with it a little
bit so if I use the keyboard and I tab
on to this toolbar I can actually see my
focus move on to it and then i can hit
different keys and from the keyboard
it's this example is not actually but
it's not wired up to do anything but
it's reachable from the keyboard so my
focus is on this button and then i go to
the next item and it's a checkbox it's
pretty it's a little bit small on my
screen but the the check box when I tab
on to it it has a an ink circle that
grows out from the center and that's a
style that you see in material design
quite a bit so as I move my focus around
the page I get feedback about where I am
and if I hit the spacebar I can toggle a
check box or a switch on and off so this
ensures that people who rely on keywords
or screen readers will actually be able
to use these controls and the seems
pretty basic but surprisingly this level
of support is not common in every
angular material or in every material
design implementation either you won't
get feedback from the keyboard or you
just won't be able to reach it at all
from the keyboard because what happens
as developers is we tend to design and
develop for ourselves and we forget that
not everyone can use the trackpad or not
everyone can use the mouse so we make it
work with a hover State and you click on
it with a mouse we think our job is done
I challenge you to look a little more
or try looking at it from a different
perspective and navigate your apps using
a keyboard and a screen reader so in
starting with the keyboard is the
simplest thing furthermore so that's the
checkbox and switch example the buttons
are also reachable from the keyboard and
I get a little bit of color feedback one
thing I've pushed the material design
team on a little bit is the color
contrast of these and it's probably
actually this looks pretty good on the
monitor on a less contrast monitor or if
you had a vision impairment of some kind
the level of contrast that we actually
get as the styles that are in the
material design guidelines they could be
enhanced more so that's something I hope
to see a little bit in the future
because the color contrast that we
currently have could pose problems for
people who have vision impairments but
at least in the in the interactive piece
of this every every control or button is
reachable from the keyboard and will
look a little bit of how we can actually
make that work but then it's also we can
we can do things from these controls so
I also have some radio buttons let me
make sure I'm on the right item yes so
if I use the arrow keys through this
selection of radio buttons I they are
essentially one control so a checkbox is
an isolated item it will check or
uncheck something a group of radio
buttons are mutually exclusive and so
you want to only select one so if you're
using the keyboard if you use the arrow
keys you should be able to toggle you
know choose a single radio button
semantics actually since we have a lot
of time I'm going to go back and look at
what these actually look like we'll look
in the dev tools to see what makes these
interactive so the let's look at the
radio button example first so the radio
group is is the item that we actually
tab on to and the important piece
I want you to look at here is the
tabindex so by adding a tab index onto
this item because this isn't actually a
native radio button it is a angular
directive and this is really common so
this is why I wanted to drill down into
it and show it to you the MD radio group
is the control that we set up an angular
material to create radio buttons to tab
on to them because an MD radio group is
essentially a div we add tab index of 0
and then you can actually reach this
control and then we use the same
JavaScript to change between the items
but the reach ability with using tab
index is what I wanted you to see so the
next big topic after interactivity which
you can always check if something's
interactive just by using your keyboard
but for screen readers and assistive
technologies it's really important that
we use semantics the problem is that an
angular and also in web components we
can now create custom elements we can
create our own named directives and
that's awesome but we should know
something about what that does to a
screen reader so in angular material the
HTML API for creating a button is md
button as an element so in your you know
in your tag name you just say md dash
button and then put text in it and then
angular material will actually trans
clued that into a real button this is
important to understand that if you were
an accessibility specialist and you
looked at this you'd say wow that md
button is not actually a button and it's
important to know that we are actually
making it into a button and there's some
pros and cons of doing it in that way
but what I wanted you two to see is the
code that have actually renders at the
end of this transclusion process where
it replaces the custom element name with
a native button element so this button
element is reachable from the keyboard
because buttons are native elements they
come with tabindex we don't actually
need to add tabindex on to a native
element it also will fire events from
the keyboard we don't have to do
anything special we can just put ng
click directly on a native button
element so by by knowing that we are
adding the some
it took version this this can improve
the accessibility of our applications
going one step further so the the button
element is a native element another
example would be a native input things
that you get a lot of accessibility for
free because these controls were built
to be form controls but because we can
create our own items and a good example
to take a closer look at this is the md
check box and we already looked at the
md radio button group that was a custom
element that we created that we are
adding all of the accessibility back
into so it's actually a lot of work and
I would recommend starting with a native
input because if we look at the example
of the md check box to make this
accessible we have to add tabindex so we
have tabindex of 0 and what that does is
it means that the the order that your
code appears in your document is the
order the tab order that it will get if
you use tab index of 0 numbers higher
than 0 you have to actually manage the
tab order of everything and that can be
cumbersome so I would recommend if you
are creating a custom control like a
checkbox you should add tab index of 0
and then it will be reachable to
actually say that this fancy div is not
a div but a checkbox for a screen reader
we have to add a role and the concept of
a role is you could think of it as what
does this thing do so this empty
checkbox which is essentially a div we
can reach it now but when the screen
reader user tabs on to the check box we
want it to be announced as checkbox so
we can do that by adding a role of
checkbox and there's all different kinds
of roles you know there's a radio button
role and there's landmark roles and
really cool things in aria which if
you're not familiar with Aria it stands
for accessible rich Internet
applications and I have a resource at
the end of my slides about using Aria in
HTML because it's important that we use
it correctly we can't just put any old
thing into the role attribute we can't
make up roles we can't just decide that
it's the new data attribute
a role is an aria is a standard it has a
set of approved attributes that we can
add so the role of checkbox is one of
these reserved roles and it essentially
announces the thing as a checkbox um the
other thing that we need to add because
this is a fancy div is the aria checked
attribute and so this will tell a screen
reader whether the checkbox is checked
or not you might be asking well why
wouldn't I just use the checked
attribute the checked attribute by
itself it will only work on a native
input so if you had an input type of
checkbox you could just use the html5
checked attribute but because this is md
dash checkbox and it's a custom tag name
we have to use Aria and what this does
this is a good example that is it's an
actual real-life example of where we use
Aria and the idea is that it's filling
the gaps where this is a custom element
and it doesn't have all that
accessibility support we can add the
accessibility support by filling the
gaps with Aria so the three main
components of Aria if you're new to it
they are the role states and properties
the role again is what does this thing
do the states are things like Aria
checked or Aria disabled and then
there's a catch-all bucket of properties
of additional things and I encourage you
if you're if you're at this level you
should be reading up on an aria
attribute when you go to use it I
typically will go and look at something
i'll say i want to use Aria checked I'm
going to go refresh my memory and make
sure i'm using this correctly so that I
know what the keyboard support should be
for this thing so what you would find
for Aria checked for example i'm
creating a checkbox and i'm going to go
look at aria checked and i will discover
that the expected keyboard behavior is
you tab on to the check box and you hit
the spacebar we saw that in my demo
earlier so I hit the spacebar and it
should enable and disable the checkbox
and so that's the kinds of things that
you should know
so another major area of accessibility
and client rendered applications is the
concept of a text alternative how many
of you have any idea what a text
alternative is a cup okay so quite a few
it's kind of a it's a term that once you
know what it means it's like okay I get
that but I want to make sure that it's
not just this jargony speak that doesn't
make any sense so a text alternative is
text that a screen reader user can rely
on to know what something is because if
you're using an interface and when we're
designing things design is not just
visual text alternative is a way to tell
a screen reader user what something is
so some code examples of how to create
text alternatives one really common
example is to wrap text that should be
for a screen reader but doesn't need to
be rendered or doesn't need to be
visualized we can just wrap it in a span
and add a CSS class and there are
differing methods for creating what's
called visually hidden text visually
hidden the method we use in angular
material is I think the same as the
html5 boilerplate example and these are
utility classes that are totally okay to
copy from other places and so the
visually hidden class it just I think it
Clips the text and maybe reduces it to
one pixel high and it like there's this
collection of things that the idea was
visually hidden is that it actually
renders the text but you just don't see
it the old method was to jam it way off
the screen using a left property and a
position absolute I think the the method
for doing that has evolved but the basic
idea is that you're visually hiding the
text inside of some other element
another example of a text alternative
would be the label for a form input so
if we and this is super common to forget
actually I was just looking at the
angular 2 documentation and this is an
item that they forget it's important
that we actually label a checkbox or
radio button so
screen reader user will know what this
control is for and I think in the
beginning we saw an image from a
textbook this is a very common thing
it's the was the problem in the textbook
example was that we forget a label so to
properly label an input this is like
HTML 101 and I'm really sorry that I
have to tell you this but we forget it
often enough that it's worth reminding
you just add the 4 attribute on a label
element match it to an input and then
they will be paired simple stuff for a
button say you've had a button that had
an icon in it and you wanted to have
only the visual icon but the text this
is very common we just we don't want
text we just want the icon one way to
actually label something is to add the
Aria label attribute you could also use
this on the input above if you didn't
have an actual label that got rendered
or wasn't part of the design you could
add an aria-label attribute and it would
label something as well and then lastly
you should add an alt attribute for any
image that is has content and I have
stop waffling and get on with it as my
caption because I'm kind of waffling
right now this is going pretty awesome
you guys um enforcing text alternatives
so I wanted to bring this up because in
angular material I saw again an
opportunity to make a framework a major
framework more accessible so we added
utilities into the framework to actually
encourage best practices and to maybe
remind you if you've forgotten to label
something I cannot tell you how many
people ask me how to turn this thing off
because we all forget leg holes
apparently so the example that i'm
showing is the radio button so in the
angular material docs there are a few
different radio button examples in the
demo one of them is an icon so you could
choose between an avatar the image by
itself does not provide any text so to
label it you have to go one step further
and trying to be an accessible framework
that you have to remind someone when
they forgot an important detail this
utility will log to the console that you
forgot a label that it'll point you to
the node that you actually forgot the
label on and that way you can it can
help you go find it and track it down
instead of just throwing you a warning
and saying hey you forgot to label it
will actually point you to the specific
node and I find that's really important
for actually fixing the thing but a lot
of people think that this is noise and
they don't think that accessibility is
like they do it's just not a requirement
for their app this is really important
stuff because we should be creating apps
that everyone can use and even if you're
just creating a demo or it's just
something I'm hacking together well if
you're just hacking it together these
warnings in the console shouldn't be a
big deal but if you're actually creating
app that people would use I challenge
you to look at your audience and your
assumptions about who you think your
audience is I can I bet you I could find
an example of someone who would use your
fitness app or your whiskey app or
whatever the thing is that you're
building chances are they're somebody
using a screen reader who would need
this text alternative so this is just a
practice that we could use to try and
make more accessible apps that everyone
are everyone who's using this framework
could make a more accessible app so to
fix these warnings instead of disabling
the console like somebody thought they
should do to actually fix these warnings
for the example of the MD radio button I
have the source code without the label
so we can look at this and say alright
it's repeating over some data it's
showing that it's going to actually spit
out a radio button for each item in the
data set inside of the radio button is
the empty icon directive which you can
use to insert icons into things like
buttons and toolbars and radio buttons
but it's missing some sort of text
either the icon needs it because the
icon is the the thing the content either
that could be labeled or we can just add
a label on the parent because the parent
of the radio button is is the actual
control that
needs the label and so what this does
when we label it it it means that the
screen reader user will actually know
what what this radio button is for this
particular radio button so we can see
there is no text at all there's a just
the icon inside of it to actually fix
this warning just add Aria label and
then pulled pull content from that data
set and then it will label the thing
it's pretty easy fix to make I don't
know why it people don't just do it but
because I get this question a lot i
thought i would show you how to actually
fix this so just add an aria-label it'll
make everybody much happier another
major concept in accessible angular
applications is the idea of focus
management and actually this is true
outside of angular as we can see by the
waffle anytime you're rendering
something on the client say you have
views and when you update something it
will rerender the view imagine if you
were focused on a form element that was
in a section of your page that got
rear-ended for some reason maybe you
made a selection and your focus was on
the item and it just it wipes out the
focus so if you're actually relying on a
keyboard it's super frustrating if
you're relying on a screen reader it
makes it completely unusable because you
don't know where you were necessarily so
if it kicks you back to the top of the
page you have to tab all the way back in
and that can make something pretty
unusable so in angular material there
are certain components that we add focus
management into and one of those is the
side nav and I'm actually going to show
you a video of what this looks like so
start this over so our focus starts at
the top of the page and as we actually
i'm going to go fullscreen with this
okay starting the focus at the top of
the page there's a skip to content link
that came up and we hit that the idea
what the skip to content link is that it
will skip us by this entire left side
navigation because it's sort of a pain
to tab through every single item so this
is why skip links are so awesome because
if you're relying on a keyboard you can
just skip by everything and it's pretty
low overhead to add a skip link so we
have one in the in the angular material
docks so we hit that link it will send
our focus into the main the primary
content area on the right and again it's
I'm having to really explain a lot of
the stuff because the color contrast is
not quite high enough so I want to point
out to you where our focus is so now
we're in the the it kicked us over to
the the toolbar as we open this side nav
the direct the component actually has
focused management built-in so what it
will do by default let's play this again
as you open the side nav the default in
this component is it will just focus on
the wrapper of the side nav as a
framework you don't necessarily always
want to send focus to the wrapping item
we had a lot of requests for you know I
need to focus on a specific thing not
that people wanted to disable it
completely but that they wanted to
customize it to their liking and so we
added support for sending focus to
arbitrary items and we'll watch this one
more time so you can see the we hit the
toggle button it opens the side nav it
sends your focus into it and then when
we close the side nav by hitting the
Escape key or clicking on the button
outside of it it will send focus back to
the item that triggered it so the idea
is that your focus is being sent back
and forth and we're managing it for you
and anytime you're writing an app that's
client rendered at all either it's react
or ember or spine or backbone any of
these things this is an important
concept so the code for the side nav the
actual component for the side nav is md
side nav and then inside of it you can
put any combination of child directives
that you want you can nest other things
inside of it for example the the input
text input in England
material the API for this is the md
input container and then inside of it
you could put a label you could put a
form input the thing I want to call your
attention to is this child directive
that we created to make it so you can
arbitrarily focus on whatever you want
this site nav will go and look for the
md side nav focus trial directive when
it finds that it will send focus there
instead of the wrapping element and this
is a pattern that I think we we need to
add it to dialogues any other component
that we manage focus by default we have
to make it a little more customizable
because what something I found is that
there are infinite use cases for each of
these components and infinite
combinations of components and the size
of the angular material github
repository will highlight that but it's
really cool to see how people actually
want to use focus management not just
that like oh that's cool it does it for
you but oh I have the specific use case
that all of a sudden now that this is an
option people are thinking about how
they could send focus to their
components so yeah the side nav does it
the I think the dialogue it has focus
management but it's not as customizable
quite quite yet so another concept in
angular material or in inaccessibility
of angular is notifying the user so
we've seen interactivity we've seen
semantics focus management notifying the
user is another thing that's actually an
advantage in client-side applications is
that we can say you're typing in a form
and you have some error messaging and
your but you're focused on an item you
don't want to send somebody's focus off
to an alert message because that could
be jarring it could be confusing so we
need some sort of web mechanism to
announce changes when something is
happening either error messaging or
maybe you're filtering a list and you
you want to keep the users focus
somewhere but you want to announce hey
you filtered a list there's 13 matches
or something like that so this concept
of notifying the user is important in
client rendered applications for
accessibility and a pattern where we use
this in angular material is the
autocomplete so the the tag name is md
dash autocomplete and what you what it
does essentially is insert an input tag
and then you can wire it up to any data
source either local or remote and it
will add a list of things that you can
as you type filter so pretty important
that a it announced that there are
options but then as you type it filters
more and announces more things so like a
common example would be a list of states
or I mean we have demos for the
autocomplete but the one I have on the
screen is a list of states so I type w
there are four matches and then as I
type another letter it will filter them
more the code for this and the concept
of notifying the user we're relying on
something called re alive and this is
another part of this aria standard and
it's a pretty big concept but it's super
cool that you can add a role of status
there's also the role of alert and the
the levels of re alive there's assertive
and polite and so it's important to know
what these differences are because
sometimes we we have to choose which
level depending on what the user
interaction should be so and an
assertive alert would be something like
a big error like something that you need
to announce immediately would use the
assertive role but if it's something
that's maybe could wait until whatever
the user is doing then you can use this
passive or polite role for an
autocomplete you're in the middle of
typing you kind of need it to tell you
in that second what the error is so you
can actually tie them the two together
if the filter announcement waited until
everything was done we would not
actually know what what it was
announcing so for filtering a list of
states we need immediate feedback so we
use the alert roll or the assertive
setting
so for the autocomplete to actually
announce these changes we have a sort of
a hidden child directive called the
arias status and this directive it
technically it is rendered so if you put
display none on it it will not announce
to the screen reader it has to be
present when the page loads so these are
some things that you should know and the
things that have the aria live roles and
properties on them have to actually be
present and then the idea is that you
just append messages to this element and
it becomes the message center that when
a user has a screen reader running it
will just announce these changes so the
autocomplete there's two parts to it the
HTML that gets inserted by the
controller of the autocomplete and then
there's the the switch in the in the
JavaScript for the controller it will
append messages to this thing and as
they appear and disappear it will
actually just pipe them to the screen
reader so to notify the user you use re
alive it's worth pointing out that
angular loves open source and the
angular one repository is huge the
angular material repository is huge
angular 2 is also obviously on on github
but you can go and contribute you can go
on file issues and say hey this
component in England material is could
be better on Android or whatever
whatever your use cases they love having
that input part of this culture created
ng aria and ng aria is a module that was
created to do some heavy lifting for
accessibility stuff where the framework
should just really handle it for you
like if you're using ng disabled you
shouldn't also have to go and manage the
aria for that so ng aria does that for
you it's been in the framework since
angular 1.3 but there's nothing really a
critical that requires that you use
angular 1.3 like if you're using angular
1.2 you could pull in ng Aria as a
module dependency and it would be fine
but there's some good documentation on
it online
on the dot angular Doc's website to
include ng Aria you just included as a
dependency and then there's actually a
configuration object where you can turn
things on and off you could say i don't
want tabindex i'm going to manage that
and you can just set it to false in the
config object and you just include it as
a dependency right next to angular in
your scripts ng aria adds support to a
few choice directives including ng model
and do disabled ng-show ng hide ng-click
ng double-click and ng messages and
there's some improvements to this coming
in the future but this does some stuff
that makes it pretty useful as a
dependency for example ng disabled as I
mentioned it would be kind of a pain to
use ng disabled but then also have to
manage Aria disabled what this does
similar to the the checked example how I
mentioned the checked attribute only
works on a native input disabled is the
same situation so it will only actually
disabled a native input if you're using
an empty checkbox or fancy div or some
custom element to actually disabled it
in a screen reader you have to use Aria
and that will for an accessibility API
that will actually disable the thing so
ng Aria when you use ng disabled it will
just spit out Aria disabled and update
it as that condition changes so that's a
pretty useful example ng-click this is
one of the bigger things that Aria tried
to fix and it does do a pretty good job
the thing that it's trying to fix is ng
click on a div and it's technically you
could add a click event to a div in
native JavaScript but for some reason
this became really popular in angular
and I think it's because they didn't
discourage it and I have a div with an
NG click on it the method it's calling
is oh no you didn't because please don't
do this because let's look at what ng
Aria has to do to fix this so the
problem with this we have a div we have
ng-click remember what we were talking
about with the interactivity and the
semantics stuff earlier
having to add tabindex to this obviously
that doesn't have tabindex this doesn't
have a key press event on it because the
cliq does not fire on a div that's the
same with native JavaScript and HTML
this should be a button element but it's
a div and this happens so as a
maintainer of ng Aria I looked at the
landscape and said what could ng Aria do
that would actually improve
accessibility of web apps with all the
only thing people would have to do is
add this dependency well this ng-click
situation is a pretty big one and I came
in all excited and optimistic and then I
learned how Harry this is because every
browser handles us differently and so I
am proud to say I introduced my first
bug into a major framework with ng aria
it is now fixed but there is a section
of ng area where it would because what
we did to fix it we add the tabindex and
actually that's already being added by
ng model if you're using that it will
also add it with ng-click but it added
this tab Nix but you still had to go and
add ng keypress alongside ng-click so to
fix that we under the hood if you add
and you click onto a div we will also
bind the key press event and it will
fire like if you're using the keyboard
it will actually fire off your callback
functions one step further we went and
added the button role which is a bit
controversial because you might be
intentionally using ng-click in some way
and so this tried to fix it for like the
majority of use cases but obviously you
might be totally knowledgeable about
accessibility and be doing this for the
right reasons and so this might make you
a little uncomfortable but the idea is
that we can make these clicked divs more
accessible just by adding ng Aria the
bug that I mentioned was that we didn't
actually check whether the element that
had ng click on it was a native control
or not so if it was a button which
actually does have the key press event
it would fire two
callback functions so that was fun that
was a good good time and something I
introduced in angular it is now fixed
and I learned a lot about what this what
it should do how this kind of stuff
happens in browsers knowing that a
button element actually fires a click I
didn't had never looked that closely at
the click event so this is a utility
that really just use a button and then
we wouldn't have to do stuff like this I
wouldn't have to come and write a module
that tries to fix accessibility on the
web because you just use a button and
everything would be a lot better so we
see the waffle again this is a big thing
like use semantic markup use buttons
because the amount of work that you and
I will have to do to make the web more
accessible will be much less okay
projector it's actually taking a lot
more time I thought protractor quickly
is an oj s command-line application it
runs on selenium webdriver you can
choose which test framework you want and
it's great for continuous integration if
you want to prevent an accessible stuff
from making it out into the world I
wrote a plug-in for protractor that you
can use to test your site with the
chrome accessibility developer tools
which is an open source library and 10
and i/o which is an accessibility API it
will run each test that you write it
will run your code against these
utilities and tell you if you have
problems the setup for the protractor
accessibility plugin you can it comes
with the chrome accessibility developer
tools library pulls it down as an MPN
module and then you can just add this
flag of true or false to enable it 10
and i/o is like both of these are
optional but the tenon i/o option is
more robust it requires an API key and
an account the chrome version is free
which I have a little graph in my slides
about should I which one can i use the
chrome accessibility developer tools is
free it runs locally on your machine so
your code won't grow legs the tenon
version is more robust and they have
actually gotten rid of their free
limited accounts now but if you were
actually
testing for accessibility compliance
tenon would give you way more peace of
mind and more test coverage so you might
say well why would I use tenon it's
because it's a more robust set of tests
some testing strategies you could check
for labels so you could check for things
like the radio button example you could
validate that you've used the correct
aria role or the correct attribute
because it's actually just roll it's not
re a dash roll it's just roll and these
are really easy mistakes though like
I've made that mistake I've said you
know role of image and wrote i am a GE
instead of IMG it's kind of my example
that i always go to because I've made
that mistake so if you automate your
testing it will just find this stuff for
you it can find what art watch daria
properties to make sure that they update
at the right time it can test your
interactions and make sure that you have
tabindex or that things are reachable
and then lastly you could check color
contrast which is a thing that needs to
improve in material design quickly some
angular 2 which we've heard already
today a little bit about some of the
biggest changes for the user interaction
side which I'm definitely more in the
user engineering side or UX engineering
there's no more directive definition
object it's more web components based
your binding directly to properties and
not attributes so for things like user
interaction these syntax changes are
pretty important there's no more JQ
light dom wrapper because we don't need
it the web api's have gotten a lot
better in the last five years and then
es6 modules which don't really have much
to do with inert user interaction
they're just cool the event bindings we
used to do ng focus and ng click and
then you know use interpolation and side
of attributes on the native button for
example now we just instead of the ng
focus you bind the event using
parentheses and then as we've this is
actually kind of an evolution happening
with angular 2 right now is the
prefixing of properties
it's not a good idea to just pollute
your app with unnamed unnamed spaced
properties I have an example of waffle
ID whether you would actually prefix the
ID property am i need to actually go and
check but if you had some arbitrary
property that you were using you would
want to prefix it with something and
there's a really cool discussion on
github about the decisions they're
making in angular 2 and you can go and
participate it's pretty cool angular 2
includes arias support so we don't need
ng Aria in angular 2 they're doing a lot
more now to actually include it from the
start and so that's pretty cool we don't
need a band-aid thing like Angie Aria to
come and fix it so I'm excited to see
how this evolves in the future again you
can contribute to angular 2 on github
there are accessibility issues open and
conversations going about you know modal
dialogues things that need input like
they need to be reminded of focus
management and semantics and all of
these things I think there already is a
conversation going but I wanted what I
wanted to tell you is that you can
participate if you aren't already wrap
things up I have some resources in my
slides including using Aria and HTML
this is pretty important for if you're
writing these custom directives like md
checkbox you should know what what are
the rules of Aria the chrome
accessibility developer tools both the
browser extension and the audit library
I just gave a talk on automated
accessibility testing at jas conf and
that was all about that side of things a
little bit about the protractor stuff
and so on there is an official angular
blog post from back in November about ng
Aria and what it what the goals of it
were and kind of understanding where to
get started I have a the documentation
for the protractor accessibility plugin
which I would highly recommend using
because that's just an NPM install
that's super easy to pull into your app
if you're curious to know more about the
intricacies of accessibility in angular
my colleague Dylan Burrell did a really
good series
on the accessible to do MVC application
which is the canonical client rendered
application example but they don't
always have the best accessibility so
that was a good one and then lastly I
have a post about how to audit a website
for accessibility if you're like alright
that's cool talked at us for 45 minutes
what do I do next that might be a good
place to get started that's it question
I did create the waffle yes and it made
me giggle the the waffle is square and
he has googly eye like there I literally
searched googly eyes and that's the eyes
it kind of has like a sponge bob face so
yes i did create the waffle but if you
have any legitimate accessibility
questions i can answer those two sure
the question was about keyboard
shortcuts I think that would be awesome
as long as they work with screen readers
which have their own keyboard shortcuts
I think I didn't go into it in this talk
but there is the concept of a virtual
cursor in a screen reader where there's
a basically a barrier between the user
with the screen reader and the actual
web browser where the screen reader will
catch input so like if I want to hit the
H key to skip around two headings that's
a reserve shortcut for a screen reader
so it might be something to think about
but anything you can do to make keyboard
accessibility better thumbs up for me
