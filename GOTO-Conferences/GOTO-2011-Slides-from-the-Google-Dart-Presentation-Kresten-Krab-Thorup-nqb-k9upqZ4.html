and we're just about to launch the go to
conference this year with the dart
keynote it's going to be really
interesting to see what it is like so
I'll run up there and right after the
keynote I'll come back and do a brief
overview of what was in the keynote
unfortunately we couldn't videotape it
so we'll get some video out there for
you soon see you
you might be loud now we just over with
the dart intro keynote hear it go to
conference and i'm down at my office I
thought I'd just do a quick recap for
you about what was in the keynote with
sin darte and kind of general
impressions so personally I'm really
excited I think this is a really
something that's gonna going to be make
a big difference and you know there's
been lots of discussion before the
launch about what is the art and this is
going to be the next JavaScript where
were what is it going to replace what is
it going at this place and I think you
know from my point of view this is
pretty much everything I hope for it's
very early in the project so there's
still plenty of room to to change it to
to improve it and they're very open
about taking 16 contributions from
people both in terms of feature requests
and code etc so that's going to be
really exciting the next couple of
months to see how this unfolds so what I
brought with me here today is actually
the slide set that they used have it
over here for the morning keynote and I
thought I'd just like to do a quick
rundown of some of the major things in
here so first of all you know dart is a
new programming language it's a new set
of tools and it's an open source project
and it's all that is out there now you
can go download the tools you can go try
to try it and there's a there's a
complete IDE there's compilers there's
there's a vm it's all available for
download at code google com but also
this very explicit warning this is only
a technology preview that this project
is really there so that you know they
can make sure they get this right
they're not intending what they have
today to be the final thing
and definitely i can already see many
things that can you know their needs
kind of resolution that needs not fixing
but that needs to be implemented and and
done so the two guys behind this i did a
speaker introduction and then it was
kind of unfortunate but these two guys
be lot and Lars have been you know
working in this space for like 25 years
and they worked together on a system
called strong shock like 15 years ago or
something like that when they broke out
of sun labs and they work together and
JVMs for a long time and now they're
working together and art in between Lars
block last buck worked on beta self OPM
and v8 recently gilad has been busy
doing java language back for a number of
years and new speak so this was the
agenda they had you know they talk about
motivation why we're doing this what's
the language what do the code samples
look like unfortunately I don't have all
the code samples here because they
switch to an editor and I don't have
that available here maybe Carl can come
up and show some of that later they had
some demos I headed running on an iPad
really cool really really cool demo and
they introduced open source project so
they're talking about what works well on
the web today and the things that work
well with the web technology we have
today is developing small things it's
really nice platform independent that
you have JavaScript and HTML HTML 5 you
don't need to install things it's really
easy to do incremental development and
it's available everywhere it's really a
bit kudus web browser experience so
that's all the good parts now the bad
parts goes in there argumentation you
know it's really difficult to be do bit
projects if you do if you have a large
code base then
in doing that with JavaScript and html5
is really tricky so what's hard is hard
to find program structure because you
don't really have types you don't have
tools to help you because there's no
static types and there's no really good
support for libraries there's no good
module structure the tools can't really
help you you end up editing your
JavaScript system and like text edit
basically so all this stuff where you go
into large-scale development is a
serious lack in current state of the art
and so they're saying that dard really
fills the vacuum something where there's
not tools right now something which is
in between all the other things and I
think that's right because we've this
vacuum has been created by basically
having ten years with no significant
language innovation with a 10 or 15
years you know the the major programming
platforms that we on which is JavaScript
CCR Java were pretty much set in stone
between 10 and 15 years ago and there's
been a lot of of different systems
different different problems that we're
starting to see it wasn't weren't really
covered by the technology which is like
15 years ago so the most interesting
thing here would say it didn't really
explain too much about it say we have a
fragmented mobile platform so what they
mean by that is you know we have Java on
Android we have objects to see on iOS we
have JavaScript based systems and stuff
like web us there's a range of different
ways that you program applications for
mobile devices and you know it's kind of
hidden in the middle of this
presentation but I think this is the
kind of the key to where they're really
going to attack it's not just another
JavaScript this is a way of defragment
izing if so to speak assembling one
programming platform for all the
different arm app
forms so if they succeed in that you
know then they're like really going up
against of changing the world of Android
developers and iOS developers
specifically so they're saying a year
ago they did a little toy project called
spots those with Casper Casper Lunt and
they tried to do a small language which
was like kind of like JavaScript but
with types and they just spend a few
months playing with this and then
decided to go ahead and do it so so
Casper and Lars are really the two
people who drove this from the beginning
so dark getting down to what dark really
is it's a it's a simple object going to
programming language so everybody who's
programmed in java and c sharp or Ruby
or you know you name it will immediately
recognize this language that's very
straightforward as class-based single
inheritance so that's one place where it
diverts from like JavaScript which has
this other notion of prototypes and
delegation it has optional static types
which is one of the things they brought
forward from the strong chalk project
it's also how objects of C has typing
essentially it has real lexical scoping
and this is a punt on a javascript
because javascript has some some strange
issues in terms of lexical scoping where
they're also you know other languages
like Ruby have had issues with lexical
scoping getting lexical scoping wrong
javascript has this this terrible
construct I believe it's called with
something right where you can inject
names into your lexical scope which
really breaks performance badly and then
they said single threaded and I was like
oh no this is single threaded how can
they I can they rule the world with the
new single threaded programming language
but at the core the core model is single
threaded and familiar syntax which means
it's like
its a mix between JavaScript ish and a
little scholar syntax maybe you would
say because it has like nice in line
anonymous functions using an arrow since
x
one of the perhaps are one of the most
different things is a type checker so
it's a different type checker in in the
sense that the type checker does not get
in the way of you running the program in
fact the type checker does not change
the semantics at all you can have a
program full of all the wrong types and
if the program at its core is correct
then it will continue to run so the
types do not get in the way so instead
of having programmer expressiveness
being limited by what they're what the
type system can express you know if this
turns it completely undone saying types
are there to help you you know the
programmer probably knows what the
program should do and if you can get
help by adding help from the compiler
and tools by adding type annotations
that's just good so they put this quote
in in dark you're innocent until proven
guilty so basically that means you know
the compiler the runtime will just let
you a program run even if the type sir
or are incorrect in some way and that's
all so you can see that in that it only
issues warnings there's no type errors
in dark there's only type warnings okay
the types in dart are reified right and
that means that you can actually test if
something is of a certain type so this
is like like an instance of check you
can use the instance of check at run
time to check is this of a certain kind
it's called is in dart and this also
works with generics so if you've been in
java space you might be a no have been
annoyed about the fact that the runtime
model doesn't carry information about
generics and parham parameterize classes
well in dart they do so you can actually
say instance of a list of string for
instance and you'll know if it was
instantiated as a list of string okay so
this slide was about there's a certain
runtime mode that you can enable during
development which will actually at
runtime check these types check all the
types so type declarations become
annotations become assertions well as a
normal production you probably wouldn't
enable that so this is more details
about optional types that I just
probably always said then who I was very
happy when they and we came to this
slide because you know remember hi
before said that dart is single threaded
and I was like oh no or no no how can
you make a model language single credit
but dark has isolates isolates is kind
of like it's inspired by Erlang it's
like Erlang processes so dart has this
notion of running these lightweight
processes and you can run many of them
within the same dart VM and they
communicate by message passing so each
of these is is completely isolated
semantically they have a complete
separate right now at least I asked SP
lot a bit more about the semantics right
now it semantically has a copy
of all the code that's the semantics of
it and use message passing to talk
between them when you create one of
these you get a port that you can use to
talk to it and of course isolate support
concurrent execution so I think this is
just the right model for doing
concurrency programming in a modern
world so dart is not done there's still
a bunch of things that they haven't
implemented or haven't decided what to
do I mean there's no no reflection
support but that's very likely going to
be based on mirrors gula told me that
offline there is various minor language
things like do you have variable number
of arguments they support enums that
hasn't been decided implemented they're
talking about do you want maybe you want
pattern matching as in Erlang because
when you send messages between isolates
you need to be able to decipher these
messages and figure out how to how to
interpret them and what's the oops
connection to chrome it's not in chrome
yet eventually minus stabilizes this
will of course be a vm that's kind of
part of the chrome experience right now
it's something separate you have to
download because this is a technology
preview so the way you can execute the
art is a dart source you can run that on
a dart VM or you can have darts or run
it through the dart c compiler and run
it in JavaScript so that's what they
were demoing we're no demoing this
running on an iPad they add an
application that they compile to
JavaScript and we're running on an iPad
one of the cool new things is you can
also take the dart source and then kind
of pre compile it you could say into
what they call a snapshot and that run
that on a dart VM and a snapshot is like
doing all the things up to the point
where it runs the first line of main so
it'll can initialize theta structures
get code ready
to run and then so basically this tool
that takes a snapshot is a dart VM that
runs up to the point just before the
entry point of your code and then it
freezes that vm state dumps it and you
can load that up very very fast 10 times
faster then if you had to parse all the
code I'd like you have to do in
javascript today so this is like
starting from a snapshot lets you do
very quick startup which is one of the
things one of the issues have been
they've been struggling with in in
JavaScript and one of the things I know
they work very hard on in v8 is being
able to get startup be as quick as
possible so that's very cool new stuff
performance there are some numbers you
can check them out probably you see the
numbers here are almost all below
hundred meaning that this is still
slower than hand optimized JavaScript
for a number of different examples so
it's still not this is they're not like
blowing us away today and saying this
language is ten times faster than
JavaScript insane times faster than Java
but they're still in its kind of in a
comparable reins and this is very early
and large said you know before we call
this a production release I'm I
guarantee you I don't know if he said
guarantee but he said I he said this
would all be faster than JavaScript this
was will see um a little bit about
snapshotting they had some examples they
showed then they showed an editor that
had a full IDE they showed so in between
these slides they flipped to the live
code editing they had have a full kind
of Eclipse paste editor with syntax
highlighting and and aid in for if
you're accessing stuff in a library
which has types on its on its API you
get you get like drop down boxes of what
methods can be called and this object
etc just like you're used to in your
classical ID and
you know exactly the set of features
that that they're aiming for with the
type system the type system is there to
help the programmer and to help the
tools it's not there to make the
language run faster or to be more secure
in a sense let's let's if you use the
type system for those things then it
kind of tends to get in the way of
expressing what you really want so this
is really really really interesting kind
of mix between these and they opened all
these websites there's dartlang.org
where you can go read more about the
code there's dark googlecode com where I
can go download the code and contribute
to the open source project so I think
that all these things that they talked
about today are available there and it's
just pretty darn cool so you should go
check it out I think this is really uh I
think this is really a game changer it's
going to be really interesting to see
how this unfolds there's a lot of stuff
that needs to be done still and lots of
things that we need to help them they
need to finish this project but this is
really really a good start I think I
think it's going to create a lot of us a
lot of interesting things going on so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
