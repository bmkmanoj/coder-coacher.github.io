CRM product we're really known for
cloud-based business software so
controlling your accounts in your
contacts and your opportunities in your
leads and so what so forth right from
your browser and so when we talk to
developer communities I frequently get
questions like you have developers and
yes we have a few you know Millie and on
them and we do have a platform and I
even get questions at some conferences
like like why are you here and it's it's
I get it because like it's like why is
the outlook guy here at a big data
conference like what's what's the
connecting point here and I actually got
exactly that question at an industrial
IOT conference not too long ago and my
response was let's let's talk about a
fridge okay so so my dad is retired and
as a retiree he gets easily bored and he
likes to purchase new toys and things
like that he really wanted a new fridge
and he wanted a new fridge that had a
front-loading ice maker it's really big
deal to him he'd never had one my dad's
life really resolved revolves around
like Sudoku and drinking lemonade and
smoking cigars and drinking whiskey and
two of those things involve ice so a
front-loading ice maker was like that's
a feature he really wanted so he orders
a fridge and the fridge gets delivered
and the fridge gets installed and the
delivery guys leave and he goes to use
his new front loading ice maker and the
front letting ice maker doesn't work
doesn't produce any ice so he calls the
delivery guys and the delivery guys are
like well that's not our job we just
delivered it you signed the papers were
done you should call the store and then
he's like well he calls the store in the
stores like well that's not our job you
should call the manufacturer about your
warranty calls manufacture the
manufacturer tells them to call the
store and so on and so forth and
basically three hours later my dad still
does not have a working fridge nor does
he have any idea how it's going to get
fixed so once again my dad also sort of
having the inner geek within him and
he's kind of an engineer
here and had a lot of time of his hands
what he did of course was start taking
the fridge apart right there in my
stepmothers kitchen and so he's taking
the whole thing apart and sure enough he
finds a tube from one section of the
fridge that was supposed to go up to the
front loading icemaker in that tube was
incorrectly manufactured and it was
sealed at one point and so it wasn't
getting pressure and my dad being my dad
of course cut that tube into three parts
and bore through the section of the tube
and then duct taped the tube back
together and put the whole fridge back
in place and I think his exact words
when I was talking about this was well
it's working better I didn't ask like is
it working as intended he's like a zit
making ice well it's making ice better
so so he had improved it and eventually
like the store was supposed to have you
know a third-party contract and they
didn't know about it and it all got
sorted out in weeks later he finally got
the service appointment that he wants
but this this is an anecdote because
this is not the day one experience that
people want to have with their
appliances and we start looking so I'm
at an industrial IOT conference and I'm
talking about this and as I start
getting to that point of failure they
kind of know where I'm going with this
because we would look at the consumer
side of what is smart this here pictured
it actually a smart fridge is a smart
labeled as a smart fridge from LG it has
two main features which makes it smart
one is a set of cameras that are pointed
inside the fridge so if you need to
check whether or not you have to buy
milk for instance and for some reason
you cannot walk to the kitchen and open
the fridge to see if there's milkman
side you can apparently load up a nap
and check to see if there's frigid milk
in your fridge now I don't know what
fridge they think that will work on
personally my needs robotic arms to move
stuff oh wait you know if I need to know
if i need to buy eggs you have to remove
the three layers of takeout food that's
in my fridge before you can figure that
out but apparently if you really need to
see inside your fridge you can with the
smart fridge the other feature it has
is this Windows 10 style tablet that's
shoved into the front door of it which
apparently does calendar and notes and
you can check your email and I kind of
get this a little bit because fridges
are this like cornerstone of our daily
lives right like somebody's going to
take a post it note and write pick up
Jimmy at 5pm they're going to put the
post-it note on the fridge and that
reminds dad to go pick up little Jimmy
at 5pm and and i guarantee you that's
some household out there that has this
fridge has taken a post-it note and read
pick up Jimmy on 5 p.m. and put it right
in front of that tablet screen right so
I get the functionality but when it
comes to improving our lives and having
this this this kind of touchstone
experience with IOT I'm not really sure
that's the direction smart really needs
to go to and what would be better is if
it had something like the device that we
see here I forget the specific product
name but this is basically a water
detector detects a depth and viscosity
and pressure basically detects the
existence and quality of water and
industrial IOT uses this all over the
place they put this on pipes and pipe
lines so that they know that from point
A to point B that water is where it's
supposed to be and it's where it's
supposed to go now I don't want to
trivialize this I'm not trying to say
that LG could just pick up a couple of
these and slap them into the fridge and
be done with it i'm basically proposing
taking about a hundred miles of pipeline
and condensing it down to a phone call
sorry about that in condensing it down
to a 10-foot appliance right so we're
not it's not necessarily simple but the
technology is definitely there and if
that technology is there the appliance
gets delivered my dad has his experience
see everybody's dying my dad gets
connected back to some kind of cloud
service so now there's a relationship
between my father the fridge and the
service company that's supposed to help
them out and the first thing the
appliance does is it runs a diagnostic
and it says is everything working ok and
if everything's not working ok then it
deter
what's not working okay creates a case
up in the cloud contacts the right
person and then that person calls my
dapped and so now day one experience is
my dad realizes that his front loading
ice maker doesn't work and somebody
calls him and they're like mr. Burke
we're very sorry this is not the day one
experience that we want you to have your
fridge appears to be malfunctioning when
can we send somebody out to do a service
appointment for you and I can't
guarantee you with absolution that that
is in the near future to you but I will
tell you the first company to do that
will make bank on it because if you can
give your consumer the best worst first
day with your appliance you are
definitely going to get them back as a
return customer and if for instance that
scenario where we're taking that hundred
feet of pipe 100 miles of pipeline and
converting it down is not something in
their future another way we could go
about this would be to do what I like to
call the car talk method is anybody know
I'd made you listen to car talk NPR
right so the car talk is these guys
click and clack people will call them up
and they'll be like my car's not
functioning correctly and and then they
what they will ask the person on the
radio call to do is well what is your
car sound like I'm not kidding here then
the person will actually do these really
clumsy like it sounds like go to POW and
click and clack you're like oh that's
your air intake valve like they just
know right away like that's the sound of
an engine that's malfunctioning like
that in theory a mobile app could do
that as well now instead of all of those
sensors we replace with a mobile app we
do the exact same flow we get the same
experience now if you think that sounds
too pie-in-the-sky note that LG is
actually already doing that LG has an
application it's called smart diagnosis
works with some of their dishwashers and
laundry machines I believe I don't think
it works with their fridges yet however
if you start poking around on this the
reviews for this application are not
terribly kind so it's an interesting
idea it's an interesting stopgap I don't
know how great
is going to be for that best worst day
one experience that you want to have
with your consumer for that we're
probably going to have to start actually
wiring things up so what I want to do is
start walking through kind of a more
live demonstration of how this kind of
thing could occur from an IOT point of
view and before we really get into that
I want to kind of break down where at
least from my perspective where I OT
demonstrations have kind of grown over
the years and it actually for me anybody
here ever watch sports night or sports
and I was an early Aaron Sorkin comedy
only lasted two seasons it was cancelled
very very early on I believe you can
still find out on hulu I highly
recommended it's actually pretty darn
hilarious and has some great writing to
it and was in the late 90s and there's
this episode of sports night where they
think that the company is in trouble and
so in order to figure out if they need
to do something because the company is
in trouble they basically set up the the
modern or what was modern at the time
equivalent of a Google News Alert right
so they have a news alert and they're
waiting for something to occur and the
ongoing joke during that episode was
this line Jeremy says there'll be bells
and siren sorry bells and a siren then
we'll know we're in trouble and the
humor is that the concept that something
from the internet could call off bills
in a siren is so bizarrely black magic
that the fact that the characters
believe that this is possible makes them
look like country bumpkins and it would
be 1999 that the British line for dinner
Kevin Ashton would actually coined the
phrase Internet of Things and so one
year later we're kind of off to the
races when it comes to this concept of
having a mesh of sensors having them
connected up to the internet and then
having some kind of delivery system back
to the humans so that they can actually
do something about it now there are a
lot of different demos I'm not saying
that this next slide is going it was the
apex of sophistication
when it came to doing Internet of Things
demos however my entry into demoing IOT
to enterprise clients was was a 2013
when a friend and colleague of mine
recrawl Berg got the IOT zone up and
running back at dreamforce our annual
conference and at that time it was very
maker right like it was a lot of
raspberry PI's and a lot of Arduino and
things like that so the first ever
enterprise IOT demo that I ever did was
a makey makey keyboard so making manky
keyboard makey makey keyboard basically
takes the same electronic fundamentals
as a potato clock all right so the the I
believe it's a lime it was either a lime
or an avocado on the side there that's
the that's the negative ground and then
each the bananas have plants in them or
you know chords into them bananas have
high potassium value so they do a good
high electronic charge and you get
positive charge so when you press the
banana it changes that charge slightly
and then that little white thing that's
the makey makey breadboard and a detects
that did that change so if we converted
it to modern IOT right this is a cheek
guests getting electronic fluctuations
from something off the in real world at
this point just happens to be a banana
so you press different bananas it goes
through the makey makey makey makey
converts it to a sound and you have a
banana keyboard and note your this has
zero business value right there's no
connection there's there was no other
step to this this was the demo and dream
forest is hardcore salespeople business
people CTO CIOs and they loved this this
was amazing to them because it's the
first time they're really seeing do some
changes in the real world have a
computer really respond to them so then
my next demo wasn't much better to be
honest but I felt like I had to do
something that might at least possibly
have something downstream
from what we actually do as a platform
and so and this is basic Arduino 101
stuff it's a Python script running off
of art the Arduino itself hooked up to a
breadboard bread board is connected to
the LED light and and the script changes
a value and the LED goes from 0 to 1 and
either turns on or turns off and the
concept there was that we could call
into our api's and but doing the same
downstream response we could have that
led light go on or go off and once again
this demo killed even though once again
0 attachment to the actual business by
2014 we had gotten much much better in
2014's this is a internet creations i
unfortunately i saw this demonstration
live i forget the gentleman's name and
but internet creations set this up and
this was really the first time that I
saw what was going to become kind of the
stock IOT demo and so you have a laptop
you have a Raspberry Pi and i'll get
back to this here in a socket and then
you have some kind of smart device or
not even necessarily a smart device just
a device it's somehow connected to
either the laptop or to the Raspberry Pi
or possibly Arduino board and then you
have a complete loop so in this case in
this situation he created a case in
sales for that sales that case in
Salesforce would have a specific kind of
priority if it was high or above the
light that we see on the screen on the
slide here would go so it's like a
hockey style light so like you're in a
the concept was you're in a year in a
situation we have a lot of people
working cases you want everybody in the
room knowing that suddenly a high
priority case was submitted and now the
things is the actual light going off and
this is good right like this is very
it's small in scale but it's it's it is
the loop we have some kind of data
coming in we are processing it through
the cloud we're doing something
meaningful that somebody can actually
react to and then we're doing
in the real world itself like turning on
a light and this would be calm for the
next year I think I probably saw seven
eight nine ten demonstrations almost
exactly like this in some kind of laptop
pi Arduino smart appliance and and it's
just kind of changing out the variables
but we would always kind of go through
that loop and so when it came to 2015 I
wanted to start changing things up a
little bit I'd already gone for making
Mickey keyboards and we're getting into
hockey lights and things like that and
so I went into what i called my most
complicated demo ever and what i wanted
to do was show that we can truly
leverage the internet one of the things
that caught me about having a laptop and
a raspberry pi and a smart appliance is
that everything's right here in front of
us and that's never the case in IOT
right the fridges in my dad's house the
pipeline is in Alaska the the car that
we're tracking is driving all around the
place we are we are using the internet
and in order to interact with these
things so I wanted to separate the
experience out a little bit I wanted to
have multiple points of integration
around one use case so instead of laptop
pi device laptop pi device device device
phone laptop have a lot of different
touch points because once again we get
text messages we talk to mobile apps we
get emails we have Alexis we have
smartphones we have these things which
are becoming pervasive in our lives and
they can all kind of interact with us in
different ways so how how do we break
out of this concept of just one flow and
one loop and so also showcasing how I OT
can satellite around lives and also
demonstrating because this was another
difference we saw in 2015 was the
consumerization of IOT was really
starting to hit so in 2014 we had shown
more demos of industrial size I ot's of
robots we had a fridge that could detect
the the correct
inventory as well as the temperature of
the fridge and things like that by 2015
we had at the IOT zone a smart cat door
there's a smart cat door out there and
the first time I heard that we were
going to demonstrate a smart cat door I
am like who it's kind of like the fridge
right with the cameras I'm like who
really needs a smart cap don't like how
smart can a cat door be well what they
didn't tell me is that the smart cat
door is also associated with a smart
RFID chip that they put in your cat so
it's not just a smart cat door it's a
smart cat it can do things like the cat
leaves and then you want to close the
door and then you want to wait till five
o'clock but let's say the cord the cat
comes back you want to make sure the cat
eats its dinner because oh by the way
it's also connected to the feeder so the
cat returns and it usually goes back out
but you want to make sure it eats its
dinner before it goes back out the door
closes waste for the feeder to go off
and then lets the cat back out and at
this point I want to move to the suburbs
and get another cat like this is too
much fun like I can actually control my
cat's behavior from the cloud possibly
better than I currently can without the
cloud so so we saw this kind of actually
like richer use of consumer style
devices and we had things like this was
it was the first time that ever showed
Alexa live at a conference as well and
so I wanted to show that we're not just
talking about pies and sensors and
things like that but we're also talking
about the kinds of things that we might
find in our actual home and so let me
now let me kind of be honest with you
here and describe a little bit about
what we're actually seeing here and
we're going to we're going to start with
Alexa first thing we're actually going
to do so this is actually a flick it
will start with a flick so the flick is
actually a Bluetooth button it pairs
with my phone the phone makes API
requests so if I want to turn off the
life x bulb here and I'm also doing this
to make sure my internet connection is
still lurking ok so I turned this on
goes the bulb bulb gets the life x lifx
turns off alexa
I do that all the time Alexa is also
connected to my smart devices at home
now Alexa comes in two different flavors
either what I call a first-party
connection which is where it's built
right into the product and you can say
very natural things to her like Alexa
turn on the study light or as we're
going to see a little bit later we can
actually also design very custom skills
around Alexa so that we can have a
little bit more precise control over
them now i also have i showed you a
little bit earlier I how I do have a
Raspberry Pi here okay this raspberry pi
actually has very all right we'll get to
that in a second so this Raspberry Pi
has almost nothing to do with the demo I
just I just want to call up at it's here
this is actually what it does is the the
PI 3 has a Wi-Fi and then i added a
Wi-Fi point so this is just a Wi-Fi
access point and it's the bull here
doesn't like like hotel-style Wi-Fi with
browser logins so this just allows me to
actually I probably shouldn't say that
because I think that's violating like
three EULA's or something like that this
allows me to have a common access point
across IOT devices let's put it that way
okay so it's not actually controlling
anything it is just it is just using a
little bit of internet magic to make
things a little bit easier now what is
controlling something is what we just
saw there so while I was talking my
phone went off all right well the most
reliable part of my demo is not working
so let's maybe it doesn't like the new
mirroring I'm not sure that's okay what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use and
use an audience member I've actually
always wanted to do this I need a
volunteer from the audience so volunteer
from the audience whoa
I just lost it okay time is it there we
go can you read what it says there
that's the alert notification that I
just saw here we go that's not on so
it's it says am a zombie in white dress
shirt table decor has been detected on
your desk it may be dangerous a
Salesforce case has been created so a
zombie has been detected on my desk and
a Salesforce case has been created so I
want to be able to easily investigate a
little bit more about what's going on
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use our friend here my echo to
help get that done however what I want
to do is be able to do that in a way
that I can also kind of visualize what's
going on this is actually something that
i put together first as a bit as a demo
for some of our our internal case users
i want to be able to say alexa ask
salesforce to get my latest cases alexa
alexa alexa open case number one more
information
set priority to high set status to
escalated chatter prioritize next
meeting I'll be very interested to see
which he actually posted chatter ah this
needs to be Ryan is the next move exit
okay so Alexa now gives me the ability
to look into my sales force cases list
them out not just see what is going on
but to actually interact with them now
to be very clear and I'll walk through a
little bit of how this is happening a
little bit more if I did not have my
browser open the results would be the
same so the interaction with the
Salesforce data is is separate from the
ability to track what's going on from
the browser point of view the browser
point of view just allows me to be
interacting with with Alexa while also
wandering around room maybe I'm fixing a
computer maybe I'm talking to other
people and I can go back and I can see
the results of those interactions in a
live way now what we didn't get to see
because my phone was not there is let's
go to related unfortunately this is a
little bit clunkier on my on the browser
so ahead and let me save this
specifically zombie one and save that
and now go back into this and it's
little tiny see I was wanting to show
this on my thumb because it actually
shows up a little bit more on my phone
now this is lot this is my desk back I
live on the north side of Chicago this
is actually the zombie that is actually
on my desk on in here in Chicago and so
what happened was when I turned on the
study lights it changed the
fighting in my office and the change in
lighting itself actually detected the
presence of the zombie and I'll walk
through the loop here in a second but
what I think is really important is the
fact that i am here presenting to you
and there is apparently a zombie on my
desk so i would like to be able to get
rid of the zombie that is on my desk and
so in order to do that I am going to go
into my feed go home okay and you can
see so now this is our chatter chatters
like our enterprise facebook / twitter
offering allows us to have this kind of
conversation with our data you can see
that not only my phone was getting
updates chatter was getting updates as
well it gives me this description a male
zombie in white dress shirt with the
table decor has been done there I don't
really care what shirt it has I just
want to say kill that excuse me I need
to put my glasses on because I have no
idea what i'm typing right now trust me
if you turn 40 you're going to know what
I mean kill that zombie and then just to
make sure we're serious we're going to
use the hashtag really and I'm going to
hit comment and give it a second the
light has turned green and the light has
turned green I don't know what internet
I'm on this seriously the phone is
supposed to be the most reliable part of
all of this and it's just like doesn't
even care ok so the I know but I know
something has changed so the light has
turned green let's go back to our case
here in Salesforce see there are we oh
my wife just texted me yay so I think
that's success if we go back into
dangerous object and we go back to our
related information of course there is
all of the stuff going wrong is the
stuff that should be like rock solid all
the stuff that is
supposed to be strange and scary asst is
working just fine yes let's go ahead and
replace that now we look to see oh hey
that's actually a really good picture
because sometimes the zombie is just
knocked way off screen and so it just
looks like maybe my wife just casually
removed it from the cameras view so
you're not entirely sure what I just
showed you was real but you can see that
the zombie has actually been dealt with
now I do kind of apologize because this
is kind the the really exciting part of
this is zombie getting killed right and
you didn't get to see it so and I
appalling to get a good setup for that
and it didn't really work and so my my
compromise and I almost never do this
but my compromise to you is this this is
this was the first version that I
actually got up and running correctly
okay so that's the zombie actually
getting shot actually on my desk
slightly different setup but they did
that the exact same flow so one of the
things that I was trying to do here was
to provide something over complicated to
the point of believability that there
are so many moving parts of this that
you have to think this is something that
might actually work in the real world
and if that sounds strange to you then
you probably haven't done a lot of
consulting if you've done a lot of
consulting you've done a lot of work for
other people for other clients you know
that they don't come to you with simple
straightforward scenarios because if
they had simple straightforward
scenarios they wouldn't have to hire you
they hire you to do the weird
complicated stuff that requires you to
do object detection and change light
bulbs and have voice recognition and all
of the stuff in the same flow and so the
one the big goals from moving
from laptop raspberry pi light was to
make things over complicated enough to
think I have this weird scenario maybe
IOT Kinberg for me maybe that's not so
weird maybe it's actually a solution
that we can actually put together so
what was that what what did we just see
actually go back to that was the first
version of it the the first thing that
happened was Alexa controlling my lights
back at home so when I said told Alexa
to turn on the study lights study is
actually a group so in life X you can
group bulbs so this light bulb was in
study group so was the light bulb that
was on my desk so when I said turn the
study lights on we saw this light go on
we also the desk light also itself
turned on now I do also want to just
give a call out lifx is like when the
least known smart bulbs and I love them
and I love them for two reasons one is
that each one of the smart bulbs here is
actually its own Wi-Fi point so unlike
some of the smart bulbs which we lie in
a hub to do all the real internet
interactivity each one of these has
what's called it it's actually a
hardware variant of what's called an
electric imp electric imp makes these
little breadboards that basically have
Wi-Fi on one side and I Oh on the other
side so it's good at two things staying
on Wi-Fi and then talking to some other
kind of device so I don't need another
hub or anything like this I can actually
just connect this right to the Wi-Fi
assuming it has an access point that
it'd actually likes they also have a
great API which allows me to either when
I was doing this trick here where I'm
calling just that see all the all the
real stuffs done so now there we go so
we're just randomly changing the color
we can either talk to the group or we
can talk directly to the light bulb when
the zombies getting killed that's
talking directly to a light bulb and
it's just a put request to a specific
point in API with a bearer token to get
that done back at home I've got a
Raspberry Pi running nodejs the core
library that was making everything
actually work now this was a big goal of
mine the the 2015
version of this had my wife basically
pushing buttons on Arduino to like move
the demo along kind of like faking out
sensor data and it always kind of bugged
me because I'm trying to do this over
complicated to the point of
believability thing right well I want to
show that we're actually detecting an
actual object changing on my desk so in
this case resemble jas takes two images
and it tells you what the threshold
differences between those two images and
so all day long it's been running there
and the dark it's been dark and it's
been dark and it's been dark and then
the light goes on and it sees that it
has a different image and so it says now
the image has changed the point where
now I need to figure out what is going
on with this the within this image so
it's not a very smart library but it's
very good at detecting the changes
between two different images then we
post up to our platform using our REST
API that's what created the Salesforce
notification and then the second trick I
didn't want to just say something had
changed I wanted to actually be able to
detail what was it that we were actually
looking at and my big goal was to be
able to get the words a zombie put
intelligently into the demo flow
somewhere and thankfully we did the way
that the API is working here is this is
an API from cam fine cam fine actually
has an iOS and Android app if you want
to play around with it they do object
recognition so you shoot take a picture
of the Alexa or a glass or the bulb or
your phone and you send it up their API
and they try to guess what is in that
image and they're actually it's actually
pretty impressive it's really good at
like well-known landmarks and things
like that and it's pretty good at
products and that was one of the reasons
why I went ahead and used them because
they're relatively reliable and knowing
that was not just an action figure that
it was a zombie action figure actually
on my desk now there are different
routes that you could take here object
recognition basically just says
wholesale what am I looking at you could
also do something more along the lines
of facial recognition there's an open
library called opencv there's a great
project out there called kitty dar kitty
dar is a nodejs application to determine
if a cat is in the picture and it does
it by recognizing
cat's face so it's trained on 10,000
different images of cats and it knows
eyes are kind of like here and a nose is
kind of like here and a cat's mouth is
kind of like here and that picture kind
of has those traits so I think that's a
cat and I'm going to tell you that I
think that it has in a picture now those
are two very different routes of trying
to determine what it is that you're
looking at I started the opencv route
and I didn't finish it because
determining what's a zombie is actually
a lot harder than the terming what's a
cat because we don't identify a zombie
between eyes and nose and mouth we
determine a zombie because it's gray and
its skin is falling off and it's met
list missing an arm so it's a very
aesthetic quality to it that says this
is actually a zombie so I'm using Kevin
fine here they actually have a great
developer experience they give you like
500 credits for free just to try things
out but just to note there are many
different ways pun intended to skin this
particular cap the case control using
echo this is using our REST API so like
I said all of the really meaningful
things that we're doing up against
Salesforce those are just rest calls
into our system authenticated using
OAuth updating the case and then it
updates another record and we have a
streaming API and so the streaming API
is pushing real time down to a client
the very handy thing about this is the
PI on my desk does not have to be live
on the Internet it doesn't have to have
a public IP to interact with what's
going in the cloud because it's just a
handshake up to the server so as long as
the client can see the server the client
can get notifications in real time from
the streaming API so as long as my pie
is Internet connectivity it can get the
messages it sent those messages to the
chrome extension the chrome extension
itself is what was kicking off the
changes that we saw within the browser
and then to kill the zombie same basic
trick except it was looking for the
chatter feed the chatter feed with the
hashtag really kicked the message over
to the streaming API the streaming API
then determined what was in that message
if I use words like kill murder may
shoot aim destroy if it found any of
those
it would then talk to the usb dream
cheeky missile launcher that is on my
desk which is what actually shot the
missile which is what actually took out
the zombie and then finally an apex call
out over to our life expo to see those
changes and we needed luck I'll talk
about that how are we doing on time
about 10 minutes ok I'll talk about that
in a second because what could possibly
go wrong what I mean really what for
instance would it be possible that on a
Saturday afternoon when I'm trying to do
the full end-to-end version of all of
these new things moving together would
it be possible that the 64 gig card that
I have in the pie on my desk at home
just melts itself have no idea why I
don't even know how it could possibly
happen it's just gone no computer on
this planet will even recognize its
existence all the code all the OS
everything got so little things like
that when you're setting up a
demonstration like this can kind of
throw roadblocks along your way that's
probably unlikely what really can kind
of go wrong first of all internet
internet internet why did I build an
entire raspberry pi just to duplicate
wireless access point because that's the
kind of thing that's wanted to talk to
making sure that we have connectivity
across all of these devices is the only
way that we can keep all of these touch
points up and running so if the if the
power went out at my home boom half this
demonstration would just not be visible
right also if you do start playing
around with this kind of stuff and you
are going to use USB devices as opposed
to a lot of pi devices actually go to
the GPIO slot if you go through the USB
devices do note pies have notoriously
buggy USB hubs pi ones don't even go
near them pi tues depends on the device
you want to bring to the table pi 3 s
actually seem to have stabilized it
considerably and by buggy what I mean is
that you will get your code up and
running and especially like the webcam
the webcam is taking a picture taking a
picture taking a picture taking a
picture when I try to run this on a PI
to it would take a picture take a
picture take a picture and then freaked
out and it would drop connectivity to
the USB device until you restarted the
entire hub you had absolutely nothing to
do
so there's no work this it just is right
so that just happens cam fine can be
kind of slow that's why there was a
little bit of a pause in the middle what
I did a little song of the dance and I
hope that my LED bulb actually updated
itself it's also very random it's kind
of interesting because you will give it
the same picture 5 times you will get
five different responses from it and I
kind of like that because you know it's
actually thinking about what's in your
picture and trying to evaluate it and so
it's not 100-percent durham
deterministic so i was very happy to see
that we actually got zombie in that
section and then finally Alexis usually
spot on but every now and then every now
and then she just doesn't want to talk
to you and then finally I have two cats
at home which I don't recommend for any
kind if you try this at home just put
the cat somewhere they're jerks I don't
know what to tell you however do note
that multiple points of entry like this
so I had the Alexa I had I had the light
bulb I could control this demo for my
phone I could control it from my laptop
I actually had multiple routes to go so
for instance one part failed where I
couldn't show you what was on the phone
but we can kind of duck and dive a
little bit so doing something that's
over complicated actually gives you a
little bit of odd level of redundancy to
it where if one part fails you can cut
you at least have enough demo on the
floor to actually get things up and
running and then very very quickly to
overview the kinds of the ways that we
communicate with these different devices
Alexa is has a brilliant developer
experience if you can put together a web
server and you can put together an
endpoint that can grab a JSON and return
a JSON you can put together an Alexis
skills amazon will take you down the
road of using lambda I use our product
Heroku and it's actually very very
straightforward I prefer node because I
find no to be very fast and light weight
to build this kind of response server
but if you can put one out there then
you can start taking it with us and I
have published none of my right you can
keep them all private you can talk to
your own devices you can just tinker
with it to your hearts as I highly
recommend the Amazon experience I also
highly recommend the life experience
like I was saying they do not require a
hub and they have a first-rate api out
there they also have not only the HTTP
API they also have a landing
p I so you can communicate from your sub
network directly from code to the light
bulb itself I personally use this as a
trick at home for four party guests
where I'm playing a game on the PC and
the light in the pc game is driving the
lights behind me in the living room and
it's actually very low latency because
it's all through the land and so it's
just shooting UDP packets over the
network as opposed to going through the
cloud and finally Raspberry Pi is really
just Lennox if anybody has been kind of
tentative about tinkering around with
Arduino zor kind of a special little
style of cat and I'll talk about that
next but if you can code Linux or if you
can google stack exchange to code Linux
you can probably mess around with a
raspberry pi and then finally for some
of the weirder devices like the IMP that
we would find in a life x imp actually
also has developer boards you can get or
Arduino ziff the Arduino has ed embed
it's called which is a product by arm
you can do the development in your
browser in the cloud and then you it
either delivers it right to the browser
to the device or you just plug the
device in through USB and it reloads the
device itself so if any like I said this
the intent of today was not to teach you
a bunch of stuff but to pique your
curiosity if your curiosity is there the
other part of this message is
development on the stuff has never been
easier it's never been easier to pick up
the stuff and just run with it so I'm to
remind you to please remember to rate
the session from the go to application
and do we have any questions ok any
questions
No
thank you
I was wondering you mentioned how those
lights don't have the hub owner if you
plead with the hue of that so I have not
played with the hue not through
prejudice but just through time
management however I I so I say this
tentatively but i will say that we are
looking at potentially replacing a huge
mo that we were doing for one of our
upcoming conferences with life x i think
the message with hugh is that if you are
playing with it purely from a consumer
point of view setting up the lights
hooking them up through alexa hooking
them up to your phone it's actually
probably a more seamless experience that
you get from lifx if you're looking at
it from a developer point of view I
don't think he was quite there yet all
right thanks everybody thanks for having
