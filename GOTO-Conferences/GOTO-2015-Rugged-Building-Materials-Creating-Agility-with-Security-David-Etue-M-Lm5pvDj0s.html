building materials and so we know we've
we've talked about you know already how
do we write good code how do we deploy
quality environments and how do we
choose our components wisely you know
what else is left and so there's some
you know I look at security i think
there's there's sort of two sets of
security tools there the security tools
that are the prescription drugs a lot of
what we do in security is unfortunately
correcting for problems elsewhere in the
system not blaming people for that that
some of the vendors are the ones to
blame for that but a lot of security if
you go to a security trade show it's you
know fixing its producing doug's to fix
things versus healthy lifestyles and so
I would try to talk about some of the
things that are the healthy lifestyles
of how we we build secure components
into our infrastructures and I think
this matters matters for a couple
reasons so one is whatever you call it
security and compliance matters I will
talk in the next slide that that how
these are holding up the DevOps
movements and certain organizations and
the other thing I think it's important
one of the reasons i think you know is
josh said i agree that I think DevOps is
a 30-year opportunity for security we
will never see a security opportunity
like this again in many of our lifetimes
because you know so I was Iran computer
security globally a general electric and
and as a overseeing organization that
size from a security perspective one of
the realizations I had that if you don't
know what basically the the visible ops
principles if you don't know what you
have how its configured and how it
changes building any security control on
that top of that besides crypto is
pretty difficult the house on sand
problem and the challenges and security
no one in security owns configuration
asset and change management and the
beauty is DevOps is do it cloud and dev
ops are the first things that are
fundamentally changing those those how
we do that or enterprises and that's a
great thing for security and so I get
very frustrated scooping will say oh
DevOps you know we're doing three
deploys a day I can't do a code review
that's horrible like well they're
actually building reliable repeatable
infrastructure which is the first step
doing security well and and so that
really excites me on what frustrates me
is when I see surveys like this that you
know CA did this survey at last October
and and security of compliance concerns
was seen as the the number one very
early they are 1425 Enterprise folks
largest barrier so regardless of what
motivation you know Josh just near
vector Josh the slides whether it's
hearts and minds money whatever
motivating you security is keeping us
from getting this done a lot of
organizations today and moving forward
and and one of the challenges is that I
think we've talked about security has to
improve to this is this is not hey you
know we've got security right now
there's a breach a day you know our
current approaches security clearly
aren't working and so if the teams are
coming in saying hey you should take all
this the 20 years of best practice and
security and build those in I think it's
appropriate to push back and go wow well
those don't seem to be working very well
as it is and cloud was it was a big
prove ER of that that yeah you know I
think most in almost all cases DevOps
has a cloud component to it and and I
think one of the challenges distributing
that they're having trouble dealing with
cloud so even before you get to the
complexities continuous deployment just
the fact that this exists in a public
cloud environment or or environment
where the you don't necessarily trust
the system administrator there's fuse
like security data sovereignty and
compliance that are better dragging on
our cloud deployments and if we're
dragging on cloud we're really going to
be dragging on on DevOps so we'll talk
about some of the components today of
how we can help it up a picture in his
presentation this morning I've kind of
left hand side of this this is for
presentation he and I did a couple years
ago that the left hand side sort of maps
again the security controls and here's a
network security host security that tiny
little line of application security data
security identity identity and energy
security and and some rough views of the
size of how much money spent and then on
the side if it's hard to read but you
know that basically platform as it was
our service platform as a service of
software as a service and when you look
at where the Security office spends
their dollars in most organizations
today it's the bottom layers of this
stack
he go asked firewalls intrusion
prevention systems any virus systems you
know you can't send you know Oroku a
firewall doesn't really work very well
you know that that the tools that our
security teams are used to building and
deploying have to change and the good
news is if they change up the stack it
actually works fairly well for micro
services and it actually makes us more
agile that one of the big challenges
that we have in general operations is
that we end up to tide and two bounds to
the infrastructure that we're running on
and you know containers and micro
servers are excited because they bring a
portability that that you know if
there's an outage or if there's a more
attractive environment to run inside of
we can move our code and security has
been horrible to port if anyone's ever
been through you know the migration of a
sock or a firewall or an internet
connection our traditional approach to
security we're not very my gradable if
we actually focus on the higher levels
we have to have a chance to get not only
do security more efficiently but also to
do to make our infrastructure more
portable as a whole which I which i
think is very exciting so you know I
think one of things important is
building bridges that one of the talks
that that Josh and I recently did was
talking about how security teams could
build alignment across the organization
and the CTO the DevOps teamers was one
of the case studies inside of that talk
but we talked about a number of the
different different areas and you know
one of the thing that I as I look at the
DevOps opportunities is our security
teams want automation too they might not
know it yet you might need to educate
them they might be be saying different
words but if we look at if you if you
were to give your security team
requirements for them for them to work
in your environment you know we want
things that are orchestrated we want
things that are API here driven and
provisional that there that the security
can be automatically assessed there
doesn't have to be a human who comes in
and reviews and looks at this and said
hey is this okay or not to deploy the
change advisory board it should be
automatable it should be portable and it
should be risk-based or appropriate I
think as we get to crypto we'll talk
that a lot of a lot of security
standards don't take
you know risk into mind and the idea I
throws fast and this morning you're
talking at the average life the
container being zero minutes or one
minute the the idea I've had this
conversation a lot of times in big data
environments that for saying oh well
you're working with you know customer
data and this is you have to have these
17,000 controls before you can deploy
this like well I'm going to take this
data I'm gonna spend it off to a
thousand machines the attack surface
will be there for one hour and I'm going
to turn it off and delete it all so you
know the the risk of that being live for
an hour vs. into perpetuity is very
different and we so which enforce our
teams to think differently what you when
you talk to the security team they're
saying well you know I want my security
closer to the data that you know
protecting random infrastructure is not
so you know is not stopping adversaries
so protecting what matters where it
matters as important cost of compliance
so part of the reason you know I'm a
vendor now I i I've been a security
practitioner both at the operational
side as well as a security officer
compliance is a is the the worst part of
security these days in many cases
Security department's have become the
chief compliance checklist officer not
the security or risk manager
organizations there are there are trends
across all of security about lowering
the cost of compliance that that in many
cases we're doing security like things
like segmentation and in our data
centers not because it's the right thing
for security because it reduces our PCI
audit scope that the cost in both the
time and cost of compliance is a big
issue with security analyst productivity
much like you know that if you're if
you're you have experience in DevOps you
probably get ten recruiter calls a week
because there's not people out there
security analyst are as rare that
someone who actually understands
security infrastructure what's happening
in an incident when an adversary is
doing we have very few of these people
and if you go to security conference
there's 80 startups that all they're
doing is workflow to make the analyst
more productive better inventory and
asset management's more uniformity that
we taking complexity out of the
environments faster updates and patches
to the to the heartbleed conversation
and and most security people if they
don't have this on their list it
shouldn't be work with you don't want to
be doctor knew that that most people
hate to say no and they have to it's
their job but the in many cases but they
hate to be dr. nettle and
we look at these things there's there's
actually a lot in common that the big
challenge today is that and I'm I'm one
of the vendors that that has some
products that have this problem is
there's a big gap between this desired
state and security running as code I was
was talking with Sharon this morning
that if you did internet security you
know in kind of the mid-90s when the
internet took off the internet went from
this toy to something that really
mattered from a business perspective but
we didn't have any tools of how we
managed and scaled internet security and
website security and people I feel like
we're in a very similar place now that
that we have things that matter they are
driving immense business value but the
tool sets haven't evolved to where the
point where they have gooeys and have
automation of the things that you need
to make them work and and so there's
there's a lot of I think the security
teams I think chan's talk was great and
how we need to bring these together to
you know the security is code concept is
something that that needs a lot of work
and I would encourage your teams to get
involved in so i'll talk about first
this is a couple of core security
building blocks that that should be part
of your plans and as you architect
solutions and I'll go through them quick
and they're going to dive into some more
on each of them so you know so first is
identity if you don't know who or what
is doing things or more importantly
failed to do something that failures are
important that that that's a very
important attribute for understanding
security implications controls on what
privileged users and privileged
infrastructure can do you know I think
the particular the Snowden incidents put
a big focus and security on the
privileged user I think we're missing
the concept of privileged infrastructure
and privileged code if you look at what
you if you look at what automated
deploys can do there's privilege there
if you look at how we centralized
infrastructure if you control the AWS
account or the vm VMware management
layer or the storage infrastructure you
have immense control on both security
and the operations of the organization
and so you know separated using least
privilege are important components in
that encryption is something that has
higher on the stack has really brought
back what cryptic crypto that really was
was in banks big banks and big
governments
people that used it all of a sudden you
know we're seeing people 10-person
startups using the st. wanting to use
the same encryption infrastructure
because of the impacts that could have
we'll talk about roots of trust and how
crypto plays in these environments but
crypto has a couple of different
functions you know one is what crypto
allows you to unshare in a shared
environment so if you if you encrypt
something and you maintain the keys you
can eventually put that in hostile
territory and a nun basically
unshare that data and that could be
because you have internal separation
that you don't want a database admin to
be able to see you know you know
customer information it could be because
of compliance concerns with your cloud
provider a third party you need to
illustrate to your auditor that you know
that healthcare data can that be seen by
the by it admin at the cloud provider
more importantly when I hear people say
when I work a lot with customers and
cloud and they'll say well I don't trust
amazon or Microsoft and what that really
means is I don't trust the government
agency that could compel Microsoft or
Amazon to turn forced to turn over my
data and then obviously the adversaries
is that their their separation that can
comes if if encrypted data is taken and
there's not an access to the the keys
and crypto is well applied it provides
so strength of resiliency and then those
great that you're Adrian mentioned
logging and auditing that you know we we
need to you know we have granular views
of what happened way to realize things
or things are going to go wrong we're
going to have incidents and the ability
to understand what happened remedi ate
them and learn and to not repeat them
that log uniting date is important I
think there's a big opportunity to
automate the demonstration of compliance
this is an area where again I I kind of
term I turn off and people talk about
compliance but if the data we have
auditing is an incredibly manual process
today and if week the one of the best
ways to go to best friends in security
is to automate something that an order
is making them manually do today you'll
have you'll have a friend for life so
there there's a number of reasons we
need these components here so as you
look at identity you know they're there
are a lot of solutions for humans
there's a there's additional space
called identity and access management I
call it the ER p.m. secure
it's immensely complex your vendors like
yeah IBM and Oracle and CA that have
these ERP like systems that take data
from HR and contractor systems and put
roles and and you know and provision
that out those are those are sometimes
useful there's a new cloud I am space
that's much more that yeah that's that's
much more provisional and manageable and
the good news is a year ago if you were
talking about provisioning API is with
these folks the answer was Oh put this
in active directory and wilke off from
there and in the past year you know
they've gone from you know this kind of
enterprise directory approach to oh
here's how our solution can be
provisioned here ap is from managing it
there's been some great evolution in
this space and one of these eyes
encourage folks is is you know solving
identity for everyone is a really hard
solution solving it for the the you know
the privileged users is a really good
place to start that you know he or she
you could deploy is God if those
creative that account is not well
managed you know if if you have a shared
root account doing employees that's a
problem so the this is a great place a
good easy place to start there's a lot
less solutions out there for system
services processes and things in the
Internet of Things you know that we have
been talking folks about what you know
how do you do device ID management when
you have a million devices and Internet
of Things this is an area where we're
things there's there's not a lot of
off-the-shelf solutions today a lot of
the identity vendors will tell you their
stuff works I think you'll find that to
be not always the case the good news is
is we need you you IDs or something
similar for pretty much everything we
deploy if you're going to play and
manage a thousand of something you need
to be a uniquely identify it and find it
so we have some principles here that
that we can work off of and and what's
also understand is is you know
understand privileged code that if we
have things that you know that a code
can hit go and and deploy or unda ploy
that that code has as much power as a
privileged user and so understanding
those identities and you know so looking
at the credentials the to the carrier
modern production stack tend to be a
great place to start that you know the
the amount of people that I've seen that
have spent tons of time on app sec
and then you know doing massive deploys
an AWS and then have you know a common
path a common bad password for all their
AWS account even turn on multi-factor
authentication that that if you can
control the production stack you win it
doesn't matter really real good Cohen or
not so you know the production stack is
an important place yet to look at manage
identity first one thing is that
actually amazed me as we as I was
preparing for this presentation is in
there's been a lot of thought Thaksin
around the DevOps community around
secret management and there's a bunch of
products and open source projects that
call themselves secret management the
servers and what surprised me I couldn't
find anyone that actually wrote a good
definition of a secret and I need to
work on I want to work on one myself but
but I think some examples of secrets I
think everyone knows an encryption key
is a secret now passwords are secret API
keys tokens any you know the anything
that you want to keep hidden from
someone else is a secret and we need to
manage those things and some of those so
some of the questions asters you know
where are we storing our secrets where
is it used you know who or what is
authorized to use it and and you know
what does it auto eyes to do and that
lets you then have you know to to the
misuse cases comments have checks to
make sure that these things are used the
way they're supposed to so if we talk
about what you should do let's talk
about how you you know how not to
protect the secret so the you know first
thing you shouldn't do is embedded in
source code and bonus points if you been
in source code and then post it to to
get you get search when it was rolled
out in 2013 was one of the greatest
tools for security red team's because
you just search for begin RS a private
key and and you'd be amazed at the
number of things it's better now but in
2013 it was a gold mine of encryption
keys yeah a dimension of API keys you
know i mean amazon has had to have a a
pre another Cal Fire's headtube programs
that actually examine public
repositories because their customers
keep posting their keys so it's funny
but it's it's too real so people go oh
well I'm not gonna put in my code i'll
put it in a configuration file or script
next to it same problem
and the other thing is you know that
people try to be more creative and one
things we'll talk about is doing crypto
wrong is almost worse than not doing it
at all that they'll take the key and and
obfuscate it or better to hide it
somewhere and and you create operational
challenges yourself and you really don't
don't improve security so if you're
doing any of those things please go back
and fix that so so how do we protect a
secret this is long I won't read it it's
in the slide supposed to conjure as a
start-up in the US that's what Achilles
building with these secret management
servers and they did a great job I have
no affiliation with them but as I was
doing the research I I thought they did
a great job of defining you know how you
protect a secret now self auditing you
know granular controls encrypted when
it's at rest unique keying a number of
very important attributes to it you know
professionally audited crypto so you
know real quality crypto and one of
these i'll add is that one of one of the
one of those fun things you learn master
security team is to is to argue about
how you protect the secret to the secret
server that see there is a secret that
is a recursive problem ultimately you
need to authenticate to the secret
server and an addition is that these
distributed distributor secrets if you
can derive them those youyou adsr great
mechanisms that they should have least
privilege and so you know you shouldn't
have a common here if you shouldn't have
one key that that can open up you can
allow every instance across the
enterprise to take something and cause
an action that being able to make this
granular is one of the key things but
you want to mess your security team the
the recursive secrets the secrets is a
is a is a fun fun conversation so so how
do you manage these things well so in in
the you know first lot of people go to I
do it yourself and if you don't know
what you're doing don't that but I have
seen some DIY things that I put one of
them in cloud solutions Seussville that
have actually done a really nice job of
saying you know what a secret something
I can put in a file I have you know i
have i have object storage like s3 i
have i have strong identity and access
management controls around us
re and I have you know it's a service
like Amazon's key management service
that they built their own they rolled
their own and if you have the skill set
of research do that you have possibility
but I think the good news is there's a
lot of other solutions out there that
are coming that you don't have to so
there's the traditional crypto key
management space and during the day I
work for Gemalto formerly safenet
Gemalto is identity and data protection
division and we have a number of
products here and and your traditional
key managers are really good at managing
keys manage life cycles but you yeah
they're they're not they weren't
necessarily API driven is scalable is
that they need to be you know with
something I work with every day inside
our organization is making sure we're
investing to do those things so you have
to look there they're great for
encryption keys but most people don't
know is there's a standard called kmf
the key management interoperability
protocol that was designed by the
storage industry because the storage
vendors didn't want to be in the key
management business they would said hey
how do we can monetize this and let
people buy a key manager came up has
this concept called a blob and so you
can make pretty much anything a k-map
object so there's the concept even if
you're not using came it but something
that's really useful to look at because
this concept of a unique secret or a
blob that doesn't have to comply to you
know and RSA key you know private key
structure other things you can do cloud
solutions have have come about so amazon
has I think it's been the leader in this
space cloud hsm as the you know
something that I've got to spend a lot
of time personally with that yeah is was
the first time where you could actually
put an encryption key in the cloud with
with a high audited high degree of
confidence that the cloud provider
doesn't have access that key their
separation between the cryptographic
function that the end user has and
Amazon is a cloud provider what they
could do amazon also launched KMS which
is a here but more of an infrastructure
for a service for their services as well
as has application and a REST API s4 for
applications to use there's the 80's s3
approach i talked about their IM system
what I concern may get to be careful
about is is we talked about portability
if your service offering comes from your
cloud provider you have to understand
how you would switch later KMS does not
make it very easy to take your
do something else with it cloudy HSM
allows you to as long as it's to another
safenet HSM and the same can security
configuration which is also a pretty
high bar Microsoft is rolled out as your
key vaults very similar so the the great
scale and management not asleep
portability and there's a ton of other
solutions you know conjure that
mentioned has a secret manager hachey
Corp is built a product called vault
written and go that's that's that's
pretty exciting it's early but but but
very exciting square open source their
key Wiz solution which which basically
is a treat secrets as files pretty
innovative approach barbican is part of
the OpenStack initiative it was
originally designed as a shared secret
manager for the OpenStack infrastructure
but what were what we're seeing is
people evolving an infrastructure
starting to use that for other non other
non OpenStack services so there's some
innovative development going on around
barbican there's there's some chef vault
projects there's some pretty interesting
things as he know your capabilities and
your security needs we're talk about
crypto assurance levels the next level
you know it cloudy hsm is the highest
security you know crypto model you can
have in the cloud it's also one of the
most expensive and the most constraining
architectural II whereas you know key
whiz but I think some people say has
some security concerns but it's not
designed for sure and so if you look at
what square has square also has
applauded called Bletchley that is to
that exposes their h SMS so
understanding what what products you
need where is important so so one of
things about crypto is you know crypto
is scary that's very is cryptos one of
the few places you know you can easily
shoot yourself in the foot if you
encrypt something and lose the
encryption key you've self-destructed
your own data so it's really useful when
you want to put data in the cloud and
you decide you're done with it you just
want to delete the key and not worry
about the data life cycle when you
wanted that data doesn't make for a very
good day when you have to explain that
you lost all the data and there's a lot
and the other issue is a lot of people
spend a lot of time deploying crypto and
then miss key management important key
management principles and end up having
encryption implementations that are very
valuable so you know the beauty of
crypto is this the one security control
getting you if with if you take encrypt
data and put it in hostile territory you
have a mathematic reliability of that
data you know based on the research and
implementation of it so very useful
control but has to implement it properly
so you know my way all these topics
could be full day full day workshops so
gone through these at a high level be
happy to dig in more offline this is a
really important concept to understand
and we again you can dive in more but if
you look at encryption yeah the idea it
comes back to well what is the quality
of the encryption key and encryption
implementation so there you know there
are things they call trust anchors so
hardware security modules are probably
the most common you know so hsm say the
ABS cloudy HSM there is you know trusted
platform module xin laptops and servers
the tpms that have some of these
functions but the idea of an encryption
of a trust anchors it's something that
can create you know first thing to do is
you can create a high quality encryption
key so that often means a certification
authority is said this is actually a
true random number generator
post-snowden I have to talk more about
number generators than I ever care to
but you get a high quality encryption
key and then you have some options to
what you do with that that if you these
things can vault a key they can hold a
key in here where that where that key is
never exposed and and that's you think
from a high assurance model you have a
key and a safe if you want to use that
key you have to send the data to the to
the to the key to be used very high
assurance architect can be architectural
e constraining you know these things are
fast but they're not between you know
your application and memory and flash
and flash drive fast so there's some you
know but that doesn't mean you can't use
them so the idea that you know that on
the right hand side this high assurance
model where the application or workload
uses the the key in the HSM or in the in
the trust anchor you know is is a
important model for for high assurance
models and if someone comes to you and
says oh I need a Phipps you know 140
debt you know Dutch to level three
implementation of crypto this is what
they're talking about the good news is
you can you can actually change ease to
get some of these benefits without
requiring the same architectural
concerns so if you look at what if you
look at a lot of those secret secrets
management projects what they'll say as
they'll say oh well we you know we'll
take every secret you have in
will encrypt it and will store it in
some sort of management layer and then
we'll take that layer that that
encrypted key and will encrypt it again
down here so now you get the key
generation quality and the ability that
you you can you can delete one master
key and have the entire hierarchy
disappear but that you can actually
deploy keys out to applications to micro
services to at the workload level so
there's a number of different ways that
that crypto can be deployed and you'll
hear considered like people say things
like you know if phipps levels I from
the US government to become cavity
international standard for how these are
rated and there's level one which is a
software implantation level to which can
be achieved in software on a reference
architecture but is generally done in
hardware level three and four that are
hardware only environments and you can
mix and match you know how you handle
these but you know the key the key this
is understanding what are the you know
what level of security do you need that
you know this is incredibly valuable but
can be also very expensive so you know
switching on to logging and auditing
that this is this is one of the areas
where I think most humans that are
boring but it's something that's really
essential to security and it's a great
starting point errs are talking about
for the automated compliance
conversation that if you as well as
testing if you can produce rich data a
security team should be able to do
certain assessments just off of that
logging data of whether it's you know
deploys configuration environments and
this is a place I have immense hope for
their apps community because this is
something that is is core to what you
know if you're going to deploy something
to roll it back you have to have
knowledge and ability to do that and so
this is a place where I think most most
of operations or relations well
securitizations can learn the question
is is you can UK are you capturing the
key attributes so the you have the six
WS who what where why when are you
putting logs somewhere that is secure
tamper-evident so the you know the the
if you're logging and leaving them on
the server in a directory accessible by
the same user the application those
aren't secure logs so are you putting
those someplace that that you
can prove that the logs are the logs and
this is a place where again if I think
we can work to automate a number of the
security task today that are that are
incredibly manual and painful and and so
this is a place I think there's a lot of
hope it's actually one areas when I'm
talking to security team is about cloud
the opposite conversation is to tell
cloud to tell security teams this is
where they should if they're not doing
cloud they should start is take all your
logs and stick them in the cloud that
everyone is everyone security net
complains they never have enough data I
never have enough log data they don't
know what happened they don't have no
storage to keep it you know it they get
they get 15 days of logs you know they
need they need six or 12 months to go
back and find attacks so this is an area
where I think there's a lot of a lot of
commonality and what needs to be done so
in closing brothers always like to end
with sort of an apply or take away how
can we walk out of here and make an
impact so I think first you're finding
common ground with it with the systems
on security and compliance automation
that we all want to take you know none
of us have enough time to accomplish
what we need and we all want automation
and so they it's a great common point to
say hey you know we may not agree that
whether or not something needs a code
review before it goes live but what can
we take and automate today that makes
all of our lives easier you know for
focused on the privileged user of the
infrastructure that if it can commit
decommit you know create delete the
things that that are you know that have
the largest impact and the widest reach
are a great place to toys if you have a
secret make it one the there is all
there is a you one of the areas the
security perception of the DevOps me is
that there's not a lot of discipline
around secrets and I think there's
whether it's true or not in your team
there's a lot of examples out there that
that that's support that so if you have
a secret make a secret and and don't
take crypto lightly one of the beauties
of these cloud services for crypto is
that you know five years ago to do
crypto you had to be a crypto geek and
and no one can afford to have a crypto
geek embedded at every team now you know
there are services that our API driven
that are enabling you to do this better
but if you do it do it well anything in
closing making security portable that's
something your security team has to do
with you but the idea if we can make
security portable we can actually make
security more agile as we
as we move along so I think there's a
there's a ton of opportunity hopefully
these components you can see some ways
that take home and build bridges and
improve security today so thank you very
much your time and look forward to the
panel
