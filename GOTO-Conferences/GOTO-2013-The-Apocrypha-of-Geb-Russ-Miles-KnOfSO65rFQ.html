here to talk on the programming tools
track I get an opportunity to share with
you the sort of tool that I like to use
to do and I think it's kind of
undervalued it's not necessarily used
well enough or actually being used
anywhere near its potential so what I'm
going to look at is Jeb and the first
thing to do mist if I think is the word
Apocrypha as in rock or what well it's
all about why this word well I didn't
know the title wasn't mine suggested by
a good friend of mine and so I looked it
up on Wikipedia and the answers for that
were that it's either of dubious
authenticity which would be unfortunate
and so I started to wonder what my
friend was implying secrets or
non-canonical well it's starting to move
in the right direction but I'm not
trying to keep things secret and finally
I hit on one that works which it was
obscure so what are we looking at some
of the obscure features of Jeb's so in
the beginning we had the book of Jeb now
first of all when you do a search you
may encounter this particular book of
Jeb which whilst being absolutely
wonderful book it's also something that
may end up making your head feel a
little bit like this or even like this
and if you are and if you find in your
head is starting to feel like that then
you maybe you've hit the wrong book what
I'm referring to is the book of Jeb now
the book of Jeb is a great online manual
for how to use yet but unfortunately
whilst it was being developed and put
out there it has been somewhat ignored
so an aspects of it been ignored in
favor of other aspects and so I'm going
to try and throw a light on those
aspects that I think have been
downtrodden for far too long okay at the
same time as Jeb being developed we're
also looking at building things that's
just j unit and some of the madness that
was ensuring after the after j units
usage instead this was janet was then
becoming Spock which was where sanity
rail it rains here we have as i socked a
spock definition it's very similar to
the janet definition and I think you can
understand the simplicity and the Clara
see that it contains unfortunately Spock
and Jeb led to what can only be
described as a that's plenty enough of
that thank you yes it was a tragedy in
that people assumed implied that you
needed one with the other because it was
too tempting it was tempting to have
jayden Spock and unit testing and a test
ability of websites and Jeb's ability to
automate the usage of said websites so
unfortunately people are taken the book
of Jeb and focused very much on the
first feature they one number one
feature which is his idea of web testing
and unfortunately there hadn't got much
further than that because it was so
compelling well if you've got is people
using a lot of Jeb for web testing and
never getting any further along in the
line in the definition of what Jeb is
for okay so what I'd like to do is to
spell the fact that people think Spock
and Jeb are some way closely related
that's that Jeb is in some means a child
of Spock it is not it should be taken in
isolation oh there's something but
people think it's an inheritance
relationship it certainly is not please
don't if you take one thing away it's
that Jeb is so much more and please have
a plan you have to go with it ok so I'm
focusing on everything else beyond web
testing primarily and so my hope is
after today's talk there will be a new
hope
for Jed
gen 4
automation
whoa there we go now that's enough of
the graphics and v6 and sporting if
anyone had too much coffee beforehand
I'm sorry okay so this is a little
diagram I've talked about it a few times
i'm going to use this diagram the life
preserver to explain the code on your
look at so i'm going to write a very
small Jeb script I'm gonna write it
because these guys do typing freeform in
talks I can't so instead i'm going to
show you some code and basically gloss
over it and say it works it's on github
i will point you at it okay but the idea
here is I have a little script that is
doing something incredibly important to
my life it is going to search for all
the chuck norris references on a couple
of different search engines and because
i am pretending for the sake of this
talk that they have no rest api i'm
going to have to screen scrape
unfortunately i have to dirty myself
with that particular technique so in the
core of my life preserver I have my
search for chuck that is my job that's
what I'm trying to do and so that's what
it looks like we're still not
complicating the diagram too much
hopefully we now have some integration
sources I have some components that
going to need to talk different search
engines to get my Chuck answers okay so
I have my google equivalent and there's
a few things to point out on these i
have my pages i'm using the page object
pattern very familiar to people who have
used jab at all it's a wonderful way of
encapsulating hiding away the intrinsic
complexity of working with a particular
vague source such as an HTTP HTML page
okay so i've got my google 1 i've got my
big one because I'm interested in
answers that are duplications and I'm
going to also use postals law which I've
mentioned a couple of times how am I
using Apostles law whenever I introduce
postals law into a conversation it gets
confused I don't know why it just does
maybe it's me posters Lord for me is
being very very flexible in what you
accept and trying to be rigorous in what
you give out that's a very small summary
and when I'm talking about something
coming in and going out I'm talking
about the form of something we talked to
I talked to a gentleman a couple nights
ago about this a form of something not
necessarily the actual data types
involved you can still be rigorous in
the data types you except in my case
postals all really isn't a complicated
implementation
it's basically being flexible about what
I accept from the page and trying to
find a bunch of elements that I match
upon so anyone who simplement ation
apostles lawyers complex needs to use
jab or selenium arguably okay so I have
my age to be sources they are looking
good that's how they look on the life
preserver let's move on we need some
more we need something else to my system
we need some dependencies unfortunately
Jeb is a dependency it's something else
I'm going to need to use it's a nice
little library so why don't I grab that
I'm going to use a wonderful little tool
called grape because I'm doing is
writing a little script you can see a
common theme I think to the talks today
of writing little scripts that do one
thing and they're really helpful and can
be chained together here i'm just
writing a little script so what I want
to do is say yes I have dependencies
sorry about that but I can declare them
and go and grab them from a repo and
with a little bit of config inside my
scripts okay so now I've added my
dependencies well I've added my depend
kisses because unfortunately I can't
spell and then the last thing I've to do
is configure things so yeah I'm going to
use firefox just for the heck of it so I
have a configuration domain the bottom
there is another integration domain it's
an integration between my core my search
for chuck and the outside world which in
this case is my configuration so I have
a Jeb config and I'm done ok that's it
to write a nice little script that does
some screen scraping get some
information does thing with it and then
you can happily chain it together
because it were using standard in
standard out and I'm sure some other
people its money will be talking about
how wonderful that is too so a little
programming tool gets me going quickly
in summary book of Jeb JEB is about so
much more than just testing it's a great
tool for working with all sorts of
different sources took the HTTP HTML
sources that you want to then pass out
as appropriate as possible it's not just
about Spock although Spock is wonderful
and I could have done just a session
just on Spock because it would be fun
the source code is there don't worry I'm
sure the slides will be available at
some point so you went to note it down
the important part is try and remember
how to spell Apocrypha once you've got
that down the rest of it is relatively
straightforward if you want the diagram
I have it you can even get my spelling
mistake and there is a whole bunch of it
additional techniques around this sort
of thing inside the book I'm writing
only
warning books in alpha alpha for me
means i have titles but it and it's very
much fluid and work and changing almost
every day but if you're interested it
it's up it's out there thank you very
much I don't know how long that was but
that is me done that was ten well
questions yes good why not one question
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
