Conway's law is because I break it so
often when you break something like that
it must not be a law oh there is there
is a school of thought
especially in the micro service
community about something we're calling
reverse Conway's law and the idea is
basically we're saying the architecture
of your system will drive how you need
to organize yourselves if your
architecture is sort of a centralized
architecture big components shared
fields you're going to have an
organization that has dedicated
apartments to these things you will have
long integration cycles so on the other
hand you have a very loosely coupled
system you may have very small very fast
teams it tends to be the environment I
tend to set up so this is a talk about
doing produces primary oh I put together
about a year ago for basically a
conference in Perth Australia and it
sort of was because I was I have a
varied background this chart sanitized
all the data it basically says I'm
really old this is more or less what I
really do I am a change agent coming
back to Jamie's talk this morning I am
the guy who goes in there and breaks the
culture and rebuilds it I'm very good at
beg doing that in fact my job
description at the Daily Mail was a hand
grenade being thrown into the
development if you can ever get this job
title you should take it because it's a
quite a bit of fun so this is kind of
what I do is and to some degree because
I've kind of lived on the edge of
technology my entire career a lot of
things you're going to hear about today
are going to be very strange they may
not be appropriate for you yet that's
okay but my best guess is within the
next three to five years they would
you'll be doing a lot of things I'm
talking about but basically it's kind of
all bleeding edge things so I go to a
lot of conferences I speak to a lot you
know it's kind of my way of touring the
world and I see a lot of topics
certainly micro services are very hot
topic now there's dedicated conferences
to it the one in Berlin is quite
excellent
there's also almost all conferences have
at least a track or several
presentations like we do this today
about micro services but I'm hearing a
lot of other topics you just heard what
about docker
in fact the entire conference is
dedicated to doctor and some of these
other topics but you're also saying you
know agile into some a lot of new agile
stuff coming out it's kind of a next
generation of agile so we're a very
aggressive agile I have a version I call
programming anarchy
but recently Eric Meyer and for the last
year or so has been talking about one
hacker way which is again a very much
advanced agile process it's worth your
time so that's all going on and then of
course the business guys can't be left
behind they have their own version of
agile it's called lean startup or
Minimum Viable Product and and they're
getting a lot of press have their own
conferences about these sorts of things
as well and also all of a sudden now
we're having your new titles becoming
popular again DevOps which I find kind
of entertaining because as I say in a
minute I think it's the DevOps guys
getting together having a conference and
it's interesting when you go to these
conferences because it's basically just
Ops guys there's no Deb's and his Ops
guys saying oh do I have a job yeah I
still have a job do you have still have
a job yes we still have jobs not sure
that's actually true but the other thing
is full stack developers all of a sudden
you know something that we've been
trying to go away from since the 70s
we're coming back saying maybe it's a
good idea to have these guys that can do
everything there's a common theme here
everyone if people are doing this in
order to go faster they're trying to go
fast from the time something is needed
til I get it out the door
this is what's driving all these
conferences and all these topics and all
these technologies so I want to talk
about that now why do we care about this
well you know one of my favorite ways to
sort of describe what's going on to some
degree and what's changed and across my
career is this model that comes from a
guy named Dave Snowden being named
Snowden is means he does not want to get
any more first page hits he used to get
a lot of first page hits he doesn't do
that anymore but he's a Welsh guy he
actually divide the world into these
sort of segments he said problems can be
classified and he called a simple
problem one where the cause and effect
relationship is very straightforward if
I turned the light switch the light
comes on I turn it back off it goes off
he said they're also complicated
problems there's a cause and effect
relationship there but it's much work
polluted it is the domain of the expert
he understands what the cause-effect
relationship is he is your expert but he
doesn't stop there he says there are
also problems that are complex and
chaotic a complex problem is one where
the cause-and-effect relationship is not
discernible yes if this happens you
probably figure out why it happened by
backing up but that doesn't help you the
next time it's not a predictor of the
future there's a large class of problems
that this meet this is in fact your
financial markets this is Google AdWords
this is the recommendation who decides
whether I should loan you money or not
which sort of book you should read next
these are fuzzy problems now the
problems we used to solve in the 70s and
80s were complicated we started putting
our payroll systems together accounting
systems that sort of thing but now we're
moving into being you solve a suite of
problems called complex and these
complex problems make you can make you a
lot of money if you do them well you
know the other thing Dave Center would
say basically is that you start out in
some sort of state of disorder which
means you don't really know what type of
problem it is and Dave being a guy who
studies this in industry basically says
85% of the time you do not know what
type of problem you're working with you
need to watch how it acts does it
respond to these experts and the advice
can you predict the future or is it
unpredictable figure out whatever
problem you're working on it also turns
that you have a prejudice as an
individual you kind of have a prejudice
about where you like problems to be it's
like your little happy world is one of
these quadrants if you're Donald Trump
it's simple you like me I'll fix the
problems I'll raise the taxes I'll put a
wall up between me and Mexico we'll do
something to be solve all my problems of
course the problem is really complex and
those sort of solutions are nonsense
I tend to be a guy who loves the complex
environments I sort of loved sort of the
cowboy nature of this there are no rules
here I kind of like those sort of
environments I've been known to take
normal problems and turn them into
complex problems just so I can have fun
you be careful when I when I come work
with you but so this model Dakota House
we're solving complex problems those are
the ones that are making money and a lot
of problems I've been
over the last 10 years have been in the
complex domain and a lot of the
techniques I'm talking about work
extremely well there but may not work so
well in the other domains all right the
other reason this becomes important to
go really fast is you got competition
and competition has two key advantages
they now versus say 10 or 15 or even 20
years ago one of the advantages they
have is they no longer have to go get
themselves a good lot of startup money
go buy themselves a million dollars of
machines go hire 200 programmers to work
on these machines for a year to build a
software to compete with you and your
business they can go actually straight
to the cloud get computing power then
goes straight to the straight out there
get frameworks that do amazing things
that you know 20 years ago we wouldn't
imagine and they're free you're not
having to pay Oracle a million dollars a
year for something and they got great
new languages that allow them to express
their algorithms even more efficiently
so the technology barriers for compa
competitors are going away but even
worse than that because the business
side of it is also strange because now
they have a way of which they can build
a business up so almost from the ground
up based on the Silicon Valley model so
there's all these companies in Silicon
Valley I've been very public about how
they start themselves up and how does it
get going and so there's a way in fact I
could do these things but also because
of social networks they don't need a
Salesforce anymore they can go through
social networks reach out to huge
communities and basically suck away your
best customers and you didn't even know
what was happening
not until obviously you do portfolio
analysis and find out all your customer
or your banking customers are horrible
customers they're always late in their
payments we're all the good customers
got siphoned off and also I can be
sitting in Bangalore and put it put in
set place a system that can run in
Europe just drop it on the Amazon
cluster in Dublin and now only European
company and so even the even the
international barriers are down so the
competition is coming out it's very hard
either you're doing these things that
we'll be talking about or there'll be a
competitor out there doing them who will
come after you so you have to watch out
for that so the question is basically
how fast can you go how fast can you get
from that requirement all the way to get
something out the door so let's talk
about some of these there's
and sort of what's happened over time
you'll see a lot of charts like this in
my presentation because being old you
like to room in this and you're a
captive audience so we'll go back to
just 2000 most of you remember 2000 I
think that's that's a lock skill on the
side and so we talk about how long Gator
Asians were and I was one of the early
guys doing agile back in around 1999 in
1998 and there are a lot of different
agile methodologies that back then
extreme programming was kind of the
fastest in terms of iterations two to
three week iterations scrum was sitting
about two or three months and that was
very fast compared to what we were doing
before now it turns out I did a lot of
extreme programming in three weeks or
cycles and turns out with a three week
iteration it seemed like the first week
we were kind of resting and the second
week we kind of worked and the third
week we panicked and it turns out it
turns out panicking all the time is
really productive so I cut my
interations down to basically one week
well we didn't stop there
I actually continued to work with some
companies in London we wound up actually
turning our are basically a stand up
into our iteration planning meeting what
are we gonna do today that's our entire
horizon and then it got really crazy and
I'll show you how crazy it got so this
is a train going on and I would say if
you're still doing an iteration cycle of
two or three weeks and you did that last
year in the year before
you're not agile anymore you should be
going faster and faster you should be
pushing that envelope all right how long
has it take to get code out the door now
I'm gonna go really far back here let's
see Oh think I'd go back to 1980 maybe
some of you were even born in 1980 I was
working in IBM at the time and basically
we were planning projects they were last
anywhere from three to five years in
fact I'm working on a project in this
timeframe where we had a three year
project 1,000 programmers I'm working on
it for three years
don't feel sorry for us we made 1
billion dollars with that software and
we shipped it on time three years later
you know I was working on it still
working on IBM and I sort of got a
little bit fast I mean this is a log
chart right so any straight line down on
this charts really a hockey stick this
is a really good thing to go a straight
line
we got a little faster I get the point
and IBM I was shipping things every
eight months or six eight months we
introduced octagram program you got a
little bit faster maybe six months sort
of cycles I moved out away from IBM at
that point I was working in the agile
space but we're still doing three
four-month delivery cycles even with all
the agile stuff and extreme programming
then interesting things happened we
started doing tweaking a few other
things in our process and the bottom
fell out a two kind of refers to
aggressive agile or agile agile or if
something or avanced a jewel but we kind
of the bottom dropped out about how fast
we get code out the door so how fast do
we get basically this is a github stats
from the team we are pushing something
new in production every three and apt
minutes every three and a half minutes
do you think you're going fast now you
can go faster so what were the
inhibitors what's keeping you from going
you know speeds like this what stopping
you from doing that so why there's three
categories we'll be talking about today
technology inhibitors some process
inhibitors and we'll wrap up with some
organizational inhibitors and these are
as Jamie was specifying these are
cultural things and there's some things
that culturally you need to break down
and these are some of the things I've
done in the past to break these things
down so first of all you can't be afraid
to use what the CEO is called Valley
tech basically these are companies very
much like the bank who says oh yeah I'm
on the Netflix basically gave these CEOs
are saying what can I do to be like
these very successful Silicon Valley
companies and your answer is you look at
the list and it's going to be like
you're gonna exploit the cloud it can be
afraid of the cloud you can use new
languages open source don't be afraid of
open source and I can't tell you how
many big clients that go to says oh we
can't use open source it's not reliable
guess what your competitors aren't
afraid of that they're after you and
moving to continues releases so these
are things a lot of big companies don't
do but if you're not but that when they
say I want to do Valley tech and you
look at what the valleys doing this is
the list so you got to be ready to go do
these things
another good graph chart how long does
it take get hardware and what is that
done to this problem again I'll go back
to the night
again most of you hopefully are born by
then it used to be a back then it'd
probably take you about six months to
get a new machine you have to go sort of
hear what you want order it it will come
in there you have to sort of put it in
plays make sure it all works and then
it's available for usage and that's kind
of a lie because generally you had to
make sure you allocate the capital
equipment the previous year for this
machine which means you went through
some capital planning process it may
take a year year and a half to get a new
machine in place which means you've got
to be pretty sure what you're gonna use
it for because you have to justify that
expenditure fortunately virtual machines
came along and were able to carve this
machine up into smaller pieces so we can
sort of change our mind a bit this was a
very powerful thing and so you can
probably get a virtual machine in a week
or so uh then the really bottom fell out
Amazon comes along and says oh by the
way I'll sell you virtual machines and
you can sort of ask for them I'll get
them up pretty quickly maybe maybe takes
30 minutes to sort of get one five or
ten minutes if you get really good at
this stuff
and we go we're very happy we were
amazed by that of course we we didn't
hit docker yet which isn't like the
second range we're second saying Avenue
went up I've a company in Las Vegas
where I live they're doing sort of you
know financial transactions with docker
they bring a doctor machine up run one
transaction and it's throw it away
just sort of machine away they don't
worry about memory leaks
you're gonna memory leak for the next
five seconds that's it and then throw it
away
you're never gonna run out of memory in
five seconds so I'm not gonna worry
about this problem anymore
so what happened is it based upon this
sort of thing if you really watch what's
going on what you should be doing all of
a sudden in this world capacity planning
the idea of sitting down the beginning
of the year figure out what you need
machines for how much you need is a
useless exercise because there's not a
capital expense anymore it's an
operational expense if you need it you
make money with it go get it
nobody's stopping you doing that but you
have to tear down a lot of structures in
large companies in order to do this
that's a change the other thing is this
concept of ops team which were necessary
to try to get some Sheen up and running
and and give you some virtual machines
those are very important guys in this
world they're not so important this is
why they call themselves DevOps and
trying to consider convince themselves
they still have jobs they don't
now there's an impact was going on so
basically you know the whole movement
that we're talking about today has to do
with that curve right there so what's
the impact of services again log-log
chart in this case wrap your head around
that so it kind of plot on here how you
develop software basically this is
traditional way of doing software I call
it the rails in Java zone it's really
the idea is this one big application it
can be a hundred thousand lines of code
a million ten million lines of code it's
a monster well we knew that was kind of
a bad idea so you know back in the you
know the the late 90s early 2000s
service-oriented architectures came in
place
krytus Swiss was one of the big guys in
this space and they took their big big
systems and started carving them up into
50 or a hundred thousand line of code
systems along Conway's law by the way
and they built the systems like that but
with that ggressive curve with the
virtual machines and all the way down to
docker happening you have this new zone
on this chart I would call it sort of
the microservices zone click yes and it
basically is sort of this part of the
chart where basically is maybe 10 to 1
ratio between lines of code and number
of services so you know this is why I
used to work on projects in this space I
will never do that again my life is too
short this is not fun things to work in
I run a workshop yet a Monday where we
basically wrote some services that did
some very interesting things and we
basically were writing about we were
gonna write about 10 or 12 services they
were gonna be about 50 lines code each
the company worked in London the one
that was going every 3 and 1/2 minutes
that's where they are that's how they
work over 300 services none more than
probably hundred lines of code
constantly adding more and more services
at space this is Adrian Cochran's
Netflix implementation thousand to
thousands of Java code 600 services I
think I just got the last number I heard
could be more now but this is where
Adrian hits his guys built this is where
you're building the new applications
this is the micro service zone and it's
because of that hardware curve then we
can do this new micro services has
emerged in parallel I had no idea
Netflix was doing this when I was doing
my work in London nor did I understand
what the gilt guys
with their application or four or five
other guys I've seen come up and saying
we've been working the last four or five
years building micro-services have this
amazing system we all saw the same
phenomena we all reacted the same way
okay so the other thing is happening is
the eventbus is becoming a technology
that's sort of key to making this sort
of thing happen what I mean by event
buys traditional structure says I have
an operational sequel database it kind
of has the entities all I before
operation respect I also have another
one I use for a purporting because I
know I need to organize that differently
the operational sequel database is dead
that's the thing that's going to slow
you down because you touch that thing
all your code has to be retested that's
why you have specialists associated with
it we make special changes migration
scripts all this is because I have this
very very fragile sort of system so the
Silicon Valley guys are moving to event
buses so instead of having an
operational sequel database they just
take everything going on and put it on
an event bus a persistent bus so how
does that look oh one of my favorites is
Kafka Kafka is the the event bus that
came down LinkedIn so LinkedIn uses this
for all their systems and the open
source it it's not an Apache project the
documentation on the Apache site is
excellent
they're also now many other buses coming
available of the same nature this is a
very dumb bus it's not why these
Enterprise Service bus is back from you
know 10 years ago this is a very dumb
bus it just takes messaged in and gives
it to anybody who wants some period and
it's persistent but it's also very very
very fast because it's dumb it'll handle
a quarter million messages a second now
that's a lot of messages you know you
have to think about what's going on so
one of the things you like to use these
buses for is put everything on them
because they have the capacity for it
it turns out these guys when they talk
about the bus capacity they're kind of
cheating it turns out if you write the
message one time you read it ten times
that counts for eleven messages you're
like whoa really so I've got a hundred
guys on this bus you know two and fifty
thousand now becomes twenty five hundred
not such a big number so you try to
minimize that and minimize that base
formula a little microservice that hangs
off here which pulls the traffic in
filters it see what
interesting and that gives it to people
who care so basically I attach these
little things I call rivers to these
thes big bus and they pull off sort of
theme messages in themselves it turns
out in systems I've built so far I don't
need more than like eight to ten rivers
total so my capacity our buzz stays at
least 25,000 or more very good for my
systems and so basically what I do is I
attach my service to one of these little
secondary services these second-tier
services but I always publish back to
the core bus so that's the dark the
architects you put together for using
event buses in this world this begins to
replace my centralized database now that
will lead to some different
architectural patterns as well so using
this sort of architecture you build
different systems differently and this
is how we built a lot of our systems
where we made this a lot of money so you
know you're sitting on here you're
sitting on a bus and the service says I
have a need for something should I loan
you money ask the question now there's
also the services that you could write
sort of just give advice about that not
one big guy who's gonna make all the
calculations but lots of little guys
making different calculations look at
your bank account history how many to
pay you getting regular payroll deposits
which your credit card balances look
like what's experience' about you all
the different little services going to
be voting on that and they vote and tell
you what the answers are and then you
collect the answers back and decide you
know okay given that wealth of advice
you've been given should you loan this
guy money or not and it turns out this
sort of structure is very powerful the
little blue service said know about the
green service the fact that I wonder
where it looks at Experian enough when I
look at your bank account they don't
care about each other all they do is
responding to a question should you lose
your money it's easy to put in version
two of the service in fact a conversion
to imperil into version one not have to
tell version one about it at all and in
fact if some of the services go down I'm
still giving advice maybe not as good
advice I want to give you but but it's a
complex problem I'm guessing anyway it's
fuzzy
so sort architecture becomes very easy
it's easy to write variations and it's a
very robust architecture if one of these
services go down I know I'm not down I
keep giving answers a very powerful
structure and this allows you now to
build what I call
incremental applications buying from
rental application I mean I keep sort of
write an application it has a few of
these services like that so I giving
giving in this case advice on what's our
for average husband so I want to show
and thank us I've been running and I can
start making money and the ROI
calculation on these projects is very
very high because I spent a little money
get something back but then I could keep
adding more services I can add more you
know give more information about the
customer their membership what are their
usage patterns and buying patterns and
give that advice and it make these make
it a little smarter and keep making it
smarter and smarter day after day so I
can now build incremental applications
using these sort of architectures thus
against makes me fast well the other
thing is going on as I said is that we
got to go Calif until that big database
recently you know a few years ago I was
at a hotel chain I was talking to their
chief architect and since I'm basically
a trouble maker I went to him and sort
of said you know how many debate
operational databases do you have and he
says all we have three and we're trying
to get it down to two so that's really
kind of interesting because the right
answer is 300 it was the last
conversation we ever had which was kind
of ok because he was going to go tell
his vendor about his new waterfall
method next he was like I dude I don't
want to talk to you either so the new
vision is basically you're going to use
that event bus it's sort of your new
backbone system structure that just
takes everything interesting going on
it's in that bus and then you're gonna
put a database in each of the
microservice that needs it if you need
persistence have your own little copy of
the information so some conference will
be talking about the idea that we rather
cache the information locally then try
to go query it remotely
we're preferring to cache the
information and particular for that
segment called complex problems this is
a very powerful strategy the nice thing
is by the way since I can I have no idea
what happened I don't know how to do
that with my tool so whenever that last
bullet is so it turns that just because
you need transactions as a service
doesn't mean all the rest of us are
stuck with Oracle we can use key value
stores that somebody else's very sane
you know what I mean you still need
transaction system for transaction
but the wrestlers are not stuck with
that database choice and that makes this
faster no Microsoft wants to update my
software thank you very much not now yes
thank you Microsoft and so example going
back here you know when I'm writing this
little service is asking for things
actually I point out writing for little
containers to do that service so my one
service so I'll have a I'll have a
little service that sits there and
publishes something on the bus saying I
need an advertisement on my page have
another little you know service alright
another little container that basically
sits there and sort of gets all the
answers back and pups have been around
it rate its database which is running
its own container and then I got yet a
another piece of code is sitting there
waiting if a 300 milliseconds and saying
oh after 300 milliseconds I better pick
the best the answer is sitting back to
the page so for dinner little containers
running for little things I would still
call that one micro service because it's
sitting around one database if I change
the reddest database structure all three
pieces of code may have to be touched
similarly if you look down this little
piece of the bottle called membership
basically what I'm doing is I'm looking
up to see if this user is a member of
our frequent retro program is she silver
is she gold is she platinum so I
basically has a little piece of code
sitting there it's pulling it out for
key value store because that's all I
need you know your user ID map to status
and that user ID and status is probably
updated every night from the data
warehouse so I write myself a little ETL
micro service it runs as a cron job
wakes up you know runs a query sticks to
my for refresh my database and by the
way if that doesn't run tonight okay may
I'm using day old data that's okay it's
a complex problem I'm just guessing
anyway
fuzzy problems allow you to those
freedoms so that's the concept of having
your database sorted as scattered
throughout your services as per your
technology then the is an open source
you know you can't be afraid of the open
source stuff you know Adrienne you know
Hadrian his team built Netflix and they
open source an incredible amount of
their code it is in fact the system by
which many custom companies are building
their big news
systems or also Netflix tack if you told
me I had to go build one of these
million line of code two million line of
code systems that's the system by
building on very robust set of
architecture now forty open-source
projects in there basically there's too
complicated a dream as it's been made
before it's more than you can possibly
get your head around as a programmer so
there's a lot of great stuff in there
but you better to think about it hard
but that it's a sensor by which you can
build some really robust systems and of
course there's docker out there all open
source heavily endorsed now by all the
major vendors you should be on that
technology as well so don't be afraid of
the open source it's the it's an a video
and finally there's some disruptive
technologies coming along along the
point of languages some of the
functional languages are very
interesting and you sort of look at some
pieces of code we like to use things
like Kafka copies actuated in Scala not
Java or C++ as a high-performance bus
it's written in Scala and RabbitMQ one
of my favorite pieces of software
extremely reliable was rewritten a few
years ago to become more reliable and
we're in Erlang Erlang
they're using languages like that oh and
basically I've done the same sort of
thing in companies I've worked with at
the mail online we were trying to
rebuild and get the pages on the Daily
Mail and it turns out the it took
130,000 lines of Java code and jsps to
actually render the pages of the Daily
Mail their ambassador pages there are
lots of different pages we couldn't
change that system anymore it's getting
too ugly so we rewrote that enclosure
4,000 lines of closure replaced 130,000
lines of Java way more flexible now so
if you're not using things like these
disruptive languages you don't have
knowledge of what these languages are
you're a competitive disadvantage you
need to understand how these things work
alright so there are also process
inhibitors so as much as the technology
you kind of get our heads around that
yeah cool technology but you need to fix
your processes as well first process
thing you gotta do is you get understand
what type of problem you're solving if
you think if you're organized to
complicated problems you have architects
and key designers you have a development
teams that look what the architects tell
them to do that's a traditional
organization of an Indian
it's offshoring company works really
well for complicated problems does not
work at all for complex because in a
complex problem those experts are
useless because there are no experts we
sometimes tell the story about what's
interesting that the the expert
architect and a used-car salesman and
the answer is a used-car salesman knows
he's lying so yeah if they say no how to
do it it's complex problem
they're lying so it turns out you
organize yourself differently as this
sort of problem so figure whatever
problem you're working on you may be
working in a very traditional sort
application I'm not sure my cursors that
will provide you much advantage but if
you're working these complex
environments you want to be there the
other thing is we got changed in mind
about what we're trying to build to
something Wow it's clicker loves
clicking back back so generally we
traditionally have put our requirements
in stone tablets to some degree this is
my fault
not personally nestling might fall but
my generations fault because at some
point I'm back in the 70s when I was
writing code I sit down with a customer
right we're at your application because
it's small but it's got bigger bigger is
like temporary to one and leave us alone
we got to put a team together figure
this out and we kept pushing them
further and further away so put your
requirements into stone tablets sign
them in blood we'll implement them it
turns out that's not what you want to do
for a complex problem because they can't
tell you how to solve a complex problem
they don't know either so you want to
move basically to a paradigm that says
how fast can we try out new ideas so
don't tell me bout your requirements I'm
here about requirements I don't hear
about your details stories tell me what
you're trying to accomplish give me some
ideas about how you may make money or
get more clicks or how longer page
retention what are your ideas I want to
try these ideas as fast as possible as
we as one of our companies in London we
use this expression experimentation
drives innovation I love the word
experimentation and implies we will try
things and they will fail get over it
we also need to rethink our interaction
with customers particularly for the
complex problems so most rear
traditional most of your traditional
agile processes all have the concept of
stories and stories can be broken down
to task but colleague of mine and
thought were use to about 10 years ago
we sort of built this pyramid it says
there but stories are part of something
bigger sometimes called mega stories I
call them features but features are part
of projects and projects are sort of
business initiatives and almost all the
actual processes then probably the ones
you use say this is your level of
interaction with the customer he defines
the stories we count stories we measure
stories we we track how stories are done
how many we get done how big they are
everything's about a story when actually
going to organizations doing agile or
think they're doing agile you listen to
their stand-up meetings and it's all
about at the task level what test you
working yesterday how long did it take
why did it take more than an hour you
said it's gonna take an hour yesterday
why didn't take more than an hour and as
a programmer this word you're like oh
god please cook what time is it kind of
go home yet because this is no fun what
we've done the origins I've been working
with again cultural change is we want to
interact with the customer at this level
we want you to customers come tell us
what are you trying to accomplish what's
it what are your goals here describe to
me your business success metrics if you
don't know what those are you're not
ready to have a conversation with me
what are your KPIs your key performance
indicators so basically the customers
job is to come teach me your domain and
some guys some guys say well my domain
is really complicated you can't possibly
understand what I do I'm saying dude you
ever try to deploy at Amazon you ever
try use closure or JavaScript you think
your world's worse than mine change jobs
any day I can't understand what you're
working on I am that smart so yeah teach
me your domain a new paradigm in
different way to work all the customers
and try to reverse a trend of back go
back to the 1970s where customers are
sitting with you describing their
problem and you're freaking out how to
write code for it
the other thing we do want to do is you
want to measure what really counts
I've been measured on many many things
in my career I mean I've been doing this
a long time you name it I probably were
measured against it I mean used to count
how many lines of code
Road I mean classes I wrote you know
blinks of path function points where a
key thing back in the day to some degree
all these metrics were games things I
played games with all these things like
give me a metric I can win the game so
when we started giving this metric so we
change our metrics when we started
working higher we said okay what are
your business metrics is it sales is it
you know paid retention time is it
clicks is it money
what is that we're trying to do it's a
business ok let's measure that is major
our programmers they eats that turns out
we like to give these metrics too so
we're gonna gain this measure make more
money today because she says you made
more money to say what you do well we
tried this and made you tried what and
it made money yeah ok do it again so it
turns out yeah we're smart we're out we
build our roads that's what we're good
at
give us a problem and we'll free our
clever ways to solve it that's where
we're programmers we're algorithms we
like to outgrows don't tell me how to do
my job so we want to raise up to the
feature level and measure the right
things
all right last section ok we got to
change the organization as well
this is where the cultural stuff becomes
very important so what I found is that
key inhibited all this stuff is what I
call over specialization then we're kind
of over specialized in our roles so this
is the result of you know years and
years of sort of moving in that
direction and it's manifests itself
mostly by the titles we give our people
so it sort of comes up the theory is of
course if you're our specialist you were
better at this stuff so we should give
you work that you're good at but we
completely underestimated the overhead
of communication and all the working
balances that happen we have got enough
friend developers right now oh my god
what we're gonna do I guess we have to
slow everybody else down so I guess it
turns out the we've institutionalized as
specializations by the titles we give
our people front-end developer you know
Java back-end developer all these titles
so a real case study this comes out of
the Daily Mail
the Daily Mail is one of these cases
where we make cultural changes massive
cultural changes so I had 50 IT
professionals in the group I was working
with the guys to do the online system I
found over 25 titles across that
organization between the database
front-end designers testers
skies there was zero people understand
we're trying to do the poor scrum master
was sitting there trying to understand
the big picture so she could make sure
all the pieces were coordinated and she
wasn't capable understanding that so
that's the problem we were running into
and this was rooted in fact we had these
titles so we decided we would fix the
titles so we first of all to sign what
we thought were competences we cared
about so we define that I like this
pyramid of masters during been
apprentice sometimes there's different
names sometimes at four or five levels
doesn't really matter but pick a
competency model of some nature and then
we picked up the technology we thought
were strategic for our business Ruby and
Java iOS Android as well as web-based
platforms databases both sequel and non
databases and the like but basically
these were the key skills we wanted our
team to have and we assessed our people
for each one of these things on this
pyramid so we got an idea and we based
our job titles upon the pyramid so gone
was the concept of project manager gone
was the concept of team lead those were
all gone we replaced them with we called
you a developer if you are confident
with our key technologies we called you
a graduate of developer if you weren't
confident our technologies now I'm not
sure why I hired you
but the CTO liked the title so I said
fine we'll put it on the chart we called
your senior developer you're an expert
and this is Troy a traditional path
right you want to build yourself up from
a novice all the way to be competent
into becoming a master of your thing
where the databases or Java or you know
CSS but then we did the strange thing we
said we're also going to create a new
tile called system developer will pay
you the same as we pay these experts and
we paid the experts very well we'll pay
the same but you're gonna be confident 5
to 7 technologies across the space you
might read this as full stack developer
and we value these guys because these
are the guys that could give a problem
to at the feature level and they can
solve it the whole thing because they
say this part looks like front-end this
is back in this is sort of architecture
I need you know and just apply for money
deploy it on
they know they're confident but they
also know their limits and so they need
the extra they go grab experts when they
need them but they're capable of solving
the problem and these are the guys we
want it in the organization and we sold
we told them that basically was one more
tear here we called master so if you
actually be a wizard or three to five
things we would pay even more we put up
there for aspiration purposes we didn't
have any Nora I expect necessary have
any and we said you got a choice as a
career path with this company you'd go
either way you pick and by the way if
you want to become a system developer I
will take you and drop you into a team
where you're basically on princess in
order for you to pick up the skills dad
you're at your list over time you can
sort of get yourself all the check marks
and become a more higher pay person
without having become that expert so I
took this to Human Resources so this is
basically was taken to human resources
which was the you know Daily Mail as
part of a hundred and twenty
five-year-old company is run by Lord
Rothermere the fourth Lord Rothermere of
his title so I'm walking into human
resources of that company English
company like this with a Lord it's a
head and saying oh I have a way new way
of classifying my programmers what do
you think human resources told me they
loved it I'm like you love it oh yeah we
we don't want to class ladies and silly
programmers oh my god it's a nightmare I
have this page of descriptions I trying
to match these guys up there they're
complaining all the time they been
promoting it you guys are gonna take
responsible for that please take that
problem so they loved it
and we and we implemented it so we got
rid of the concept of man project
managers we got rid of the concept of
team blades we went to basically pure
developers we also fix the furniture
everybody is sitting at desk and their
little cubes we tore out the cubes we
made tables this is actually if we doing
this in India we've made tables and said
you'll sit the table with your project
if you're a front-end guy or back-end
guy but you're working on this feature
you're sitting at the table with
everybody else working on this feature
and you make them mobile so again
breaking down part of the culture
rebuilding in a different way we also
didn't believe in dedicated leadership
we felt the leadership will morph
overtime is a sort of feature gets put
in place originally it's part of a
feature you'll have the idea that as is
the architect I probably got a good idea
how to split this stuff apart but you
get down to implementing getting out the
door and shipping it your architects
usually not your best guy for figuring
out all those details
I mean said if you're docker clusters
and swarms and the like probably not
your architect doing that I sort of got
this from this book gun surgeon steals
it talked about basically the the idea
that you don't need a dedicated
leadership until your village gets to be
at least 100 people I'm looking at I
have a dedicated manager for a team of
four or five programmers I'm like
seriously what's changed in a human
nature that I needed a dedicated leader
at this point and we kill the concept
yes we do have leaders but they're sort
of do their other job as well in a
village of 50 people the leaders out
there working in the fields if you need
the leader you could talk to him but
otherwise he works in the fields that
everybody else we like that attitude and
the other thing we got a break from is
bringing work to the team there's a
tendency to reform projects and put
programmers together and that becomes
your new team but it turns out it takes
a little while you might experience
somewhere between four to seven weeks
for the team to sort of gel where we've
sort of had arguments we figure what
editors are going to use what
architecture use what tools and
frameworks takes about six years and
then we're not productive in that time
then we're productive so why are you
doing this why you keep reforming these
teams we want to take the attitude we're
gonna bring the work to the team we're
not gonna play musical chairs with the
teams anymore we're gonna bring the work
to the team so if you're a business guy
you got some money then it comes in with
our team will have to meet your problem
until you run out of money and then
bring you the next business guy in we're
not going to keep reforming the team we
know how to produce ourselves so we
flipped that model on his head so those
were the sort of things you need to
worry about if you're doing micro
services by itself and that's gonna be
the thing you're trying now you will
fail you need to pick up pick up a
couple of other things in this chart to
do in parallel to enable micro service
to be successful you certainly want to
be in the cloud you certainly want
thinking about containers structures you
want to think about some sort of manager
list process especially you're solving
complex problems you doesn't want to get
rid of your big databases but this
allows you to go faster if you pull this
off then you get the effects I saw in
this
I mean this is a hockey stick right this
is a linear on a log chart straight line
it's a hockey stick like this this is a
hockey stick on the hockey stick it goes
crazy
you will go absolutely crazy with how
fast you can work and this will make you
lots of money alright I'm definitely out
of time in fact I'm way over time but I
cut into your coffee break so I would
say thank you very much we are gonna
take questions are we yeah well we
actually do have time for questions and
there are a lot of them so no coffee for
anyone Thank You Fred oh thank you thank
you so yesterday we had Randy soup
talked about that you shouldn't probably
start your new projects as
micro-services that it's you know they
they once they become successful you can
probably go that way but it might not it
might take too much time and you might
want to start with all in one
application do you agree with that no ok
good next question well I basically I
would say that any time I start out sort
of the ideal bill be some sort of
monolith to start out with you basically
are building yourself a legacy system
from day one this is just you're wasting
your time you need to think about it
harder and attack it differently ok I
would say it's essentially true you're
trying to solve a complex problem for
solving a complicated problem if I got
to do bank statements I'm not so sure
this competitive advantage to usually
micro services yet maybe the traditional
approaches are fine but if you have an
aspect of your problem try around sort
of fuzzy problems or complex problems
don't start down the road of big systems
you'll be a failure so you talked about
rivers and that you had this event bus
where you had zero MQ connected to it um
can you elaborate a bit on that why do
you have these rivers compared to the
individual services simply fetching
their messages from the main queue
well again basically the idea of the
high speed Vint bus is you want to put
every possible thing on that a bus you
can because you want to put basically
everything interesting going on not just
a message between your services but
you're also putting every little log
message on that bus and your your user
journeys
and all your traffic stats from your
service boxes are putting on that bus
you want everything on a common event
bus that's going on yours in your world
because you don't want to try to filter
that who that is and this is a lesson we
learned from Google but the problem with
these event bus is it like this is that
when again if you put a hundred guys on
this bus the capacity gets dropped
tremendously and I can't put a four to
put everything on it I want to put
everything on it so the idea of these
second-tier services to pull things off
by themes is to basically minimize the
attachments to that core bus and by that
process I can make sure that core bussed
allows me to put still everything on
that bus ok good so say that you have a
huge project with hundreds if not
millions of lines of code do you really
believe that having this huge segment of
functionality that it's it will be
easier to understand if you split it
into you know small chunks of a hundred
lines of code that means that you were
gonna have thousands or services yes
well it would definitely understand
thousands of services and millions and
millions of lines of code yeah because
you will not have to understand every
one of them exactly and it's the same
way that you develop a system using you
know object or your program you build
classes but you don't look at individual
lines of code in the class it's a class
it has a job and you in a java world you
put these into packages and either the
package has sobbin functionality so you
want to continue to have late layers of
hierarchy associated with that but if I
have a legacy system like that and I
would begin to put micro services into
it by looking at the next feature that
comes along and says this this feature
truly embedded into this thing or is
there way to sort of tease it out sort
of tease out some information from your
database run this all micro services and
then maybe push the answer back into the
legacy system and for clients I've
worked with over the last 10 or 15 years
that's kind of been the strategy we've
taken to sort of re-implement things in
a different fashion when you have a big
legacy legacy tarball that's all the
questions we have time for good thank
you well thank you I'll be around today
so find me
yeah thank you go and talk to the
speakers please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
