that you might have heard of the current
project is we've which is the company's
called we've works we also found at
RabbitMQ and cohesive and some other
things that are not shown and for a
while I was put in charge of spring as
the product manager and made some new
things which you might have heard of
like spring boot and spring cloud and
other cool stuff so today's question is
can i go faster with technology now you
probably all know what the answer is
I've just put it there yes you can but
I'm going to be talking about something
called cloud native which is of course a
buzz word and but it's a good buzz word
and i'll be talking about a few things
in relation to that the economics of
convenience which is something that i
think amazon have really introduced at
least for software the war of the
platforms what's at stake there a little
bit of that and a little bit about
what's missing which is of course my
opportunity to talk about myself so it's
become standard in the current cycle to
talk about unicorns and big web
companies as a sort of paradigm for how
you can build more software more quickly
and do more well and make more money and
be more famous and if you're Adrian you
can talk a lot about Netflix all around
the world and they get a fantastic job
at battery to do the same thing which is
just great but for the rest of us are
kind of wondering what do we need to do
in order to be like these companies to
kind of build technology really quickly
and then scale it up to large size I
mean this really matters because now
software is critical to business you
know if you're a hotel company
Intercontinental Marya you're worried
about air B&amp;amp;B they really are a threat
to your business and what's particularly
noticeable if you look at these
companies is most of them are new they
are founded fairly recently in the last
15 years these really big technology
companies didn't start in the 90s a few
of them did but many many more started
more recently
and that's because they've been able to
move quickly that they've been able to
grow so big so fast and that is you know
the so-called unicorn the billion-dollar
company so can anyone become a eunuch or
if I'm running a little startup down
here in Shoreditch what do I need to do
to become more like one of these
fantastically brilliant Silicon Valley
companies should I just move to Silicon
Valley we have a lot of talent here in
Europe and in the UK we are plucky we
are resilient and we can do it all we
need to do is move to the roundabout
just over there and everything will be
amazing actually there are no unicorns
on this picture although I believe there
are seven in the UK companies like a
sauce for example so what are the
ingredients for success well you don't
you do definitely need money to actually
build software I mean there's no
question that doing it without any money
and I speak here is someone who started
several open source companies is tricky
then you need developers developers are
really really important we've got to the
point now where if a developer refuses
to do something for a business it can be
mission-critical you know if you've got
your business and you've you're chasing
air B&amp;amp;B and your hotel company you've
got a great new team that's got this
kind of room sharing thing going on and
suddenly the lead developer is sick or
has just taken a job at Netflix you know
you're stuffed so you've got to have a
big strong adept development team it's
not enough just to have a few people and
do things in the hallway these guys are
critical guys and gals and you've got to
have the right technology which is what
would be talking about a little bit
today so that surely is the mix money
developers technology and then hey
presto everyone can do it so the phrase
or the word that the expression that
people have been using recently to
describe this correct mix of
technologies and people and practices
and of course money is to is cloud
native meaning not
it runs in the cloud but it is
architected according to a set of
practices that means that it looks like
the applications that people do run have
built on Amazon and also running house
the netflix style architecture for
example and it's these agile practices
like continuous integration and
continuous deployment so enabling rapid
change breaking things up into small
pieces microservices I'm preaching to
the choir and say no that is all adding
up to cloud native which is of course a
buzzword so you know here's my attempt
to do a buzzword bingo card for cloud
but feel you know feel free to hack this
later you may have heard some of these
expressions today if you don't demand
your money back but what it's really
about is economics what I think of is
the economics of convenience it's easy
for me to do whatever I like with the
cloud that's the point that's what
Amazon's innovation was and why I took
everyone else so long to realize what
the hell they were doing all these big
hosting company is saying but we do
hosting too that's not the point the
point is making it so easy for somebody
to start and stop to scale to scale up
to scale down and so much more and what
people have done and what cloud nate is
all about is taking this idea and
applying it to as much of the stack as
you can which brings us to this who's
heard of docker is anyone not put the
hand up see me later so what Dhaka does
is it exemplifies convenience it's not
about containers it's about convenience
it's about giving an API to this thing
called a container that makes it easy
for developers to do things with it
hence millions of users a month you know
downloading it they're claiming I think
800 million downloads now whatever that
means but it's a lot now that clearly is
a lot you know this is this is a change
it's very important and the next change
that's coming is this shift not just
from one technology to several two
containers as a container centric
approach to arc
texture and to a micro services agile
enabling philosophy in multiple
different facets of the architecture
until a lot more automation or you'll
notice I'm using these hedging words all
the time a bit of this a bit of that
bias towards the other thing that's
because the reality is that when people
do cloud native it's not a hundred
percent containers it's not a hundred
percent microservices it's not a hundred
percent cloud it's not a hundred percent
automated but you're using more and more
and more of this technology and it's
like the web in the 90s which initially
was just a way to put you know a kind of
the address of your business on to you
know the internet so that people could
find you and maybe phone you but now
what they're doing is that people are
introducing these technologies to build
apps and services so we're seeing a
revolution equivalent to the 90s for
websites but for applications and
services and as I mentioned earlier
these are business critical if you don't
have a software development team in your
business that understands this and can
build digital experiences for your
customers you will lose out to people
who just spend all their time doing that
like a B&amp;amp;B as I mentioned so I've been
spending a lot of my time in the last
few weeks trying to kind of come up with
a way of describing the stack for cloud
native architectures now one of the
paradoxes here is if you go talk to all
these companies none of them is using
the same technology exactly so it's not
the case there is currently a standard
tool kit for this but there are patterns
and more as more time goes by you can
recognize clear demarcation of role and
function and I think that we're starting
to sort of see the wood for the trees
now and it's possible to talk about a
three layer stack with a little bit of
hand waving and the layers are automated
infrastructure a container service and
domain-specific tools and obviously the
bit in the middle is new and didn't
really exist a few years ago in 2006
amazon started all this off with ec2
which is the first piece of automated
infrastructure that layer has evolved
now you basically had this concept that
any developer could get their credit
card out and do whatever they wanted
they could go and form a company if the
boss wouldn't let them and go do it
with that regret because they could
always dial back down they didn't have
to have a planning meeting about buying
a data center they could just go ahead
and get started and now you have a
combination of cloud hosting plus
provisioning tools plus operating
systems that update themselves like
chorus for example and that collectively
is this lower layer of infrastructure
the next layer is the container service
and this is very very important this
introduces a key distinction from the
previous layer the layer below amazon I
mean the evidence is clear amazon and
people who compete with Amazon like
Google and Microsoft Azure and digital
ocean are there to give you an agile
computing platform in the sense of
hardware but this layer goes further
than that because it replaces VMs with
containers with the goal of making the
overall startup time much less for any
individual software asset so that as you
use more and more of these things and
the times add up you can still get work
done quickly without having a kind of 30
minute pause while you wait for
something to build and test and compile
so that means overall too subtle change
but it means that if you look at the
evidence the people are seeing much
faster performance sorry much faster
development cycles much higher
performance from the development teams
and it's portable that's another key
difference one of the reasons this layer
and the containers themselves are so
appealing is that there's much more
portability you know an ami from Amazon
does not run yet on vsphere I believe
correct so wouldn't it be great if we
just write for one thing I mean I know
that can be a bit of a fantasy but
there's just much more portability with
containers you can run containers on
Amazon you can move them and run them on
VMware you can run them on methyl the
other thing that's that's really new
with a container service it's coming
through with things like docker swarm
which is part of the overall docker
platform and Cuban at ease which start
at Google but is now moving to
Foundation and other technologies like
that is a star trying to standardize the
execution model for applications that
means taking two things and putting them
together one a scheduler also known as
an Orchestrator for container
which understands what they're supposed
to be doing where they are whether
they're started or stopped how many
you've got running that kind of thing
and core execution services is a bit
like an operating system things like
networks coordination storage shared
data all this kind of stuff that you
need for a nap and trying to make all
that common set of AP is what that means
is if you write on top of this layer you
get two things you get something that's
virtualized across automated
infrastructures you can move it anywhere
and something that has a standard set of
management api's regardless of your
application type which means that you
can have a massive team all trained to
know one thing only and they can switch
around between jobs which means that you
can grow your team you don't have people
dedicated individuals individual tasks
it's much more like in the platform the
micro services concept breaking things
up into smaller pieces and not having
things being too big to fail so that's
pretty cool I think and then this is the
stuff that's been with us for a while
now what developers really really like
in my experiences to pick the tools that
they know will do the job well and not
be told by somebody else to use a
different tool so I always really
impressed when I went to the doc on
Amsterdam event last year and I saw a
gentleman from ING who I believe is the
CIO saying that one of the things that
they had done in introducing
microservices was liberate developers to
beat more free to to some of their own
tools so if the development team said we
want to use Mongo not my sequel be like
okay fine if you fail it will be your
fault as opposed to know the central
database provisioning team will not let
you provision what MongoDB you'll have
to go and get you know you have to wait
three years for that and so developers
hate this and if you're in business of
hiring and developers and you want to
make them happy remember if if the right
developer leaves your business could be
in trouble now you've got a given bit
more freedom and responsibility you've
got to make them accountable as well so
this layer is that's been with us all
along and not all of it necessarily is
suitable to running in the cloud or in
cloud native architectures but a lot of
it is
and so the point I'm really trying to
make here is that it's very very
important that whatever stack you choose
whatever architects you choose you still
leave open the possibility for
individual teams to choose the tools
they want to use I'll come back to this
point in a second this brings us to the
war of the platform specifically so
what's at stake here I just cover a few
of the debates well I mentioned
containers versus VMS and mixtures of
these so some companies like VMware
Joyent and others have combined vm
technology with container technology and
interesting ways then you have the
debate of unstructured powers versus
structured powers or unstructured
platforms and structured platforms and
finally another one that you see is
opinionated versus an opinionated
everyone's got an opinion so let's talk
about structured pads for a little bit
so what is that that is basically
somebody saying I'm going to take a
slice through the stack and I'm going to
make decisions about what's going to be
in each of the layers for that slice I'm
going to put them all in a box I'm going
to sell you the Box in one go who does
this appeal to obviously this appeals to
vendors it also appeals to big
businesses which worry about technology
and don't have too much noise across the
team when I said I thought ing a pretty
actually amazing st. people you know use
whatever technologies you like maybe
it's not quite that extensive but it's
very brave because if you're in a really
big business that could mean a lot of
technologies right but the appeal to the
buyer of the structured pass is
somebody's going to make a few decisions
nail it all down for you and just make
sure they do a really good job of
looking after that the problem is of
course it's a black box if your day of
customer you can't change this thing
because the whole point of the value
proposition is will do it for you which
means you've really got to have a high
degree of confidence this is going to
give you the value that you're looking
for that's why you'll see a lot of
people talking about unstructured pairs
or unstructured platforms which
essentially means pick your own
technologies at each layer
and they should just work you should be
able to use q benetti's on top of
automated in the structure without
caring what automated and structure
you've got running it could be on Amazon
it could be on google it could be in
house as long as you've standardized on
Cuban Eddie's the rest below it should
be fine so you can also have freedom of
choice there and then run whatever you
like on top so that's much more
appealing to develop teams who want to
make their own decisions and don't want
to be prevented from hacking the stack
then you have the opinionated versus
unobtainium noted debate this is arises
because of Heroku which is really the
first platform as a service and it was
it created briefly in industry called
pass which I think people have slightly
lost faith in opinionated path says
we'll do it all for you everything you
need to build run and scale all in one
magic black box the problem is I went to
their site today you know they've got
these impressive looking numbers on here
but actually these are not impressive
numbers you know Netflix re linkedin
announced by running casket for doing
log processing and other things they are
doing now trillion messages per day on
LinkedIn's Kafka okay that's a lot more
than that in one company who here thinks
Heroku is making a lot of money in is a
big business for Salesforce anyone so
why is it this thing that gets a great
deal of love from one section of the
market a certain type of developer and
don't get me wrong with it's a great
platform isn't dominating the world
because people don't want to use someone
else's opinion about an architecture for
every type of application it's as simple
as that so back to the stack uh
opinionated you can have a nun
opinionated pass that's basically
somebody doing the black box thing again
but saying I'll look after the lower
layers for you I'll have my you know
tectonic service from Cuba nap so from
chorus which is Cuban Eddie's based I'll
give you an enterprise edition you can
run in house and I'll support a cloud
version for you you can just deal with
me now that has the appeal that you can
have one throat to choke which is a
buyer remember I said can be four
appealing but it leaves the dev teams
free to do whatever they like but for
this to work you really do have to have
an architecture that can support all
these different application types now
Heroku remember is 12 factor pass and
then not every architecture in the world
of the 12 factor pairs that's why people
are moving to these container based
systems because they get freedom of
choice around what architecture to use
whether it's 12 factor or big data or
real-time streaming or something else
and you can recognize these types of
applications because if you ask the dev
team to draw them on the whiteboard
instead of doing what they would have
done 15 years ago and drawing something
that looks like a cake like that
actually they'll draw a big draw arrows
and bosses that's showing that they have
an opinion about their architecture and
it's unlikely to be identical to someone
else's so you've got to have a very
rigorous execution model support all
these patterns and that's why I'm
excited about things like Cuba Nettie's
and darker and so on is because they
really show promise to deliver the
agility and automation but without
locking you into specific architecture
types and I think that's really
fantastic there we are choosing Netflix
again so convenience economics of
convenience are important but they do
require choice choice is what you need
and choice is what developers have to be
empowered with in order to deliver that
for the business so now let's look ahead
a bit into the future this is supposed
to be the future because it's dawn I've
borrowed a few slides here from our host
mr. cocroft mentioned microservices
earlier and mentioned different
architecture patterns this is one of
adrian's slides kind of demarcating
concerns in a micro services
architecture and I'm going to be talking
a bit about the one on the right here
observability so that's very important
another slide from Adrian you may have
heard of this guy by now famous American
strategic thinker who started his career
as a pilot and then became one of these
come around corporation types you came
up this kind of concept called Buddha
observer right beside act to represent
what you need to be good at in order
compete with other people who are
fighting for the same resource as you
another slider made compromises the last
one from both stolen from you Adrian it
here's another example of the OODA
concept applied to the innovation
process itself and as you can see you
know you go through the cycle again in
the game at the point it never stops and
the idea the central notion of video I
think you know it seems so obvious now
but when this guy came up with this
people thought it was really radical is
the faster you can do it if you can be
doing it faster than your competitor
even a few percentage points on whatever
you know metric you choose you have a
critical advantage that compounds over
time until you win and they die which if
you work in a business that is competing
with other people for a finite resource
EG you know custom the money or
something like that is really important
so my proposal is that it's not just
about process but it's also about the
platform the platform itself has to
embody these values observe orent side
act or into observed assignment and what
we're doing in weave works is focusing
on that with thinking about these sort
of questions given that i'm running on a
container service platform therefore it
could be running any architecture
there's all these things i really want
to know is what's going on I can't just
take a single tool that's designed to
work with an app server and a database
expected to tell me the right things if
I've got a micro services architect or a
big data rap but I want to know some
basic questions is my appt healthy if I
start it now and I leave it for 24 hours
is it still in the same state and if
something goes wrong is it in the app or
the platform of the containers or what I
mean you've got all this new technology
how the hell are you going to know which
bits gone wrong where so you need to
figure all that out and then you need to
of course decide an act so it's not just
about learning but also doing does it
matter maybe it doesn't matter how do I
know compare it with the past what
should I do about it and then who should
do it
and then because all this is so new you
also have to give people a way to get
started that's just a fact so we call
this connect observant control your
applications get started or in turn
observe decide and act and we're giving
you a bunch of tools which some of which
are in 10 states some of which are pre
10 state to support that process nice
quote from mr. cocroft here saying that
we make it easy to do something we made
it so easy that as soon as we launched
our software a year ago everybody wanted
to use it which is really nice and then
in April we started a second project
scope to go with we've met our network
which generates no matter what your app
is no matter what your architecture is a
map of it so that you can start the
process of observing it orienting
yourself and making decisions and this
this is a living project that we of
course invite people to get involved
with we did a release yesterday even
that was no point 7 that was yesterday's
release it's something to see more
sophisticated screen here and finally
run which is our control point right now
very much focused on network operations
like load balancing but in the future
and more thing so the use cases here are
things like blue-green deployment how do
i do Bluegreen deployment independent of
an architecture type that's an
interesting question
and you can use the stuff on ecs if you
want to that was something that Amazon
pimping quite recently I'm very grateful
to them for that so that's what we do
simplest way to connect observe and
control your containers works with any
app no fuss that's it thank you very
much
