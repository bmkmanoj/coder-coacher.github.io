tactic today I will show you how to
create an advanced I own a gallery with
images and also lowing zoom of those
images inside the gallery so some time
ago I had this post about displaying
images and videos in a cool pop over but
some of you asked how to zoom those and
it's a bit tricky so let's get started
and see how we can achieve this we start
with a blank project and we will add
everything later we can also take some
of the code from the last one or you can
take a look at the new article and all
the source code will be there so what we
want to have is yes okay what we want to
have is some tiny thumbnails like in the
last example and also again the ionic
slide box and inside and ionic scroll
view so we can scroll and zoom those
images I will just take everything
inside the ion content and make it look
a bit better and I think we don't need
anything more from this okay let's give
it a name
and the controller will just be our
gallery controller so we have title we
have our ion content and we have a small
item called my images and again we have
a horizontal ion scroll bar or ion
scroll view with some images which we
will take from our controller all those
images have a click event which we'll
call show images with the index of this
image inside this array and some styling
and we don't need to play a video so
let's cut this one out okay let's go to
our fjs and start a new controller which
is the gallery controller and we need
some dependencies we need scope we need
ionic modal and we also need the ionic
slide box delegate and also the ionic
scroll delegate we will see how to use
them later in this tutorial
so first of all we have to define our
images array okay and we will just have
some images inside our image folder
it's some more
come on yes that looks come on oh man
whatever picture to picture three and we
are fine also we want to define a
minimum zoom level which we will need
later okay let's take second to copy our
images I will use just those three and
put them inside this folder okay perfect
let's go back to our code we want to
display our slide box again in a modal
of you so for this we need to create a
new folder inside our WWE folder and we
will call this one just templates and
inside our templates folder we want to
create a new file called gallery zoom
view dot HTML so inside our gallery zoom
view we will have a surrounding div
around everything and this will have
some styling which we will add very soon
and also we want to add on swipe down
event so whenever I use uh swipes down
we want to close our mobile this just
feels cool I think okay
next inside is the eye on slide box and
as in the old tutorial we will have on
slide changed changed okay calling
slight chain okay I guess we well we
don't have to use this I'm not sure if
we will use this one but we will need
the active slide so when you select the
second some nail you want to open this
light box with the second image centered
and that's why we have to pass active
slide or set this from our scope
controller close it good job
next thing we need is an eye on slide
which just represents one complete slide
inside our slide box and as we want to
have as many slides as we have images we
make ng-repeat
with all our images and now we come to
the interesting part well we can already
make this one which will hold our image
but this is not the most interesting
thing here so give it some styling and
we will pass the image source
close it close it and close it okay now
into the funny part the ion scroll which
is responsible for the complete
scrolling or zooming we want to allow
both directions of zooming or scrolling
but as we want a cool zoom view which
feels native we don't want to show a
scrollbar
because that will just look ugly and we
want to obviously allows oming and now
we come to the minimum zoom level which
we can also take from our controller and
we need some styling to you get the
complete result we want so we want this
ion scroll view to cover the complete
width and also the complete hate of our
of you okay two more things we need we
need to select delegate handle and this
will have the name scroll handler plus
or additional the index so we can
identify a specific ion scroll because
we will have three in our slide box on
each view one scroll view and we need to
identify them later on so we have to
give them a unique name and index and
additionally we have to set the on
scroll event which we'll call update
slides datas you will see why we need
this later on it's it's very interesting
I think
and we pass the current active slide and
also just to make sure everything's
working we will catch the on release
event and again call update slide
stitches with our active slide so this
is our ion scroll our image is inside it
and that's our model over so you might
ask why do we need all those things okay
so first of all this outer div is just
to get some styling and this model
overlay the slide box again is to slide
through views and have these dots at the
bottom and the eye on slide represents
one view inside the slide box and
finally why we need all those things so
I try to get the old code working and
some zooming but it not doesn't really
work so what I do when I try to get some
features is look how a let's do it so I
took a look at the Facebook app where
you can zoom in images and scroll
through a list or gallery of images and
what I noticed is that you can just do
either one action at a time so you can
zoom in or you can scroll through the
gallery list so I thought it would be a
great idea to copy this behavior because
you don't have to reinvent everything
inside your app you don't need
innovation all the time so making a cool
app is often about learning from the
best and that's why we want to
deactivate the slide box scrolling
whenever we start zoom or our zoomed
inside our review because this will not
work with scrolling we will have what I
would have a very strange behavior trust
me you can try it if you want so
whenever we scroll in we prevent this
event or disable it and whenever we are
zoomed out to our min zoom level we want
to enable it again I hope this is clear
to you if you have any questions just
leave me a comment before we do this
let's add some styling I'm a bit lazy
today and this is not very interesting
stuff you can find all the code on my
blog or you can just use this our image
will have well 600 heat is a bit high
but whatever for now it's working just
like this and the background is very
dark right now so you can change that if
you want to have a different layout
let's go back to our controller first of
all we need some more functions we need
the show images function which will set
our active slide to parameter pest and
we also want to call show modal yes
and the file will be at templates
gallery zoom view hopefully so we need
this function as well I like to split
those things because you can reuse them
on this way very good okay this one will
use the ionic modal service and we want
to call from template URL which is our
template URL and additionally we have to
pass this current scope and once this is
done we have our modal and we can assign
it to a scope variable and finally say
scope a little show which will bring up
our view finally this is not very
interesting right now I know we have to
close it sometime which is related to
our on swipe down event yes no spelling
errors right now and at this point we
just need to call scope modal height and
finally also make sure to remove here
view now let's get into the interesting
stuff
this is our function which will be
called whenever we start scrolling
inside the scroll view or zooming and as
I said we need to check for the zoom
factor so we use the ioniq scroll
delegate and call get by handle and you
might remember we all gave them an ID
and at this point we're using it so by
giving them number we can easily get
them at this point and at this point we
have a scroll view and now we want to
have the scroll position and finally the
Zoom ok this yeah whatever
so at this point we should have our zoom
factor and now we can check if this zoom
factor is equal to our minimum zoom
which means we are a completely zoomed
out we can say ionic ok make it bigger
we use the ionic slide box delegate and
call an able slide which will just allow
us to use the slide box you might know
what's coming now obviously if the zoom
factor is not the minimums you meaning
we are somewhere inside the image we
just allow assuming and that's
everything you need ok
okay so let's try I will use life reload
maybe okay whatever
and hopefully everything's working at
this point so if you have any questions
on how to use those delegate methods or
why we are using exactly what we're
doing just let me know leave me a
comment or post to my blog and I will
try to find a solution for your problem
it's not working like I want you okay
this okay this is our standard view and
let me check I'm an idiot okay it's
working now select an image and it's not
working right now no problem
we have Safari and we can just use our
inspector to find the problem
well no problems here perfect
yes maybe I should name the function
correctly yes
so this is our classic slide box
interesting can't find variable ionics
lightbox delegate well well well
it's your isn't it okay yeah that's the
part I like about life reload okay no my
arrows right now so on swipe down we can
close it and well it's a bit buggy today
I guess let's try this out and I'm on
the mix so I'm used the Alt key to get
this
yeah whatever two fingers and on that
way I can zoom in and zoom around at
this point you might notice I can't
swipe to the next image so this is
exactly what Facebook doing if you're
inside an image you're not allowed to go
to the next image so hopefully we are
complete zoomed out right now
interesting never seen this behavior
before
okay I think the ioniq slide box is a
bit wrong so let me take a look to fix
it
okay so as you can see obviously our
zoom in was named incorrectly or used
incorrectly here so now everything's
working again open the image you see
you're at the third position you can use
the slide box you can zoom in you can't
go to the next image and okay once
you're out you can go to the next one
this is exactly the behavior we want to
have so have fun with it if you like
this I would be very happy if you leave
a comment or follow my channel so have a
nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
