there tactic in the ionic academy in
this tutorial I will show you how you
can easily implement your own QR code
generator and also how to read this code
so I started a blank new eye on a gap I
can bring it up there's nothing added by
now and the first thing we need to add
is this package ng a QR code to which
will help us to easily show a QR code
with just one input actually
additionally I will also add the Cordova
plug in for a barcode scanner which also
scan QR code so this would be the
Cordova plug-in or PhoneGap plug-in
barcode scanner and finally I'll also
add the NPM package from ionic native
for our barcode scanner if you just want
to display your QR code you obviously
don't need the second two installs now
but I will add them so we can actually
verify that our QR code has the
information that we created our hope
that it contains so here's my app and
the two plugins should be ready in a
second so first of all we need to import
the ng x QR code module which comes from
ng x QR code 2 and we also need to
import our barcode scanner which comes
from an ionic native barcode scanner so
the barcode scanner goes to the array of
our providers and the QR code module
actually goes to our imports as we
import another
on you now we can continue and make use
of these cool things so right inside our
home HTML perhaps this is the QR code
app we can add first of all an input
because we need a way to capture the
data for our QR code which we will
create so placeholder perhaps my cue our
data this is just if you want to give
you users the chance to create the code
or in our example to see how everything
works fine then we need two buttons I on
button full always looks kinda good I
don't know why we need one button to
create our code and we need a second
button second but let's add an eye on
icon as well the barcode icon and this
is create code so we should add icon
left as well and now the second button
almost the same but now scan code and we
use QR scanner as an icon and say scan
code okay um it's already almost enough
but let's add a new card as well below
so inside our card
we will then display the actual QR code
but only if we have set the created code
variable so we will not update the QR
code on every input we will wait until
we are finished and we click create code
and then we set this variable
and now we use the ngx QR code element
so this is a known element from the
package and here we need to set this
value to our created code which is
actually just a string okay so you can
encode whatever you want in our case
it's just a string and and the current
content will say what the value is of
this in clear text again just for us so
this is the most important line right
here below we can also add next or
another card which we will display if we
have scanned the code to verify if the
scan code got the result of our QR code
so most of the stuff here is just to
test things out actually you see it's
one line that you need to create your
code but okay this is the result from
our game we see my QR code data we can
create a code and we can get a code and
now we only need to implement two
functions in our home ts so our create
code and scan code sorry about that
and okay both a super simple so first of
all we need the barcode scanner here as
well so import the barcode scanner and
when we want to scan a code we use our
ionic native plugin and as I said to
create a code we just need to set this
variable of our code so let's create a
few here so we got you our data which is
not we got the created code also now and
we got this
and code also now now when we create a
code we take the input of the ng model
of our input which is QA data and set it
to our created code so super simple just
like it and when we want to scan a code
we use this dot barcode scanner dot skin
and then we will hopefully get some
barcode data click and we can set our
skint code which is the verification
that everything worked - the barcode
data dot text and that's all let me see
okay so first of all let's try if we can
create a code the ionic Academy rocks
create code and it's not working of
course all right so the actual problem
was that I had to create code here which
kind of work because great code is a
function and somehow I could assign a
value to this but of course we need
created code in this position and now we
can again try our apps so the ionic
Academy still rocks and we see that we
got our code right here we got it as a
base64 lock which is the image and we
got the value so now we can bring up our
app to scan this code ok so on the right
side we still see our browser but it
created QR code and on the left side you
see the view of my iPhone so I go ahead
and create scan code and we scan it in
there it is the results from a scan the
ionic Academy still rocks so to verify
another code we create the code the code
changes
I can again hit skin code and our
results from scan is now another code so
just with a few lines of this package
and by using the NPM or ionic native
package for a barcode scanner we're now
able to have our own little QR code
generator and Reader app so if you
enjoyed this tutorial make sure to
subscribe to my channel for more great
ionic videos and also take a look at the
ionic carry me calm which has more
courses projects and a great community
to learn ionic on the best way so I hope
to see you soon have a great day and
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
