from deaf tech day today I will show you
how to build an ionic to-do app using
the backend service called back-end and
if you're not familiar with this tool
what it does is it's a powerful back-end
as a service for angularjs and it
supports ionic quite good you can
connect your own MySQL database or
simply specify database model using
Jason and let's dig right into it so
create an account on back-end comm this
is completely free for now as this is I
think not completely released by now but
it's also very good already so go ahead
and create your account and create a new
app with a title and name you choose I
already have my app here so let's go to
manage app alright
I have already had some requests and
some stuff like this so what we need to
do first of all is create our database
model and for this go to objects model
and to the model Jason so currently you
should have some other stuff in this
field but we just want to have name
field
- duze and inside we were sorry we're
going to have a table to do this and
inside we have only one field which is
the name and this is the type string so
we can have as many - dues as we want
make sure to validate and update these
settings and once you're done what we
also need to do is go to security and
your configuration and make sure at this
point you have anonymous access enable
because for this tutorial we will just
use anonymous
excess so we don't need to perform any
social login because we have this
anonymous token for our app which we
will paste in later so if you have this
ready go to your command line and create
a new blank ionic app and let's wait for
this to happen so some more words you
can create really great apps using this
you can add social you can add teams
you can use third-party integrations
like PayPal and use their services and
well I haven't oh wait a second
no not by now so I haven't used
everything of the service by now but
what I've seen so far is really great so
why not play around with this cool
framework all right the first thing we
need to do is go to our index.html and
add the script for our back-end and for
this you can simply use the CDN file for
back-end and you don't need to do any
more inside the index so go to your fjs
and what we need to do is after ionic we
need to also inject the dependency for a
back-end now we might just or we can
remove this stuff for now but what we
need is a config face for our angularjs
app and inside this config we have a
function using the backend provider
because we need to configure our
back-end provider so first of all say
set app name and this is the name of
your app for me this is defective to do
all right and what we also need to do is
we need to set our anonymous token and
again for you this is your total all
right so now our app is already
configured to use back-end as the
backend and we can go ahead and create
our controller so this will be a very
straightforward example we just need the
scope and we will have to do service
which we can well we could already
create it below and call this one to do
service just like this well leave it for
now all right so back to our controller
we will obviously have an array of two
dues which is empty in the beginning and
we also will have an input field to add
new two dues which is an object so we
can use ng-model on our input in the
view all right
the main function we will use all the
time is get all two dues and this will
get obviously all two dues let's
implement the basic first of all we will
have a scope punch and it to do which
will edit to do obviously and what we
also need is a function called delete to
do using a specific ID to delete it to
do first as we have these let's jump to
our to do service so we can use the real
service so our service
as I said quite simply we need the HTTP
and again we need back-end inside our
service we should specify a base URL and
this base URL points 2 / 1 / objects so
this is standard all the time on
back-end and we use this because well it
won't change but the object name might
change and for me this is - duze so why
is this - duze when we go back to our
model we see that our database model was
called - deuce or this table was called
- deuce so this is the end point we want
to excess all right let's make this a
bit smaller and this a bit bigger all
right so we have this but we need some
more basic functions so to get generic
URL we need the backend dot get API URL
and this comes from back-end and we'll
just give us the first part of the URL
the second part is the base URL and the
third part is our object name alright so
this is the general your for all of our
calls right we also need sorry second
function
which will just be used inside our
service which is get URL for ID because
we might have a special ID like when we
delete two dues so we return get URL +
ID all right now to the real functions
so the first one is get to dues and this
is just a simple function which returns
HTTP GET and we use our get URL I hope
you can follow me so this will make a
basic get request to the to deuce
endpoint so this will give us all the
data of this database okay next one add
to do add to do again is pretty
straightforward HTTP and this time it's
a post request to get URL and to I'm
sorry we obviously have to edit to do we
need the to do object so we just make a
post request to our generic URL and add
the to do the last one is delete to do
and for this we need an ID of the object
we want to delete we don't have to
return anything here but it's good to
see that our request is finished and
what we do is we make an HTTP delete
request to now get URL for ID because we
need the URL for this specific ID of the
object alright that's already our
service make sure to return all the
stuff we have here so now
come on I'm a bit lazy again but yes and
finally delete to do so this is our
complete service and as you can see we
just have those two functions which give
us access to our database and from then
on we can use the standard get post or
delete create methods update we could
use as well but we don't need update for
this simple example all right so let's
get back to our app controller and
inside we get all to dues one more thing
make sure to call get all to dues at the
end of your controller because this is
where we load our to dues and we needed
to do call it initially once we launch
our app so inside get all two dues the
only thing we need to do now is say to
do servers get to do this and once this
is finished we hopefully get a result
and this result is hopefully our to-do
array so you have to access the object
data the data you can inspect the sorry
you can inspect the result object if you
like to but you can also trust me
because I have tried this all right
next one we want to edit to do and at
this point we use our scope input object
and again we have a completion block
with result no error handling in this
little app to make it really simple
you know this is just to update our
input field so it's empty again and what
I don't really like is that we now have
to again call get wall to do this so I
have used firebase before and this uses
broadcast messages and so you can
connect or listen to on update messages
this is a bit cooler than all the time
called and get all to deuce once
something has changed but for now it's
okay and as far as I know they also have
an implementation using socket IO so you
might be able to also listen to those
broadcast messages for now let's keep it
like this and let's go to our delete to
do function which we'll just call delete
to do with the ID and again we have our
completion blog which will again call
get all to deuce because we have deleted
it to do and we need to update this we
could also delete it from our local list
but I'm not really a fan of doing this
because the action might have not been
performed on the server and so you
delete the local to do but it's still
under service so I just want to be
synchronized and make sure to have the
same array as the server database has so
just call this alright so this is our
controller stuff and I think we are
already done with this so let's go back
to our index and craft little view for
it so let's remove everything inside the
body and sign our ng-controller to the
body
which is the app control well to make it
look a bit of cooler we use a header bar
so we want to be positive today this
should be I on a table our clothes and
inside the bar let's just say sorry no
not called but class like equals title
alright so this is my back and to-do
list okay so we got our head Abba now
let's move on to the content section of
our view and let's give it a class has
header so nothing is below our header
bar inside the iron content we first of
all have item input sorry
input inside so we need this to insert
new to do's and make it look good
inside we have a label the class is item
input wrapper and inside the label we
just have an input field of the type
text placeholder can be well new to do
and make sure to assign it to our ng
model and this will be input dot name so
this is quite important because the
object we sent to the server needs to be
an object and have the key name as this
is the only field in our database so
this is quite important to be
exactly like this all right label is
closed and below the label we also add a
button with some cool styling let's make
it balanced and this needs to be a small
button on the side so the ng click event
for this button is simply calling it to
do and make sure to say it to do for the
button oh come on
yeah well leave it like this all right
close the button close dev now finally
we come to our ion list which will
display our - duze so we want to be able
to delete to do so we activate can swipe
through so we can just swipe our
elements to the left side and have a
delete button on them inside our ion
list we have ion items and we use an NG
repeat to go over all of the items in
our reduce array yes okay and we just
use item name which is the name of the
to do and we use an ion option button
yeah like this and we should make this
button red colors so assertive and the
energy click for event for this you get
it it's obviously delete to do and at
this point we pass item ID so when we
get the array back from the server the
object will all the time have a name and
the ID so we can use this ID to remove
our yes delete the to do but at this
point I just want to say delete thank
you
and make sure to close your tech all
right so hopefully this is it let's give
it a try let's use Safari all right so
here's our to-do list and make it a bit
smaller so it looks like on device so
this is my first to do maybe it works
yeah I thought so
so things never work on the first try so
it's a good time to open our debugging
area all right so I finally found the
shortcuts it was disabled on my new iMac
so let's see what the arrow is and okay
so we cannot make uh-huh okay so this
looks already wrong and let's make this
a bit smaller
go to your fjs again and we see that
after objects we need to have another
slash or you could put it before to do
whatever you like and also we need one
behind this I think so
save it and you see we already have the
two two deuce
we added previously so now I can close
this and my first real to do we add the
to do and it's in the list so we should
be able to swipe this suicide we are we
click the lead enter to do is deleted
all right so this works pretty great oh
we are already inside Safari I forgot so
let's go back I think it was under REST
API playground and this is a place where
you can test with your a
yeah this is get a list of items and how
let's give it a try we don't need
anything else
so this is the generic get method we
make to our to Do's and let's see this
is the response buddy
we get so we got data and here is the ID
or this is the ID again in the name so
this is one object and this is the
second one so I'm not sure what this
does alright so yeah we could get a list
and pagination but this is just to show
you how you could also test your object
alright so this tutorial was about
creating a simple to-do list using
back-end and the ionic framework and if
you have any questions please leave me a
