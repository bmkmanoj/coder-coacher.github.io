deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy in
this video I will show you how to
include automatically prompting you
users to rate your app for your ionic
app and we will start by adding the
Cordova plug-in called up rate and also
installing the NPM package from ionic
native for a parade
so this plugin will based on some
contract that we put in our user if you
would like to rate our app on the App
Store and if you would like to we will
take him to the App Store of course you
could implement it on your own but this
plug-in is really any so we will use it
I started the blank new app there's
nothing else inside here but s this will
only work on a device there's no need to
run our app inside the browser now first
of all make sure to import operate in
your app module and add it to your
providers that's already half of the
work for this tutorial and the second
step is to go to your rep components and
remove this and we need be afraid here
as well so we're going to import it copy
this and now we can use it here as well
once our app is ready so first of all
when we use our okay of course it's just
a parade we need to set some preferences
for our parade and this object can get
quite big but we will take care of this
in a second and after you have
configured your preferences you simply
call a parade prompt for waiting and you
can pass in a variable if you want to
show it immediately
so you have passed in true our prompters
rating all the time the user starts yeah
I will add this now for our demo but if
you want to completely make use of the
Preferences leave true out or set it to
false so for our preferences first of
all we got open in open store in app
default to fold and this is also
important because otherwise I think we
have a tiny pack on iOS but anyway let's
put it here so we got it then we got the
display name which is our custom app
title so I will just call this silence F
and we will see how this looks inside
our view later then something really
interesting is uses until prompt so this
will count how often our F has been
started or the prompt has been tried to
display and it really makes sense to set
this to a number like in the default is
I think 3 so perhaps five or four even
before you ask your users to rate your
app otherwise they will not have used it
enough to really rate it appropriately
then you can say prompt again for each
new version if you update your app it
makes sense perhaps to ask the user
again if we would like to rate the new
app on this depends of course on your
preferences as well then perhaps the
most important part is actually our
store app URL and this is an object with
iOS and Android
I think perhaps Windows as well but I
don't have any window set so for iOS
let me show my iTunes Connect of one of
my apps so this is crossing numbers a
little funny game
and this is my Apple ID and I need to
copy this ID into our iOS settings and
for Android it looks like this so market
and details and aeri equals and then we
got the ID off the app so most of the
time you can find your ID right inside
your config if you've build it for some
platforms you will have set your bundle
ID here this is just now of one already
released episode it's not the idea of
this app which is kind of blank app and
this is for store information enough so
then we got custom local and here we can
actually set the strings for our afraid
so we can set a title perhaps do you
enjoy and then we can use this
placeholder which will be replaced by
our display app name so in the end we
will see do you enjoy Symes app and what
you can do as well is setting a message
so perhaps if you enjoy and again
Simon's app with your mind taking a
moment to reach it something like this
and we can set the cancel button know
things we can set the later button so
you know this for most of the apps they
will have something like remind me later
and we should use this and finally we
got the rate button label this is also
the label I think and this should be
rate it now okay
so quite a big on preferences config
already but you can also do is setting
some cold eggs if you want then it's
super useful in our example what I will
show it so we got the on rate dialog
show so this will be called once the
dialog is shown to our user yeah
whatever
do something in here and the second one
would be on button clicked and here we
would get actually the button index so I
think perhaps this is 0 1 2 or 1 2 3 you
can lock this out and see whatever
happens then ok or perhaps we can do it
select it index index and you have also
Rach yeah we don't want to use the
callback in this example ok so I think
we are ready to build our app of course
this won't work inside the browser we're
using Cordova plugins so we need to
deploy this now to our device and let's
see it on a device in a second all right
so here's our app on my iOS device and I
will start it now so we can see that the
title of our dialog is do you enjoy
chimes app so it's replaced and same for
if you enjoy chimes app would you mind
taking a moment then we got the three
buttons rated now remind me later in
note things if I had no things nothing
really happens and also rated later
won't work very well in this example so
let's pick rate it now and this opens up
the app store and brings us directly to
the app with the ID that we specify
alright so I hope you enjoyed this video
so it's pretty easy to include a parade
into your app but it makes totally sense
to get some more customer reviews on the
Android or iOS App Store if you liked
the video make sure to subscribe to my
channel and receive updates on all the
upcoming videos on ionic also take a
moment to look at the ionic Academy com
if you're looking for more ionic
training videos projects and great
communities so I'd love to see you there
take care and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
