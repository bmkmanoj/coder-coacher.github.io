tactic and the ionic academy in this
tutorial I will show you how you can
build your own chat application with
ionic and a simple nodejs again with
socket IO so I've already created the
starting backend template and you can
find all the code for this inside the
tutorial as well basically we just need
this package Jason with two dependencies
for Express and socket IO and perhaps
the main entry point and then we got the
index file where we got this IO on
connection block so whenever somebody
connects to our back-end will listen to
three different events so one is add
message this means somebody has sent a
new message and then we will emit so
sent to all the connected clients a
message which will have the type or the
name message and the object which is our
actual text from the message the name
from the person and time step then we
also listen to set nicknames so our
people will be able to pick their
nickname we will set it and then we will
also emit a new event with a event here
joint so we can catch in our app that
somebody joined the chatroom and finally
we got the disconnect event where we
will broadcast that somebody left the
chat
the app is running here we can run it
with a note in XJS and perhaps call npm
install before doing this yes guess
that's it so once this is ready you can
start your server and simply let it run
in the background yes
and there it is so it's now running on
this port and we can leave this for now
with the next one right here okay
so I've already started a new blank
ionic app and we can go ahead and first
of all create another page which will be
our actual chatroom
so we will start on the home page like
it is already configured here and then
we will go through the chatroom we also
need an NPM package called NG socket IO
well perhaps we don't have to use this
but it makes our life a bit easier if
we're using a socket IO connection to a
back-end so okay it's installed so we
can go to our app module and import the
socket IO module and also perhaps this
socket IO config from NG socket IO and
then we need to configure our connection
the type socket i/o config and this
needs a URL which is in our case and the
localhost lock we just saw inside the
console additional options not really
needed at this point so to add it to our
module we now go to our imports and say
socket IO module for route and pass in
the config ok that's everything for the
set up now let's continue to our home
page that's set on the home page we want
to join a chat with a name so we need an
input field for our name
and we create an ion label set nickname
and then below the ion input of the type
text and we just use an NG model here we
don't need a special form so we use
nickname placeholder nickname and that's
it and below the item we need a button
to actually join our chat so I on button
and on click we will call join chat
and finally we disable this button this
a build on if our nickname is still
empty so in that case we will not join
as nickname okay if we launch our app we
see that it's not really disabled okay
we haven't set the nickname eeeh so we
go to the type script file and say
nickname in the beginning like this and
then we need our first connection with
socket at this point yes import socket
from ng socket IO and inside our joint
yet now we start so once we want to join
the chat when we click this we call this
socket connect so this is the first
thing we need to call to actually be
recognized from the backend and to be
connected through the socket the next
thing we want to do is send a new
message to the backend and this is done
by calling image and in the beginning we
want to set our nickname
which is this dot nickname and finally
after these two actions we can go to the
actual chat page so we push the chat
room page and we also pass our nickname
like this okay
perhaps no I think there's no lock
inside anyway we see that nickname and
we can join as somebody and we get to
the next page which is all we wanted um
but this is placeholder and you it okay
so now we were able to set our nickname
and get to the chatroom page but we
haven't implemented a chat so let's
continue with this now and the chatroom
page first of all needs an array of
messages in the beginning it will be
empty and we will get the nickname
through from the previous page and we
will also be able to send new messages
of course we need the socket connection
here as well and we also need the toast
controller from ionic to show toast once
somebody joined or left our chat ok
let's start easy our nickname comes from
the left parent so just get it like this
and we're good now it actually gets a
bit more interesting so we create a
function get messages and this function
returns the messages but not just one
time and we return an observable
so this will help us to stay up to date
as we can publish new events on this
it's observable you will see how in a
second observable okay so I said new
observable and we got the observer and
below we returned our observable okay so
what our observable does is actually
listening to the socket connection and
whenever the event message is
broadcasted from our server so you see
when somebody calls at message to the
server the server emits
message so we're listening to message
and we will get some data at this point
and this data can be used to say
observer next data so anybody who
subscribe to gas messages will
automatically then get this new message
so in the constructor we can go ahead
and call get messages which is an
observable we call subscribe so we will
all the time get a new message when
someone something happens and we simply
say this touch messages does push the
new message okay I hope this is clear so
far so the observable listens to our
socket connection and broadcast whenever
a new went comes in we catch this and
put it to our messages array to send a
message we basically do the same as we
did before with our nickname we call
this dot socket image to send a new
message of the type add message and we
pass text they start
such so afterwards perhaps set our
message again to an empty string and
that's all the messages stuff what we
need as well okay like get messages we
need the same for our users
so get users returned observable but
here we are listening to users changed
event we do all of the things we did
before and here we're again using get
users subscribe some data and now we can
get the user object from data user
because again if we go back to the
server whenever somebody joins or left
the user change event is broadcasted
along with the user and the event so we
can get the user out of this and we can
also check what the actual event was so
in case it was that somebody left we can
display a toast message and implement a
little help of function show toast with
a message that's sorry let toast equals
this toast controller come on
create the message is our message
perhaps a duration of two seconds
yes sorry about that
and finally toes present okay now we can
use this so if somebody has left the
chat we call this dog show toast and say
use the left
of the user so this should just be the
username and otherwise we say use a
joint again with the user something
missing with C okay some additional
stuff perhaps I only you will leave it
makes sense to unsubscribe or disconnect
from the server if we are not anymore in
this chat so simply called disconnect
once you are done and now our chat is
actually ready as far as I think so
let's see well whatever we open this
private window to the left and now let's
see I will join as silent and here I
will join as fake sign we see already
use a joint fixed time so this is
working what actually is not working
okay use the left is also working fine
what we haven't implemented is the
actual chat view so let's open the chat
room and do it
remove this go ahead chat and inside our
ion content we will use the grid system
to position our chat bubbles a bit
better and first of all we iterate over
all the messages of our array select
message of messages and then we will
craft two different column blocks so the
first one will be just nine units on the
left side and this will be used if the
message that from is not equal our
nickname
we will also add some styling in a
second and also actually we don't need
conditional styling here right but I
will edit anyway let me copy this in and
perhaps we could do all of this styling
on one block whatever I was ng class you
could now say if it is or at the class
my message if the message is from my own
nickname or at the class other message
if it's not from me so this was
basically the idea behind this but as we
are already making the ng-if here it's
kinda useless but we will keep it for
now oh this is the class username and we
got message dot from and sorry
oh yeah but yeah that's fine so we got
the user name at the top then we got the
actual message dot text so this will be
the content of the message and then we
also got the timestamp which is created
on the server side so message that
created and we use the data pipe to make
it like this okay and now we got the
timestamp as well this is the column for
message from somebody else and although
it's a bit to placate I will use it like
this and use offset three here so our
own messages will be pulled to the right
this one uses nine from the left and
this more or less nine from the right
side of course
will be used if it's our nickname again
ng class is more or less not really
needed here but we keep it the rest is
the same and below our iron content we
also add an eye on footer because we
need of course a way to submit new
messages so I on role as will be the
message row and inside again using the
grid layout the input for our items saw
Sun just comes through my window
while I started recording this but I'm
too lazy to move so bit hard to see my
screen but I will get this done okay we
got the text input we got a place holder
which is message then we got the ng
model which should be our message object
and that's all for the input the column
closes and then we got still three units
left in our grid layout so we can add a
button ion button and we make it clear
color primary perhaps this is also by
default I think anyway and this should
also be disabled in case the message is
an empty string so inside the button we
are not using any icon today I think I
just set
okay finally we need some CSS but I will
put this in you can find it in the
according to toriel it's just some
styling for the username some petting
and stuff for the message a background
for both my message and other messages
so we can distinguish them we got the
time and finally the bottom message row
so let's see how do we have any arrows
let's see it looks good so far so let's
try again we join as Simon okay I on
iPod here it's that's not right it
should be of course input thanks Simon
and we are joining and fake Simon also
joined the chatroom so my first real
message we send it and we see the
message is from us so it's a bubble on
the right side we got our name the
message and the time and here we see
this is the fake diamond so the message
is from somebody else so I am fake would
be my own message and you see so it's
kind of funny to work with this circuit
stuff as you can see it's really super
simple the server is just a few lines of
listening to events and also the front
end is not really that hard to implement
we just listen to some events using
observable and emit our new values with
some CSS we are able to craft this
beautiful little chat view if I leave
now the fakes I'm
the channel now the one thing you need
to remind here is that this is a super
lightweight just example for socket IO
we're not storing any messages so if
this person joins again the person will
not see the history of the chat so this
is just like whatever live chat without
any history if you would want to have
something like this you might want to
pop in some MongoDB or whatever database
you like store the messages once you get
them add some API calls you get a
historic church or the history of a chat
but you see that it's really quite easy
to connect to socket IO with our ionic
app and to build a real-time chat app or
whatever real-time if you plan to build
so I hope you enjoyed this video if you

if you're interested in learning I own
ik I will see you next time have a great
day and take care
