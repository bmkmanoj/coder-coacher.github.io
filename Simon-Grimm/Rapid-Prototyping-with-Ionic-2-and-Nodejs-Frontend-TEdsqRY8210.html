from deaf tactic this is the second part
of a three part series on rapid
prototyping with ionic 2 and node.js in
the first part we've created our little
API or back-end and now in the second
part we will develop the ionic 2
front-end to connect to our back-end I
already started the app simply with
ionic start the name of the app we use
the blank template and it should be an
ionic 2 project I've already opened the
code editor and we need to install now
some know not install but create two
files which will both be a provider so
one is the app settings provider and the
second one is to do service if you have
not followed the first tutorial I
recommend you go back so you have the
server up and running once we develop
our ionic app we can already surf the
app and also I have running my MongoDB
and I start my little backend so this is
running this is running and the ionic
app will be running very soon so we can
close or move it to the bottom to see
some arrow locks we might encounter
alright here's the app let's make it
look like a phone screen at least
something like that let's increase it a
bit all right so let's go to our files
first of all we need to import our two
files we have created so the first one
was the to do service and the second one
was the app settings you can see I have
typed and auto-completed these and
Visual Studio code already imported our
files this is a little extension if you
want to know the name I'm not sure it's
something like auto import or so just
leave a comment if you need the correct
name if you can't find it so we have
imported our providers let's work on
them now first of all the upsetting x'
is a very simple provider we actually
don't need any of this I wanted to have
a global settings or not really global
but we can import it anywhere where we
have defined the URL for our back-end so
there were different ways I'm not
completely sure if this is the best way
there are other ways to import global
settings but for me this one was quite
handy and working so our back end is at
localhost I think it was 301 ok the
constructor can actually be empty
because we don't need any specific stuff
in here but we want to have a function
get API URL which we can then use in the
class which will make the actual
back-end calls this will simply return
conflict at API URL now why do we do
this in the third part we will connect
to a remote host and in a real scenario
you will very often have a local
development environment and the remote
development so by simply changing the
API URL to the remote back-end we can
easily switch from the real back end to
our testing back end and this is the
only reason to have this file now let's
continue with our to do service as you
know we have three routes in our
back-end
- duce created to do and delete it to do
so we need the public HTTP provider and
we need also our app settings which are
the app settings I really like this are
to imported it's so easy so first of all
we start with get to duce which will
return the list of all our - dues and
therefore we make an HTTP GET request -
okay
let's also define it up here oh come on
this dot app settings
in API URL okay so now we don't have to
always call the function again we can
simply say this API URL + - dues and we
also want to map this because we know
inside our responds first of all
transform it to a JSON and we want to
result field of the call all of the
following calls are more or less the
same so let me copy them in okay so we
have a to do which will take a new to do
make a post request again - to duce
but inside the body we send the text of
this new to do and finally we have
delete to do which will make a delete
call - - duce / the ID of the to do so
it's a very good idea if you have some
kind of back-end that you always put
your calls in a service like this and
don't have them inside the component for
the view but for now we can actually go
to our view we are ready with the
settings in the to do service and we
need to
define unobservable let's be a type any
sometimes the auto-completion sucks a
bit and we need to import the observable
somehow this is not automatically
working we need a load reduced function
which will set our two deuce to use our
to do service this is the to do service
now the our import works again just like
I hope it would we also need some more
stuff from ionic like an alert
controller not sure if you can import it
now we can't and we also want a toast
control up to display little toast
messages we also need to import it here
because for this the auto import is not
working and not sure why but to load or
to deuce we can now simply use our to do
service and call get to do this it's
observable so it will be loaded and
displayed once it's ready and we always
want to do this on startup now three
functions we need we need at to do to
edit to do we need remove to do
remove it to do for a given ID and
finally can make it private to show a
little toast message indicating what
happened with a specific function okay
let's see if it's compiling because load
to do should already work if you're
loading that's way to sing no K before
we add the rest of our add and remove
let's see if we can actually connect to
our back-end so let's give it a title
def tactic rapid to duce and inside our
content we can first of all remove this
stuff and we want to display our to Do's
in a little ion list very simple very
basic stuff I'm not using the standard
item but I'm using the ion item sliding
because we want to add some sliding
component to have slide to remove and we
want to have items with an NG for using
let to do of - duze which is our
observable and market s s okay okay now
we can actually use eye on item oh yeah
that's a cool function just turn out now
very interesting and we use the to do
text additionally we will have eye on
item options and this is the sliding
button I mentioned before we also need
to specify the side so I want to slide
it in from the right side and inside we
have a simple ion button
because it's the delete button we make
it the color danger and the click event
will call removed to do with the ID of
the to do now we know this from the
response we saw inside postman in the
first video yeah well it's just the ID
which is auto generated by MongoDB we
can also give it a name okay it's
already completed and below we want to
have the text delete an item options
close sliding close the list close now
we need an another option to pet stuff
and for this we will use the I on Feb
which is new anionic - a very cool
button which is floating above the
content at the right bottom side in this
case so you can give it a button which
is ion hop the click event again and
this will be add to do to add in you to
do and also the ion icon let's say it's
a plus sign so head okay
let's save weight and okay we don't have
any to dues I'm not sure if this is
correct but let's see mmm actually it's
not really correct so let to do of
traduce this to do is get to dues and
how to do this and get to do
it's my conflict correct I'm not
completely sure nope now it is correct
let's wait and hopefully our to do is
appear up here yes my second to do in my
third to do which you can also see in
the response you can create another one
my just created to do it's created let's
refresh the view and we see the third so
grabbing the data from the backend is
already working now let's go back and
implement our three functions so first
of all the show toast is very simple we
use our toast controller to create a new
toast we show the message we gave to it
and present it nothing really fancy here
to edit to do we use a little prompt
because it's the easiest way I'm using
an alert control okay and this will be
title of add to do the message says
enter the text for your new to do and
the inputs is now the interesting part
of this so let's start with a name it's
the text field
we need this name later to grab a
reference to this field and the place
hola says I don't know by medical stuff
like this okay so this is our text field
now we need the buttons of the prompt
and the first button should be a simple
cancel button so we only make the text
cancel no cancel
and ionic handles the rest for us the
second button is the Save button so it
has the text save and now we create a
handler for this button so we get the
data once we press this button and
inside this data we have access to the
text field so now we can use our to do
service and call nope
ad to do with data dot text we can
subscribe to this event okay yeah we can
use data again cuz inside this block
it's the new variable and finally use
our show toast we know from the backend
we get the message backs let's say when
we created to do we get the success shoe
and the message success procreating you
to do so we can show a toast with this
message and we want to update our list
so we call load to do this again
we're not using success here it's a very
simple example obviously you should or
you can always check for errors but in
this case I want to make it as simple as
possible that's everything for add now
let's continue with remove it's even
more simple we use the to do service
again we use delete to do we got the ID
from the view so there's nothing really
special we have to do here just again
show the message from the backend and
call our load to deuce again know this
would be the correct indentation okay
let's update and let's see enter then
wait for it wait for it okay so we have
three to do is currently we have the
swipe event
and we delete the second one and it's
deleted I can tell you a lot but you can
see it's not appearing here anymore and
you can also use Roma mango again to use
you see we only got two elements I
remove the first remove the first one
and we only have one more object in the
database now let's use our fab button
which is not yet working because um
because why is it not working click Add
to do I'm not completely sure why it's
not working click Add to do unless
everything right you have to mark it as
public let's see what is the alert ah I
know I know
I'm not I've created the prompt but I
actually need to present it okay save it
again run it again and let's wait for it
the update process is already a lot
faster than it was in the beginning so
yes now it works a to do generate the
live back-end is the next task we save
it we have successfully created new to
do and it appears right here can you
lead our to use we can add as create new
video and there it is so now we've
connected a very simple ionic app to our
real deck end
now we can use this play around develop
the app and do stuff which is pretty
awesome already but what if we want to
show this to other persons obviously
they don't have access to our localhost
back-end so we need to find a way to get
the ionic app out and host the backend
somewhere where people can access it and
this will be part of the third video of
this series but for now play around with
your little working front-end and
back-end you're now officially a
full-stack developer and I hope you
subscribe to my channel and I will see
you back here for the third part of the
video series very soon
