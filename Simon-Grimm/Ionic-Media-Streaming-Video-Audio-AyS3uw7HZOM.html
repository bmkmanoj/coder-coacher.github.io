deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy in
this video I will show you how to use
media streaming with ionic so we want to
load some video file and some audio file
from a remote server and display it
inside our ionic app so I've started a
blank new ionic app as always and we go
ahead and first of all add the Cordova
plug-in for streaming media besides the
Cordova plugin we of course need to
install our ionic native the ionic
native package for media streaming as
well and once this is done or we can
already start to import it to our app
module so import streaming media from
and finished an ionic native
streaming media and make sure to edit to
your array of providers so we are
already done here and can go to our home
page so media streaming and we will just
need a few buttons in this example to
test out the functionality of the media
streaming so go ahead and create the
buttons so first of all we of course
need a way to start our video and then
we need two more buttons the second one
is to start audio so we can display both
audio and video from a remote server and
for audio we also got the option to stop
this you can also add the button to stop
the video but in my case the video was
always displayed fullscreen
so a button here made really no sense I
think these three buttons or functions
is what's working for both iOS and
Android there are some more specific
cases for iOS but I wanted to keep this
general because if we only have
something that works for iOS it doesn't
really help I think so we got start
videos audio stuff audio good so far
now we need our private streaming media
yes the import was already good ok like
this and we also can import streaming
video options and streaming audio
options because we can pass some options
to our calls here so go ahead and create
options of the type
streaming video options like this and
now we see we can define for example a
success callback so this will of course
come up after it was successfully played
whatever do whatever you want here then
we can define an error callback same
like before and we can also say the
orientation types not really any
information here but you could pick
something like portray or landscape here
so these are all streaming video options
you can also go to the class and see
that we got some more in it fullscreen
as well oh oh there's audio where as we
do out there video ok for a video
actually we can only define these three
functions are these two functions and
the orientation perhaps there's also
some not really a good description here
okay but as you can see for audio we can
define some more work we will get to
this in a second
first of all let's now start our video
by calling streaming media dot and as
you can see we got pause audio play
audio play video resume oh do stop audio
so a bit more options for audio than for
video and let me just grab the link so
it's a very classic the big bunny I
think you should know this and also pass
in your options and you're already good
to go right here
so for start audio as I said it's more
or less the same but in this case we got
streaming audio options and of course
there's no orientation in this case but
perhaps something like in it fullscreen
so the problem is here that this in a
full-screen only seems to work for iOS
so in iOS we can prevent that audio is
displayed in full-screen but I think for
iOS we cannot prevent it for Android so
for Android even though we just have
audio the same player like for a video
will come up but we got the option to
change the background color image and
scale type of that image if you just
want to display audio in the background
of your app I think this plug-in is not
right for you but in our case no we want
to play audio and now I need some audio
file let's grab it you can find the link
of course on the quick win on the
Academy page and again the call is more
or less the same just a link to your
file and then the
options and finally stop audio is pretty
much just one line so streaming media
stuff audio so pause and resume audio is
also I think only working on iOS so we
cannot use it here okay okay
so we can see this right here but
actually you see it's not working
because we're using cutover plugins so
we need to to Floyd this F now to our
device or simulator and then we can
inspect our functions a bit more all
right so here's our app on my iPhone and
mi now go ahead and click start video we
see that the video comes up and I don't
know if you hear the sound but there's
actually some sound here okay and for
start audio I guess it's a bit more
complicated because you're not hearing
this sound at all let me just and D
couple it so you can see it anymore but
now you should actually hear that yes
our crazy sound file whatever this is is
displayed alright so I hope this video
gave you an idea how you can easily
implement streaming with ionic from a
remote file and if you enjoyed this
video make sure to subscribe to my
channel and also check out the ionic
academy comm for more ionic training
video courses and a community that will
help you to learn ioneiy accessor so
thanks for watching and see you next
time
