from the ionic Academy in this video I
will show you how we can implement a
simple fingerprint or touch ID login
with ionic and I've started a blank new
ionic app so nothing's going on by now
and we start by adding first of all the
Cordova plug-in deep Cordova plug-in for
fingerprint and this plug-in is for both
Android and iOS
there's also another plugin which only
works for iOS touch ID so in that case
you would have to use two different
plugins and with this one we hopefully
can use just one for both platforms some
reason paste is not working with my
keyboard today anyway make sure to
install also the ionic native package so
after installing the NPM package we also
create two pages so ionic G page home so
this will create the home page again
with a module file and then we also
create a login page which will then
become our first page of the app so
let's go to the app components and right
here we change this to be login page and
of course we can remove the reference
for the home page here and also all the
references for home page here and here
and here and finally we need to make
sure to import our fingerprint from add
ionic native fingerprint and then edit
to the array of providers down here
alright so far we are fine I think
yeah so let's go to the login screen and
we will build a little very super simple
login right here
primary login and then within the
content we want this one passport design
I would call it where we have like a
door or something so you will see it we
will use the iron row with a line items
Center to keep everything in line and
then we will use a call five on both
sides so in the middle we have two units
left I think and there we also add the
class lock column so we will implement
those CSS classes soon and we got the
lock background image background and
then we also got the little image which
I already copied to our assets folder
which is just an image of the lock and
we will give it also a class lock image
and this one will be capable so then we
can attach our actual action to this
image so let's see how this looks okay
come on the image is there lock PNG oh
whatever perhaps I need to restart build
but anyway we can continue with the CSS
for this class because it wouldn't look
good right now so first of all we got
the lock in row which should take 100%
off the screen yeah there's actually the
lock and it also has a click event
so the lock-in ro should have a fate of
100 and then we got also the column
which also should have a hate of 100
then we continued with a lock background
so this will be like a little line
through the screen to pixels big 8 100%
and the background will be little gray
color and also margin left just edit so
we are in the middle of the screen more
or less and then we got the lock image
which should be completely in the middle
of our screen so top:0 bottom:0 left:0
right:0 and margin auto and perhaps a
little padding if we liked no auto yes
petting and now the screen looks a bit
like our 1password app if our app is
locked of course there's a bit more
animation there but I think we're fine
here so let's actually implement our
function and go to our login page so for
the home page we don't have to change
anything perhaps just at this is private
area so once we reach that screen we're
sure that the login was successful so to
perform our login we basically only need
our plugin so prey with fingerprint
fingerprint there it is and then when we
call login we just call the plugin
and say either is available if you want
to first check if it's available or just
use so to show it and then you can
specify a few fingerprint options so
let's see first of all the one really
needed is client ID and this is just the
ID that recognizes your application
within the keychain of the device so
it's more or less the idea of your and
if you like to you can use a client
secret only for Android yeah
password whatever you like to and then
something like you could use a localized
fallback title for iOS and the localized
reason like I use pin or please
authenticate something like this but
this is completely optional I will just
leave it out for now and then we
hopefully get a result and this means we
are authenticated now we can use our nav
controller to simply call save route
with the home page so then we will be
guided to the next page if there's an
error we can catch it perhaps print it
out like this now of course as we're
using cordova plugin this won't work in
the browser so let's switch over to my
device and see it in action alright so
here we are with the app on my iOS
device and if I hit the red lock I will
be asked just like any native of our
application for my touch ID so this is
iOS not Android or any way this might
look different and you can also see the
idea of our client of the fingerprint of
the app whatever the client ID we
defined here is now right here so if I
put on the right finger
I hope you don't cut it we are locked in
and inside the area so with just a few
lines we were able to implement this
really cool feature which many apps
today use which really feels native to
the user not like any web app or
something like this
so this is really a quick win you can
easily implement in your app if you
enjoyed this video make sure to
subscribe to my channel there are a lot
more videos you can consume that will
hopefully help you to build better ionic
apps and also make sure to check out the
ionic Academy com where we got some
courses I think more than 20 already by
now project and the great community that
will help you to get forward and make
more progress with your apps and your
ionic journey have a great day and take
care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
