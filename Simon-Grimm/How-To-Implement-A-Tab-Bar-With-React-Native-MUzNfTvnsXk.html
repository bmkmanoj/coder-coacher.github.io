tactic with a video tutorial on how to
implement a tapa with react native so
today we will make a very simple react
native app for iOS and we will see how
to add the tapa component so it's very
easy and I will start with a yeah with a
standard react native templates so let's
start with that
okay I hope this won't take long
so in addition to our file we already
have when we ended our new app we also
need to to create two more files okay I
hope I hope he's doing fine yet
everything's here okay so we can also
open up our app and also start our Xcode
project okay whatever
yes okay that was wrong obviously
and we can open it and we can also run
it on some device already so okay let's
go back to our implementation so here we
already have the standard stuff which
react native creates for us and the
react package comes up when we launch
the iOS project so now as I mentioned
earlier we need two more files which
will be the Welcome dot IO SJS and also
the mark I Oh SJS so those two will be
our tabs be the basic template so let's
take a look now our app by now that's
the default okay you can refresh it but
nothing happens right now okay so let's
start first of all we need to require
our two components right now they won't
be initiated because there's nothing in
those files but we will come to that
later
so welcome will be the Welcome iOS and
the more will be guess what
more than iOS okay
so from now on we can use them so that's
pretty cool
here we need that registry we don't need
those things but we need the tap our iOS
component and we need the general
component so now we don't need styles
inside our template and also I want to
do this in a different ways so you can
delete that as well
okay sorry there was a little problem
with my syntax highlighting so let's go
back and we create a class which will
use the a class 6
syntax so this is a bit cooler I think
and okay so inside our main class we
will need the general render function
which will return the state for our view
so here we have our top bar iOS
component and this is just the outer one
so we can say selected tab equals this
stage selected tab so okay this is not
yet implemented but we will come to this
very soon okay so this is in general
your tab bar
okay what do you need inside at a bar
obviously you need items so you will or
you can make just as many items as you
want here and you can always specify if
it's selective and okay I can copy this
so the first one is selected when we are
at this stage welcome and it has an icon
which will just be a very standard
featured icon this is already packaged
inside here and on press we want to
perform an action and this action will
be this dot set state okay let's make it
this way and here we will just make the
selected tab will now be welcome so the
tapa item will recognize this and you
will see that it's selected once you
have done this so finish this and close
our tap our item sorry and we also need
to close the tap our iOS
item okay so this there will be the
first item and here we need to have our
you so I think this won't work right now
yes
okay component I like the error
reporting okay so yeah it's no problem
well let's just continue so as I said we
need to have our view here and this will
be the place where we include or inject
our welcome view which we will implement
very soon so this makes it very easy to
yet to split those things into different
files so we don't end up with one giant
file okay obviously we will need at
least one more item which will be more
and has the image of contacts and this
will set the state to more okay so a
this one will have the moral component
and yeah that's our base template right
now obviously this won't work
as you can see and there's one more
thing we need to implement so the tapout
will try to get this that state selected
tab and this is not set right now so we
need to implement a constructor for our
class
and inside we will cause super and we
will also set our current state to the
welcome state so now it's always defined
in the beginning and then it can be
changed when you click on whatever
so right now whatever I know it will be
fine for now okay so our render function
is ready this is ready now we need to
implement our welcome and our more
component so let's go to the Welcome
file and we will also enable the strict
mode for better error reporting it will
need react
and we need our destructuring and inside
we need the style sheet we need the view
we need to text and we need a component
okay so our welcome class will be very
simple it's just a very very simple view
and it will return as I said view with a
style which we will be in which we will
define soon and we need to close the
view and we will have a text inside here
which will have a style as well
this will be welcome to your react
natives
dark component okay very straightforward
in nothing special so make sure to add
the styles or create create them
and here we will just have very basic
stuff for our description
let's give it a font size of 20 and
let's line it in the center of our view
and the color will be whatever white
okay so the second one was the container
and this one will use the complete size
and it will justify the content also in
the center of it and the items inside as
well and we'll finally have a background
color of whatever random color okay so
the last thing which is very important
here is now to write module exports
because this line will export our book
on class so we can include and require
it inside our index so that's maybe the
most important line of this complete
view so I will just copy this and inside
our second view where we will and just
have this is the second vu or tab
whatever and we will export the more
class and to show the difference I will
make it
okay that's one two maybe this way okay
so maybe it's already working right now
yeah perfect so let's take a look what's
happening we have our base day which
should be the welcome state and that's
with the featured item on the left so
welcome to your react native start
component is inside our home tab and if
you select the next you come to the
second tab and you can switch around and
see that's perfectly so as we have
exported our classes we can just import
them here and use them inside our views
so that makes the react view very very
simple to use we have a bit of styling
and everything's in its own class so
here we have our react temper template
and here we have the views for the tabs
so I really do like this kind of
structure of our reactor so I hope you
liked this tutorial and if you want to
see more please leave me a comment or
tweet me and let's yeah have fun with
react goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
