acting today I'm gonna make a short
video on how and why you should use ng
resource over the standard HTTP provider
of angular and for this I already
created a very simple side with angular
and I use the yeoman plug-in or whatever
scaffolding tool to set up this app you
can check out my blog to see how how to
yeah how to use the yeoman or create
your own yeoman plug-in and however
that's not the focus of this tutorial so
okay why should you use angular resource
first of all you need to install angular
resource with boa or
NPM whatever you like so run boa install
angular resource or save it to your boa
file and if it's inside and installed
you need to make sure you have the file
included which I have here in my index
and if you have this done you need to
add it to your module so then you've got
everything set up to use angular
resource so let's see why you should use
it first of all I will use a dummy
Jason place all the rest api to show all
these things and you can find the link
on my blog or go to jason place holder
type a code calm and see that there is a
very simple API to get some dummy data
and i will use this
users which is just dot slash users and
you will get a response like this with
some dummy users and I want to show this
users in my view and I have created a
little table which will display the name
email and button and we'll come to that
later
so if you want to do this on the normal
standard old way you would go ahead like
this include the HTTP and you would call
whatever you all kit like can't just -
yeah just use here's our data why HTTP
GET and then you can copy that link and
well just make that request and now you
need to make use this data then and
chain everything and finally set the
users array which we want to use to the
data you get from there okay so in my
case I can now run run sir
and I should see yeah
some users some data well it's okay for
one week with but now let's say we want
to click info for a specific user then
we need to request where is it
users slash one okay so and for that you
would need another call with more of
this promise stuff and set everything
and if you would do that for a restful
api you would very fast come to infinite
calls and chaining and that's just not
clean code and it just sucks so let's
see how we can finish this task with ng
resource and for this I created a tiny
service and we will build a user service
and we need to include resource ok so
now we can very simple return a resource
object which has the link or side and we
can also additionally already enter this
and now we can say if we give user we
can set it to
and now we make this user okay so that's
everything we need inside our factory
let's see how we can call this while we
previously had this we can now replace
it with just scope users equals user
service so we need to include it
obviously use a service berry and we
don't give any parameters to that okay I
have Auto refresh on so as you can see
again the data okay so one line is
already much shorter than this okay if
you add this it's not very shorter but
however as we one note to this um I use
the query because the response we get
from the JSON placeholder is an array
and if you use query on the resource
object you also set the parameter is
arrayed to true if you get other later
you can just call get at this point but
for now we leave this so we wanted to
have this button and see some info to
this user so in my HTML I made this
little button which will call without
pop-up and we set data for the user with
the ID of that role so if you would use
this you would need to copy everything
and so on so let's see how we can set
our data with our factory we created so
we'll say scope one user equals use the
service get and we will give in user
with user ID now the resource will
replace this with the ID we give to it
and let's see if it's working so okay
the info is very empty right now not
sure I'm doing anything with that okay
probably I'm just not okay what it's
using oh it's using current user sorry
my bad
so say scope current user and it should
refresh and now we see every data to the
current user or Patricio lip sac and we
have the data to Tricia elliptic okay
so now you see it's already very
powerful because we can use the same
service same URL and just replace some
parameters now let's say we want to make
a post request in that case you could
just call user service dot save and
let's say
give me the name and email and now that
would call a very simple post to this
URL currently it's assigned to my ed
user button and you can see that
everything is working if we clean that
ed user and you see the post receive 200
it's okay and we get a simple response
from the JSON placeholder with an
automatic generated ID so again we still
have just this service and just some
other function we call on the resource
object okay now the last one is you can
also specify your own functions inside
the service so if you would like to have
a special function inside you can make
it this way let's say you want an update
function which should make put request
because that one is not standard inside
ok so I guess not ok one more thing you
need to do you need now to say variable
like this and finally return the object
okay somehow he's complaining about
whatever
you expected anything yeah whatever
for now it should work I guess
or do we miss anything no I guess that's
no problem so how can we call that well
replace this one with user service dot
update and we say update user with the
ID one and replace it again with our
data from here so now you can again
refresh ok unexpected token in line 12
ok obviously and reload ok so now
everything's fine again we can inspect
it and make our put request and with the
again put 200 ok so we just change the
user 1 with the data to my name and my
email and everything was just peace and
these few lines so I hope you see why
you should use ng resource with a
restful api and well we can make one or
two special cases so let's say you want
the data which we currently have in a
wizard that was the options request ok
as you can see currently our data is
inside the request payload so inside the
body of the request if you want to have
it at URL parameters you can just do it
like this
and give an empty object a second one so
refresh and try to add another user and
now you can see we're making a put
request to user 1 and now we have our
parameters here okay and finally if you
really really really need to use the
promise object you can use it still in
an old-fashioned way if you say query
gly use the service query and now you
can take that away and say query dot
promise and here's the promise object
you would normally have from the HTTP
request so in that case if you need to
rely on that you can still do it in that
way and say function data whatever Scout
that users like thater
and let's see what's happening yeah we
still have our things so I hope you see
why you should use ng resource I hope
that's very clear and I hope this is
helpful for you and you can use it in
your next project if you're working with
a restful api and I would be very happy
if you leave me a comment or follow me
on Twitter or my youtube channel and
yeah come back to see more videos like
this have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
