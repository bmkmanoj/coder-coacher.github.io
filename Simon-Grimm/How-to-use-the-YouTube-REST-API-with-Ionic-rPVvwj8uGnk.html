deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy in
this video I will show you how you can
easily use the Google API for YouTube to
get data from YouTube without using
OAuth but only using an API key so I've
started a blank new ionic app and the
first thing you need to do is create a
new app in the Google developer console
so I've already created one and once you
get your app you go to library and then
you go ahead and search for YouTube
there are a few API but the one we want
to use is the YouTube data API so go
into this one and in the beginning this
will say enable so click enable for me
it's already enabled and also if you
enable it the API the first time this
might take five or ten minutes until
it's working inside your app so if you
implement the app and it's not working
immediately just wait a few moments and
then hopefully everything will work what
we then need is a API key so go to
credentials click create credentials API
key and then you will get a new API key
which we can use this would be right
here I will delete this for now as I
already got one so now we can focus on
our F and we will need this API key in a
second so first of all let's create some
stuff so we need a new page which we
call playlist and also we need a new
provider which we call YouTube so sorry
with the current ionic CLI we don't get
a module file for our playlist so if you
want to use lazy loading
need to add a module file by hand there
are examples out there so it's always
the same but just so you know perhaps
you already got a module file now the
API changes from time to time they're
not always making these changes visible
upfront so yeah deal with it and I think
you will handle it right what we also
need is a Cordova plugin so install the
Cordova plug-in YouTube video player
because this will help us to launch
YouTube videos inside the native video
player of a device we will use in this
example perhaps only the browser preview
but if you run it on a real device this
will open the native YouTube app and
play the video inside that environment
so make sure if you add the Cordova
plug-in to also install the NPM package
from ionic native and then we're almost
ready to start coding but there's one
more thing so right inside your
config.xml you need to add this
preference for Android so YouTube data
API key and then the value of your key
the one we had right here oh that's not
the one yes that's it so I'm using it in
the browser for now so I will need it
but if you run it on Android make sure
you got this one okay so let's see our
YouTube provider is here we also need
the HTTP module because we will make
HTTP requests so at angular HTTP and
finally import it to our import we got
the YouTube provider but we also need
the UQ
video player which comes from an ionic
native YouTube video player there it is
yes like this and add this one to your
provider as well and now we are finally
ready to get started so let's dive into
our provider and remove a bit of this
perhaps that and then we want to
implement two functions first get
playlists for channel so we want to
search for playlists of the channel we
will pass in a channel ID and hopefully
get back the playlist of that channel
and afterwards we will dive into a
channel and then we want to or we dive
into a playlist and when we want to get
the list videos of that list ID okay
those are our two functions and we
should define our API key upfront
because we want to use it in our request
so again let's copy it and paste it so
this one will return observable and we
will use HTTP GET request to a URL so
let me copy this part in okay like this
so Google APs API it calm YouTube
version 3 playlist and then we got our
API key and then you could add some more
stuff the first thing we need is of
course our channel ID which is channel
we passed sorry more space and then you
can also oh come on oh okay
you could add some more parameters we're
using the playlist so we can go into the
documentation
and see we got some of this we got list
I think we want list so then you can see
playlists this is the get request and
then here are some parameters we could
specify we also already use the channel
ID and then there are a few more we
could use like Max result or stuff like
this and we use part equal snippet so
this will give us a short on this will
give us some information about the
playlist and we can also say Max results
20 of course this is completely up to
you what you want to specify at this
point but I think this should work for
now finally we need to map the result to
Jason but we also want to do something
else
so we map it to Jason and then we're
directly accessing the items array
because this is the interesting part of
the response sent counts for this one
but in this case we're not using
playlists but playlist items key still
the same but now we use playlist ID with
a playlist which ID a list ID okay the
list ID and we also want part snippet ID
and Max result Wendy and that's all for
our provider at this point now let's go
to our home and home HTML so first of
all make sure to import your YouTube
provider come on I am really bad at
typing currently I don't know why
oh sweet Jesus okay playlists will be an
observable of the type let's save a new
array and of course import observable
from rxjs observable okay now he's happy
also we need a variable which will be
our mg model for the search field and I
will already give it an ID because I
don't want to type this ID and we can
easily make a search to this channel ID
which is of course the channel ID of my
own channel the video you're currently
watching so perhaps we also need an
alert control you never know and import
it from ionic angular and there you go
now if we hit search for a playlist it's
actually quite easy so we only set our
own playlist to this YouTube provider
get playlist for channel and this will
be the channel ID we have we can also
subscribe to this just for demo case so
let's see and we can show the data of
the response because there are quite a
few field what many fields actually and
inside the arrow block we might shown
alert so this a lot create no create and
then whatever title error message no
playlist found
a channel ID might happen and buttons in
that case only okay no other options and
I would forget the thing I always forget
to present it alright that's the first
search playlist and once we got the
playlist we also want to dive into a
playlist so we implement open playlist
with ID and this will use our nap
controller and push a new page normally
I would now use like playlist page but
if we're not using lazy loading in this
example I will go ahead with playlist
page so it will be imported up here and
we pass the idea through to this page I
just think oh yeah in that case we need
to add the playlist page right here and
here as well to our module if we are not
using lazy loading so now this should
work let's see okay and of course we
haven't implemented the view so let's go
to the view
and we call this playlist search color
will be danger because this matches the
YouTube red so remove this and first of
all we need our input field to make it
an eye on item if you want with a label
label perhaps DECT call it channel ID oh
sorry I already got that one nice then
we got the actual eye on input type
should be text in this case and PNG
model is our channel ID
alright and below and I think I had a
short cut for the iron button
I don't know where it is so I am button
and the click event will trigger search
playlists I hope we call it like this
search playlist yes we can also say it's
disabled when we haven't added anything
so if channel ID equal to an empty
string so color of course also danger
red it's a really dangerous path here so
search playlist and then we can search
for playlist and now we only need a way
to display the data of our playlist so
we use ion list no painting should look
good for the items we create so this
will be only buttons and we will go over
the list of playlists and of course it's
unobservable so we use the a zinc pipe
here on click we call open playlist and
we will pass in the list ID of our
current object and inside this button we
can now go a bit crazy and use some
stuff of the response so we actually got
a little thumbnails for each playlist
which is quite cool so why not use it
image and this will be in snippet
thumbnails and we will dive into the
response in a second but I already know
it's at that place finally what we of
course need is list at snippet tile oh
so you see this is why we included
snippet in the query and finally place
the snippet published
and we use the date type sometimes I
really love angular and how easy it is
all right let's see okay perfect we got
an arrow what was it some quote yes I
was already celebrating my great
implementation so here is our channel ID
I specified you could of course use
something else
so let's hit Search playlist and then
you can see we got the playlist of my
own channel and we got this data object
so we got eight playlists and each
playlist has an ID and also this snippet
and inside the snippet we got like the
channel title published at the title
again or the real title of the playlist
is the channel title and then the
thumbnails where we used I think the
standard one so all of the data is right
in the response you just have to dig in
and perhaps include even more if you
want something else why is there so much
pitting I don't know I thought we had
left heading well anyway I think for now
this one should look good and now we
want to show the videos of that playlist
so the part now is really simple as we
are already pushing the next page with a
right ID so inside the constructor we
can now say that list ID
this does not forums yet and I think we
passed ID and same like before we got an
observable array now it works nice
and that's it okay and we can say this
videos equals the provider we have to
import private GQ provider there it is
get list videos for our ad and this will
hopefully return all the needed all the
videos of that list also we want to
implement open video for a specific
video and here we could now make a
little switch so I will implement this
with platform and also the what was its
name YouTube video player yes like this
but we will call it you cube okay so now
we can check if this dot platform is
Cordova so in case we are running on a
device we want to open it in the native
YouTube app so we use YouTube open video
there's only one function to play one
video it just needs the video ID and
this should be in video snippet resource
IV video ID perhaps we add a little lock
here as well for debugging
video data so we can take a look at this
one as well but this should open
hopefully the video player and otherwise
we can call window open
I think the URL should be something like
this so YouTube watch with a video and
then let's hope it's the same like this
and finish it okay
the last missing part of course the view
of course we need the dangerous color
again we're still living dangerous so
there is a playlist and now inside the
ion content we got only the ion list of
items
perhaps I can copy a bit of this so
button ion item that video of videos and
unclick open video with the video item
and we got the thumbnail which should be
added video snippet some nails right and
same for this but let's use the
description here alright we search for
my playlist we go to the ionic quick
wins and there is our list of video data
again each object has an idea snippet
here's the description is it shown
actually or is it a title like this yes
now we also got the description right
below so upgrade to I only three lazy
loading subtitle and the description
whatever it is channel ID thumbnails and
in resource ID we can find our video ID
which is and what we used here resource
video
I D so hopefully if I click this now yes
stare at the video and this should work
for all videos yes alright so I think
this the end of our video here you have
seen how to implement a Google service
without using or out so only using the
API key you can request YouTube data go
into and get all the data you need it
for Europe and of course this is not
only limited to the YouTube API I don't
know for how many this works but the API
key but I guess they're quite a few it's
not only YouTube that what really
surprised me so I hope you enjoyed this
video if you do make sure to subscribe
to my channel for more ionic videos and
also check out the ionic Academy comm if
you're interested in truly learning
ionic I hope to see you in the next
video have a great day and take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
