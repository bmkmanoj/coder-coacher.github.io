the tactic and the ionic academy today
we will build a simple token input with
ionic so I've already started a blank
new app and the first thing we need to
do is install NPM package called angular
2 tech input and we want to save it so
at this this package will help us to
build a simple input field which will
automatically make tokens from our input
values so you might notice from Facebook
like the hashtags and it's more or less
the same so to get started after
installing it we need to edit to our
import inside the F modules so our L tag
input module and of course make sure to
import it from angular to take input ok
now we're already good to go so we go to
our home TS we got two options now so we
could use it with auto suggestions or
without so we will take a look at both I
will craft also a little UI around it so
it makes a bit more sense here so we
will build an input for a name and the
topics so you can add some talk to your
app in our case we will just add them in
a array here but of course you could
save this wherever you like to so once
we add a talk we call this talk push and
we create a new object with the current
name and also with an array of topics
which
is the start topics so we really see
this package in action we will go to
Auto suggestions later so for now let's
go to our home HTML and call it my talks
and we can remove most of this here and
the first item is just for our name
input so that is nothing special for now
we just use ng model and this is the
name perhaps a placeholder my awesome
talk and that's it for the first input
now the second input is actually more
interesting one so here we use the
package we installed this RAL tech input
now we got a few options to it here so
first of all the ng model for this is
our topics array
perhaps we can close this and open it
side by side so you see our variables as
well okay so we got the topics array
which will be filled from our input
field and when we got an opportunity at
on blur and we want to have this to
false because otherwise the field will
try to add the tokens once the field
loses focus but I don't think we we
don't need this here perhaps also a
placeholder like topics and that's
already everything here and we close it
now we need a button to actually add our
input and this button will call our
function at talk
let's talk here to see that we actually
have added something and how it looks we
build a simple ion list with items we
iterate over our talks and we print out
the talk name and we also print out our
topics but we will do it a bit different
because our topics array is an array so
we join all the elements of the array
just divided by a simple space okay I'll
list and we're good to go so let's see
how it looks like
nothing really fancy here so Simon's
ionic talk perhaps and we now go to
topics and let's say we had hash tag
ionic and press Enter we see that our
string just got tokenized
currently I think it tries to separate
once you're making a comma so yes if I
write a comma will automatically try to
craft the totem from it I can remove
those tones again and again I can edge
just like this now if I add a talk we
see that we got the name and the array
with the three values right here but
that is of course not everything so what
we can do as well now is to add
autocomplete and therefore we could add
autocomplete equals true and now we need
some auto complete items so a list of
perhaps prepared text from which the
user can then select now let's go back
to our TS file and
at pre paired or what it takes and now
you could build an array of hashtags
whatever you like angular whatever of
course we're not limited to hashtags
here I'm just doing this because it's
best known with hashtags but you could
use everything okay enough for now so
now we go back once it's loaded and our
field will now use the autocomplete
function and look up inside the prepared
text array so again we name it my talk
and now if I start with I I get this
drop down of all the words with I if I
go ahead i/o I can select ionic riots
top with jab I got all the JavaScript or
a with angular JavaScript so now I can
use all of this right here and if I type
again I'm I won't see the ionic again so
I can sm and it appears right here you
could now also change the UI of these
elements a bit but it's a bit more
tricky inside the CSS but you can check
out the according quick win on the ionic
Academy to see how you could also change
the UI here a bit okay I hope you
enjoyed this short quick win we saw how
to easily use the angular tech input
package to build this cool ionic input
field with tokenized function so if you
want to get more videos make sure to
subscribe to this channel and also check
out the ionic academy calm for more
ionic training videos content and a
great active community I hope to see you
next time
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
