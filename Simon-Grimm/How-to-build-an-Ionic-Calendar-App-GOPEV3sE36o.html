the specter in the ionic academy today
we will build a simple calendar with
ionic so we will integrate a package and
we will be able to display a calendar
view you might know from iOS or Android
inside our app and we will also be able
to add events to our calendar so I've
already started a blank new app as you
can see and we go ahead and create a new
page because we're going to need a page
where we can enter some details for our
kalenna now we need to install a few NPM
packages so first ionic - calendar then
we want to use moment a as which helps
us to display dates a bit better and
finally we need this package because the
calendar has a dependency to it and if
we don't install it we will run into an
error let's wait a second I think it
should be fast okay and we're finished
here okay now we need to go to our f dot
module dot TS and we put the env
calendar module to our imports and of
course we need to import it from should
be ionic to kelenjar alright that's all
for here let's continue with our current
home page so we add view title and we
will set this title in a second and we
also need some buttons so I on buttons
we want them to be at the end and then a
button I on button I can only because
it's in the navbar and we only want to
show the icon there
this will trigger an event which will
open our modal page we've created in the
first step so ion I can name perhaps add
and we're good
the interesting part is now integrating
our calendar and the calendar has a few
options we can or need so first of all
we need an event source and this will be
an array of events which fill up our
calendar let's close it so I don't
forget about it ok then we got the
calendar mode and we will set this to
variable dot mode we can use either the
day view week view or a month view and
in our case we will pick the month view
so we can mark the current date and this
will also be inside our variable and now
there are few options we can listen to
events so uneven selected means we have
clicked or tapped an event from a list
below the calendar and we simply call on
event selected which we of course need
to implement and we got something on
title changed and this will happen when
we swipe for example to a new month of
the calendar and then we can update our
view title up here in the on view title
changed I don't even know if we need the
event let's just keep it there and
finally we got on time selected means we
are select the day or an hour and we
want to store this as well because once
we are opening a new event we will pick
the currently selected
currently selected time as an initial
time for our calendar so finally step is
I think it's even for the debuts so we
can make chunks of 30 minutes and
finally we add the class come and I'm
not completely sure if we need this
class let's see okay
currently it will not compile I'm pretty
sure because we have referenced quite a
few variables so let's create them first
of all the event source we can make this
an empty area in the beginning then we
got the view title which is of the type
string simply and the selected they will
be just the current date
okay selected day like this now we have
the calendar perhaps we can open the
split view here so okay perfect then we
got the calendar sorry I need more
coffee I think we got the calendar and
we need to specify our mode and we said
we wanted to have the month view and
then we get the current date which is
actually it's a selected day but I'm not
completely sure if this will work see
and of course we have not yet defined
some of our callbacks so I guess it will
still crash yes so what we have was on
view title changed and we had on time
selected and we had on event selected
okay now in mine who not crash anymore
perhaps and we can also go ahead because
on you title changed we will simply set
our current view title to the new title
and you can already see that we got this
beautiful really good-looking calendar
view almost out of the box so if we
change the month you see up there
our beautiful trainers currently we
don't have any events and perhaps at
this time I can show you the week view
as well another idea would be let's say
you pick a date and then you drill down
into a week view or a day view but as
you can see we pew is interesting so you
would have to do some fine-tuning here
to get this be week view to be like it
should be but the debut actually is okay
I think I think that's fine for a day
view you can start with this but back to
our case we go to the month so what we
need we got all of this I think so let's
close this side and go back here one
time selected we simply set our current
selected day to the event that selected
time so we will always update our
variable and for uneven selected yeah I
forgot to of course add even where we
need to open our Model View
therefore we need the modal control
and import it from ionic angular so once
we call on event selected we just want
to present it in a cool little alert
view just for debugging and here we use
moment and if we want to use moment we
need to fix the typescript error or we
just need to import it as a moment from
moment so now we can use everything from
moment.js
so we go back here we got the event that
start time and we make it in a quite
extensive format but so we got the most
information out of it we got the end
time and finally we create an alert view
okay I need alert as well I don't know
why my auto import is not working
anymore like I like it used to be but
anyway we create the alert view we got
the title
directly from the event so we can use
our event or title as a subtitle we
craft a string so the event will go from
our start date and then we make the line
break to beat and finally buttons well
just okay because it is just an
information for us so a lot present and
we're good here as well okay so all this
was quite funny but actually we can't
see any went by now
so let's change this except we use our
model which we have created so we create
it we use lazy loading so event model
page just as a string and we also pass
the selected day which is this dot
select a day now we can
sorry presenter just and do the action
from our model page to add the the data
if we would have some data service but
in this example we just have our event
source here so that's why we call an on
the dismiss and this will be called once
we leave the modal view and at this
point if we get some data back we know
we should add a new event so we use the
data and entrance form a bit of that
data start time because sometimes it was
wrong for me it just came as a string so
we make sure that the start time is the
date the calendar can understand and end
time now also a little trick as our
events or if you would just push the new
event it would not automatically be
displayed only when we reload the page
so we use a little trick here we assign
the current events or two events we push
our new event and then we set the event
source to an empty array and then we set
a time out okay don't hate me it works
and then we can use it and the view will
be updated okay so now to the last
missing piece of our calendar which is
the event model page back here whatever
event details if you like to you can
also edit dismiss button I will just
skip this for now we don't want this
video too long so inside the event
details we will craft some eye on items
with eye on input just to fill the basic
needs for an event and we will also just
use ng model no reactive form here this
is just okay for now so the first one is
the event title and then we need a few
more of these so what yeah we can also
yeah perhaps use an iron label here
because it's not so easy to see the
start and end time and this is now an
eye on date/time because we need a date
picker and the display format should be
like month month day year hour and
minutes and same counts for the pick up
format it's perhaps not the best way if
you have a better one just let me know
and make sure that we set it as the
start time
so for the second one for the end of
course the end time but the picker is
more or less the same if you want you
could also specify something like the
mean date so then we won't be able to
insert past events but this is of course
up to you one more eye on label because
we need a check if this is an all-day
event this is then of course only a
checkbox so edit here and this is start
in event dot all day finally below the
lists we need a button to submit all of
the fun we have created full perhaps an
icon to the left side and unclick we
save it I think checkmark should work
here and the text add event okay we're
pretty close to being finished so let's
wrap it up you can see here title is not
defined whatever we need to create our
variable for the ng model and we set the
start time in case we don't get any time
to a new date and we need to know we
need to transform it to in my cells
string so the date picker can use it
same for the end time just to set some
general setting and perhaps all day
should in the beginning also default as
I said we also can specify a min date
if you want to do this just go ahead and
do the same again let's go to our
constructor because here we can grab a
reference to a pre-selected date and
first of all this is in this dot nav
piron's
that gets selected day select day or
date day okay selected day but we need
to transform this a bit so again we make
use of moment a as we call a moment doc
format and this will be enough to
formatted to some something useful and
now if we got the pre-selected date we
can also set our start time to the
pre-selected date and same comes for the
end time perhaps we don't need to set it
but anyways finally our save function is
where we pass the information which we
stored in our event back to our parent
view which at home and we need the view
controller which is also from ionic
angular so now we can use this tub view
controller dismiss and just put our
event into as a property of the function
and then it will end up right here so if
we make everything correct by now it
should work so let's say we want to add
a date for this 20th of June yes we can
see it is selected and perhaps there's
an ionic workshop let's leave it like
this and maybe it goes a few
days so until then for days and perhaps
it's also an all-day event and now we
can see all the days of the all day
event are marked and if we click on the
event we see the alert coming up from
Tuesday to Saturday of course we can
also make it just a few hours so Academy
course preparation and then we see here
we got the all-day event and here we got
this single event which is from whatever
12:00 to 4:00 okay
so this is our calendar view I don't
know if we now change it to week how it
will look like but not so super cool I
guess but basically if we add the ionic
to calendar NPM package we craft our
view of the calendar around some sources
variables and functions and then we are
able to display the data change all the
times catch all the events we need and
also add new events so if you want to
add new event make sure that the event
you push through your event source is
correctly formatted so that you got
start time end time all-day title with
exactly those names this view is I don't
know really interesting and as I've
refreshed my data has gone right now
so let's go back to the month view so
the end picture looks good here okay I
hope you enjoyed this video make sure to
subscribe to my channel for more videos
of ionic and also heat over to the ionic
academy calm
complete ionic learning all-in-one
platform that will help you to make
progress a lot further I hope to see you
next time
so enjoy your day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
