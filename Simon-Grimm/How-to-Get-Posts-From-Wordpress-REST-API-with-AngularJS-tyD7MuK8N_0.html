from their tactic today I will show you
how to get posts from the WordPress REST
API and therefore we will create a new
angularjs EPS so I will use yeoman if
you know this tool to create my app it's
really cool to have 4 app running in
well minutes so if you have not
installed it checked out my blog and you
will find it so go ahead if you have
installed it and run your angular the
name of your project so there will be a
few questions I don't want to use god no
no yes
bootstrap please just leave everything
to default and create this stuff alright
so meanwhile we can check out what we
also need so you need obviously a
wordpress blog and also you need to
install the WordPress REST API plugin
because currently the engine is not in
the core of WordPress but this is no
problem just install it on your blog and
I have a block running which is my blog
on localhost but well you can have it
running wherever you like to so just
make sure to have this plug-in installed
all right let's get egg and let's wait
until it's finished alright so once it's
done you can run grunts earth and yeoman
will have our app up and running
allô allô alright so this is our
starting point and we also want to have
ok so we are already in that directory
and we want to install
another boa component called angular
loading bar so this will display pretty
loading bar at the top of our page
because those requests can take some
time if you grab a lot of tweets you
will see why and it's really good to
have some indication what is going on
inside your app at that point alright we
go to our code and we need to go to our
script and fjs to load our angular
loading bar it should automatically be
inside our index because grunt will have
a task for adding it if you're not using
yeoman you will have to do it on your
own all right let's start with a little
factory and again I use yeoman and
called yo angular Factory and call it a
loopy actory so this will create a new
factory and let's see it should be
inside our services and there it is if
you're not using yeoman again you have
to do it on your own but for now remove
well let's remove almost anything here
and all right
we don't okay we need this so first of
all this factory will make HTTP requests
and also do as an Chronos task so
include those two dependencies what we
need as well is a base URL and for me
this is localhost eight eight eight
eight and this is your WordPress
instance wherever by you have running
this insert your credentials and this is
followed by
WUP Jason again WordPress and v2 because
this is already the second version of
the REST API also make sure if you are
looking for help for this REST API make
sure to look forward to if you're using
this article alright so we want to get
our posts and we also want to limit how
many posts we get so let's create a
function get posts with a number and
also at the end this let's wait for it
to recover and we can go to our get
posts function meanwhile so we want to
return an HTTP requests and we will make
a get request to our base URL plus posts
and add a query parameter per page which
is the number we pass so in Dan block we
will call either handle success or
handle error because well one of those
two cases will be there so obviously we
need two functions down here and all
success with the response and also a
little arrow with the respond so in the
success case we can just return response
data and in the error case we should
check if our response data is no angular
object
sorry or if there is no response data
message so in this case something gone
wrong and we need to reject our promise
but if everything's fine here as well
you can still oh no obviously we are
already in the error blocks so we should
never fulfill our promise here so we
just reject it with response data
message so our checks are just to to see
if this message is present inside the
object I'm still not sure what's wrong
here I think my syntax is completely
fine now I don't need this whatever okay
so let's get back to our function so we
have to get posts and this will give us
a number of posts and return a promise
the second function we need we can
actually copy this because they're quite
similar you know we want to copy this
this is get media data for ID and we
need this function because inside the
jason we get from get posts there will
be just a media ID for the image or the
featured image of a post and we need to
make a call through the server again to
our WordPress REST API and say this is
our media ID please give us the link to
the media and this is why come on we
make a request to media plus ID and
additionally at this point
I will insert ignore loading bar true so
this is for all loading bar because we
will get post which will take quite a
time and we will display this loading
bar in that case but we don't want to
also show the loading bar if we get our
media you can obviously leave this out
if you are not using any this loading
bar anyway but for now make sure to put
our function in the return of our
factory and we're done with our factory
so you could include all kinds of
functions to make other requests but for
us those two you are just fine so I'm
using yeoman and I will go to the main J
s if you're not using yeoman you might
have to create a controller at this
point but our controllers are already
assigned to view which is the main view
we have seen and this why I just use
this controller so either way go to your
controller and add two dependencies
scope and our factory first of all we
have two empty
objects the one is an array and the
other one just an object holding a key
value pair later on so what we are gonna
do is we will call our WordPress victory
and say get house let's say we want to
have five and then we hopefully get a
successful respawns and we can just
assign this response to our scope dot
posts I already said that there's only a
media ID inside this response so this is
why we need
to also go over each of those objects
inside Jason and with each of them we
will call another function which will
set the URL for image and this function
needs the index of this object and also
the media ID which is value our response
dot featured image alright so we also
want to handle the error case and in
that case we just lock our error out
hopefully this won't happen all right so
we need our scope function so create set
URL for image and this function will
take the index and the ID of a media
object and inside again we can just use
our we WordPress Factory and call get
media data for ID which is our ID and in
the completion block call scope images
which is our images object and at the
position I hope you remember of the
index we will set the response dot
source URL so you can take a look at the
response of the JSON rest api and this
is exactly where you find the URL okay
bye now we have the data but we have no
view to display it so currently our app
still look like this and I also opened
the tab where I grabbed the data from my
tweet so this is data you can make it
look a bit cooler
so let's see how we can make it cooler
right now and we open our main HTML
remove everything so this should update
this page all right this is not
available things okay we call grunts off
and hopefully yep our page is empty and
you already see the loading bar at the
top grabbing our tweet data what do we
don't display it so let's go back to our
HTML and craft a little view so I used
some bootstrap classes and I recommend
you include bootstrap as well this is
the easiest way to get a cool looking
interface and we will use a media list
because we will have some text and media
which is our images all right the
important part here is that we iterate
over our posts array so ng-repeat come
on post in post and for every post we
can now create a little media card so to
the left we will have our image and
first of all we want to wrap it in a
link so everyone who clicks on that
image will get taken to this and
therefore we use post touch link a
straightforward REST API additionally we
will now display the image and use ng
source and now the magic comes we are
happy to use our images object at the
position of the current index of this
object additionally I add media object
class
and also a bit of styling so now it's
not that big sorry
all right this is our Ling and this is
also ready now we want to make media
body which will hold the title and our
excerpt alright so inside the body again
we want to make this clickable so I just
copy this yeah whatever
add a target if you like to you and now
we craft our header which is media
heating and this will just be post dot
title dot rendered so this is the title
you also see on your posts you can
inspect the title object if you want or
just trust me this is correct
now finally there's one thing if we want
to display the excerpt that might be
HTML text included and that's why we use
ng bind HTML so we don't end up with
HTML tags so use excerpt dot rendered
and just close div so otherwise we would
have your some HTML tags and we don't
want it now let's take a look what's
happening or it's already loading and
there we go so these are the posts from
my block you might know them and here
are the images scaled a little bit
smaller we have the heating and we have
the excerpt now if you click on this
you're obviously taken to the correct
location on my localhost instance and if
you go back they're still there but if
you reload you see
they take quite a long time and these
are only five posts so okay it's okay
for now but if you have like twenty
fifty a few hundred posts on your blog
you might have a real problem so if your
plan to use this inside real application
make sure to have some logic for
handling this long loading I hope you
