tactic and the ionic academy today we
will build a simple ionic wordpress
client using the wordpress api in a very
cool wrapper library for angular to use
the wordpress api so this was created by
julien thanks again
great job first of all make sure you
have typing installed globally for this
package and then you can follow to
install the WordPress API angular
package there's not much we have to
install additionally so as you can see I
started a blank new ionic app which is
running right here nothing really
special so far what we need as well as
of course wordpress blog somewhere so
this is the rest api of my blog with all
the endpoints and stuff so this is just
a test to see if it's working anyway we
can continue now ok with the
dependencies installed and we go ahead
and create some additional stuff can you
see this ok ionic chief provider we P
provide now of course it's not ionic
with a gene so we create one provider
and we will also generate an additional
page which will be the post page so our
provider will help us to deliver the
data to our classes and the page will be
used to display a single wordpress post
we can continue with a setup for the
wordpress api package and therefore we
go to our app module and at the top we
need to import HTTP and we need to
import some stuff here as well and what
we also need is of course the URL to our
WordPress blog in my case I will take
this the namespace is not needed right
now so we can remove this right in the
beginning I added type script error I'm
not sure what of you know it's working
now
perhaps we're lucky ant it's working
okay so that is very good because I have
the same problem when I first use it so
I copied this out but it was actually
not working I had to remove the type
here so now it was working also you see
we'll add to some stuff to our imports
which is here and since we are using
already I only three with angular for we
need to import the HTTP module as well
which is also imported from add angular
HTTP okay
so make sure to configure your WordPress
API module inside your imports here this
will use this custom loader Factory
which is responsible for passing in
correct base URL to our WordPress blog
additionally we have created a provider
called WordPress provider so put it into
your provided array and at the
additional statement - automatically
imported already also we are not adding
our post page to the declaration or
entry components because we use lazy
loading with ionic 3 so we can skip this
for now okay let's start with our
provider or actually see the still a
problem perhaps we need to restart it or
will we pee WordPress
module loader generally well I think
everything should work but okay yeah
what's my own fault because I missed
that one but we can continue with our
webcast provider first of all I'm
changing this a bit because let's see so
then I miss it against someone oh yeah
two spots where missed it let's wait a
second I think everything is right now
sometimes this can take well I don't
know why okay
so the app is running and we are happy
to have configured everything right okay
back to our provider we import the
injectable for the decorator we import
the map because we want to map our HTTP
calls later we need the observable and
we need some stuff from the API package
now what I did as well is I created two
custom classes called post and user the
user is a user object and post of course
post object we will see them in action
soon for now just notice that I only
need to add all this stuff to the
constructor and make it public and we
don't have to set all this as additional
properties for this class so this is a
shorter way of doing things now inside
our constructor we want to load an array
of users because we will later display
an image for a user and we only want to
load this one therefore you can change
our instructor to use the dependencies
we need in our file which I cried a few
and we start with this dot
WP API uses that get list which will
return us not solvable which is a list
of users and we first of all map the
data to JSON data and then we continue
and subscribe to our observable and once
we get the data we set our current uses
array to an empty array and then we
iterate over the user inside the data
array and for every user we create a new
user and we use some properties of the
data you can inspect the data if you
want my case I already know what's the
name of them so it's ID name and then
for the image URL we need user our thar
URLs and then the one for the biggest
avatar right I think okay
and of course we need to push to our
users array the new user so there's the
first step we can log it out we want to
so when I use this actually I'm not
going to have lock my own users because
well now have users on my block which
might not want to be shown here so let's
hope that this works and it's not
throwing an error I will copy in two
functions because they are more or less
not really interesting so these two
functions will help us to get an image
for a user ID or get a username for a
user ID in both cases we just iterate
over our own array and check if the ID
we
get to the function which is the one of
the object and return either the URL or
the name so those two are not really
interesting at all let's start with a
maybe most interesting one which is of
course get posts and this will return an
observable and this will be an array of
posts so we can use it in a nice way
later on and in this case we will return
something to our view we use now the
wordpress api of course with a small one
get list good idea I think so and again
a bit lazy let's copy this we need to
change it to Jason and then we also
transform the data to something else
inside this map look so what we did
before for the users are we going to do
as well for on the data right here so
let's see what we get here we iterate
over the data we get from the API and
for each data block we create a new post
object and passing in some of these
properties you see the only interesting
thing right here is actually this one
and let me write the function and I will
explain it in a second because I thought
long how how to actually solve this in a
good way and I think this way is quite
good so every post of course has a
header image in my case and we don't
want to always reload and reload and
reload those images so at this point
where we're receiving the list of API
pose we're setting the meteor URL for
one post to this function
which is an observable of strings so
this will at some point return the
string to the image URL and we safe this
observable right to media realm this is
also why I added this additional
property right here maybe I could also
have added it to the constructor as an
optional but I want to separate it so
you can see it am I doing this you will
see how easily we can actually use this
later on the get media function which
pull in the end return our string is not
really interesting so this time we use
API media and get the media URL for an
ID so each image has an ID and then we
return the source URL of that image okay
so this is our provider of course you
might need different things but for now
this is pretty pretty strong and working
actually very good now we come to our
home ts inside our imports we import our
own provider and also a loading
controller because we want to show some
some loading events while grabbing our
data and let's well I can add this
because the loading indicator is not
really what's interesting in this video
at all so we call this dot present
loading and then we call our WordPress
provider yeah need to import it of
course I don't know my auto correction
isn't that good today I'm not not sure
what's wrong because in generally it
works good whatever we call get posts
perhaps we call get posts and we can
also already create our array right here
which will be used inside our view and
remember we use an observable of the
type post array so now we can fill this
array with the result of this call let's
see okay actually this moment we won't
see anything but we add another do block
and inside this block let's see we will
just log off I think we could also at
this point block our array so let's try
this and what we also need to do is well
at this part is to hide our loader so we
will have a loader of the type loading
in the present loading we will set it
and here we will just dismiss it I think
my auto completion is somehow broke a
bit today and my also my automatic
import is as well not that good
okay we're loading and we're actually
loading very long
perhaps I should reload once again okay
so something is wrong here because where
is it not completely sure because
they're brown where is it
WPI post-it lists
let me check this for a thing of course
we missed one thing in our get post
function and this is first of all this
dot no actually it's not this but it's
this one and in the end we have to of
course return posts because otherwise
the function would be returning white
and not an observable of the type post
and if we hit reload no and wait a
second I'm not completely sure what went
wrong here but yesterday was working in
today nut so I changed this now so we
assign our observable just to our posts
and subscribe to the data and once we
got the data we dismiss our loading and
we can now see that we get a list of ten
posts and each post has exactly the
information we specified inside our
class for the post so until here we are
now fine we need two more functions here
because we want to grab a user image
based on the ID and in this case we will
simply use our own provider so call our
provider and get user image for our ID
and the second one is almost the same
but in this case we want to get the
either name so we call get user name on
our provider okay so far it's working
hopefully for you and now we can
actually go to our view and implement
the simple WordPress view so we call it
ionic plus WordPress
apps set the color to primary and now we
create very simple eye on card
ng for loop so we go over all the posts
and if this isn't observable right here
so it's another standard array we have
to use the async pipe here now we attach
the click event to our card which will
open the post so this is our task after
this view and we also have the typical
directive here so our card responds with
it better to actions
perhaps we can already add this so we
are done with this view so we got the
post object and now we use again ionic
lazy loading so we used enough
controller push event function but we
don't pass the page but only the string
which is the name of our post page we
have created in the beginning and as
enough param we pass the post and that's
everything now back to the view we have
our ion card and at the top we first of
all want to have the image of the post
which is inside media URL and remember
where is it
this is as well and observable which
will be loaded in the background so we
also use B as in pipe here next we got
the information about the author so we
put it in an eye on item and use the
avatar
item left so look good and in sigh we
again get an image and this time we use
accuser image for post dot author ID
that's all of our matrix here for the
Alta of course we also need the username
and guess what we use get username of
post the author ID and close okay now to
the content of the card in the content
of the card we want to display the
excerpt so this little snippet at the
beginning of every wordpress post and
first of all we need an eye on card
title because of course each post has a
title but below this title we now got
the content and we are using different
ways so we use in our HTML for a div
element just because if we which I use
this perhaps I can show you like this it
would not work like we want it to so
first of all let's see if our view is
working yeah there it is so we got our
images or user name or user avatar and
you can see that there are HTML text in
the excerpt so this is the reason why we
have to change it to be inside the inner
HTML so we already trust this HTML tags
and render them correctly which will
then look like this so no more ugly text
around them
we are already pretty far inside our
tutorial and almost at the end so we got
our list it is capable and we're coming
to the next page so we only need to
implement the last missing
pieces for our page and also okay so
whatever recent update this was fixed
it's already called right that means we
can go to our post page remove a bit of
this and already has a decorator yeah
this looks nice so what we need is one
post of course of the type post and we
can set this post directly to the Nath
params that get and we passed it as the
host object we don't need this we
actually need anything here at all and
the view is also quite simple just the
basics so at the top we use again the
title and that's our header bar and
inside the content we remove the padding
we again show the image which is imposed
media URL and we still use this pipe
because perhaps the image is not yet
ready loaded it can happen and we also
need the content and we put it again
into you inner HTML and post that
content and now we are happy with our
WordPress client I cannot read property
title perhaps because the app was
starting on the wrong page now we're
back here and we navigate to this post
and we see our title we see our image
and the complete code of the novel not
the code but the content of our pose we
could add some padding here it looks not
good yeah you see if it's starting on
the wrong page post title of not defined
so
we need to start on this page and then
we can go ahead and navigate to whatever
the image gallery pose now we also got
petting and we get the complete text for
our posts of course my plugins from
WordPress won't work here so that syntax
highlighting is not given for the code
snippet but you can see all the images
from the posts as well you can navigate
through my last and recent posts and
always get the header post and the
complete post so maybe I could maybe I
should even do an F for my blog I don't
know maybe okay so if you're just
starting out make sure to configure your
WordPress API loader factory right here
if you want you can use my provider
which is another wrapper around some
stuff and you will find all the code in
the related tutorial below this post so
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial if you
want more tutorials make sure to follow
my blog or if you want in this training
with video courses and products you can
check out the ionic academy the link is
also in the video and below and I hope
to see you next time on my channel good
