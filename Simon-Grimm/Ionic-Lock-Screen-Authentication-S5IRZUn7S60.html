from the ionic Academy in this video I
will show you how you can easily create
a lock screen for your ionic app and
therefore I've created a blank new ionic
app and we start directly by installing
this package and this package is
actually something I created but I don't
want to take the credits for this
because I basically took this ionic to
lock screen github repository and
changed a few things and prepped it
inside a module so you can easily
install it using NPM to your ionic app
so therefore you can check out the page
it is inside the article linked and see
what Carson has done great job
thanks again Carson ok if you install
this you can go ahead and let's run
ionic lab as well and first of all
simply import the lockscreen module and
the component from this package we also
want to use the ionic storage and
therefore I will also thanks coming up
therefore I will also add the ionic
storage module in the article I also
install the Cordova plugin for SQLite so
ionic storage will then use SQLite on a
device but for now we will test all of
this inside the browser and therefore we
don't really need the Cordova plug-in ok
so this comes from my own extort and
then we can import the ionic storage
module into our app and we also need to
add the lockscreen
module right to the imports into the
entry components we need the lockscreen
component we need to import it here
because it's not using lazy loading and
we simply display the whole page as a
compare
and later on okay that's fine for here
so let's go to our home let's get a bit
of color in here and call this ionic
lockscreen and then we just need two
buttons we will not make the full
authentication stuff in here this is
really basic example how to use this
lockscreen component inside your app ion
I can name perhaps luck and then also
open lock screen button is closed fine
let's add a second button to set up the
code for our lock screen settings and
then change code all right so let's
implement the two functions in our home
ts now open lock in lock screen and
setup code also say word more at the end
about limitations of this approach for
now let's go ahead and import a few
things we will need the private platform
to check if we are ready we need the
storage which we've installed before
storage and make sure to use the right
one yeah I onyx storage there it is then
we might also need what could we need as
well the private alert Controller alert
controller and then
and then perhaps also private toast
control of toast controller okay I think
that should be fine for now so in the
beginning when the app starts we first
of all want to check if the platform is
ready nope that's not how it works what
is wrong this start platform ready okay
no it works interesting anyway so when
the platform is ready we will check our
current storage and get the key for the
test code again I will say a bit more on
the security aspect of this approach
later for now this just means if the
user has never set a passcode and so we
don't get any code we want to call our
setup code function which will display a
screen to setup the code and let me
bring in some code because this is just
some typing present okay so what we do
inside the setup function is we create
an alert view just titled message and
one input and this is really a very
basic input just so we can set a code
for our app this input will then be
handled inside the button click for set
code and if the data is not for digit
long or actually four characters which
is still kind of wrong we return false
and otherwise we set this passcode to
our local storage and then we can use it
later when we bring up the actual lock
screen so this is our setup code again
very easy and just so we can test the
actual stuff so when we want to open the
lock screen we edit this to you a button
regular case you might have some timer
running in the background perhaps or
whatever if the app goes to the
background you want to open it we will
just trigger it with this function so
then we will simply push the lock screen
component which we also need to import
again from ionic simple lock screen my
package and then push this lock screen
on to our current navigation control and
the package was designed by Carson that
you just need to add some parameters
right here which are then handled as
enough params on his side
so what you need to push is first of all
the actual code which represents the
code that is right and the right
combination to unlock the code again the
app again then he has AC and delete
buttons you can set this to true or
false just how you like it I will set it
to false because the screen looks a bit
cleaner but you can give it a try with
true as well so then you got more
buttons to reset the code input passcode
label very straightforward simply the
title at the top so let's call this
unlock app and then we got two more
functions we can pass in here so the
first is incorrect you might guess what
this means
so the passcode was entered correctly
and then we got on wrong which also
returns the number of attempts so do
something on wrong as well and finally
before I forget it now it's right so
let's simply do a toast on these two
events to see what's going on so toast
control a create message in a success
case app unlocked and duration perhaps
two seconds should be enough
and then toast present of course and
same for the error case but this time
let's present a bit different message so
the number of tempts wrong possible
attempt ok and present it as well so
let's take a look how this looks like
perhaps I've run the app before so I
should for now ok it's actually already
removed so I got the screen to set a new
lock code I will set this code if I do
it like this it's too short will return
false inside this function here and
therefore the alert is not close but if
we do four digits we are fine and then
we can open the lock screen and the app
is more or less locked and if we do a
wrong input now we get this nice little
animation and at the bottom we can also
see the number of wrong attempts to the
lock in and if we now use the right lock
in our app is locked in the screen will
be removed just like we have a pup event
with enough controller that's exactly
what's going on in the on correct case
and then your app would be unlocked
again ok so that's basically how to use
this package and how do you create an
ionic lock screen to things now so first
we are simply presenting a view within
our app so this is not a whole security
system and of course we are doing it on
purpose inside this function so this
means you need your own logic for
displaying this view inside your app and
it is not 100% safe also we're storing a
passcode of the user within the storage
and we're storing it in plain text right
here and this is of course also not
completely safe so if you want to have
more safe you could for example hash the
entered code and of course created a
little bit nicer input than we got here
and then I might have to add check to
the ionics simple lockscreen module so
that you can also pass a hash value
which is compared then so that would be
a first approach to make this a bit more
safe if you're interested in this
definitely leave a comment below then we
can see or if you want you can also fork
the repository or create a pull request
with a new functionality but anyway
let's keep the basic functionality like
it is with a simple code input so if you
just need some minor sort of
authentication inside the app to show a
little bit of security then using this
ionic simple lock screen is perfectly
fine and that's also why I call it
simple lock screen it's not a full-blown
authentication stuff why should you use
this package instead of touch ID or face
ID I don't know no but you might have a
case where you don't want to use the
Apple or Android native stuff for your
app but still want this pattern which
users know from other apps so therefore
you can use your own codes and are not
dependent on the pin code or touch ID or
whatever it is and get this nice little
view which we've seen here which looks
pretty good I think out of the box so
thanks again to Carlson for doing this
and if you have any comments for the
package just let me know I hope you
enjoyed this quick win if you want to
