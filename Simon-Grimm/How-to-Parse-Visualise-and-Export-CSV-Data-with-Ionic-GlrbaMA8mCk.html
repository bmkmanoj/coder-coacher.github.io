from this tactic and the ioniq Academy
in this video I will show you how you
can use CSV data inside your ionic app
so I've created a blank new ionic app is
already running and I also edit some
dummy data to my app so a CSV file is
basically a comma separated values file
you can export this from Excel sometimes
you get this from clients and I just
created a few lines here so we got some
data for our app now what we need to
install additionally into our app is
first of all the Papa Paris plugin Papa
Paris is as you can see a powerful CSV
partha and also additionally to this
package you can install the types for
this so you get more auto completion and
stuff like this if you do this so this
package can do almost anything so we can
convert to jason we can convert back
from jason if you want to you can have
some config files and even download from
an URL and stuff like this so it's a
really powerful tool and we will only
touch the basics here but i think those
will be enough to get started with this
package the first of all we need the
HTTP module so go ahead import the HTTP
module from an angular HTTP because we
need to load our local file so let's
continue to our home and of course you
can find this dummy data in the blog
post according to this video so here we
need to import
and we can put it as pata from there it
is alright and we also need the HTTP
from again angular HTTP to open or file
now it is here as well and then we can
go ahead so let's make a function first
of all to read CSV data and we will call
this here so everything is nicely
separated first get our file which is in
a third dummy data dot CSV and then we
subscribe to the result and if we get
some data we call another function which
will extract the data with the response
of this extract data with the data and
if we hit an error
perhaps craft function handle error and
this one will be called in this case
okay
now we're good here and at this point we
got the data from our file so it's
actually super simple but first of all
add a check so that we load the body of
the respond here I don't know if we
could map this before perhaps but just
as a fallback we use this way and then
we go ahead and let pass data and now we
use Papa the first time and we call the
parse function which expect a csv string
or data
so we use CSV data and from the results
we only want the data so this line
already does everything we need so this
will go into the CSV file and let this
up look for the delimiter and handle
everything so this is then an array of
all the values we got but there are two
things so we got the CSV data in the end
which will be an array and we also get
the header row which is the same array
and we separate them here so we say our
header row is parsed data as position 0
perhaps at a check if there is a row 0
but I'm pretty sure there is in this
case and then we splice it out so the
first is gone then and now we can set
our actual CSV data to the parsed data
and then we got a header row of values
and we got the CSV data array of arrays
I think and we can use them now so
handle error whatever perhaps we leave
this out for now but this one is
important as well so we not only want to
show the data we want to make it
editable and finally download it again
so to convert our current data back to a
CSV file we can use on parse and it's
almost the same but we specify the
header field which is this header row
and then the data which is this dot CSV
data and to show you that is actually
working our copy in
some simple HTML heck so this will
create a new element from our data and
click on this element and remove it so
really ugly code here but it's just so
we can download the file and see that
we've actually changed something in the
file
the last one we need we could do this in
a segment but let's do it right now
perhaps you might already know why we
have this this is a very simple trick PI
function for our angular array because
we will iterate over our CSV data in the
view and we will change the data and you
lose the input for the field sometimes
and this trick by function solves this
problem so we don't lose input if we
change our data now let's go back to
this or I am let's see if it's still
loading we have it a good sign
so I didn't fuck up anything today makes
me kinda happy so let's go ahead with a
view and we don't need this anymore
so now course like this and this because
we need to download button so simple ion
button I can only and unclick we want to
call our download CSV function so then I
on icon and this should be download here
so we got the icon ready now we can
remove this and now we start with the
implementation for our table we could
use just bread table but I recommend
putting it into an ion scroll so you can
actually scroll the table
and we can make the table a bit bigger
scroll I'm and also we add a class here
which we will fill in a second okay
because most of the time those tables
won't fit on just one screen especially
if you target like an iPhone which is
really super small so this is the data
table and now the fun begins
so we built a header row and this row is
still quite easy we say LED header of
header row we want to Center our text
and then we make this a bit bold and
simply print out the header so this is
then our header row perhaps it already
appears yes and as you can see the iron
scroll is well we could scroll it but
it's super small and therefore we want
this to cover the whole screen or in
your case however big you want to have
it so I say data scroll inside the CSS
position:absolute top:0 bottom:0 left:0
and guess what right is 100 now it's of
course zero and then you see that it's
completely visible and it covers the
whole screen so we got all the space for
our data Scrolls now I also edit data
table here because I found that if we
give this min with whatever fits your
case perhaps make it flexible make a
calculation I will just put it to 800
and we see that the rows look a lot
better
on an iPad this would actually look
quite good now but for now it's also
okay and we can scroll them so it's the
best we can do without cutting all the
information now after our header row we
get back and now it gets a bit more
tricky so we need first of all to
iterate over all the rows of our picture
CSV data we use the index and now we got
a row for each entry in the CSV data now
we need to craft cells for each let
Bator of bro so every cell is one column
then we need B index again and finally
we need the track by function so we
don't lose focus so track by function
which we crafted before this is already
almost the full magic here now we just
need the ion input set the type to text
FP ng model so we can actually change
the data and the model for each input
will be CSV data the first index we use
and then the second index and that's it
so let's see there is the data from the
CSV file I can go through it I could
change this to whatever what you like
you could change the date the numbers of
course there's no validation here but
it's just a simple example so now we've
changed a few rows
and if we hit download we see that we
got this new file let me open it and
perhaps it takes a second come on
is there anything else we could do by
now no think so there it comes
so there we got it let's see oh come on
that's not what I want it I want to zoom
in yes there it is so you can see Mick's
been invalid whatever different ID so
all the changes we made inside our ionic
app to the JSON data or array data is
now back transferred into the CSV file
and you can give this out so I hope you
