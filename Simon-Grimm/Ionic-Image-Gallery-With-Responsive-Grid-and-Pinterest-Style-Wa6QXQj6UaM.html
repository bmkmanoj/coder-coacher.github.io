from this tactic and the ioniq Academy
in this video I will show you how you
can easily create a responsive image
gallery on two different ways so one
will be a general gallery like you might
know it from images at inside your phone
and the second option will be a more
Pinterest inspired layout so let's get
started I've created a blank new ionic
app and what I also did is I copied in
some images to an image folder inside
acid so just pick some images I took
them from Stuxnet but of course you can
take your own or whatever you like so
let's get started first of all let me
add one simple segments switch so we can
later on easily switch between our two
layout types so gallery type I think we
don't even need a color right here and
then we need two buttons so I on segment
button the segment control is really
handy to switch between content on a
page so one button for regular and one
for Pinterest okay close button close
segment and we're good yes now we can
already see our switch also we should
edit - of course not but gallery type
can we set it to regular in the
beginning so the first one will be
automatically selected
okay now the fun actually begins so
first of all we add and
in the switch for the gallery type so
inside here it will be the two different
ways now the first one is based on the
ionic grid system so we're a bit inside
ion grid and we have to add ng-switch
case and this will be displayed once the
regular action is active inside the grid
we start with an ion row and it will be
just one row covering all of this so we
will have multiple columns inside this
one row and they will simply wrap to the
next line if they don't fit in the
current row so we don't have to do any
math for calculating rows or anything
like this then we go ahead and create an
NG for that image of in my case I
actually thought you could create an
array of numbers with a dot syntax in
you like 1.11 but I wasn't able to find
out how this works perhaps you know this
also we add the image container right
here an additional class and now we
could add all images on their own to the
iron core but I will put it inside this
div and what we use now to make the
gallery look a bit better is setting the
background image of each of these
different elements so by doing this we
make sure that all of our gallery blocks
look the same size so inside here we put
the URL to our image so it's an SS image
and then it should be at
image or variable dot jpg in this case
okay close the brackets close the diff
and let's see how this looks actually it
doesn't look like anything now let it
reload where's my image come on
Oh perhaps we need to go to our CSS
first of all and implement the image
container class because we're sitting it
as a background image we need to set
background size to cover so it covers
the full size and also perhaps set min
hate of whatever fits your image is best
and now we still don't have anything
what is wrong here my switch not working
come on it's ridiculous okay perhaps we
should also add our responsive
breakpoints dialing so let me write it
and then we can talk about this for a
second alright so for some reason I had
to restart my eye on a clip command and
now I can copy this inning somehow I
ever did a view like we had this issue
before but never mind so now we can also
switch between our cases if we add the
ND which case again which was regular
and then hopefully we can continue okay
now so here we got our gallery and we
said that for the smaller screens we
want each column to take six
units so a row had 12 units which means
on the smallest Queens we can present
two colors now for medium screens we set
the column size to four which means on
medium screens we can actually have
three images next to each other and for
the biggest size we set it to 3 so 3
times 4 is 12
so in that case on the biggest Queens we
could even have 4 images next to each
other as you can see by using the
background image we can fill it and we
see well not the complete image we could
do this with some more CSS to stretch it
or I'll not stretch it but cover
everything and just zoom into the middle
but I think this effect is already
pretty good and this is a regular
gallery you might see in your Photos app
which you could use for displaying
images to your user or displaying
whatever you like and it's really
responsive so it works for tablets for
bigger sizes as well as for small
devices with their current IO Nagl app
you can open the full screen right here
which brings us to this I'll simply
remove I on a gleb from the URL but this
is now the first type of responsive
gallery let's go to the second one and
the second one is from the code error
from the code bit different because we
want to Pinterest style layout so you
might not pinterest the images have
different sizes or the pins and they
flow next to each other so it looks
really nice and I was not able to do
this with the ion grid I don't know why
but I think it depends on how it is
thought of how the Flex box below it
works and all of this so we have to
create our own little Pinterest inspired
styling here
so again ng-switch case but in this case
we used Pinterest and for Pinterest we
wrap everything in images we will create
the CSS class in a second and then we
get DIF with one image we can again use
our for loop here and now we simply put
in an image to assets image image the
JPEG and that's it so by now it will
look well not really like a Pinterest
gallery not responsive at all so let's
change this also if we like to we could
now set this to Pinterest as we are
debugging the Pinterest layout so we got
the image container and what we now need
is a styling for our images and here we
use a column count so if we specify a
column count of two we see that we
automatically get this Pinterest style
layout if we want to we can add some
more margin to all the images so they
look a bit nicer but there's one thing
missing so now we're not using the
responsive grid so looking at these
images it doesn't look that good on all
screens perhaps on your phone but what
you can do now is use simple media
queries and we use the min width so in
the beginning for a min width of 0 we
want our images to use to color just as
we did with the breakpoints for the
column we use now to more media queries
that was the wrong key so the first one
perhaps starting at 420 and the bigger
device is perhaps start here and now we
got again a flexible column layout based
on the width of our device is it right I
think so so on small devices we got two
columns as we get bigger we got three
and at some point our layout changes to
use four columns for the images and with
this of course you could put in some
cards or different elements just like
the Pinterest pins you could change your
breakpoints I think the press is somehow
a bitch small I don't know why should be
yeah perhaps more like this but this is
yeah okay I'm on an IMAX screen so my
breakpoints happen very quickly here but
you can see that we still now got our
responsive grid and it looks like a
Pinterest so first approach is with the
ion grid and the rows and columns with
different break points and using the
background image for the images and the
Pinterest approach works completely with
custom divs flexbox in the column count
and media queries so I hope you enjoyed
this video I hope you can build a cool
UI for your next image gallery with this
approach and if you enjoyed this video
