from deaf take day today I will show you
how to create a simple navigation inside
react native and we will use the
Navigator iOS for this so let's start
with a blank project first as you can
see the documentation for the Navigator
is quite heavy and in my eyes you don't
need all those render stuff and
everything inside so I will show you a
simple demo how to create a simple
navigation which means we will have
three views route view a child be you
and one more child so we can go down
three level and all those views will be
sticked so we automatically will have
the back button at the top like you know
from most of the iOS apps all right so
it's ready let's get in there and also
open the Xcode project we don't need
this
let's start it no not that one so once
we got everything up and running
hopefully we see our app but by now we
can already create some files inside
here because as I said we will have some
more views and that's why first of all
we will have root view so create the
root iOS j/s and two more child iOS J s
and also child to iOS J s so those are
the files we will need in this tutorial
all right hopefully this is working
right now and it's connected great so
first of all the index file we already
have is the basic one we need and inside
this file we will create the container
for our navigation so let's remove all
of this stuff here we don't need this
and also we just need the flexbox
styling and we don't need the text and
also no view but we need the navigator
navigator iOS and inside our render
function we will now create the view
which is simple Navigator iOS and we
pass some styling
take the container styling and also we
have to define our initial route initial
route alright and this one is an object
inside here so our initiative vu or the
route view has the title of my route
which is what will be displayed in the
title bar and also a component and this
is what will get rendered inside the
view so we pass the route enough we
obviously don't have it by now
so close this one and close everything
else perfect
if we save it and refresh we obviously
don't have a route enough right now and
we also watch 18 their problem what okay
now it's okay so I hope this should work
yes
okay so currently a route enough is
missing so go to the top of your file
and let's require it and this will be
our route that iOS alright I this
one up
yes love that okay so now we got it but
we obviously don't really got it
Oh in my application crash that's new
but no problem so we obviously need our
route view so let's copy this and paste
it here
we don't need everything inside but some
parts all right
let's comment this out for now at this
moment in the root file we don't need
the app registry that's only for our
index file so here we will create our
basic view or the first one we will see
so we need the style sheet we need view
we maybe need a touchable highlight and
we also need some text maybe and this
will be our route enough as I said and
also make sure to call module exports so
our route enough will be available for
others ok so inside our class we don't
need the Navigator again obviously we
just need a simple view some styling
again we need the container and inside
our view we will have a little touchable
highlight view which means a button so
inside the touchable highlight as I said
some styling again we will create this
style in a second
excuse me and we also have to define the
unpress event for our button sew-on
press we want to call this dot let's go
deeper and obviously we need to
implement this but not now all right
that's it and afterwards we also specify
the underlay color which is the color
you see when you pressed button so this
just looks nice one two three four five
six okay all right and also the button
needs some text say else button start
button text and inside we must go dhurpa
all right
it's everything for our button we need
to close our touchable highlight and the
view is closed finally we need some more
styling so let's take a look we need a
bit more for our container to make
everything look smooth and we specify
row layout flicks we want to align our
items in the center
we want some background color to see if
our view is active or not alright I had
some cool color five one five one or all
right and also some padding so it
doesn't look like
alright we also had the button and we
had the button text so the button text
is quite easy a bit of font size a bit
of color and also some margin so the
text is centered I'm not sure why this
is not working
yes automatically but we're in a very
early stage of react native so hopefully
we will see this in later world again we
want the Flex Direction row so you can
find all this code on my blog
in case you're a bit lazy or you don't
want this styling just leave it out but
I'm not sure how you you will look like
maybe something is missing or hidden so
make sure to copy the styling if
possible either by typing now or by
getting it from my blog alright finally
we got everything inside and I think we
need to recompile let's run it again
all right some minor error okay yes
and finally we got it so what we've got
until here we got our Navigator iOS
which is the container around everything
and we got our initial root and this
root is our root enough which is this
view with the touchable highlight the
button the background you see it it goes
below this bar the my root comes from
our title so everything's working until
here but we don't have any navigation by
now so let's change this and therefore
let's implement the Ghidorah function
and this is pretty straightforward we
just have to call this dot props dot
navigator dot push no I'm sorry
navigator dot push and we need to push a
new yeah a new title child title and
again we have to push a component or
specify it and this will be your child
we will require this soon and also I
want to show you how you can pass some
properties because you will need this
yeah a lot of the time so just pass
props and make an object
this could be your value all right I
hope that clear so this will push a new
state and as I said we need to require
this child and this will be our
childhood iOS that yes so by now our app
isn't running because we need to
implement our child but this is no
problem right now
and so our child against a sheet view
touchable highlight we will require the
second child very soon we need to call
it let's say child enough make sure to
export it and we don't want to implement
this by now and our view is a container
and inside the container let's define
the text style start text
and and we can say my value and just say
this dot props that my element and this
will give out text we have passed in our
roots date so let's keep the touchable
highlight and yes just so we can see we
want to go even darpa and let's change a
bit of the styling so let's take a
different color let's say this and we
also have to add the styling for our
button so this is not for the button I'm
sorry
obviously for the value we want to show
which we've passed from our previous
state so this will be a bit bigger than
our button and the color of the text
again will be simply white all right I
think the rest is fine for now we can
keep it and let's take a look maybe this
is already working by now so okay so
right now we are inside the navigator
and inside our route view we press go
derpa and we should hopefully see our
new state yes so the child title is the
title we passed the component we see is
the one we passed and also we had this
optional element which is my element and
the text this could be your value and
that's exactly what we've keeps played
inside our view sorry
all right so there's only one thing
missing now and that's the last view so
again we want to go dripper and this is
even lower than before and right now
this will be the lowest child for our
tutorial and we don't need the optional
value all right so let's require our
lowest child which will be chai - dot io
s and let's take this to our child - and
let's see what we need to change for
this one so this is the child - now
make sure to export it and at this point
we don't want to go durpa anymore so
let's remove this one and also our view
will look a bit different we let's say
yeah we can keep a simple text so this
is obviously the dopest child so we got
one touchable highlight and unpress we
want to say pop all which will bring us
back to our initial route view so this
will pop the complete stack views as you
can see we will be one deeper and we
will come back to the blue initial one
without a back arrow so just back to the
route and yes let's say pop to route and
we also want a second touchable
highlight and this will call pop once so
this will do exactly what this arrow up
here does but I want to show you this
function because sometimes or many times
you want to go maybe go back by yes by
doing something and calling it and not
using the default the default arrows or
buttons so this will be pop once all
right so we got our styling our
touchable highlights and the container
can stay the same the button can stay
the same maybe we should give bit more
space to the buttons and a bit less
space to the text but everything else
should be exactly how we want it
so let's implement those functions this
is real quick again this dot props that
navigator and just say pop for popping
it once that's everything cool right and
obviously this is just as easy as pop to
top and yeah well let's see if this is
working
so this was already working before so we
got one keeper oh we could add some yeah
the button obviously needs some margin
because this does not look cool sorry I
must do this all right so we add the
diapers child we can go back to your
previous state and back to the first one
but we can also use our pop ones which
will bring us back just one we obviously
should have taken another color to make
it even more clear right now yes so pop
ones we go back to our middle state just
like we would go with the button and pop
to root brings us back to the blue state
without any buttons up there and now one
more thing you could also use slide from
the side to go back this is so cool I
love it and we have done nothing to get
this we just get it look at the title
bar how it's changing it's just the
effect we want to have and this feels
real
really really native well it's native so
I hope you enjoyed this video you
learned how to create a simple
navigation with a navigation bar and
some routes and I hope to subscribe my
channel if you like this and see you
