from the ionic Academy in this quick one
I will show you how you can really
easily and superfast implement Instagram
sharing inside your ionic app and first
of all we need the Cordova plugin for
Instagram so go ahead and add this
plug-in and then of course we need the
plugin for the camera as we need some
picture that we can share on Instagram
so second install the camera plugin
after those two plugins we of course
also have to install the ionic native
packages so npm install ionic native
instagram and camera and once this is
done we can go to our app module and
start with our app by importing first of
all Instagram and also the camera from
ionic native Instagram and same with the
camera okay and then make sure to edit
through the array of your providers so
camera and Instagram okay
our view is very simple in this case
let's give it a name insta share and
perhaps a color primary and then within
our content we actually only need two
buttons and a little image so create an
iron button for and unclick the first
button we want to load an image into our
app so this is load image and the second
button will call share image so this is
in
degrom share and above we will also add
an image where we display the current
image which is selected by the user so
we know what we're going to upload also
only displayed if we actually have a
current image okay so that's for this
now the actual implementation like
before we need of course Instagram and
we also need the camera now it's working
quite good today and also the camera
options might be nice southern private
camera camera and also private Instagram
Instagram yes like this and of course
like this all right so we got two
functions the first was load image the
second was share image so we load image
we want to load a picture from the
camera so this that camera that get
picture and then we can specify some
options so let's create a little options
object of the type camera options of
course and we can say quality 100 the
destination type in this case needs to
be base64 because this is what the
Instagram plug-in expects so we use
destination type data URL and then
encoding type I don't know perhaps JPEG
should be fine for Instagram and finally
I will make this just to use the library
so you can choose by setting the picture
source type either camera photo library
or say photo album I will pick
the library and then we can go ahead
like before with our get picture
function then we will get some data back
in promise and then we can set our
current image which we should create and
we can set our current image to the data
but the data is not yet complete as a
base64 string so we need to append it by
data image JPEG and then base64 and then
the data will follow alright so this is
a very simple load image function and
then to share our image Cui's the
Instagram plug-in if you want you can
also test if the plugin is actually
installed I will skip this for now and
just use my current image and then what
you can see we can share a canvas ID or
data URL and we pick two data URLs so if
you have some canvas object you could
share this one as well and then we got
an optional caption here so you could
say this was copied to my clipboard
because Instagram is not allowing to
pre-fill the caption for images but this
plug-in will automatically copy this to
your clipboard so you can paste it you
might have to inform your users about
this so let's see okay no compile errors
so in that case we need to build our app
either for iOS and Android because of
course we have no core door inside our
browser so now we need to test our app
on a real device all right so this is
the app on my iPhone I will hit load
image and then just pick an image so we
take this one and we see we got the
image at the position we defined and now
we can hit Instagram share and this will
bring up the sharing dialog with the
option to copy to Instagram so I will
use copy to Instagram and then my
Instagram opens with exactly the image
we just had we can go next and select a
filter if we like to and also at this
point we can go into this field hit
paste and then we got this was copied to
my clipboard the caption we had right
here so you see that's how we can easily
share our image to Instagram actually
now with a callback in the den block you
cannot completely be sure in my case now
this would already be successful because
we've opened Instagram with the image
but we actually haven't shared the image
so be aware that just reaching this
point doesn't mean the image is actually
shared okay so I hope you enjoyed this
quick win you now know how to capture an
image set it to a variable and then
share this image with an optional
caption to Instagram if you enjoyed the

channel and also check out the ionic
academy for more quick wins and also in
depth training with video courses
projects and great community have a
great day and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
