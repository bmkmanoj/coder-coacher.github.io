tactic today I'm gonna show you for
Gallup toss that will save you time and
actually money as time as money so if
you are not familiar with God you could
check out my blog to see more
information about it or just ask me
about it
it's very similar to grunge so if you
know that you will see many familiar
things in this demo so as I'm a friend
of ionic I will start a new ionic app to
show you those plugins and how to apply
them so I'm gonna start a simple app and
if you already have a project or
whatever you can just skip this step and
continue with the plugins we will
install very soon okay so let's open it
okay so actually we can already install
all those plugins if you want to have
the complete code just check out the
link below the video to my blog so I'm
gonna type NPM install safety net deaf
because we just need it for development
and those will be our plugins got load
plugins got up J as hint and jaea sind
stylish go up fix my je s you might know
what this will do and the last one is
got to do so we can already install them
and take a look what's wrong
okay what
okay that's a typo it's obviously
jeaious and as I said okay so for this
demo video I'm gonna create a tiny
controller inside our fjs just to see
some of our plugins in action and you
might already see that I'm not making
the controller as I would do I include
some well not brown things but the
syntax is not not like it should be in
JavaScript so make power and something
like this you might have in your code
and you might have a
with us which does well whatever this is
just for testing and to show purposes of
these plugins and maybe you have some to
use in your code or whatever so
basically this is our control you
already see some J's hint tips from tomb
so we ignore them for now we just save
and we go to our gulp file so here are
already some default task by ionic and
the first thing we want to add is gulp
load plugins so normally you would have
to add all these lines for every plug-in
we use and you would always have require
require require and that would just get
too long so the first one we installed
was got load plugins and it works like
this you say plugins or whatever you
would like require carb-load plugins
okay so now this little plugin will
include all our other plugins which have
to cut prefix so you don't have to put a
require line for all the plugins you add
you can now just use plugins dot your
plugin and that's the first plug-in
which will save you a lot of lines and a
lot of code and even some errors when
you delete plugins and forget to remove
the require line or whatever so I would
recommend this is your first plugin okay
so the second plug-in I want to add is
gulp Jayceon you can see this in action
a bit here from a term and this is just
for JavaScript syntax highlighting and
I'm not sure if we already have it no we
don't let's add J as hint our C file at
the top of project okay where is it
I'm blind yeah my life okay so in this
file you should put the parameters for J
s end and I'm a bit lazy I don't want to
type all these you can find them in the
regarding article on my blog so these
are just some parameters for the syntax
highlighting now let's go back to the
gulp file and add the real task which
will lint our code so you write gulp
task
Lindt the name we're gonna call it and
function okay so we want to return this
pipe thing might confuse you a bit first
but you will get used to it if you use
God regular so we give in the source
folder come on which is Jas and Jas
files so on these files we call pipe
plugins as we said plugins require
download plugins and so we can just use
it down o J's hint and additionally I
installed a stylish or jsn stylish which
just makes a bit tidier output so called
plugins giant reporter and make it j as
hint stylish okay obviously that's the
cult source so our first task is ready
let's try it out okay sorry I'm an
expert I had dot here and that was
obviously wrong so let's try our plugin
and what we see is a very pretty output
of our J as hint
so it says strings must use single quote
or notification in another way is
preferable and this is better than that
and missing semicolon and some
additional stuff we might also exclude
through our JSON file but for now that's
a very fine if you use it in a big
project that will help you a lot if you
see those things and fix them so at this
point I thought why is there no plugin
to fix those things and I found one so
the next one we're gonna add is the gulp
fix marriage is so again we add another
task here in our gulp file and this time
it's called fix Jas
okay
so again the same we give in the source
which is again our job www J has not j s
and we say pipe pipe plugins as so and
fix my J s ute and additionally we give
in the destination so this plug-in can
fix files on the fly or you could have a
diff file or whatever you like can take
a look at the options but for now we
want those files directly back to our
www JSF older
so before we start our task let's go to
the controller we edit and let's save
that so we can compare it better
I hope those things won't get fixed so
let's try it out and go ahead with gulp
fix J s okay you always see something
happened so what happened it put our
controller up here okay that must not be
and the comment is inside that but
let's take a look what happened so
double quotes are now single quotes here
here we have okay the semicolon here we
have three equals and the new object was
is now this so as you can see my term is
not complaining about anything in this
so what happened is everything which was
ugly before is now fixed and this in
seconds so if you run Kaplan you see
there are now only these things which
can be excluded or whatever is defined
but never used this is just this case so
this will save you a lot of time if you
have clean code everything will work
very very much better in the future
so try to include this plug-in somewhere
in your workflow maybe even run it when
you build something or whatever and yeah
just be happy okay
so let's come to the last plug-in iPhone
as you might have seen I added a little
to do and I pretty often at this line -
whatever remember this or come back to
it later and maybe you don't find this
line again if you have a very big
project so this should not get lost so I
they search for a plug-in which would
scan my files for this and I obviously
found one because there seems to be a
gulp task or plugin for everything
so let's add another task is the to do
tasks and now we don't want to return
anything you could but I don't want to
so we give him the source which is again
W wjs every all with J s in there and we
say dot pi lock-ins
to do you might have seen it's very
handy to have this plugins we don't have
to mind any require up here so plugins
to do and and we want plugins to do
reporte which should print it out as a
jason and you can specify some options
here let's say file name to do the jason
i finally let's say called destination
save this file to the root of our
project okay let's try it out
and here's our till you file and here's
the explanation as you can see very very
nice you can if you run Jenkins or
whatever build server you can integrate
it very good to display it reduce or
open things and parse this automatic
generated file to whatever so this comes
in very handy and the last thing you
might want to have is all these tiny
plugins or tasks we used to be chained
so you don't have to call in fix to do
because I feel like you need them
together often so I finally made a task
let's name it quality because this
boosts our quality and this will call
lint fixtures and finally to do so I go
back to here let's take that one back to
the old world
and let's delete it to do so now you
just need to call quality
okay okay
fix yes obviously not as you can see
lint takes js2 do linting result the
file is fixed and we have the to do so I
recommend you include those tasks to
really boost your productivity and I
would be very happy if you follow my
channel or subscribe to my blog and if
you liked it let me know it so if you
have any questions just contact me so
have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
