from deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy
in this video I will show you how you
can create a user interface for your
ionic app that's more flexible for
mobile devices for tablet and even for
desktop browsers or applications however
you want we will build this starting
from a blank template for all platforms
so first of all we need some more pages
so inside your project go ahead and run
the generate command for a new page and
we create just the news page and perhaps
a profile page you can pick of course
whatever you want but I will just use
those two okay so by now we just have
this UI and we can also open it in full
screen so we can better change it and
these changes came in with the latest
I think 3.5 update looks very cool so
make sure your CL is up to date then we
can go ahead and go to our current home
page which is the first page displayed
here and change all of this to something
called split pane so this was inside
some of the ionic news and it's also in
the documentation but it's a bit hidden
and it's actually super cool and super
easy to use what it does is create a UI
that's different for mobile and bigger
devices so inside our split pane we need
a menu and we need to set the content of
the menu which we will do later and then
we have to craft our menu okay actually
I could have kept what we had before so
I on toolbar and I on title menu
and after the Hira we got the ion
content and inside the content a simple
list of just two items in our case so
button ion item and unclick we will call
the open function it will either open
the news page or another one and we also
add menu close here so the menu will
automatically be closed once a user
click this button and the second button
should open the profile page and this
would be profile okay so this is our
menu inside the split pane now we also
need our navigation we can wrap this in
a simple I enough we have to reset the
root page which we will do from our
class and we have to say this is our
main view this is the content of the
menu and now we are good here
now go to your home key as anti find
what the root page should be in the
beginning let's just say it's news page
and also we need the open function which
will get a page name and then we call
this dot root is no page name alright so
let's see you can already see that we
got a menu right here
we can switch from profile to news and
when we make our view this small so
below a certain point the menu will
completely disappear and now we can add
actually a button to our news and also
to the homes to the profile page inside
our navbar which says button I on button
and just menu toggle that's all we need
here and inside you can put an icon but
classic one menu icon which is the
burger like it or not let's edit here
and to the news as well and now we will
see a few changes so on bigger screens
we still don't have this button but once
the menu actually disappears we get the
button with a side menu now so you can
imagine you can create your F now for
let's say iPhone or phone device and you
will have this classic interface with a
site menu which you can bring in from
here if you now also perhaps want it for
tablets or phablet devices perhaps
tablets still would have this button but
finally for tablets the UI might look
more like this and the user will see the
menu all the time and also if you plan
to deploy your ionic app to web or
perhaps to an electron container for
desktop you would perhaps have full
screen size and then the menu would
always be visible of course you could
change things you can remove this
somehow crazy bar you can change the CSS
for everything you could make it a bit
smaller and all kinds of things but the
point is we automatically now get this
behavior through the split pane and also
you could even set the break point so
when this switch happens based on the
device will or based on a function even
so this makes it really useful to use
the split pane if you plan to build your
app for multiple devices now
additionally I want to cover something
else in this video which is the grid
layout you might know it already but
let's make a short example so inside the
news page we add an array of
items nothing special so we got a title
and we got some text just pure dummies
stuff here but let's go to our Muse HTML
and use the ion grid so you might know
that you can use the ion grid and then
you get rose and then you got columns
right and you got every row 12 columns
and they can share the space or take up
a specific part of the space and
distribute it all 12 is the magic number
remember this so you might have cards in
here with eye on card header okay
perhaps we should add the ng for loop
let item of news items and now for our
header we can use item dot title and for
the content we use item dot I think text
description okay let's see where is it
actually sometimes my reload is not
working at expected okay there we got it
so um actually the behavior is already
pretty good through the through the
split pane I see okay also I guess the
eye on card has some internal stuff but
this still looks not perfect I think so
what you can do now is add definition to
our column how it should behave on
different sizes so normally every column
on the smallest possible device should
take the full amount so a column should
have or should cover 12 units
so you can just have one column in one
row but if the devices get bigger
perhaps you want a column to just cover
six so you can have two next to each
other and then you can also change it
for larger devices to have to kayak for
which means you can have three cards
next to each other so 3 times 4 or
perhaps and the biggest screen ratio you
want even for element next to each other
apparently this looked already pretty
good before so I guess the changes are
not that big but you see at the lowest
level we take the complete width then it
snapped and we take half so each column
block is now 6 we make it a bit bigger
ok the eighth and the menu appears so
this area gets a bit smaller again but
then we go back and we have the form
this still doesn't look that good but ok
it actually saved some times let's see
ok now it's saved so now we're one two
next to each other three next to each
other and at the biggest break point we
break so each column just takes 3 units
3 6 9 12 and the places fit so by using
the split pane and the grid layout would
break points for different device sizes
we can make our user interface within
our ionic app really flexible so it
looks good if you have a very small
device if you have a medium tablet or
even if you just have a desktop browser
or electron app or whatever it might be
so keep this in mind that you can
actively change the behavior
of your ionic f on different platforms
so it always looks the best I hope you
