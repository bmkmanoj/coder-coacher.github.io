detect again Bionic Academy today we
will build an accordion list with ionic
so I've already started a blank F and
what we're going to do is based on a
JSON file we will implement a list where
we can open elements and those elements
can have items so child item knows child
items could again have items so it's
more or less a nested list yeah let's
dive right into it because we have a lot
to do so we need to get started
implementing or using the HTTP module
because we're loading a local adjacent
file and we just need this so go ahead
and import it from it angular HTTP and
we are fine here now let's create our
file inside the assets folder and name
it information that Jason and I have
already created something so you can
find this on the quick win on the ionic
Academy page basically we got an array
of items and we got an item at the top
level and we got the item pizza and then
we got drinks UC drinks for example only
has some children and the top level
action also only has this level but if
we check out the pizza section we see
that we got another subsection inside
the children with again children so we
got different levels to display and this
makes it a bit tricky and a bit more
interesting of course so we got this
let's go to our home T s because
functions we actually don't need that
much let's implement those few that we
need so we need HTTP err almost like
this
and we need to map our data as far as I
know yeah so we need rxjs it's operator
map and this is of course HTTP and then
we got an array of information which is
of the type any and now we can do local
data equals this third HTTP GET and now
the path to our file which is in assets
information that Jason and of course we
need to sorry not this we need to map
the information to Jason and also we use
the item items inside the array now one
power local data is here we subscribe to
the data and now we are able to set our
information array to data so this is
only to load our data maybe you have
real HTTP requests so this is just some
dummy stuff now we need two functions so
we need total section and we call the
second one well toggle item what we need
to do is once we toggle a section we
will set a property inside our
information array so when we click on a
top-level we set the selected item at
that position to all so we use our
informations array at the position which
we will pass to this function and simply
says open to net ohm so we can toggle it
in or out more or less the same for a
toggle item but now we are already
inside the children
array of something and now we are using
the second parameter which we will pass
so we got one from the top level and
then we select another
section inside that item so we're inside
the children's array then and do the
same for this so these are actually the
only functions we need the rest of our
stuff completely happens inside the HTML
and CSS which is kind of interesting
because it's super easy okay let me do
one thing I also for this example change
the primary color to yellow I don't
remember why but it looked better to me
okay back to the own HTML and now the
fun begins
so this is the Academy keeps our F to
order some pizza okay this can be
removed and we start first of all with
an ion list and we give it a class say
accordion list and this is our first
level so we can also say first level
right here just so we know what we are
doing
the first devil has ion list header and
here we create headers for fluid item of
information so this is the top level and
of course we now need the index so we
also say that I equals index you will
notice we add quite a few of these
additional attributes like no lines no
padding to achieve the effect we really
want to have of course we need a button
to open a section so button I on item
and unclick we call toggle section with
the index we got we don't want detail
arrow at the right side and also what we
already can do is
engi class because based on a parameter
or if it's open or not open we set a
class so this will have the section
active class if our current item that
open is true and it will only have
section if not let'em open okay so
nothing really fancy but this helps us
to style our element it with open or not
okay
if the button and inside we add two ion
icons the item should be on the left
side so item left and the first is arrow
forward so this will only be displayed
if the item is not yet open and the
second one we can copy this is now arrow
down and this will displayed once the
item is open and finally we add item dot
name and we can take a first look at our
app so here we are we got our three top
level and once we hit an item we already
see this the arrow icon changes we will
implement the rest of the CSS styling
later
so now just let continue so we are
inside this one item and this one item
of course can have some children or in
this case it will actually have children
but let's see how well it doesn't have
to you have children so if it has
children and it is open only in that
case we display our next ion list which
is now the second level
so we can copy our header if we like to
because now we need again to iterate but
now we have child of item children so if
this is too fast to stop and take a look
again at our JSON file is a bit complex
of course I think we don't need no lines
again here yes of course we need to
close it at some time now this is a bit
more interesting because we can copy
this to some degree so if the section or
if this child has again children we need
to be able to toggle this again of
course but we could also have this is an
item so if we see here this is directly
an item then we need to display
something else so that would be a direct
add button in that case so we need to
implement both options the first option
will now call our another function which
is toggle item and we already get our
index from top and from here again eye
on item detail none we don't need a ng
class here just add class child item
perhaps and what we also need is now
that we got already detail man oh yeah
of course
we need this button only if our current
child actually has children okay so this
is the full leg like I said below we
will have this other button oran can
only make it an eye on item and this
will be displayed in
if not tell dr. Challa so this would be
an item to add to our card for example
sorry let me see again eye on item and
like always detail um and we add a class
child item and what we also need here is
two at X prime to display everything
inside on this item so this would then
be child that name and perhaps we also
want to display the information so for
me I had text lower case for some reason
my text was always an upper case here
and this did actually not look so good
so we at our information and we finally
add also a button of the style outline
and the item will be at the end on the
click event whatever you like perhaps by
item child are not implementing this
year but just so you know and then we
could say child our price Europe and we
could display the price of the child
let's go back a second here we have our
toggle button let's indent a bit it will
only be displayed if we get children and
the icon to the left is no add and now
close so we're using a few different
icons here and just to make it clear and
of course when not watching the item
anymore at this step the child of this
ng for loop who quite a bit already so
let's see how our app looks okay this is
almost the final view same for drinks in
for pizza we see that we got three
subsections and if we hit the plus
button it changes to the close button
so as you can see it's already working
actually quite good the only missing
piece is some more styling and our third
level inside here so let's add this
third level now so again we start an ion
list and this list should only be
displayed if our child actually has
children and if our child is currently
open in that case we have reached the
third level sorry and now at this level
we know now that all of the items on the
third level adjust items so normal
sections to open if you get more levels
and people levels you could have to make
more levels and if you want to make a
dynamic let me know that's another story
I guess but for us we want to just have
those three levels and they're already
quite dynamic so hopefully you can tweak
this example for your needs but let's
make our third level before we get too
philosophical so in this case let item
of child children I don't actually know
if we need the index not perhaps not
again no detail and this is not a child
item and I think just like before we
need text wrap so our text is not cut
again but no it's item well could this
be a problem when the trouble over no I
don't think so and again actually we we
use the same stuff here but we use item
dot information and buy item item blah
blah blah so I think we are pretty much
done here
so here the third list closes the stuff
of the second list and the first list so
let's refresh and see Pizza traditional
and there we got our three items and we
can open this as well you can open
action and see those items we can close
pits are open the state stays the same
inside here but you know this we got a
bit too much padding here and there we
could use a few more colors some less
padding and margin so let's dive into
our home is CSS and apply a few changes
so we got the accordion list and to make
it a bit more good-looking we use the
color function to access our color array
and use the light color for our
background and so the background colors
everything we apply hate 100% okay it
doesn't look really bad about now but
trust me we'll get better we add section
and I could also keep this open mark and
again whatever the section background
will first of all be white and then the
color for the text is black and we add
the margin to bottom four pixels okay
what has changed not really much
so let's add more so if these section is
active then we change our background to
the primary color I think and also the
text color will change to white was it
safe I don't know our there it is so if
we now open a section you see the arrow
changes like before but also the color
changes to yellow and the text to white
so now we are very good seeing in which
section we currently are okay let's head
on we got the child so a child will have
pretty fancy background I got this from
somewhere I tried it out in 76 and the
font color will again be black and again
we add a margin bottom of 4 pixel we're
getting closer so we also got child item
with a no not backspace background yes
and the background is also like this and
we add some padding so our child items
which are the items we can buy our a bit
more have a bit more padding so let's
see how it looks now okay
well looks more or less okay but not
perfectly so perhaps my last pixels will
change this so we add a general label
class which will apply to a lot of
labels here and we had zero pixels and
also for the general list we add a
margin bottom of four pixel to override
the standard styling so now looks
more together
I don't know these should have a
different background I think
let me check those are the second level
so the second level should have class I
think it should only be child my child
item so then it should be different yeah
now we can distinguish them a bit better
and if we hit this we see three
different colors the active section is
marked our child's have a bit of padding
to the left could of course add some
more let's see how this looks perhaps
better Pratt not I don't know you can
decide but we got our sub list data and
we could add them of course if we would
implement the function we can still open
the top levels here which actually you
have whatever let's keep this like it is
for now but I think there should be more
padding for those items maybe we have
applied the wrong styling to the direct
ok this is of course the child item here
and now they look better okay now right
perfectly fine I think we have applied
all the stylings we need so now you can
click around in your accordion list you
can open all the tabs you can dive into
a third level you could at them you can
close the complete section and if you
open it again it's still open and now
you could of course at animations also
as well but this is covered in a
different course inside the ionic
Academy and I hope you like this video
in case you did make sure to subscribe
to my channel
and just like I said before if you want
more information on ionic you can check
out the ionic Academy where for example
we also have a course on animations with
angular so thanks for joining and
watching this video today and I see you
