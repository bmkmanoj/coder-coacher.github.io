from deaf tech day today we will build a
cool app using ionic 2 and firebase sync
so for this let's go ahead and start a
new app I call it tip tactic firebase it
will use the blank template the second
version of ionic because this is still
in beta and also we will use typescript
so go ahead and run this from your
command line and while this is
downloading some stuff we can already
take a closer look at what we're gonna
use so this is called angular fire -
that was obviously an angular fire one
library as well for ionic 1 or angular 1
but now there's the official angular 2
library for firebase and we will install
this and go some of those examples they
share for building cloud sync and also
simple user authentication so with that
in mind let's wait until our app is
finished and then we can dive right into
the code so by now our app is ready and
we can go to our folder inside our
folder we now have to install some NPM
packages so the first is angularfire to
which we have already seen on github the
second one is firebase and I'm using
this specific version just because I had
problems with the other version so if
you're following this tutorial make sure
to use this version as well ok
besides this installation we can also do
one more thing so firebase ok we already
finished so let's continue with this we
have installed the NPM packages now we
need to install the typing
for sorry for the firebase library to
use it with typescript oh I actually
haven't installed typings what's it
again
I guess NPM typing's like this let's see
I'm pretty sure NPM install - GE timings
okay so as you can see this is a
typescript definition manager okay back
to firebase they had re-branding
relaunch or whatever you want to call it
and this is the actual old platform so
this is firebase.com they now have
firebase hitting firebase google.com so
there's a difference between those two
and to use the authentication we
actually need to create app in the
legacy console which you will have to
log in so let's create the app dev deck
take fire if it's good or is this not a
lot yeah it's okay so we have this app
created here but we actually need to get
it to the new platform which is this one
so go to the console here and meanwhile
we could try to install the firebase
typing's again which should have worked
now okay so we have done this as well
and now we can see I have two old
projects here already and below is the
one we just created in the legacy
console so click on import here
this will be my URL I will not be able
to manage this from the old okay I'm in
Germany
so let's import this project and okay so
our app is important now and we can go
to the database and create the structure
for our firebase database or import the
JSON file I have already created a
little structure which I will show you
in a second so it looks like this and
this is the data contained in the
structure Jason so this is what I just
added you secrete you and you find this
public okay yes that is not so good but
let's go to the AWS top for now and
choose sign-in method and enable email
and password and this is exactly
everything you need to do to enable
email and password authentication and
sign up for your app so now we got this
little arrow here which simply says that
we haven't defined any rules like this
so therefore I will just copy those
rules and replace them before everyone
could read and write to our bucket now
only authenticated users will have
access to our data so this is everything
we need to do on the backend side we can
keep an eye on our database later but
for now we can simply move on to our
code and we start inside the FDS on our
web form
besides the automatically generated
homepage we need ionic ji generate a
page called login
okay and my internet doesn't suck okay
now it's better so we got to login and
this is the first file you want to
import this is the login page and this
should be somewhere in maybe pages
lock-in not really a good code
completion today whatever okay we can
actually remove the home page because
the login page will be the first page we
see and obviously the root page will now
be the login page so no more errors Ian
the second thing we need to import is a
lot of firebase stuff and this will come
from angular fire to and inside our
little object we have the firebase
provide us we have default fire base we
have what do we else have we have
angular fire we have all methods so
please don't ask me for all of those
what they are but this comes from with
the tutorial on github for using angular
fire tube and finally firebase of config
okay so we have imported a lot funny
stuff and we can now go to our app and
create a new providers array and then
inside this providers array we first of
all pass the firebase provider and then
we can set default firebase and this is
interesting because this is just the
name of your app which in my case is
this
and from that point on we don't have to
take care of using this URL or
connection anymore it's one time set
here we also already specify the fire
bathe it's not to config it's called all
config this fire bit of conflict like
this now we can use it the firebase OS
config here which expects an object of a
provider and this is the earth providers
password and method it expects it off
methods password again sorry so we could
also define Twitter or something else
here this is just the default method we
specified for logging in ok so that's
everything we need in our app file now
let's move on to the login we can also
run ionics
ok obviously surf not so so inside the
log in HTML we have well still I own
title login and I own content which is
pretty good at all ok we already have
some types grid arrows yes and yes fixed
so inside our content we will have a
form or either logging in or
oh this does not look very good actually
it looks pretty bad I'm not sure about
my typing's okay we will we will see
okay as I said we will have a form and
we will use the angular 2 way for this
form and this is by defining the login
form in the form and now we don't have
to create reference for the variables
inside the form inside the unlock in TS
we can simply do it all inside the form
and I will show you how inside our ion
form or login form we will have two ion
items and inside the items we have ion
label why can't this be closed
automatically I don't know and we add
some styling which is something we
already get from ionic this will be the
email field and we also need an ion
input with the type email and now we use
angular 2 again ng control and this will
be stored in the variable email we will
see how to use them later and finally
close the input all right obviously we
need to second of those this will be the
password field it should be of the type
password obviously
and also be like this okay so a lot
about two items we will have a little
dip with some petting just to make it
look better and we will have two buttons
the first button has a click event which
we'll call login login okay and the
second one will be red just user because
we obviously need users to create an
account you could also create them on
firebase but why not let them create
their own account so by now we're not
passing anything so we should change
this to use login form dot value so in
login form not value we will have all
the informations about the email and the
password field so we don't need any
special variables inside the log in TS I
have actually already launched Safari oh
yes
and we can see there is our little login
screen hopefully everything will work
but for now we're fine and let's move on
so we go to our log in TS to implement
the lottery the first thing we need to
import is PI base
off from again
angular fire to because we want to lock
in the user but we also need the home
page because after successful login we
need to redirect the user to home ok we
have the template for our page and we
have the class now let's add some
loading as well so we can show some
progress is really easy so I will show
you this while we're doing this ok yes I
haven't reported this so we need to page
we never control alone you might need an
alert and we need the loading from ionic
Angela now we had two functions one was
register user with the credentials we
get from the form the second one was I
think look in and maybe we need
something like show loading which is
pretty easy to implement this loading is
equal to new loading really easy with
ionic 2
it will say please wait and we have to
use it on our navigation controller and
quad present this dot loading yes it's
already public maybe we also want to
show an error this can happen
although we don't like it and in case of
an error there was a little problem with
the loading indicators so I have to use
a little a bit ugly workaround to
dismiss the loading I guess in future I
own equations this will be fixed but for
now this also works so we set a little
time out without any time but I don't
know it's to be something related to the
lifecycle of you so anyways what we
wanted to do was create a new alert view
and this will have the title fail
subtitle will be exactly the text we
passed and the buttons we only need and
ok so we can present this
all right so we have implemented all the
uninteresting functions for now let's go
to the register EULA
first of all let's show the loading
because we can after showing this we yes
we obviously haven't created this by now
so far our functions we need public
variable off which will be firebase off
just like that and now we can use it
here and simply call create user because
this is inside the angularfire to
library and the good thing is we can
directly pass our credentials as this
already expects an email and the
password this uses a promise and not a
new subscribe way maybe in a later
version but for now if you're coming
from ionic one you know how to do this
or from angular 1 so first of all let's
dismiss the loading view and okay let's
create a prompt because no this is no
fail inside this block we actually have
success so we can see you new account
was created okay we present it and what
we can do as well is catch an error
never no errors can happen
so for this we obviously have a horror
show arrow and simply pass the arrow so
if we have done a lot of things right
and the arrow we see here is nothing
that matters we should be able to create
a new account so and see first argument
must contain the key password with type
string whatever but this is an error
coming from fire so my name is also I'm
password test this is the loading
spinner hey success your new account was
created so let's see where's our
firebase packet and there we have it
this is the user we just created user ID
you can disable delete or reset the
password I'm not completely sure what
we'll have so they have some email
templates sign up or set up but I'm not
sure those are not really automatically
sent outs so maybe you have to set up
something else for those to work anyway
we have our user which means the
registration was actually successful our
pew is working and now we can go to the
login function and implement it as well
because of this really nothing special
at all it's even a lot shorter than
before I will copy this because I'm a
bit lazy so the only thing that changes
is we call log in with our credentials
and what we're going to do inside is not
present something like this but just say
there's enough set root page
to be the homepage and also show an
error on error because that's good
violently so let's see so we are back
I'm using my login and I'm passing a
wrong password ok let's specify password
is incorrect
ok I'm sorry for that so let's give the
right one and we're on the automatically
generated home screen of ionic 2 so this
means we actually locked in to firebase
which is great news at this point now
the only thing that's missing is cloud
sync between our to-do list and our view
so let's see how to implement this
before we build our to-do list view
let's go to the typescript
implementation of the home screen
because we can already create the
variables so I'm getting a bit lazy of
implementing this stuff so we empower
all the stuff from angularfire to don't
want to type in all of this and I'm not
completely sure if we actually need the
next one but yeah let's keep it like
this
so inside our home page class we will
have a to-do list which is of the type
firebase lists observable it can be any
object inside so I'm not sure if we need
to import the servable object as well
but we will see what we also gonna do is
use an user image because what in
firebase does is giving you a user image
from gravity' based on your email
address
so we will see maybe I have an image
from my email address and also the
constructor I already prepared so we
import again angularfire like we did in
the login or this was the earth we have
enough controller which we should always
have here just like the other one and we
have angular file reference and this
will be used to syncing our data
so let's actually start with that one
because this is the most interesting one
and this is actually the angular
lifecycle so energy on in it and on in
it come on I can't pronounce this right
so we subscribe to the authentication
event and if we get data so this means
we're actually locked in only in that
case we actually fill out to do this so
you might think we should be definitely
locked in on the homescreen
that could be cases I could directly go
to the home screen and I wouldn't be
locked in so this is to make sure we're
really locked in so the to-do list is
now equals our reference to angular
higher and we want a list of objects
from the to-do list bucket like this and
this is again the name of our array of
objects on fire mate so as I said we
also want the user image and this is
data we get from the login password I'm
not sure why the field or object is
called password I really don't know it's
somehow strange but I inspected the
result and there was a profile image
right inside the password fields so if
this changes and I could imagine it will
change
you might change this to a different
object inside data but for now for the
versions I specified for this tutorial
this works pretty well
okay this was really the most
interesting question here but we need to
create some more so we obviously want to
create it to do and this we'll call a
special function so we will simply use a
mechanism well tell you in a second so
we will display an alert view and either
tell the input filled with data we
already have or use it empty and use the
input for the new object so if we want
to create in you to do we call edit to
do with know to do and we say yes this
is a new to do I might not need the
parameter if I would check for now but
just in case I would like to pass this
as well to open it to do yes said we get
to do from the view hopefully and we
call edit to do with a to do object and
in that case it's not a new to do and
the third one we need is obviously the
classic remove to do this is a bit
easier in that case we simply call
directly on our to-do list remove that
to do seems very easy and it's really
that easy
I'm sure let me copy this alert block
I'm a bit lazy for this third block all
the time so as I said we create an alert
the title depends on if this is a new to
do if it's new we obviously have the
title created you if it's not new we can
say update to do hmm
we don't need the subtitle but what we
need is we need an input or we just need
one input but whatever it's called input
so we have the input name is title
placeholder if we have no value should
also be title and the value of this
field depends on if to do a set then
it's to do that to do and this is a
little object to do object because this
you will see it from our firebase bucket
if we have now to do the value is simply
empty the buttons is a bit bigger array
in this case so first of all let's have
a cancel button and surprise the role of
this button gets it yes it canceling our
stuff but the other button is the
interesting one
so again we make the distinction between
the to do is said and not said so if it
said the button should obviously read
update otherwise it should be adding the
to do and for this button we can specify
and handle it for the data so the cancel
button will simply cancel the alarm you
but this button will have a handler for
the data and now we again use our very
cool variable is new so if it's a new to
do we need to crawl under to do list
push because we want to append or push a
new object to the array and now we see
why the object has to do and this will
be data dot title because the name of
the variable is title and at this point
where was it studio to do this because
the objects have the to do key and the
value is this okay okay we actually need
to handle the else block as well this
will be this dot to-do list update and
we want to update the to do which we
already in cut up here and the new data
for the two will be they turned out to
taya so while I'm typing this I'm pretty
sure I could also remove them from here
yes only pre present the papa
I think we've already done let's give it
a try so know what we should have
disabled autocomplete no I'm not come on
I just want to login okay oh no I forgot
yes yes yes very good
fair enough we can lock the data this is
somehow interesting to us we obviously
haven't created the view I was so happy
we were already finished but whatever we
can go back to that come on now stop
doubt completion hey what is this kind
of magic poof so let's see yes there we
have it this is the auth object I talked
about so allowing this now right there
yes and inside the password field we
have as I said the profile image URL to
a Gravatar image we also have an expired
you could use a lot more of those things
but for this simple use case I guess
it's enough to lock in and be happy so
where was the look let's remove it
and let's graph the final mew poof okay
so back to the home HTML we have enough
bar and before the title which should
obviously be my two dues
we set up an eye on buttons tag and also
apply a start because it should be on
the left hand side on iOS or on Android
well at least at the right side and the
left okay will be here if we say and
it's to the right and if we also start
one it will be here so where was I
okay I was about to close the tech yes
inside we use the eye on Avatar which is
pretty awesome for displaying a little
avatar and we can simply say the image
source is now our user image from our
class you have the eye on touch buttons
is defined and we also have buttons at
the end so you will see this in the view
but now we have an eye on button
obviously not an eye on button just
simple button and the click event yes
click this will be create to do well
let's actually give a cool Titan let's
say add I think it's like this yes the
auto completion is somehow ridiculous
not working
but whatever wicked button buttons lava
okay let's go to the content we don't
want the card but what we actually want
is ion item sliding so we want a slide
button or we want to have a list with
buttons we can move to the slide to
reveal the lead button hmm when use the
new ng form and I hope you watch this on
the new let syntax is already out and
hopefully still there so we iterate over
all of the items in the to-do list and
we also apply a pipe called adding this
will help to update the buttons once
there are changes coming in to our list
inside the eye on item sliding we have
items which are buttons effect and which
have the open to do event using the item
and yes of course we should have I on
item content so this is the content of
the button come on
so much right-hand or something all
right I'm not to do just like we had
inside our typescript I'm so close the
eye on add content close the button and
now we need to specify eye on item
options
and also close it sorry
and again we have a button once we
reveal it which will then call remove to
do on current item and again okay can I
copy this no no no not really
come on we had some agony yes we have a
icon and it will be that trash I know
it's small I guess and delete so after
this okay yes to close it we have closed
the eye on item options we've closed the
button we have closed the sliding and we
forgot the most important part which is
opening the eye on list and also closing
the list poof let's see you know if I
type quite fast they have no chance to
correct me down perfect so let's look in
ok I I created some something bad on
parse error yes obviously uh come on
that was really bad
and I shouldn't take any easier email
address possible there you have it so
much well in a single view so we have
three two deuce which are coming from
our to-do list we have important we have
the user image we have the chance to
create it to you my new epic to do and
there we write have and let's go to the
firebase and it's so this is the beauty
of this we have the sliding delete
button and we used on the second to do
it gets removed from our list and you
have seen it can do it again it's marked
red on firebase so this means it's about
to be deleted and it's gone my epic to
do update and my epic to do is updated
and immediately updated here if I change
it on fire oh can I change it yes it's
changed and it immediately has changed
in my file alright so this was the
tutorial on using user signup
authentication with firebase using
angular fire to with ionic tube and also
cloud sync with our list items creating
updating removing everything you need in
a normal app created in I don't know
maybe 40 minutes 30 40 minutes something
like this so you see how fast you can
really create MVPs or anything using
ionic 2 and 5s
