from detecting today I'm back with an
ionic 2 tutorial using the first release
candidate so hopefully we're on a pretty
stable version right now and this
tutorial won't change or they won't be
breaking updates
so we're gonna build a simple RSS
reading app using ionic 2 and therefore
we will use the ionic CLI as usual to
create a blank new project and using the
second version of ionic 2 so while this
is installing let's wait until it's
finished ok so once the app is ready
navigate to the folder and let's start
generating some assets so we generate a
page called feed list which we will use
later on and we can also generate
provider which we simply call our feed
service so this service will be injected
to our pages later on we also need the
ionic storage package because we want to
store the RSS feeds we already added and
this is the new way of doing this and
finally we at the in-app browser so we
can simply open the ini browser for
articles inside our app so let's go to
the code alright and we can also call
ionic serve already here and just shut
it down for now ok so this is the
structure of our app and we navigate to
the pages for now now we start with the
providers so our feed service is quite
empty at the moment this feed service
will take care of loading the feed data
and
to do so we obviously need some imports
we need the injectable for the feed
service HTTP to make requests to map and
change the result
we need the storage for storing the feed
data we already added and observable so
our typescript is not complaining about
what we're doing let's see our app
currently looks like this let's put it
to the side well it's a bit too big I
think and maybe we can also add some
logging just in case we make any arrows
alright let's continue with our feed
service so we're using typescript and we
can define some classes to make our life
a lot easier so we will define two
classes a feed item and also the class
feed which will simply hold some values
which we can then pass to our views all
of them are strings for now and the feed
item simply represents one article which
always has a link a title and the
description and we also create a
constructor for this so we obviously
need all of those values and the title
and then we can assign them
to our variables we already find all
right so this is the feed item the feed
looks quite the same so let me paste in
the code for this it's a title and the
URL not really interesting at this point
okay let's go to our actual feed service
and we already have the HTTP provider
imported we also need the storage the
types storage oh sorry the constructor
don't or has no real other functions at
this point so inside our pizzas we need
three functions we need get saved feeds
which will return the feeds from our
storage we need add feet to add a new
feed item and we also need one big
function for getting articles get
articles for URL so for one feet URL we
need to retrieve the articles inside
that RSS feed okay so let's start with
the get saved feed the storage and
returns or the get function is not a
yeah it's actually a promise still so we
call this storage get and we want to get
the value for save feeds and once we get
it
we can use that data which is actually a
string so we need to convert it to an
object so let's call it object front
string and simply use json.parse as it
will be a json string on our data object
so if we actually get something so just
some security checks here so we don't
return any re-return the parsed
data which is the object from string
otherwise we simply return an empty
array just to prevent any crashes or
anything else okay so this is how to get
our saved feeds now to our ad feeds we
again return this promise first of all
we need to retrieve the feeds we already
have so we can use the function we just
created and with this array of feeds we
can easily call push to append our new
feed so again this array of feeds is now
an object therefore we need to convert
it to a JSON string and this is almost
the same but now we call string E file
on the array of feeds just like this and
finally we want to edit so we return
this dot storage set so we set our JSON
string for the saved feeds property
alright this is everything we need to
add and get saved feeds now let's go to
our get articles for URL
this is a bit tricky so let's copy in
first of all this so we make use of
courage' who api's which will pass on
feed URL which is returning RSS data and
we want to format it to Jason so this
string is created from the Builder
oh hi sting nice to see you let me close
steam for now we're not playing at this
moment
sorry pilot so back to our get articles
for URL let's define an empty array of
articles which we will finally return
but we obviously first of all need to
make an HTTP call which is a simple get
call to the URL and we map that data so
we can change parts of it and we call
that jason and we already extract some
results because we know at which
position the data will be so it said
query results all right now let's use
another map because well we can and the
data we have here should be quite good
but just in case it's not for some
reasons we return the empty articles
array so we don't get any problems
inside our page once we use this we need
to go actually one level deeper here to
get the items and we want to shorten the
description so we define a length of 20
you will see why and let me copy in the
rest because I might it up
so here we have it so we go through our
objects with a simple for loop and we
get every item and from the item we take
the description and check if the length
is bigger than our 20 which actually
well yeah okay so we make a substring
from 0 to 80 so I think the links should
be 80 I'm not sure why I made this
before so otherwise we simply return the
item description for the description
finally we create a new feed item using
the description the item link the item
title and we push this item to our array
and finally we just return our articles
so this is everything for our feed
service which is actually the heart of
our app so let's continue with a home
screen and add some more information
there so home come on yes there we have
it let's start by importing view child
I'm not completely sure if we actually
yes okay I think we still need it like
this we need to get some navigation and
from ionic angular we want to import the
alert control as well and enough yeah
okay we got this and we need to import
two more things so we need the other
page the feed list page and we need the
service you see the red line in the
first version currently if you generate
feet list will not depend page so we
have to manually append feed list page
now it's correct we also import the feed
service and
feet here we got the component we got
our class we can add the view child
which will use the navigation so we can
better navigate from our side menu okay
we also got a root page which will be
the feet list page and we got an array
of feeds where we can actually use our
type feed okay
so inside our constructor we have the
nav controller we have the feed service
and we have the alert controller so to
add a feed the function is quite big but
it it's actually not doing that much so
let's go through add feed function first
of all we will create a simple alert
view and we will have two input fields
for the name and the URL once we hit
save on that box we can handle this data
to create a new feed object from that
data and call our feed service add feed
with a new feed and once this is done we
want to reload oh yeah sorry for that we
want to load our feeds again so let's
implement our load feeds yeah we got
some arrows on the left side that's fine
so we will use our feed servers in the
load feeds to get save treats and once
we get the data
we should have all feeds and you can
simply say this feeds equal all feeds we
will use this array inside our view very
soon so we got load feeds we also need
open feed
so once user select the feed oh yeah we
will yeah so that's a nice error
actually I know what this is doing so
let's continue once we click on a feed
in our side menu which we will create we
want to pass the information to the main
view so therefore we call our navigation
set route and we pass a feed list page
and also we pass some parameters and we
defined selected feed will have the feed
so we can catch this data inside the
feed list page later and we know which
feeds to retrieve finally we make use of
eye on view will enter high on view will
enter which will be called as you might
notice and the view enters and in that
case we want to load our feeds to
populate our list let's go to our home
HTML and let me replace the content with
something better okay so we define an
eye on menu and this part is the content
of the menu and this part is the root
page or the main content we see in the
main screen so at the top we simply have
recent articles and inside we have a
list of buttons which will go
over our feet and at the open feet to
every item below the list we also have a
new button to add a feed and that's
already everything so as you can see
nothing is loading right now and this is
because we haven't properly loaded the
stuff inside our app module ts so edit
this moment we need to load the feed
list page this might change in an
upcoming release of ionic but for now we
have to edit here and in the entry
component we also have a provider so
therefore we need to import our feed
service as well which should be in
providers feed service I guess and this
feed service need to be injected to the
provider so if we are lucky our app is
now more happy than before I think yeah
he's one more reload ok yeah that's good
news we also used where was it right it
was here we also use the storage which
is also provider so we need to add the
storage to the array of providers as
well the error messages are quite good
compared to angular 1 or ionic 1 all
right so we got the feed list we
actually don't see our button but I
think this is fine as we haven't defined
the feed list HTML which is this part
let's see if we can fix it very fast
yeah we should be able to do it like
this so inside the iron header we add
enough bar we add a button which has the
menu toggle and this will take care of
toggling the menu so we currently don't
have some title here but that's fine and
we can see this is our recent articles
side this is actually the home HTML and
this part so once we press add feet we
can add feed my feed and some URL and
you can see we have my feet appearing
here so we are fine up to this point
and we can continue with the actual
implementation of the articles view
which is the feed list HTML and the feed
list TS let's start with a feed list TS
so we need to import a few things here
let me copy it it okay so we got
component and we got the nut params
which will help us to gather the value
we passed from our where is it
yes from this set root read list page
selected feet feet we need to get this
information inside our constructor so
let me replace it with this our selected
feed
is obviously of the type feed we defined
it for this we also have an array of
articles and finally let's define a
loading variable no it's big boolean
come on so we can display a spinner
while making our HTTP requests to the
backend to the API sorry okay so inside
our constructor we are extracting this
selected feed and setting it now we will
use again the ion View will enter and
inside the ion view will enter we first
of all check if our selected feed is
really set so if it's set we want to
load the articles public load articles
and if it's not said we have some little
workaround we don't need this but well
why not this will get our saved feeds
check if we actually have one and if we
have more than 0 feeds we just take the
first one set it as the selected feed
and call load articles then so load
articles is now taking care of loading
or articles for a feed
first of all we set our loading to true
which will be used inside the view to
show the spinner then we can simply use
our feet service in call get articles
for URL which will be this that's
selected feet dot URL so you can see
it's nice to have this classes which
give me auto completion here
so I can be sure I'm using the correct
object
here we can actually use subscribe
because we are simply returning the HTTP
coil which is now handled like this so
we get some data at this point and this
data is already the correct formatted
data for our articles array and finally
we need to set the loading to folds to
hide the spinner again so there's one
function missing by now and this is to
open an article we pass a URL and
normally it would be done like this
using the in-app browser calling open
URL and blank but we're currently
testing this in the browser so this
won't really work and therefore we're
using it a bit different so we simply
call window open just to see if it's
working okay so this is the feed list
let's go to our HTML and let's complete
what we already started up here I simply
add title so if we have no selected feed
using ng if we show
newest articles otherwise we shall the
title of the selected feed which might
in this case be yeah my feet just like I
described it there and the iron content
is getting a class and we will make the
styling later and we add an ion spinner
which will only be displayed if loading
is true and now we are coming to now we
actually have one more fallback which we
can display so if no feed is selected we
display a placeholder
I think this won't happen now anymore is
I already
you have this beautiful feed but yeah
let's keep it like this
finally let me format it for you oh
okay so we got this ion list and this is
only displayed if we actually have
selected feed in that case we can
iterate over our articles at a click
event to open the link of the article
and the class and inside we're
displaying the title and the description
but the description is wrapped as inner
HTML of this element this just gave me
the best results for that all right we
are pretty close to finishing our app so
the last missing piece is actually
adding some CSS so inside the page feed
list I put in some CSS you can find the
complete code on my blog the link will
be below the video just also make sure
if there are updates to check out that
code but I hope again there will be no
breaking update so let's see hopefully
it's working by now this feed is
obviously trash so let's add this feed
let's see I think it's simply yes it's
def technique that come slash feed so
this is my RSS feed from the Deaf tech
tip blog we edit we select it we see the
spinner and we see the beautiful
articles from my blog you might have
noticed that we trim the description so
let's see if we now increase the size of
our view the description is actually
trimmed here this was just a random
value you can make it to fit whatever
you could leave it away whatever you
like but this is a
so we get I think 20 articles are coming
back from the Yahoo API and for all we
got the title and the description we
actually don't get the image which is
kind of sad but well I think this is
already a pretty good result I'm
displaying stuff here so finally if we
click on the link we're coming to the
ultimate ionic to cheat sheet make sure
to check it out if you haven't checked
it out and to share it on your preferred
network yeah just a short side note but
as you can see we got the feeds we got
the add function we can open feed so
this is everything we need for our
simple RSS feed reader if you like this
tutorial and want to see more ionic 2
tutorials or maybe ionic 1 tutorial that
