duck tactic today I will show you how to
create an easy image gallery using ionic
tube but first of all we need to install
a little package which will help us to
actually zoom into an image so we got
this ionic on this package on github
it's from this guy called Rylan so
thanks Riley and we can go ahead and
install it simply into our app so I've
already created a blink new ionic app
and I've also edit four images to our
assets image folder so we can display
those images inside our gallery now we
need to make two little changes to our
app module file so first of all we have
to import the ionic image view our
module exactly and we need to import it
up here to load the NPM package now
let's go to our home page so you can see
currently the pages empty that's not
really anything going on so for now we
add an array to our home page consisting
of the four images inside our assets
folder so we could even make it more
easy but for now this should work
alright
and number two okay so we got our image
array which we can now use inside our
view first of all we're going to use the
eye on slides component which works
pretty good
but is actually not exactly how we want
our image gallery to look you will see
so I will already give it a class
because we need to add some stuff maybe
we leave it to the blank version for now
so inside the slides we got the eye on
slide MD ng4 which will go over the area
of our images now finally inside the
slide we got the actual image and the
pass is assets IMG and then following
the name of our image this will later
also get a class for now I will keep it
like this so you see what's actually
going on maybe I can even move it side
by side wait a second okay we don't need
this I think so currently you can see we
got the image sliding and it's full
screen it also stops at the end so there
are a few things we can change first of
all we can set the loop equals true so
now if we hit the end of our array or
the beginning we simply start at the end
again so it's like an infinite gallery
now also we can add maybe I can show you
something quite cool
I inspected the component and found out
that you could even add something like a
cover flow you can see its core is not
perfect right here and with a shadow up
there but it's quite interesting how
easy you could add something like this
so we go with slides per view and we set
Omaha's slides per view to two Sundays
will give us a different image GT now we
got actually two images inside one slide
but still we cannot see a preview of the
following so now it's time to get into
our CSS and tweak it a little bit around
so we also want to have some padding
right there sorry
so every image should have some padding
at least but anyway still we're not
where we wanted to be and now we add the
I on slide swipe a slide and directly
modify the CSS for this and we move it
some percentage away from the left it
works pretty good I think right so the
component still thinks it has to display
two images inside but they are moved a
bit so everything fits quite good now
initially I also had with inside here
but I think it's
on not even need it anymore now we could
just achieve it by using this simple
trick and yeah it should work alright so
this is the first part of creating an
image gallery now to get a little
zooming image view the only thing we
have to add now is image viewer and now
the problem is it will come up but I can
actually not zoom inside this view so
now you would have to deploy to a
simulator but anyway you can already see
that the view is coming up just as we
want it to be and if you slide down you
even get this native like animation so
you can slide it to the bottom and it
will disappear again
so try around on your device it works
even better than inside the browser and
that's already all to create a simple
image gallery using ionic and a very
cool image viewer package so hopefully
this will be inside ion scroll very soon
but for now I think this is a very good
solution if you enjoyed this video make
sure to subscribe to my channel and if
you want more in depth training also
make sure to check out the ionic academy
and we will see us again next time
inside the deflected channel or the
academy forum so stay tuned and goodbye
