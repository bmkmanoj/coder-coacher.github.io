today I'm gonna show you how to
integrate the iOS game Center into your
ionic app and for this we will use
Cordova plugin you can find on github
and we will at leaderboard and
achievements so let's jump into and
start with a blank ionic
so I'm on a Mac and I'm gonna develop
this app for the iOS platform if you're
not using a Mac you won't be able to
build for the iOS and if it's done we
can already
and when this is done we can okay
so let's jump into the code
so what do we need we will have a button
to report a achievement we will have a
button to submit some scores and we will
have a button to go to the game center
and finally we will have a button to
reset our achievements
some styling that's enough so we had our
three buttons and we make just because
and the first one the chief score in
this will show the game alright now the
last one I mentioned was to reset it
this one triggered the set
so finally we're gonna add our
controller
and what we need is just scope so before
I continue at this point I just want to
make sure you have app already
registered with your iOS account so you
need to create one with your developer
profile generate a provisioning profile
and finally go to your iTunes Connect
and create a new app with your
provisioning profile and enable the Game
Center so we will come back to these
points but make sure to enable the Game
Center and make sure you copy your idea
which you sign to the app into the
config file of our Cordova project
otherwise okay so so first of all we
want to have some identification inside
our ionic platform ready function so for
this we will call the plug-in we edit
and it's very simple it's just game
center point off with a success
otherwise we won't see this anyway so
and so that's already saving everything
okay so next what we're gonna do is we
will copy this to is we will need them
here but let's go to our chief
so what do we want to do we want to
report an achievement to the iOS game
center so we get this tiny message from
the top saying yeah you achieved
anything and coming from very soon and
we need to set a percentage game center
again and say submit report okay that's
the same the score function we just want
to submit some score to our leaderboard
we created on iTunes Connect and for
this and we need
and what we do now is not reportage
evened but submit obviously okay it's
not very hard so the third one was to
show the game sander and we want to show
leaderboard so what we have to do is not
report or submit well as well as good as
ready set the game center game center so
that's everything
let's take a short look at my iTunes
Connect page so what I'm doing I added
an achievement and my achievement ID is
the objective game you can add some more
things like an image and points you will
run for this achievement and the other
part is we have this leaderboard section
in here and you have to add a
leaderboard so leaderboard and the ID
was leaderboards which is shown here and
if we go into that some things and
finally here we have a leaderboard name
which you can find in the show game
center
so if my tone saved everything we can
give it a try
and hopefully
must be some it's way to st. and there
it is yeah it's already you and this
Papa is coming from our game central
authentication here I'm going to type in
my details and we will try to login and
the game center says welcome back Simon
if this is not coming in your app don't
worry you can go to the settings game
center and scroll to the bottom of that
tab inside your iPhone or yes mute or
whatever and make sure to enable the
sandbox function so in that case you
will have to delete the app and open the
official Game Center app and log in and
then everything should work you can find
the help inside my tutorial on the
tactic or if you have any problems just
contact me so now everything should be
set up we are locked in with the game
center and now we can try to achieve and
yeah chief when completed perfect that
was exactly what we wanted
next we try to score something and if
you score something you won't get some
feedback but we can see it in the game
center if we click show game Center and
we see our leaderboard and me with some
points additionally we see the
achievements and that was just the
achievement with hundred points I
created on iTunes Connect and the last
point was to reset our game centre and
it's more or less for testing only so we
go back our achievements are zero of one
so there is
okay so I guess that it's all for now if
you have any questions contact me I
would be very happy if you follow me on
deaf tactic comm or on my youtube
channel which should get some more
videos in the next time and yeah see you
then and have fun with the ionic
framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
