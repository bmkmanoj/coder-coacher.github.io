deaf tactic with another video tutorial
on how to use angularjs filters for HTML
parsing so what we gonna see in this
tutorial is how to show HTML text or
links you got from an API like Twitter
or Facebook or so to be correctly
displayed in your angularjs F so I
already created a little a little app
with a yeoman tool you can read more
about the yeoman on my blog I would
recommend it it's really great so you
can see here's the link
well it's no link at all it's just text
you can't click it and it looks just
like this my HTML tags and it's just
displayed here so that's not what we
want it to look like we want to have it
a clickable link and this should open
your mail program or whatever and what
we're going to do is create a angularjs
filter and apply it to our text so the
first thing you need to do is create a
filter file and I'm gonna make it with
the yeoman
that will create the filters past your
ljs and now we have our file here so
this is the most general or easy way
easiest way to use a filter you have
some input and you return whatever and
the input and to use this filter we just
created you can just go where you're
using your scope variable and make a
pipe pass URL and spin the server back
up so yes the result pass your L filter
and the text we gave to it okay so
that's the general use of angularjs
filter now we want to we want some more
functions like we have now and for this
we need to install another angular
dependency called sanitize
which you should link in your index I'm
not sure yeah okay the Yeomen already
did that for me and obviously you needed
to include it into your angular module
at this point ng sanitized so now you're
ready to use it so let's go back to our
filter okay we don't want this okay so
we want to scan the text we give to our
filter and search for URLs or email
addresses so I already prepared two
regular expressions I don't want to
write them by hand now so you can see
them on my block general they just look
for HTTPS or whatever and some
characters and the email foreign it and
so on whatever don't yeah just look at
my blog okay so we have our function
here and we check now if the can say
text if our text match URLs so there's a
URL in it we say text equals text dot
replace and we want to replace the
string with power with a link to what's
inside
and obviously it should have the same
name so that's already the filter for
the UL the second one is if the text art
match emailed we want text equals
TxDOT replace emails we found with mail
to the email we found and obviously use
that and we're fine so what's that
problem
okay okay so the last thing to do is we
already replaced it but we must use some
escaping and there's another dependency
called SCE
angular string contextual escaping
so inject the dependency and we finally
return
SCE not trust as HTML our text so in
that way we trust our tokens inside our
text and yeah say that it they are safe
okay so we're returning already the
correct text now now the last thing you
need to do is go back to your HTML where
you're using your scope variable and do
it a little bit different P and this is
the function from the angular sanitize
so on that way yeah well it's a bit of
total stuff and whatever just use it and
you will see it will work
okay so we bring back up our server okay
so the same one is already correct the
first one not yet I'm gonna take a look
what's wrong
alright seems like I'm a little bit an
idiot
so everything inside our fill has fine
the problem was just I did not had HTTP
inside why are texts so my records did
not work so you should have a look at
what's your URL and what's your ex to
make sure everything working and as you
can see here's the link and here's the
mail
okay so that's how to pass URL inside
scope text or whatever you get from
wherever but there's another way to do
these kind of things and I would like to
present you the aterna tips so if you
just want to have it like this inside
you you you can take another way and
whereas my mage is yeah yeah so the
first option is to pass the pass URL
filter as a dependency here and just
call
URL filter with the text so that will
already apply the filter to the text and
sign it so okay yes as you can see they
are already replaced but obviously we
still need this sanitized so you need
that ng bind HTML and now the links are
correct so that is the first option you
can take or another more general option
is to just add the filter dependency and
at this point call filter and the name
of the filter and after that the text so
as you can see it it gets narrow because
there is only the name of it yes okay so
that is the second option you can take
and yeah it just depends what you like
what's your style whatever you want just
take what fits your needs so you learned
how to apply a filter and pass your HTML
to get beautiful links inside your text
and I would be very happy if you join my
youtube channel or follow my blog and
have a nice day goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
