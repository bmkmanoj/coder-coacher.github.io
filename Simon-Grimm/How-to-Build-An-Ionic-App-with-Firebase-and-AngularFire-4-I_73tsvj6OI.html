their technique and the ionic academy
today we will do the simple ionic app
and integrate firebase with the angular
fire package in the newest version which
is for in the first release candidate so
I've already started a blank new app
with ionic and I've also created an
ionic fire based project inside firebase
so I haven't changed anything there yet
first step is to install angular fire
with this release candidate currently
and the firebase package as well to our
app and once this is done we will also
generate an additional provider for our
firebase connection because I kind of
like to put all the logic into one
additional provider so to configure our
firebase connection we have to go to our
firebase app and click at firebase to
your web app and then you can simply
copy out this snippet and paste it to
your app module ts perhaps we will call
it firebase config so it's clear for
everyone and then we have to import a
few things so let me copy them in and
explain what we are doing okay so we
need the HTTP module very standard and
nothing special but now you can see that
there are different sub packages of
angularfire - and if you want to use for
example database you have to import this
specific database module if you want
authentication that would be in another
package as well but in our case we just
use those and also we need to call
angular fire module initialize app so
this is more or less like
in previous versions so we initialize
the angularfire module with the config
for our firebase app finally we also
have to add our firebase service down
here to power provided array and now all
the imports should be fine for now okay
perhaps I lied because I tested it but
we will delete it
we're not using authentication in this
example and therefore you have to change
your rules so you have read and write
access just for everyone in generally
you would be some authentication rules
but bypassing true we disable them so
everyone can read and write our data ok
our app is not giving any errors by now
which is kind of good so we can go ahead
and implement our provider what we need
here is of course the public AFD and
this is the angular fire almost database
not database module but the import is
more or less right so we need to put it
to our constructor as usual and then we
will have three functions inside our
provider first of all we want to get
shopping items so this will return a
list of items and then we will of course
have add item and finally remove item
with an ID so these three are our
functions and connections to the
database when we want to get our
shopping items we can call this dot aft
does list because it will be a list of
objects and then we only have to specify
at which node so we say shopping items
and all the tiles below shopping items
will be returned as an observed actually
we can remove
this as well now if we want to add items
we can use more or less the same because
the connection is the same but now one
to our list we call push with the new
name so a new item will be pushed to the
list and when we call push a unique ID
will be automatically created inside
firebase and we will see this in a
second finally if we want to remove an
item again we use the same reference
that now we call remove and simply pass
the ID for the object right here now we
can close all of this and go to our
actual home page and here we need our
public firebase service so it's the
firebase service here we will have a
list of shopping items which we will get
from our firebase service and this is a
firebase list observable so of course
the import is not working but you can
import it simply from angularfire 2
slash database so this 6 is our problem
now in our constructor we can now set
our shopping items to get shopping items
from our own provider and by doing this
we can keep everything clean and we will
have those references only in these
spots of course it's easy to simply use
firebase here and have the references
directly here but again it's a bit more
clean if you do it like this so here we
need as well add item and remove item
just like the functions we implemented
and to edit item we will have an input
field connected to a variable right here
which is new item and once we hit add
item we will call our firebase servers
and item and pair
this dot new ID so this makes it really
easy if you've implemented the provider
accordingly so again this firebase and
now remove item perhaps we pass the ID
through from the view okay this is
already our class and a lot of meetings
that now is to implement the view let's
see it's still compiling yeah that's a
very good sign so we go to our view and
we call it shopping list perhaps some
color here and inside the content we
will create simple ion list with items
and above the list we will create our
input where we distribute the space to
two columns perhaps the first column is
nine second can take the rest of the
side and here we'll add an eye on input
of the type text and it will be
connected through the ng model with our
new item and as a placeholder oh no like
this you shopping item okay and in the
second column we put a button nothing
fancy here we just want to make sure we
can add item and that's it now we can
already see our input and add stuff to
it
let me see looking a bit strange and
displays so I on call and call 9-1-1
I'm not sure lately some things tend to
Bro with my setup but whatever we got
the input field and we got the add field
so we should be happy right now yeah
whatever
whyever it looks so ok yeah of course
inside the eye on coal we could put an
eye on item which wraps our input and
then it looks a bit better now to the
list we want the option to slide our to
Deus or now to our groceries of the
shopping list to the side so we use eye
on item sliding which gives us the
option to add a sliding button to the
side
the most interesting part here perhaps
is the mg for loop where we go over the
items of our shopping items array and
this this is an observable we use the
add link pipes so everything should work
by using this now the item of this list
is simply the item dot value we haven't
stored an object as item in our list we
will see this inside firebase in a
second so we can just use directly the
value to get our sliding effect we now
add eye on item options and we pick the
side right so we can slide it in from
the right side again button eye on
button and this time the color should be
somehow red maybe only an icon and once
we click this we call remove item with
item dollar key so this was the value of
our item and now we're using only the
key to close this we need also an icon
so I on I can name we use trash and then
we got it so let's see now it looks a
lot better we type banana we have the
banana it appears in our list and at the
same time it appears right here so let's
add a few more apple whatever so we can
see inside our shopping items note we
got three child this is the key and this
is the value so what we used right here
the value is what we passed initially
and the key is the automatically
generated key from firebase now if we
slide the item to the side color equals
danger I'm not sure my world is red but
let's see okay now it's red
if we hit delete we can see that Ethel
gets removed from the node and also
immediately disappears from our list so
we can simply remove items by their ID
and we also got the ID here okay this
was quite a lot of information a very
short time but now you know how to
connect your ionic app to firebase using
angularfire and how to add and remove
items to a list using in your lab file

will see us the next time once again on
