tactic with another video tutorial on
how to display your Twitter feed inside
your ionic app and this time we will use
the ng Cordova Oh
our plug-in to make signed request to
the Twitter REST API and display the
Twitter feed of a user so let's start
with a simple blank app and we give it
an app name a Twitter feed so as I said
we need to include ng quote over once
our project is ready and we need this in
a browser plug-in to display everything
properly so we start with copy-paste
this and at the Cordova plugin and next
we will install the ng Cordova with the
boa package manager and additionally we
will install angular resource and save
it to our file come on
as we need the resource of angular to
make good calls through the REST API not
the simple HTTP way you will see it when
we use it so what ever take the newest
one okay so now we are set up and we can
go yeah we can go and tome once so okay
first of all we need to include those
things before the cordova includes so
add those things your ionic app they are
located on the lip ng quando dist ng
Cordova Jas
okay as I said we installed the angular
resource so we need to include that as
well take angular resource and angular
resource J s okay now we need a third
one so as I said we are going to use the
Twitter API and for Twitter we need this
che one or general dis signing so you
can go to the github page of this
project download it and once you have
downloaded it I already did you can go
to the source and copy that one so copy
the file into our lip folder www lip
obviously and now the files here so make
sure to include that one as well
okay maybe we put it before Cordova I'm
not sure if that's important so
currently we just have our fjs but we
will need a controller and we will need
a service so I already write it down we
will create the files soon so not here
obviously here we will have a
controllers file and we will have
services okay we can already Inc add
those files oh come on
control us and services okay so now we
got our have our controllers and our
services everything is fine
missing okay so next we're gonna add our
dependencies to our angular modules so
go to your angular module and after
ionic we need energy resource and we
need ng code over okay so let's go ahead
as we want to connect to the Twitter API
you need to make sure you got in Twitter
app so you can go to the application
management of Twitter and just create a
very simple app so in my case this is my
app scription website it's not very
important but the callback into L must
be set to localhost callback and as
Twitter does not allow to set this well
I just gave did well to tiny URL and
that's what came out so this is just
localhost callback so make sure you have
said this one afterwards you will need
the consumer key and the consumer secret
key so you can access those keys here on
your own app okay if you set up that app
we are ready to take it one step
further so as we want to connect the
rest API we will make a simple factory
called with us service and we need some
dependencies so we need Cadogan go out
and we need cordova or out oh come on
that's wrong our utility to make some
side requests and I'm not quite sure if
we even going to use this but a while
it's included and Q so that's our
factory first of all we make some
variables which we can then use in our
factory so the Twitter key is just yeah
whatever you want it to be that's just
for saving and accessing your stored
keys so that's not very important you
can leave it to that if you want so next
one is your client ID so your client ID
can be accessed on your Twitter
application management as I said before
and the client secret can be accessed
from that page as well I won't enter my
ones here because you should keep them
secret okay so some basic functions
when we have some key from the
authentication we want to store it into
our window dot local storage just
because it's easier to exit them from
there if the user once has accepted our
app and gave the permissions to it and
we will set it for the Twitter key which
we infuse I described
so Jason stringify
your data and everything will be saved
into your local storage and obviously we
need get start token just to grab our
token from our window local storage
nope okay you should make it clear so
that's fine for now okay
so third one is another general one but
it's one of the most importance from
this tutorial and this will be to create
Twitter signature for a given method and
URL okay in this function we want to
make an auth object and sign our
requests as Twitter require special
signing of requests so you can't just
send in a request and get something back
you have to do a bit more than that so
first of all we try to get our store
token
and next we will create an auth object
which will have some special things so
first of all it will have oils consume a
key that's just our client ID it has
some random created nuns and for this we
will use Cordoba or our utility create
nuns okay
we need our signature method
that's why we included those library
from github your online and now we need
the OAuth token of all my users so it's
the one we got from our local storage
and we need time stem yeah
Twitter is very clear man round okay
let's make a new date that brackets get
time divided okay that must be enough
brackets I guess yeah okay and finally
our version which we're using it's 1.0
so that's all object okay this object
now will be given to another function
from the cordova go out utility called
create signature I guess it was done by
Nick some weeks or months ago
so thank you Nick for this one and here
we give in our method URL our our object
empty object our client secret and
finally from the top we got from our
local storage the OAuth token secret
okay the last thing we need to do is on
the clock yeah nothing we need to do is
set our headers of our HTTP requests and
we need to set the authorization header
to our signature object dot
authorization zation header so now we
can make requests to the Twitter API
which will be signed correctly with some
yeah some useful things Twitter needs
obviously and that's one of the most
important things in this service okay
why is this read I have no idea well for
now let's just continue I guess is there
any problem I can't see no problem Jason
what's your problem
I don't know let's continue okay so
first of all we got
initialize function initialize and this
function will be called on our app
startup to check if the users already
authenticated and if not authenticate
the user so first of all we want to
return promise so we get Q defer and we
try to grab the total from our local
storage so if our token is not now we
just resolve our deferred so obviously
our user is already authenticated at
that point you could make sure in the
real app that the store tone is really
yeah that it's accepted by Twitter so
you can verify the tone
once you have grabbed it from there okay
in the other case we want to
authenticate our user and for this we
can just use Cordova or not all utility
Twitter and here we just given our
client ID and our client secret and
chain int the reserved
so hopefully the result were true we
just expected in our case and we start
our user total just in the result and we
resolve our promise yeah fine and we
will use error so if anything goes wrong
we should reject our promise okay so
that was that and finally we just need
to return our promise okay that was our
initialized function next one is
checking if the user is already
authenticated so our is authenticated
functional we'll just return if we can
grab total from the local storage so
if it's equal now the users obviously
not authenticated and if it's not equal
now we expect the user to be
authenticated okay and the last one is
the one we will really here or yeah use
from our controller it's the get home
timeline so in this function we finally
will set the timeline URL and you can
have a look at all those with a REST API
routes or whatever and see what fits
your needs so for this case we will just
use API dot Twitter calm us down line
dot a Jason and now we can just call our
cool create with a signature function
web get as we want to get those data and
our URL and finally we return a resource
object that's why we included angular
resource in the first place which we'll
call the home timeline URL and as we all
only need to get data we can already
call it query so
finally we just need to write down the
functions we defined above to access
them from outside of our service okay
come on
so I guess almost that should be all ok
so what's wrong with that one in here I
have no idea
missing no you need a semicolon there
we need just the factory and the service
well whatever you will see it when we
run it later on I guess so
that's a lot Twitter service for now
next thing we want to do is add a
controller so we start with a simple
controller which is called the app
controller and Google have function with
inside and oh maybe that one is missing
no it's pot luck waiting
well I'm not sure
so in our controller we need the scope
we need the ioniq platform and we need
our Twitter service okay so well we can
start with a the ionic platform ready
function in which we will just check if
our user some completion is out and
ticketed and if that's true we will just
start our no it will
okay so here we will call function which
will fill our time line feet
okay and this one's very straightforward
just call the Twitter service and get
all timeline perfect so if the user is
not authenticated we need our Twitter
service and call initialize and then
Google check if our result is true so
the user was authenticated correct and
then call scope show home timeline we
want to handle the error case here
because yeah whatever you can do that in
a real application okay so for now our
controller should be Oh No well there's
some things we need to include already
so one thing is the date from the
Twitter service is very unformatted and
for that we need to correct the time
string and we will do that with a very
simple function and just return a new
date
and past e-string we get from Twitter so
we will call that from our view make
correctly and the very very last thing
we need to do is we will have a
refresher in our views so we can add the
port refresh which we'll call the do
refresh in our controller and that one
will do just show hometown' line and
well we could make it then and stuff
like that but for the scope of this
article we will just broadcast the
finish event right after we call that
one so you need to broadcast scroll dot
refresh
complete so the pull to refresh will
disappear okay that's our controller now
the last thing we need to do is show the
feeds inside our view so go to our index
set it where's my title whatever
my Twitter feed so we need to assign the
ng-controller to this one which is our
app controller and we need and ion
content with some class set - it has a
header and some padding is always good
and the first thing we're going to add
is our ion refresher just because it's
very simple just add ion refresher and
set on refresh we want to call our do
refresh function okay so if we're not
having any feeds right now we want to
show a simple message
so make a div with ng show and we check
for our home time line equals zero so in
that case we will display loading tweets
okay now to the heart of our view this
will be an NG repeat over all the
content we get so it will be entry in
home timeline and we will use the ioniq
cards so make it list card okay so
inside as I said we want to have some
cards and we will set an item avatar on
our card which will have an image which
we get from our entry so you can have a
look at the response from Twitter and
see what you can use from all those
things so in that case we use the user
dot profile image URL
and after the image we want to set the
header of our card which will be and
read out use a dot name very simple and
we want to set the time string so we
make the correct time string the
function we implemented into our
controller and give it the entry dot
created and and we will apply a filter
to that one that's just angular default
stuff so it looks good okay so that's
the item avatar and now we come to the
item body which will which will hold our
message
yeah we can just say entry the text
surrounded
what and finally I wanted to add the
image of the article
so sometimes tweets have an image and if
that's the case so ng if entry dot X
tendered n TT es if that once said we
will set an image to the entry dot
extended entities dot media at position
zero dot media URL okay Stanley Singh
one and we need to fit it to our views
so that the width to 100 so that should
be fine okay
so we close our and if I guess we're
white done is that one yeah the
ng-repeat needs to be closed as well so
now we are fine okay so for you now you
can include your client ID and secret ID
and launch your app so I will do that as
well and come back once my app is loaded
so in fact I had some little typos in
services here because I did not bright
Oh so if you're copying this make sure
to also go to my blog and check out the
source code from there and add this
module to the services and controller
and I had some typos here I guess so
if you've done everything correct you
can go ahead and at the platform you
want to build for so I'm going to make I
will add the iOS platform so prepare the
iOS platform and finally we can run our
app so we expect to get a login view
inside our app on startup and we should
be prompted to enter our Twitter
credentials to grant permission to our
app we created on Twitter and finally
see our tweet so here here is our app it
already started and because we have the
our authentication shake in site our
ionic platform ready function we are
requested to enter our credentials so
I'm gonna enter my credentials now and
and we will see what happened okay now
let's see what's happening you authorize
the app and we get redirected to our app
and we see some feeds inside our app
awesome right yes
and finally we got our ionic pull the
Refresh feature up here so we can pull
it down and it will reload the tweets
and if there's anything new it would
appear up here so that's our Twitter
feed inside our ionic app I hope you
liked this tutorial it was very long for
a video tutorial but you can also check
out the complete text on my blog or on
the ionic blog and if you like this
leave me a comment or tweet me something
and I would be very happy if you follow
my yeah if you follow my channel on
YouTube because there will be much more
videos in the future
so thanks for listening and have a nice
day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
