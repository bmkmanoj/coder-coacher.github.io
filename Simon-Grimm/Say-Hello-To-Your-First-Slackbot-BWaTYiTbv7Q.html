Death dekhti today with a video tutorial
on how to create your first slack bot so
first of all what is slack slack is a
simple communication tool to chat with
your complete team if you use it at your
work you might know it it's really
amazing it has gotten a lot of attention
in the last time so go to select comm
and create a new team if you have not
done so and once you have done this you
should be able to log into your team you
should see your channels and well in
general you should have it ready so and
then we want to create but which can
react to things we say in those channels
so we want to say hello and the but
should react with something so it's not
really hard but it's a bit tricky so
follow my tutorial okay first of all we
need a little server so first of all
let's create a package Jason okay I
already copied this I think all right
so here it is we have a name for our
package this is a node.js package and we
have a main file and we have some
dependencies here declare you can find
all those things also on my blog so if
this is too fast just go there
additionally we want to have one fjs
which will be our server
and there are some things we have to set
up before we can actually start with our
BOTS so we'll be an Express server we
have a simple body part
I'm not even completely sure if we need
this for this tutorial but it's fine and
we obviously get our app and we want to
run on whichever port we get from some
environment variables or on this epic
special port so now we can use our body
part that we created and set some well
in code oh is this right I hope so
URL and code URL and coded this way all
right
first any problem no I don't think so
if use body parse or URL encode it
alright next we make a simple testing
route so you know your servers running
and everything's fine if you're already
experienced with node and simple server
you don't have to do this this is
nothing we need for our bottom but it's
always good to have some sort of health
check
right and finally our app needs to
listen to incoming requests on our part
and to be sure listening on port alright
okay so that's base of our simple server
we need to install our module sir on NPM
install which will create a folder
called node modules and this is quite
fast so go ahead and type node fjs which
will start the server and it listens on
port 1 3 3 7 ok you can test it so it is
local host on 3 3 soon and there it is
so everything works as expected right
now now we come to our dot so this but
we'll listen on a post request to slash
hello
and once we receive a request we can
actually get the username from this
request because this will come from
slack and the body will contain the name
of the user so then we create a simple
JSON response which we can send back to
slack which just contains the text
saying hello whoever called me welcome
to the deck take slack channel f-fun
alright I hope all those things until
here are very clear so now when you just
need to return this but I experience
that there's let's say a little problem
because somehow you can fall into an
infinite loop which is not that funny if
you have desktop notifications enabled
and slack
so it will just blink the whole time
until you can shut down your server
finally so please add this if statement
or tell me how to prevent this case
otherwise
yeah sorry alright so if this is not the
select pot calling this function we can
return our payload we created here okay
I hope this is clear so far
nothing special right now now we need to
deploy our server somewhere in the
internet because when we just launched
this one local slack won't be able to
contact it so what we gonna do is we
want to upload our simple slack bot
server to Heroku I don't know if you
know this I already got this up here
it's really easy to power up machine
there and so if you want this please
sign up for free it's really really
great and also make sure to install the
Hiroko tool belt which we will use to
upload our app this is really amazing
fast and yeah it's free so use it
otherwise if you have any other server
you can use that one as well so just
make sure you can upload and start your
server somewhere okay we need to create
this profile same node app and this file
will tell Roku to start a web context
and use this command to init our app
nothing more at this point all right
we're in our folder you can stop it and
now we need to call get in it because we
need to push this as the repository to
hiroko so get in it
get a dot adding the folder get commit
whatever you want to say and now the fun
begins
Oroku create which is come on okay well
in that case let me fix this all right
so I deleted some like they want me to
so now we can create it okay it's edit
and now we just need to push our master
to Heroku and let's wait what happens so
first of all it gets uploaded and once
this is done we will see or hopefully
see the output from Hiroko which will
start a new context yes the node fjs is
detected creating a runtime environment
doing a lot of things the build
succeeded and finally this is the URL
you need to copy and as you can see
we're receiving our hello world so if
this working you're almost finished now
the last thing we need to do is we need
to go to our settings for our select
team and select integrations then scroll
down to outgoing web hooks and add an
outgoing web hook there are other ways I
know but for this simple tutorial this
is really fine and all we need okay so
now we can select what we want we want
to listen to any channel so all the
messages are somehow filtered and once a
line start with hello we want to call
our hero
Kosar and use the post route we created
called hello okay you can give it a name
it's obviously Kundalini and it's also
obviously where is it my favorite one
there the ghost okay I guess this should
be everything we need right here so if
you go to configured integrations you
should see your outgoing web book okay I
obviously did not yeah I did not save so
again sorry
blah blah blah the Kundalini somehow the
icon is still saved interesting okay
whatever
no problem by now it should be
configured hopefully yes when a message
starts with hello we make a post to our
hero who app perfect let's give it a try
so I go to a channel wherever I am this
is me and I say hello all good morning
and instantly our Kundalini but says
hello Simon welcome to the Deaf tactics
lecture and laugh fun and as you can see
this was really fast and really easy I
know this is not a big deal right now
but you can do a lot of things and you
can optimize your complete processes
using slack and integrations and pots
and let me end this video with some
marketing I'm currently working on the
course called mastering slag so go to
deaf technique calm / choral / mastering
