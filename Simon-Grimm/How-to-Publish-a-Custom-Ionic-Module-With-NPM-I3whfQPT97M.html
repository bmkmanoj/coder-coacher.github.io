deaf tactic and in this video I will
show you how you can create a custom
ionic module so this means you've
previously installed modules using NPM
into Europe but this time we will
publish our own NPM package and
therefore we start today with a blank
folder and no I own a project and go
ahead by creating a package.json file
and inside that file we need quite a few
things so you can find all of this in
the article link below this video
I named my package ionic Academy package
and this is already published so I will
just make an update once we're done here
so the word and gives the version
description then the main in typing x'
is the in the entry point of your
package basically and we will create
these files in a second also our files
will be in a dist folder but the NPM the
run script will create our distro love
for us so we basically give this in
right here also we get this published
package script which runs the NPM run in
the end and also npm publish so for this
command to work you need to have an NPM
account but you can go to NPM j/s calm
and easily create an account for free
and perhaps you need to log in on your
command line then but then you can
publish packages without any problems so
a repository can be specified if you
have one than some more general
information and then the DEF
dependencies for our app and if we save
this we can now already run npm install
which will create the node modules
folder inside our folder I added those
dependencies because we will use this in
an ionic
so we should have access to ionic in the
module and also the general angular
stuff which we need for the module and
components and so on
alright that's the package Jason and the
second file we need is called TS config
Jason or is it there this file is
already included when you start a new
ionic app it's basically a configuration
for typescript and how to transpile
types with what to exclude so this is
just general information we need here
okay this is the basic setup a packet to
Jason and the TS color
now the actual custom module begins so
first of all we create a new folder
source and in this folder all the code
will live inside we create two more
folders provide us and components so
more or less why do I don't have an icon
here I don't know more or less like you
know it from ionic but of course we
don't have the CLI available right here
so let's create a provider which we can
use in our app later let's call this
Academy provider the TS and inside we
first of all import the injectable from
an angular core and if the import work
we also don't get any red lines anymore
so just like you know it from an
injectable we create this one export
class CAD Amir provider and this
provider will have one function reason
you join and this will basically return
a string so the ionic academy makes
cross-platform great again whatever we
just want this one provider of course
you can have a lot more in here I just
want to demonstrate how you can create
this provider and use it later on so for
now we will leave the provider as it is
and create a new component and let's
call this Academy component dot TS and
let me bring in a bit because it's not
worth to type all this now the problem
with the components is that they
currently can't have an external HTML
file so therefore we have this inline
HTML which consists of a few ion had are
enough path stuff I have content and a
button which also has one action to
leave the page and the same counts for
CSS we also need those inline styles but
then we can go ahead and create our
component just like we're used to it and
then specify the information so normally
this is already done by ionic but we can
do this on our own as well we can
specify a template which is our HTML
template and we can define styles which
is an array of styles and in this case
we just have the one alright finally
export class Academy component and now
the logic for the class so let's have a
constructor with a private enough
controller from ionic and open close and
then one function which we are using in
the page called leaf page and we call
enough controller pop so simply to leave
our page again and that's already enough
now we can present this page from our
ion ik app web
we include this package okay that's for
the general code and now we have to make
sure to export all of this and first of
all we create a new file called in the
XTS now we use this one inside our
package Jason and here we need to export
everything and we need one more file as
well which is then our module so let's
call this ionic Academy dot module dot
TS because we need to export this one as
well so ionic Academy module export from
components slash come on please
autocomplete
come on what's wrong Academy component
and finally export everything from
provider slash Academy provider okay
that's our export file it is fine this
will be green once we finished our ionic
Academy module so let's finish this by
writing the module and I will bring in
the imports so we need energy module
from angular core we need our component
and provider and we also need the ionic
module because we've used right here
those elements from ionic and if we
don't import the ionic module you will
get an error that the selector is
undefined so let's create our NG module
it looks like you're used to it from the
ionic app module will imports
declarations
and exports so standard ionics not ionic
angular stuff of course so for the
imports as i've said we need the ionic
module otherwise our selectors won't
work for the declarations we need to
declare our Academy component and we
also need to export the Academy
component
and finally for the export class we've
right ioniq Academy module so here we
export the actual module and we create
this static four root function I think
you've seen this one before when you use
the ionic storage for example and here
we use module with providers wrapped
around module that also includes
includes the providers so this is the
return type and then we return our new
ng module which is basically the module
above so this one looks a bit strange in
here but it's correct and for the
providers of this module will provide us
you can have an array of the providers
and we only got the Academy provider
we've provided up here okay basically
that's how you create a custom module
you need to set up your package dayson
to point to the right files and typing's
and stuff like this
then you create your components
currently with inline stuff and provide
us just like you used to it we could
also have HTTP requests in here then you
export everything and create the module
with all the information of your
components and provide us and once
you're done you can run let me just give
a look ok npm run publish package so if
you call npm run it will always look for
something in the script and we got
published package here which will then
run npm run built and published and you
can see i get this message so not a lot
of code here but we see the dist folder
and we see this message so hopefully my
package was deployed let's take a look
at npm j/s yes I can see I already got
an email and this one was zero zero
- and let's refresh lives now it is 0:03
i also entered the github repository
which i somehow messed up the link so I
need to fix this as well
and I haven't created a read meme which
is also kind of wrong I think I have a
readme file but ok it's in a different
folder I guess anyway our package is
ready and we can now install it and let
me bring in this second app here
so I've already installed nope nope I've
already installed the package in a new
app but previously I had used the zero
zero two words so let's install the
latest version npm install the name of
the package and then not updated ok
perhaps it works like this should work
at least ok should be fine now if you go
to your node modules somewhere whatever
the name of your package was ionic
academy package and there you will see
all the information about the package
you've just created with imports and
stuff like this and now the interesting
part how to include this you basically
go to your app module and from here you
can import the module you can import the
provider and the component the module
goes straight to the imports where the
other modules are and the component goes
to the entry components because we don't
have any lazy loading created in here so
we need to list those in entry
components and the providers just like
we're used to it inside providers and if
we now want to use the package in a
simple ionic page we can import both
provider
and listed in our constructor like we're
used to and we can directly use the
component to push it right here and here
we retrieve some information from the
provider and here we can see the HTML
for this view basically shows the
information and the button to trigger
the action and the information is
displayed may cross plot from great
again and if we hit show component the
whole page is now covered by our custom
component welcome to the special ionic
Academy module and if we close this page
we even use the same enough controller
from there to go back to our app and our
custom ionic module is now completely
included and working and now you can go
ahead you can always change your package
again you can update it you can add the
github page the readme and simply invite
other people to collaborate on your
ionic package which is now a custom
module if you enjoyed this tutorial make
