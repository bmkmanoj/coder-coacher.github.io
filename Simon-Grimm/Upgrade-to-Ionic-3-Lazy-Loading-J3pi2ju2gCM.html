ionic Academy today we will take a look
at how to easily upgrade our ionic 2 F
to ionic 3 so I've already started with
a tub template and created a simple I
only - EPS so we see a home screen we
see about screen a contact screen and
from the code side we also got a custom
component and let's see we can actually
zoom in a bit so you can see the code
better okay so we got a custom component
which is used inside our home HTML and
this looks like HelloWorld
very simple component and also only
about screen we got a pipe so we got our
custom pipe here and we will now start
with our ionic 2 project and see inside
our package Jason that we are currently
still on angular 2 X and ionic also not
updated by now
so the first step now is to upgrade our
dependencies I will copy these and you
can find them in the related article
more or less it's about updating these
two fields so dependencies and dev
dependencies I've copied in some or all
of them if you have other dependencies
or need specific versions make sure to
check that but basically we're updating
all the angular stuff to 4.0 we're
updating ionic angular to 3.0 or one and
the rest is also updated a bit so if
you've done this go ahead and remove
your node modules folder and call NPM
install to again install your
dependencies we can leave this for now
so this will install in the background
now with ionic 3 we got this lazy
loading we want to implement this means
we don't use all
of our pages here inside the
declarations and the entry components
because they will be loaded in time just
when we need them so first of all we can
start and remove almost all of the pages
we have imported here and also the
custom component the pipes all that
stuff can be removed as well we can also
remove of course the import for the
pipes of components and pages and we
leave all of this to only import my app
which is defined inside app components
so we will take care of this in a second
now what we need to do is for all of our
pages we need to create a new file and
this will always have the structure of
the name dot module dot PS and this file
looks almost everytime the same I'm
currently using this so this is a tough
page I guess yes this is the top page
and we import the test page we declare
the test page we export it and we export
the class if you're currently using the
generate command at the time of writing
this you will end up with a new folder
with this module file but only ionic
module so in that case make sure to
change it to ionic page module and also
appear to ionic page module there's a
common error and hopefully this is
already removed at the time of recording
this ok so now we've created this module
file for our tabs and we need to create
the same file for home contact and about
as well I will skip this for now and
move on to the next stage let's see we
are already installed
and yeah everything failed so don't be
scared in the beginning we will handle
it okay
now in our app component we now actually
don't need to import the tops page
anymore because what we will do is we
will simply use it by the name so this
is enough to let ioniq know it should
load the top stage and ioneiy below it
up and find it right here we type it
correctly like this and find it inside
our tabs module okay perhaps I should
restart my loading so maybe the changes
were a bit too much for IO mnek in the
beginning yeah of course
it has air perhaps I should save my
package.json before I actually remove my
node modules and to install them again
but we can call it again in the
background and continue because another
thing we need to make additionally to
creating this module file is adding
another decorator called ionic page and
we also need to import our decorator
from ionic core so we import from ionic
angular now this in combination with the
Topps module is now enough to make sure
that I only know about our page and can
connect everything you can already see
that we got three more tops here and
just like before we can go ahead and
change all of them to be strings and
remove all of the imports we got up here
we don't need them anymore let's see we
got this we got that installing and
now we can actually start again let me
just create the other files as well okay
so I've created all the needed files
like our about module the contact module
the home module and all of this follow
just the same approach like we had
before importing the page declarations
import/export and everything's fine now
currently it is complaining about ionic
native because I also changed from ionic
and native to to ionic native three with
ionic native three we only got this core
package and like a splash screen start
is bar which are normally included in
the beginning inside your app components
here has changed a bit so if you're
updating this as well make sure to apply
these changes as well so now we are not
importing it from ionic native anymore
but from these packages so all of the
features are distributed in their single
sub package and this will help to
decrease the size of your app also when
using it here of course make sure to
edit to your providers now as well and
hopefully our app is now somehow
starting or giving us another error
because upgrading your app will more or
less be yeah will include some errors
and if you see them now you might find
it quite useful for you as well so I
don't know my my reloading currently is
a bit I don't know out of place and not
working every time so not all the errors
you see are really errors but let's
continue so we get our our modules ready
and inside our home when are using this
custom component but at our home module
is not really link inside app module
anymore it has actually no chance of
knowing about our custom component
and also of course an error you can make
quite easily is forgetting to add the
ioniq page decorator right here so we
should do this now
ionic page and make sure to import it as
well always ionic page okay so about
contact home everyone has the page
decorator okay perfect now we get
another one ever rarer okay
so for whatever reasons you know like
this by now of course because we should
use the lower case which we have
imported in our constructor up here
through the injection and reloading and
seeing the next error okay so this is
actually new one you see template parse
error custom is not a known element this
is what I was talking about this element
or this custom component cannot be known
to this component so now we have to go
to our components and inside the
components we create a new file as well
and we will call it components modules
dot TS let's copy this inside this
components modules TS we now want to
import our component and export it so
the rest of the ionic app knows about it
so inside the declarations we can put
our custom component and you see it will
be imported right here and we put it to
export and inside the import we leave
everything empty and this is just our
components
you now if we import this components
module at the top of our app it actually
doesn't work at the moment I'm not sure
if it should work I'm not completely
sure about this but what works is using
this components module inside the import
of the module where you need it so let
me show you we import the components
module right here inside our home
because in the home HTML is the place
where we used the custom component so
now we get a new error I own card header
is not a known element I think for some
reasons that my ionic is not really
installed very fine at the moment but
let's continue for a second
as you've seen for other components with
a component module we also got the pipes
and we do just the same right here so
create a pipes module dot TS and again
I'm a bit lazy let's copy this to the
pipes module but of course now we don't
want to export this but our custom pipe
so import-export and this is the pipes
module again the pipes module won't
really work at the top of our apps so
importing it up here is not working but
we have used it
I don't know on about screen I guess
here it's where we use our custom pipe
and again this is the place go through
the module import your pipes module and
hit save now let me fix these random
errors for second actually I learned
something new while recording this video
so for your component
modules TS you also have to import ionic
module inside the import if you don't
import this you can still use like
standard HTML but if you use ionic
components like I only card in my
example you need to make sure to import
the ionic module right here after this
just like before
import it to your page and everything
works again just like before our pipe is
working inside the about page because we
import the PAC module and we now have
lazy loading in our app or declarations
and entry components are fine if you
have your own providers they are still
added like normally so you don't need
any special module for this but make
sure to create for your pages the module
for the pipes pipes module and for the
components the components module if you
need any more help make sure to check
out the according quick win on the ionic
Academy and also if you want more ionic
training make sure to check out the
ionic Academy so thanks for listening
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
