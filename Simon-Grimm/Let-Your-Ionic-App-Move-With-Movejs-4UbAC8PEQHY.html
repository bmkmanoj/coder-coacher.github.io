today I'm going to show you how to make
cool animations with a simple JavaScript
animation framework called move J s
inside your ionic app and fo we're going
to start with simple blank ionic app and
we can give it an app name move it so
the move j s is on github so you can
download it you can't install it by a
boa so we have to download it and copy
the needed files into our directory so I
already downloaded it so take this move
into s and copy it to your uww lip
folder okay fine so what we're going to
do is we'll add some small animations we
will move some buttons we will add some
padding and everything just with our
move j s framework so here's the file
I'm a bit lazy so I'm gonna copy this
and add it just before the end of our
body don't forget to add lip for it
I'm not sure why this is not working in
the head but maybe you can guys can tell
me so here we got our app and we will
add a class to our ion content no
painting today
and what we need for the move tray has
to work is we need to give some IDs to
elements so we can use angular or
document.getelementbyid ease so I'm
gonna already adhere and and cheap and
our ng controller which will be the app
controller and why not give the head of
our ID error
who knows yeah I know and inside our ion
content we will have some buttons just
what you give it the ID buttons and
we're going to add three buttons
use the stable ones and add some click
actions to it which will obviously
implement in our control later so I'm
very easy I'm going to copy this three
times and remove the useless ace here so
the first bungle and you made our
visuals the second one will move our
buttons therefore move me and the third
one is going to make the a ground link a
bit so this one's blink okay so for now
this is fine and let's go to our fjs
obviously we need a controller which is
our app controller and we need to scope
injected so first one was scope dot move
buttons and now we make use of these
document.getelementbyid watch I already
told ya so document dot get element by
ID and the ID was buttons of our buttons
div ok so now we got our buttons and now
we can call move which is to start for
calling the move J s and just give it
our buttons element and now we can make
some animations or things I will come
back to that later
what you can do with that so for now
let's ease this specifies how our
animation is going to take place and
what do we want to move our salon and
how long about 0.5 seconds and we need
to end our animation well at everything
for move buttons so we'll increase the
value by 200 in a in our animation in a
duration of 0.5 seconds great next one
any made visuals continue with our next
function the animate visuals and for
this we will get another element and
this is the content BG and will as well
get our header
I love code completion definitely so and
again google call move and we will start
with our background and we will set the
padding to 10% my beep might be fine for
a duration of let's say two segments and
now we come to a bit new point we not
just call end but we will call another
function inside our end which will also
call move but on the header and we will
set the background color to whatever I
take the b6c and let's also make it the
duration of two things now we just call
and so that's calling another function
in the end of the first one it's a bit
yeah I like it it's easy but it just
works so the third one was our blink
function
oh come on just hint go away I don't
like you and we will again get our
background and here we will have a
little trick so well I start with the
first one we want to highlight and we
save this in a variable our background
we want to set the background attribute
to tell you I obviously know and we want
to make it for a very short duration 0.2
seconds and now we come to the chaining
of the move TS framework so we call then
which we need to fill and end and now we
can give another move function to then
so we can now make another one and
define it before our second one and we
will call it highlight back because we
want to highlight our background back
into the color it had initially so we
will set the background back to
this again duration very short 0.2
seconds and here we can just call it and
now we can take highlight back and give
it to them
so inside so they are chained and when
highlight is done highlight back will
just be called pretty cool very easy so
for now this might be working so I own a
platform and iOS because I'm on a Mac
and I'm gonna test this on the iOS
simulator if you're not developing on a
Mac you obviously cannot build for iOS
so we prepare iOS and for you run
it's late in the evening so meanwhile we
can take a look at the move J s side
which is just a simple example page of
what you can do with it and we will take
a look again at data so we're so
simulate we can go full size
so here are three buttons nothing
special for now and start with the third
one oh very nice
blinking effect of our background
awesome just awesome so easy okay
our first point was the content or I'm
not sure let's see what hands yeah this
one obviously made a 10% heading to our
element and in the end we called to set
the background color of our header okay
and the last one should move our buttons
200 pixels or whatever down and it works
great so this was the first part of our
tutorial now we will make something well
a bit more useful than these three
things so for now we will add a timer
which will just time and count up and
add the little animation so what we're
going to do is add another button inside
our array of buttons and this one will
call our time or function which we need
to implement obviously and
below these buttons we will have another
dip with some styling you can just copy
that from my blog just visit the page I
will write it under this video so let me
just type in some things
as this is a very easy tutorial I put
all our things inside the element which
hero should obviously not to appear
making any real apps or yeah using it
somewhere else should always edit to
your style but for now I'm very lazy and
finally we add ng cloak
so our timer inside won't be shown if
it's not initialized and when it's
neutralized we will just set it to
hidden or whatever so ng cloak makes
sure we're not have this blinking like
we have time or something like that and
that would just suck but we will have
for now another dip inside which will
have by timer so and here we have the
time okay perfect
that's it for now okay our index is
ready let's head over to our fjs and we
will need to add another dependency here
which is the time allowed okay so we
edit a function
implemented was the time of function and
here we will set our time to zero and
after this we will smoke time timeout
and we will call the timeout with
function we will soon implement and zero
because when we want to start our timer
we want to yeah started instant so here
we have our on timeout function on timer
time out function and we just need to
increase our time
oh why let's make a tiny check for well
if you start at the timer you don't want
to restart it or you get some strange
behavior well it's a it's a short thing
that case we cancel our
just a small thing
so in our on time out we will try to get
our element code completion and we call
it my timer so again we call move on our
timer and this one's going to be a bit
more we want a snap effect you can take
a look what's the snap on this page we
get here this rose snappy effect so
watch it it just snaps very fast to one
direction and we want to set the opacity
to one and we want to scale so get
bigger and we want all of this to be
done pretty much instant because that is
the beginning of our timer so a new
number should always step up become
visible and scale to a bigger size and
what we're going to do as well is call
this move again or you can play around
with those snap out an hour or whatever
whatever fits you need so we're going to
move the extra value 150 to the right
and we rotate our element
let's say 140 degrees and we scale it to
very small size and we said or it's a
lot set our path the t20 as we are
fading out of this one
with a duration of well one second is
fine and now we can call our end and
what we finally need oh yeah and this
might be 0.1 so finally we need our time
a time out to be call again a time or
one and it should call our on time a
timeout function again in one second
this makes sense I hope so
I'm not sure if this one should be above
this one I'll just make that and now we
run it again so as I said you can have a
look at all those examples moving more
moving
moving to the left rotate changing
colors translating to whatever move
where whatever you like screw it and
scale it and whatever you like so it's
coming back to our time I here we got
our diff and if we press timer our time
I should start hopefully yeah well
that does not look like it should look
so if we made a small buck and I fixed
that one to ease out it was just a tiny
typo so we can call ionic run iOS now
and again you can have a look at all
those implementations here it's not very
hard
it's about chaining calling a function
in the end calling the delay and all
stuff like that it's very lightweight so
yeah I encourage you to use it and now
finally let's try our timer and see yeah
that isn't epic animation don't you
think so well this is timing up I have
to say goodbye this is the end of the
tutorial and if you like this come to my
blog turf tactic or follow me on YouTube
although I might not have that much
videos by now more will come
so will more articles come on my blog so
stay tuned I would be very glad if you
liked this tutorial and leave a comment
or tweet me something goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
