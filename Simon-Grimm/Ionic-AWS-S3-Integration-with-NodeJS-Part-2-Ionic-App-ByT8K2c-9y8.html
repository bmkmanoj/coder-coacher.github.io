from deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy
this is the second part of our short
video series on uploading files to AWS
using ionic in the first part we've
created our little backend and if you
haven't done so make sure to check out
the video the link should be below this
video so now we are ready to upload
files to our s3 storage and we can start
with our ionic app so I've started a
blank new ionic app and first of all I
go ahead and install the camera plug-in
and also the file plug-in which we need
later on to upload or capture images
okay it's quite nice of the ionic CLI
recently that it always asks you to
update automatically so I will just go
ahead with this so as I said we need the
camera to capture images and we also
need the file plug-in to resolve the
local path to an image so we can append
that information to the put request we
will perform to Amazon so after using
the NPM package make sure to add both
plugins as well and also note that from
now on you can only of course try those
things on a real device or simulator so
those functions won't work inside our
browser additionally I created a new
provider which we will use to handle all
the connection to our back-end and I
will still bring up the lab because it
will show me if we made an error
somewhere so first of all we need the
HTTP module HTTP module from
angular HTTP and then we get our app
ready let me bring it in so we can check
from time to time if we made any error
so the HTTP module goes right below here
HTTP module and the provider is
automatically already added but we still
need the camera from add ionic native
camera and also we need the file of
course big file from as well at i/o
nickname file and make sure to add
camera and file to the array here as
well and now we're good to go and can
start with our AWS provider so let's
remove this we don't need that first of
all let's define our API URL which is
currently localhost so go ahead and use
the one you got in my case it's right
here if you deploy it to Hiroko make
sure to change this one of course if you
run it locally this should work for you
so now we need to implement a few
functions here so one is get signed
upload request and this is the first
step here we got the name and a type of
a file and this is to get the signed URL
where we can make a put request to here
we can simply return this HTTP GET and
now a bit crazy syntax let's give it a
try so we use our API URL and followed
by the past
to sign and then we have the parameters
file name which is one of our variables
and then we also get the file type
hopefully no typo here file type and
this is type and then we need to map
this funny stuff perhaps in the next
line just like always to Jason okay so
we construct the URL losing using
localhost and a slash here to AWS sign
and we append higher name equals our
name and file type equals our type the
URLs can be found right in our server so
this is our first route right here okay
the second one is we want to be able to
get a file list from our back-end and
this will return an observable of the
type array and so sometimes I add the
return values here because our eye on ik
functions will be happy then
and of course we're currently not really
returning anything so let me copy this
in because it's a bit much so now we do
a request again to our API URL to files
we map it to Jason and perhaps I can
show you this if we make a request to
files our result looks like this and we
only want this content array with the
stuff that's in key so we changed the
value and we use all values
contents so the array and map each value
to just be the key okay which will in
the end give us a simple array of
strings like this and we can resolve
them later inside our app let's go ahead
with two more functions so as I said we
get a list or an array of names like my
file dot jpg and this is of course not
enough to receive the file from our s3
bucket because the files are protected
and not available for public view so
therefore we make a request to our
back-end using the name of the file
which will give us a signed file request
which we can then simply use to make a
get request and then we are allowed to
access the resource okay I hope this is
more or less clear then we got the
delete file which is just a delete
request to the route we've created in
our server then we need another function
which will give us a random string you
can find the attribution or I can edit
right here from good ol Nick I just
copied it thanks Nick it's a good
function it works finally we need of
course upload file function but in this
case we just need to make a put request
to the URL we got from our first request
right here so we will make a put request
with a file and those two things will
already come from our controller so
that's our AWS provider and now let's
continue with the home view and
controller so for the mts let's start we
will hopefully have an image array at
some point we might need loading
controller what's there's some shortcut
to import this but I don't know what it
is I need to find out if you know it
please let me know I'm really interested
in knowing how this shortcut works
besides that we need of course our
provider AWS provider perhaps we also
need toast controller from ionic so
quite a lot we have to import here let
me check if this is everything okay yeah
we need three more imports come on this
is so long
we need the action sheet controller and
we need file and camera from our
previously installed stuff so let's add
them somewhere here and for the camera
let's use the auto import and this one
as well
okay so make sure you got all the
imports right here it's not that easy
but I think you will get this so one of
you enters ion view will enter we will
call a function to load our images from
s3 so this dot load images and once we
call this we set our images to an empty
array and then we use the provider we
just created and called get file list we
subscribe to the observable and get a
list of files so now we're
just getting the names of the files and
that's why we need to iterate this and
for each file
call our provider and say get signed
file request for the name subscribe
again and use the result and now we can
actually call push on our images array
and add a new object the key perhaps not
oh yes mandatory for the deletion and
the URL is the resource we get back from
this call you can add a lock statement
here or here and there to see if
everything's working for you but this is
how it should work
okay let's continue we need a way to
capture images a lot images and
therefore I got a standard function I
like to use I like to present the action
sheet where the user can select either
load from library or use the camera and
in both cases we will call follow-up
function called take picture and the
source type is passed to this function
which is then either a camera or the
photo library to take images we need
some options of the type camera options
of course not imported yet we can change
this so perhaps quality you can change
it to make the images a bit smaller
correct orientation I got a strange box
on Android when I was not using this
destination type in our case is actually
the file URI
so we will resolve this and that's why
we needed the file plug-in we're not
just using a base64 string were directly
using this
for the encoding type let's pick JPEG
media type for now we just make this a
picture no videos and finally source
type camera or library and this is
already passed to our function okay
before we dive into the hardest function
let's add the delete image function we
delete an image by its index inside our
array so I guess we actually don't need
the key but anyway to remove we say
images splice
no not slice but splice a P and X and
just one object and then we call on our
provider the delete file function for to
remove of course it should have only one
object so we can use the first object
and here we use the value Kia okay we
still need it so subscribe to this if
you want and perhaps create a little
toast message toast controller create
message I think we got the message from
the back end
even so duration two seconds not 20 and
what I always forget of course present
the toast so when we delete it we get
the array objects budding it's actually
only one object and we use the key value
of that object to remove it and then we
present the toast but now we get to what
you've been waiting for I guess
and that's what happening right here for
the upload process so we start by first
of all getting our picture that's the
easy part very standard we get back
image data and we do something with the
data now after we got this there will
happen a few things so it's a good idea
to present a little loading controller
right here so we call create and present
okay now we got time to do more stuff so
the image data we get back is a file URI
and we can directly use this because for
the upload put request we need a blob
object of our file and therefore we go
ahead and use our file plug-in to call
resolve local filesystem URL which will
first of all resolve our image data to
something we can actually use and here
we get back hopefully a file okay so
this file can now be used to read as an
array buffer and we need to pass in a
path and the file the pass should be the
current temporary directory which can be
accessed yes right here so after
capturing the image it should be in this
temporary directory and then we need the
file which is actually just the name
right here I'm just thinking if we need
this but I think for Android this is
definitely needed and on iOS it works as
well
so go ahead and then we got something I
would call the real file so the real
file is now our array buffer which we
can append to the put request we need to
make the type of this should be anyway
jpg or you could get it from the file
and we want a new name which is unique
so we asked our provided to give us
random string with six characters and
also we add a new date so it's super
secure I hope you heard the irony but
this should be unique enough for our app
and finally append the type so now we
got a random string with a date dot jpg
and this will be stored inside our s3
bucket okay now it's the time again to
use our AV AWS provider and call get
signed upload request and we just need
the name which will be the new name and
the type of the file which is jpg here
no it's not the type we need here is
actually the content type so this should
be image JPEG okay subscribe to this and
finally we get the data back the request
URL is inside data that's signed request
so let's go back here if we want to get
a signed request actually a file type is
jpg I'm not sure why we got image JPEG
in here let's see I'll just change it to
type perhaps it works so we get back
this signed request and we can use this
now
to finally get signed upload yes to
upload our image upload file
the URL is the request URL and the file
is our real file which we got from
reading the file as an array buffer so
we subscribe we get a result and this is
hopefully a successful result so that's
not really any error handling in here of
course you can add some caches if you
like to or you should do this so after
finishing our upload we need just like
in the loading process here more or less
the same I think
but our name is in this case of course
the new name we've created and then we
can push this into our array and finally
say loading this miss ok this is quite a
lot and perhaps spend a few minutes to
think through what we're doing there are
also some comments in the related
tutorial which is linked below the video
but it's hopefully more or less clear so
first of all get the image resolve it to
your local URL read that local file so
we can append it to a put request create
a new name get the put request signed
URL and use this URL to upload our file
and finally resolve the new files so we
can present it in our array as well ok I
hope you're still with me because now we
get to the last part of the tutorial
which is creating the view so let's make
this also look nicely we is the primary
color here
and inside we use an ion list with ion
cart ng4 let image of images and also we
use the index of the iteration so we can
later easily remove images image source
is now just the image URL nothing else
needed right here and we also add a
button which will not always be
displayed so danger
I added some styling right here because
I wanted to make it look a bit nicer and
the button will only be displayed if
variable edit is true and unclick this
will called delete image with the
iteration key right here and just and I
can trash always a good idea we want to
delete some stuff okay so we got this
delete I can we got the list okay we of
course need the fab button to get the
action sheet and upload new stuff so
button iron and on click we call present
action sheet and also an icon here which
is camera so finally we need a way to
enable the edit mode and I will just add
some button at the end of the top bar
button ion button I can only and on
click we will do it right here we said
edit to not edit very ugly but fine in
this case I think so the one unlock will
be displayed if we're already in edit
mode and the lock icon will be displayed
if we are not in edit mode okay so let's
see okay let's see I own button is not a
known element what please what is not
known what's wrong with you
so the ionic CLI in the last days was
not really friendly to me
hopefully it's just a minor issue button
I own button but I am I don't know
what's the problem
elements button I on buttons right
that's better
yes and you see I already got one image
on a WS s3 we get this edit mode right
here but of course the upload here won't
work because we don't have cord over
here so let me switch over to the iOS
simulator okay one last thing before
deploying I had a little typo in here I
had just name but we of course need the
new name here so now I got the app on my
device and as you can see on f3 we got
one file which is displayed right
if we go ahead and use one from the
library let's use this we see the
loading indicator and once it is
finished the file is right here if we
update f3 we can also see that the file
is right here it's quite big but no
problem if we change our lock we are
able to edit this and we go ahead and
delete this one refresh right here and
see the file is gone so now we are able
to upload files get files delete files
perform everything we need with our
Amazon s3 bucket using ionic and also
our node.js back-end as a server to
protect access to the actual s3 bucket I
hope you enjoyed this video series if
you did please leave a comment or
perhaps say if you want to see how other
apps are developed or could be developed
using ionic I really like to make these
kind of full stack tutorials including a
back-end so if you enjoyed give thumbs
up and leave a comment make sure to
subscribe to my channel and I hope to
see you in the next video have a great
day and take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
