from deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy
in this video I will show you how you
can easily deploy your current ionic app
to Heroku as a website so ionic
basically already gives us a folder
which is a website and with Cordova it
is packaged later on into an iOS or
Android container but we can also take
this container and deploy it as a web
application and that's what we will do
in this tutorial so I've created a blank
new ionic app and the first thing we
need to do is install some NPM packages
and I will show you why we cannot just
say Hiroko please surf this fold up we
have to create a little server file so
we go ahead and create a server j/s at
the top level of your of our ionic app
and we paste in some stuff and this is
right where we need morgan cores express
body Pazza this stuff is basically what
you use in every node.js application
sorry you don't have to mind this is
just to prevent some chorus issues you
might expect and actually the most
important line is this because it tells
our Express app to serve the www folder
as a static page and then we will be
able to access all the resources inside
this folder but there are a few changes
we need to make and also let's add a
little change to our page here so this
is ionic web and we add a little button
just to present a little pop-up to our
users where we can see on which platform
we are actually running and we call this
where am i running and this and then
according function right here show
platform we need two more things oh we
actually should increase yes sorry I
hope you were still able to see the
server J's file in case yours again but
you can find all the code in the link
below the video so we got the button
here we got show platform and inside
show platform we now need an alert view
so we have to add private alert
controller alert controller and also we
need the platform so import both of them
platform and alert controller up here
so now we can use them let's say our
text is I run on whatever and here we
use our platform dot platforms let's see
the completion again because this will
return an array if you run it on a
mobile device it could return multiple
things so it's fine for us we just want
to see the string and then we create our
alert using our alert controller and the
title will be my home whatever subtitle
is our text and buttons just okay
nothing special
and finally call alert present to show
our controller so now we got a little
function inside our app which we can use
to go ahead with Heroku you need an
account and I recommend to download the
tool but otherwise this will not
work and then go ahead run here oke will
lock in to enter your credentials so I'm
already locked in therefore I can go to
the next step and call Hiroko create
which creates a new app somewhere here
if you go to this right now you see not
really anything going on here
there's nothing deployed yet so now we
come to the actual deployment and the
problem is if we for example delete or a
built folder and commit this app Heroku
is not able to build our ionic app
because normally when we run ionic surf
or something the build command will be
triggered using the ionic app scripts
and those app scripts are not installed
on hiroko but we can change this by
bringing the dev dependencies from here
to the real dependencies okay so this
change means Heroku will anyway install
all the NPM packages and now it will
also install the app scripts and
typescript which enables hiroko to build
our app using the ionic app scripts okay
so then Iroko will be able to build the
folder and then it needs to call our
server and we can create another file
called prop file so you can already see
everyone knows that this is related to
Hiroko and inside this file we can
specify which command should be run for
our application and we call NPM run
build and then
NPM start okay so why NPM run build if
we go to our package JSON to our scripts
we see there's already a build script
and this will call the app script build
and if we run NPM run built this grip
will be triggered so we can do it
locally
if you
so we've deleted the folder we call NPM
run build and the folder comes up and
ionic will do all the build process and
copy the files over and stuff like this
and if you run NPM start our server JS
file will be started from Hiroko I think
they know that the file on that the
server j/s file is the normal name for
this so that's why they know this to
make this even a bit more automatic
let's finally add another file how can I
add a top-level file now come on
perhaps this ok
we call this Oroku deployment shell
script and perhaps we have to change
some yeah so rules so we can execute the
file actually inside this one I think we
just need to call get it whatever
perhaps we've added some files git
commit and then we add Heroku deployment
and then we call git push Heroku master
and this line is actually what deploys
our application to hero go
you can add also Oroku open this finally
opens the page and now let's give this
one a try so we call Iroko deployment
you see some files were created they are
committed that will be pushed to iroko
and now we are already in the console
log of our Hiroko app new node.js app
was detected that's right it's not just
an ionic app it's now an OTS app Heroku
goes ahead and built our dependencies
from our package JSON file so in this
step all these dependencies will be
installed including the app script
typescript so this of course can take a
second or a minute or an hour
you know this from node modules on your
local machine but once this is ready it
will continue with this command
okay so binaries fine everything is
installed build succeed is always a good
a good luck so discovering process types
proc file declares we have a web
application and in my new window already
at the great a current sense whatever
Heroku app our app is deployed I think
this can take a few seconds because I
think this step is not yet finished when
this command comes up so perhaps wait a
bit and hopefully we will soon be able
to see our app what you can do as well
is called Heroku local to see if it
works locally this can be a bit false
result because I tried this and it
worked even before moving my dev
dependencies to the dependencies because
locally I have ionic app scripts so this
will always work no if we go ahead to
localhost 5000 we see that we got our
ionic web app right here using the local
command we even get the lock from our
node.js server and if I call this I get
I run on quorum and now finally our
ionic web application deployed to the
World Wide Web is also ready and it also
gives me core you can now serve to this
URL from your Android or iOS device and
it will give you different results
returning mobile iPhone OS or something
like this so now you're actually able to
make changes
do your regular coding here build your
iOS and Android apps and whenever you
want to deploy it because perhaps your
project also needs a website simply call
your Hiroko deployment script which will
add commit and push the current code
base to hiroko everything will be
installed automatically due to our
changes to the package.json in the proc
file and then you will be able to use
your ionic code even as a website I'm
always amazed at how easy this works of
course you need some UI changes perhaps
or different general styling for the web
but we are now able to build a
full-blown application with web and
mobile app from one single codebase and
this is really awesome perhaps you've
already deployed something using Hiroko
and ionic or another ionic web app
