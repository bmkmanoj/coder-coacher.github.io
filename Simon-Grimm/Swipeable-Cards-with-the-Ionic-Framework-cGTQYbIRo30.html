tech with a video tutorial on swipeable
cards for your ionic app so we will use
a custom ion and set up a demo app so
let's start with this and okay so the
swipeable cards are similar to the one
seen in the famous jelly app so we want
something like this inside our app and
for this we will use the custom ion from
the drifty team and we will install it
with power and we can save it to our
power file as well okay so it's a bit
described here but we will implement it
for real so follow this tutorial okay so
first of all we need to add the custom
ion okay
that's again awesome my tome is a bit
broken at the moment I'm not sure why
okay so first of all go to your fjs and
at the dependency into your dependency
array which is ionic contrib UI cards
and next go to your index and add
somewhere around here
script source it should be in lip
ionic ion swipe cards and should be
ionic swipe card stock jeaious
let's take a look ionic swipe cards and
ionic swipe cards to it okay so that's
everything we need to set up our product
okay so let's go to our body or whatever
first of all we need a controller which
will be the cards controller and well
the header is okay for now
so can remove the ion content for this
as we now use the directive swipe cards
and all of our code will be inside this
tag so first of all we want one swipe
card which is static in the background
so we can still assign the action but it
won't go away so you can say on card
swipe or swipe card and this will call
action in our controller which is card
swiped
and we will style it later a bit so we
give it an ID okay and come on it will
be a tiny text on it so
swipe down for a new card you can also
take a look at the github repository so
the code is very similar to their code
okay so that's the static card
next comes the real cards again swipe
card now ng-repeat and we will repeat
over an array of cards we will create
inside our card controller and we can
say we want to catch the on destroy
event as well meaning the card is
completely disappeared and we will call
car destroy it with the index of the
current card and again we assign the on
card swipe action to all our cards
swiped with the index now okay so that's
the swipe card in general
now inside our swipe card we will have
another ng controller which controls the
buttons of the swipe card as you've seen
in the jelly app will agree or disagree
or whatever and here we will have a card
controller as well close it and the next
part is just to have a solid card with
some information so we will have a title
which is carved up title and we will
also have an image
which will be also from our card
okay and the last part we will need here
is some buttons this is just for demo
purpose so ad button bar okay and inside
the button bar we will have two buttons
which well it's just to show you what
you could possibly do so there are no
real actions here so let's have a clear
button and looks positive and on click
we will just whatever do anything okay
so I guess yeah well can some text you
like whatever
a copy the button and we'll say dislike
or something okay so that's now
everything for our view as you can see
we have this one swipe cards in general
around our swipe card and we have one
static swipe card here and the real card
with the content is here so now we need
a card controller and a card controller
so save everything and go to your fjs
and we need our cards control
and we will also need the color
controller
okay so inside our card controller we
first create our array of cards which
will be empty in the beginning but we
will have this add card which will take
an image and the name and this will just
create a new card and create this object
with the image and title and gives our
new card an ID which is just the random
number and finally add it to our area
but we will use the unship to make it
safe so oh just one and the new card
okay so I hope this works
and another thing I make is I will grab
the data from random user API to get
some work to get some dummy data I don't
want to include some images here or load
them or whatever so okay I think we need
the HTTP and this function will just
grab the amount of dummy users from this
API and add a card for every user so I
will do this and what we do to initiate
our array is then called add cards one
in the beginning so when our controller
is initiated the eight cards will be
called for one object and this will do
get request to HTTP API dot random user
dot M e and let's very straight forward
here
okay I show results okay should be fine
I guess
okay so let's chain it and now we don't
know how many object we have created so
we go angular for each and for each
object we get here we will call it card
with the user picture in the medium size
and the users email so you can take a
look at this random user API it's
nothing special it's just for creating
some data we can use here so when we are
finished we will say scope that show
cards looks true
okay I'm not sure if we're using this
okay guest it's from another tutorial I
made you know I made this well the
stinner styled cards and there we were
also using this random user API it's a
guest post on Nick's block so you can
take a look at his blog he's doing
really great great tutorials as well
okay so our array gets filled and the
last thing here we need to do is
implement the card swiped function
and also the card destroyed function so
on card swiped we can just say scope add
cards one so whenever one card is swiped
out we will just add another card and
this will grab the data and at the car
to our array and on card destroy we need
to remove the card from our array so we
say cards supplies and index and one
okay so that should work by now so as
you have seen we have another card
controller here for the card and this is
implementation of it and here we will
use the ionic swipe card and delegate
and you will see why
come on
okay I'm a bit sorry for this jsn stuff
okay so as we have two buttons which
we'll call the do anything function we
want to grab the current card here which
is I on ik
swipe card delegate dot gets wipeable
card Y and we need to give this go p--
as you here and now we can just say card
swipe so when we press the buttons our
card should we swipe outside which is
always nice and very handy to have this
feature programmatically okay so this
board already work quite okay but for a
bit more yeah for the effect we want to
achieve we need to add a bit of CSS and
I will just copy the one from here
because as you can see it's quite a few
lines so I hope we will get these things
in the near future already implemented
in the swipe card I'm not sure if the
ionic team is working on it or not but
if many people need this they will
perhaps make it okay so I guess we are
fine for now
I will add the iOS platform because I'm
on a Mac if you're not on a Mac you can
build for iOS so hopefully everything's
working already now most of the time I
have some typos anywhere
it's loading okay that looks pretty good
so here's our app here's our card and I
can come on now we don't want this well
it's a cool effect but it's not really
like we want it to have okay
sure
what was here okay now that's not a
problem I'm not completely sure what
went wrong here okay so I did not close
the tag for our initial cards so sorry
for that let's run it again
besides this point I guess everything's
already working pretty good so you have
seen we already had the background
static card and we had one card from
this random user API I can also show you
how this looks like
I hope yeah you will get this result and
you can take whatever information you
need from there
so here again here's our card and now
it's working so here's our background
steady card and scope at cards is
somehow not called okay whatever that
sucks
okay what's wrong I'm not completely
sure what's wrong at this moment because
everything looks fine for me let's start
it again one time to just see the next
functions
oh I guess we could just take card
swiped that would be great yeah and on
card destroyed okay maybe we don't want
to soup wipe our last card but for now
we leave it at this so now finally
everything should be working I hope so
the steady car the new card and let's
try the buttons and the card was swiped
and it was destroyed and we added a new
card so this is working pretty good you
could obviously assign some other
actions here or do whatever you like and
now also you can drag it swipe the card
this nice turning effect and swipe it
out and there's the new car so now
finally our swipe cards are working okay
so thanks for listening and Cheers
through the ionic team thanks for this
styling I just took from you you're
doing great job and yeah if you have any
questions leave me a comment or Twitter
me something and I hope you follow my
channel so see you the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
