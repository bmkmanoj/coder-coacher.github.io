from the ionic Academy and in this quick
one I will show you how you can get more
native-like transitions for your ionic
app if you are not completely happy with
the current animations of ionic so I've
started a blank new ionic app and we go
ahead and add the Cordova plug-in for
native page transitions so this plug-in
will allow us to use more native-like
transitions when we push or set
different pages inside our ionic app
there are a few different options and we
will just go through the basic four
options and of course also make sure to
add the ionic native package so we can
use it also
I will generate or regenerate more or
less the home page as you can see
currently the home page has no module
file if you go ahead and just generate
it again you will see that yes ionic CLI
come on okay yes there we now got a
module file and now it works a bit
better with lazy loading also we'll
create a second page so we can navigate
to that second page from our first page
so let's remove the everything the own
page and also import the native page
transitions from an ionic native native
page transitions and edit to your array
of providers and then we're good here to
get started with our app so for the home
screen there's actually not much we have
to do so let's call this transitions and
we just need a bunch of buttons here
so I unbutton perhaps full and now we
will open the different or use the
different animations so we will have a
slight animation and we got three more
so the second one perhaps is flip page
flip then we got fade page which is kind
of cool
eight page page yeah and then we got
curled page a nice curl animation
alright so not really that hard until
here let's import our native page
transitions inside our home ts as well
and also of course make sure to add it
to your constructor native page
transitions of the type native page
transitions okay so let's implement four
functions first was slide page and then
we got three more again flip page eight
page and finally curled page all right
so to use these animations or to to make
a general animation we of course use our
enough control to like call set route
with the second page okay so this is
just the normal behavior now if you want
to use these native transitions you can
call the native page transitions plug-in
and there are different options so slide
flip fade and curl are the standard
transitions and if you use the drawer
you can control the animation a bit
better and cancel or execute your
pending transition at different points
but we will leave this out here and just
use the basic ones so the first one was
slide and we need some options here or
we can use some options here so let's
create an options object of the type
native transition options and now we get
the option the option to use different
stuff like the direction from which to
which side should this be animated so
for the slide to the next page we just
say left then you got something like the
duration of the animation 400 is about
pretty normal and there there are lot of
things you can use like slowdown factor
I don't want to get too much into detail
on these as I'm also still trying to
figure out what's the best option let me
bring in something so this is the
official page for the native page
transitions and here's everything
documented very well so go through this
and just try around what's working for
you so there really a lot of options you
can use some look at some look not that
good together so just give it a try with
different options and mix the stuff one
thing I noticed is that when we use the
push command which brings in the next
page it already uses some ionic push
command on animation and if you mix this
with like a slight animation you might
get a duplicate animation here and there
so that's why I'm using say route and
some places here but again just give it
a try and you will see what works for
you so let's make this one a bit
different up transition but of course
there was a flip and then perhaps the
fade just
just without any options because of fate
looks almost all the time pretty good
and the curl animation sorry curl and
yeah let's keep it like this but for
fate or for for flip we might use push
so we have it at least in one place
alright let's finish this up by just
implementing a little bit on the second
page so just give it a button so we can
get back if we have used the set root
click call go back and finally implement
that function right here again we use
private native page transitions and
perhaps also the options so it goes
right here and then on go back we might
want to check perhaps if we actually can
go back so we can use can go back from
our navigation controller in that case
we have a previous page we can pop to it
so we just need to call this knife
patrol pup and otherwise we need to call
the knife control set root again now
with a home page to go back very
standard navigation here let's add some
more animations so perhaps we make this
also slide up now down as we go back
then you have long something like slight
pixels so how many pixels yeah you will
see it in the animation it's hard to
describe here and if we call SEP root
perhaps we just want to fade back maybe
a bit slower than before
and that's it now remember we cannot use
this inside the browser anymore homepage
let's see perhaps we should change the
entry point as well because we're making
use of Cordova plugins so we need to
build this app for device and test the
native transitions on a real device or
simulator so let me deploy it and then I
will show you the animations okay so
here's our app with the four buttons
we've implemented so let's go through
them slide just slides in the second
page I think we used set root and slide
with a duration 400 so tiny delay and
this looks pretty native inside your
apps I think this is maybe one of the
best animations you can also see when I
hit back we already see the fate
transition which is just like this so a
very smooth transition to the next page
can be pretty cool I kind of like it
and now flip and curl are a bit more
crazy so flip this crazy animation
perhaps this was used more some years
ago I think I haven't seen it that much
lately but it's still a nice animation
if it fits your app and finally curl you
know it's like pulling or some book or
whatever maybe it has some places where
it makes sense in most apps in most
normal apps this is a bit over the top
perhaps so a very nice light animation
or a fade animation might look good in
your app in here if you want your app to
look more native than
it is with the normal ionic animations
go give the native page transitions a
try especially the slide play around
with the options you can get a really
nice material design effect if you have
the right parameters set up here this
works for Android and iOS of course and
here perhaps leave a comment what's your
favorite transition and if you have
found some good settings that really
look like a perfect native animation
okay I hope you enjoyed this video if

channel and also check out the ionic
Academy com what this quick win was
hosted you can get more training video
courses and a great community to learn
ionic I hope to see you in the next
video have a great day and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
