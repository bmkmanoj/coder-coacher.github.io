deaf tactic today I will show you how to
use push notifications with the ionic IO
service so let's start with a blank app
if you have not created account here you
can just go to it and create one for
free and you will need this to continue
in this tutorial because we will upload
our app through this service to use the
push notification okay it starts with
ionic upload and if you are not locked
in by now this will ask for your mail
and password and once this is done we
should see our app appearing right here
and why do we need this because this
will give us an app ID and also concede
here let's refresh yes there it is this
will give us an app ID and also an API
key which we will need later okay first
of all we need to install quite a lot of
plugins so I'm a bit lazy I will just
copy paste them you can find the list of
what you need on my blog post or if
you're fast you can also take a look at
this one or stop the video okay Angie
Cordova we need the ionic Service core
and the service push and finally this
one this is not documented but they
wrote it would be included but it wasn't
so yes you will need this one as well
okay
open your text edit or whatever you
using and go to the index file and
append all those scripts we have just
installed right after ionic bundle J s
and also go to your FJ s and the angular
module array and we need some more we
need an D Cordova and we need ionic
Service core and also ionic service push
okay perfect that should be enough for
this let's get started with the config
we need this config to identify our app
with the ionic IO service and we need
the ionic app provider and again ionic
app provider here and now we need to
identify our app and inside we need an
app ID which we will set very soon and
we need the API key which we will also
insert soon and finally we set the def
push flag to true because we are only
using development push notifications in
this tutorial this will speed up the
process and we don't have to struggle
with Apple or Android certificates and
keys and all those things
okay I already said no we don't use this
anymore that you can find the app ID
here so copy paste your app ID and also
go to your app go to your settings and
this doesn't look very good and find
your public key and insert it to the API
key this key will be used for push
notifications later on we will also need
the secret key later but we will come to
this later okay it's not working right
okay fine
first of all inside your index we will
need two buttons and also we obviously
need a controller which will be the push
controller as I said we need two buttons
some styling
no that's done and unclick we want to
identify our user we need to identify
our user first because well we need some
random generated unique ID to register
his device and so we need to call
identify a user before we do anything
else once we've identified our user we
can register or push but this one will
only be available if the user is
identified and this will call our for
register or what do we name it yeah push
register ok so in the beginning we will
only see this button and once we've
identified we will see this button as
well this is the only thing we need for
our view right now
I already assigned the controller so
let's create it as I said the push
controller and we need some dependencies
we need the scope we need the root scope
we need ionic user and finally ionic
push ok as I said the first function
we'll be to identify our user so first
of all we will get a user object and if
the user has no user ID right now we
will set the user ID just to a random ID
okay that's enough also you can set some
metadata for our user I think this is
not mandatory but I just want to include
it so you know how to do it
and I'm the order of their tactic okay
let's do the real work we need to call
ionic user again and identify with our
user object and if this is successful we
said scope identified equals true so our
second button will be displayed and we
can also lock whatever name should be
user name and the ID should be use a
touch user ID okay so this is our first
button you can also read e serve it and
we got our button and let's make it a
bit bigger and as you can see my name
and ID and the button for the push-ups
let's go on the second function is the
push register so at this point we want
to register for push notifications and
this is also really easy and
straightforward we just need to call the
ionic push service and call register and
inside we can set some parameters like
can show alert and many more so I will
include them here just so you know what
you can do but as we are only using
development notifications we won't see a
batch or have a sound right now okay as
you can see there are many more and
maybe the most important one on
notification
well at this point you can do whatever
you like but make sure to return true
right now to display it and so here you
can handle your stuff with the unnoted
okay that's everything we need to
display the notification there's one
last thing we need to change right now
because once we've registered for push
notifications we want to catch the
registered event callback and for this
we will use the road scope and catch the
okay know type own please cut over push
to' and received and this will call
function and to make sure everything
works we will alert it
and we will also print this out you will
see why we will need this totem later on
we can say they did too
and there's also a platform included but
as we are running it in the browser we
won't get IOS or Android back and if you
want to you can set the totem but we
won't use this any further right now so
this is everything we need right now
okay let's run it again hopefully it's
still working
no obviously not okay
okay where's the arrow okay yes now it's
working again let's try it out it's
cleared we identify our user and we
register for push notification and page
say is success and we get a token back
okay now how do we send them out open a
new tab or whatever and go to your
directory well okay you don't have to go
to it but you need to call ionic push -
yes so this will try to send a push
notification to our app and it asks for
a private API key at this point don't
may use this one but use the secret one
and now it asks for the device tone
which is this note we got in the
callback so this is why we have to
listen to it notification alert message
rain my first deaf tactic notification
bitch well we won't see a badge here and
we will also don't hear a sound so just
send it let's wait for it
and every five second
our page checks for updates and here's
our notification and you might be very
surprised how fast this was if you know
how to include native notifications and
yes it's really that simple the problem
only occurs now when we want to use
production notifications with iOS the
Apple push notification service or
Android but
right now everything is working and I
hope you liked this tutorial if you have
any questions or if you wish to see how
to perform this for iOS and Android on
the real device just leave me a comment
and make sure to follow my channel
