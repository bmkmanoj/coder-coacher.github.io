from the ionic academy in this quick one
I will show you how you can implement a
swipeable taps interface so this means
we have a top bar like we can have with
ionic but the user can swipe between the
different tabs of the app so I've
started a blank new app and first of all
we need to install this super taps
package and I picked the words in 4 1 4
because with a 4 1 5 I had some issues
so I had to go back and pick this word
also we need a few pages for our app so
call ionic generate page and then we
regenerate the home page so it will have
a module file then we create a noose
file just some dummy stuff here about
perhaps and let's call this one account
and then we add one other which will be
news details so we will also take a look
at how we could change from the
swipeable type interface back to normal
page so once you got this you can close
this and I will restart my lap great
anyway there was some problem so let's
go to the app module and first of all
import super tabs module there is the
app as well
so super tabs module from
ionic to super tabs and then inside your
import add super tabs module dot forward
to initialize it for your app and now we
can use it and our home page will be the
base template file for the super tips
so we have to import the super tips
module here as well and at the import if
it's not coming up automatically so
let's go to the home TS I want to make
this a bit more flexible and therefore I
created this array of pages and we will
create the top bar from these pages so
we got the page names we got a title for
each page perhaps an icon and also an ID
which we will need later on what we need
as well is to keep track of the selected
tab which will be 0 in the beginning but
of course you could change this to be a
different tab as well then we need
access to our view child super taps and
it is imported but view child also needs
to be import from angular and then super
taps of the types super taps so now we
can access this one as well also what we
might need here is an alert controller
so add private alert controller alert
controller and at the import as well of
course so now there's one function we
can subscribe to and we will call this
on top select and this will give us an
event so inside our tapa we can
subscribe to this event and handle what
we want to do this can be interesting
for many cases for example if one tab is
only for authorized users in that case
you can check let's say if the index of
the event is 2 so we want to have some
special access for the third tab which
has the index too of course
otherwise we do
set our selected tab to the index and
also we can use the super tips to use
some functions and we say clear batch
for the tap we want to navigate to so
you could set a batch number you will
see how this looks in a few minutes and
if you say clear bitch you have to
specify the ID of the tap why you want
to clear the index so we use our pages
at the position we want to swipe to dot
ID so all of the tabs have the unique ID
now if you want to have some special
whatever here you could make a check to
your provider to see if the user is
authenticated or stuff like this we will
just add a very simple alert title or
secret page so now real authentication
in this example are you sure you want to
access that page and then we need two
buttons so the first button text no and
then we attach a handler which will use
super tabs slide 2 because some users
clicked on a third top but he said no so
we want to go back to the selected tab
but if the user is sure that he wants to
continue of course we can add text yes
and then with a handler again set our
selected tab just like we do in the
other case perhaps also clean the batch
if you want to so this will give you
more granular access to the functions
emitted by the super tabs
so that's fine for the typescript pal
let's heat on to our home HTML let's
implement the content and the temps
first of all so this element is called
super tips and then you can specify a
bunch of things for the super tips so
let's say you want to have tips
placement at the top like this and many
Android apps you can set the toolbar
background to whatever but those colors
have to be inside your theme variables
defined so this will use these colors
from the color map of ionic so we use a
secondary color here then perhaps a
toolbar color light some differences and
indicator color also light as well there
are a few more things you could specify
like if you have a site menu you could
add an additional configuration for this
we don't need this you can check it out
on the official page of the super tips
but what we want is the tap select event
I said before and here we can plug in
our on tab selected function with the
event and then whenever somebody clicks
on a tap or swipe to atop our on tap
selected good thing I checked the name
this function of will be caught and just
like with ionic inside the taps you have
to specify each tab and I said we want
to iterate over the array so let page of
pages set the route also just like ionic
and this would be page that page name we
can set the icon which is page dot icon
the ID which is page dot ID
and I think that's all for now so let's
save all of this and see how it looks
okay don't look so good so if you
encounter this error
let's check we don't want this I want
this exact word I don't know what's
wrong but that's exactly the error you
get with a wrong package let's see I
will just reinstall the package and it
should work don't say for now so we got
super tab so we got the super tap and
that's all for now let's wait for it and
there it is
now we can see the taps we can switch
between the tabs actually in the last
function okay I know why it's not
trigger I forgot what I always tend to
forget calling alert that present and
then let's check again the alert comes
up but you can see in the background you
already see the new page so if you hit
yes you will stay on that page if you
pick no you are brought back to the
first page but the UI is not looking
that good so first of all let's change
the color here to secondary as well and
you will notice that we still got this
little border and shadow but we can add
no border to the iron header which will
result in a UI that looks like this but
you still see that we only have a home
in here and that's why we edit the names
of the pages because showing the name
here is not really UI I know of and it
looks kind of bad so at this point we
can use our pages array again at the
position of
like that tap dot title and close it and
then we can see that if we switch
between the tabs we get the right name
for each tab now it already looks quite
good for some reason in my Chrome I
can't really use the swipe event here so
we will use this on a device later as
well
but for now to make this look even
better let's go to your pages and for
all the pages you've used simply remove
the header pad so it was account years
and all those pages only need ion
content because they will be displayed
here and now you see that we got a clean
page we could say news not home account
and about and I will save all so now you
will see come on
news about and account there it is for
some reason it's not coming up so I
guess my live reload crashed or
up something again I don't know what's
bro but in general this is the base part
and now we also want to use the
controller and therefore let's go to the
home on the news HTML and let's add a
few buttons in here to test out some
functionalities so different functions
perhaps go to details we will implement
them in a segment of details and where's
my mouse they are say that
I don't know how many so we can call set
bitch we could call clear bitch we could
to account we could hide toolbar and we
could also show toolbar so let's
separate them and add a few names hide
toolbars so we know what's going on in
there
show toolbar this go to account and we
had clear badge and finally set badge
that's also increased batch but we will
just stick to those then let's go to the
news TS and add the private super taps
controller of the type super taps
controller so the import comes up and a
few things we need to take care of now
so first of course implement all the
functions go to detail set badge clear
badge what else
jump to account
hi toolbar in show - okay doesn't look
right and nope and that's it
first of all to go to the details we can
use the nav controller and say push news
details page but you will see how this
looked like if I were to have my laptop
and running the problem is that if we
use this new F controller we will push
the page inside and the tab navigation
for some use cases this might be fine
but in general I think most of the time
you want a different behavior and
therefore you can use the root nav
controller the type nav controller and
simply inside the constructor say this
dot root enough controller equals this
stop enough params get and then root nav
controller so this is injected by the
super tabs and by using this you will
see that the live reload perhaps again
is not doing what it should do this is
really you can do better
I'm a bit disappointed sometimes by the
CLI in general I like it but sometimes
it just seems that the updates are not
really applied to my life reload so
let's see okay now we don't see anything
also something I've never seen come on
this is so bad
perhaps I've also forgotten to import
the super taps module in here maybe this
is the fix for it let's see actually no
actually I should have used a root
enough control sorry ionic for flaming
the CLI see lies great everything's
great and there you can see it so before
it was opened inside this navigation
controller in area and now it uses the
full page to go to this of course simply
decide what's for you what's not for you
but I think it's good to know about this
so let's use now the actual super taps
controller and we want to set the batch
perhaps set it to some number but this
is not working because it needs the ID
of the page which we've used before
inside our area so if you want to target
this page you need the about tab ID and
the number to clear the batch again this
touch super taps controller via batch
and we see that this also needs the tap
ID so edit in you can also add the taps
ID which would be the ID of our super
taps element but as we only got this one
super taps we don't need to specify it
here and perhaps you want to jump to a
specific page of course this is working
as well so simply called slide to to to
slide to our account a
and then you can also use something like
high toolbar
no it's show toolbar with faults and
this is show toolbar with true so let's
see all of this in action finally open
details still as intended set badge sets
the badge we're not increasing is we are
setting it to your value we could remove
it by calling cube edge or we could
navigate to the page as we've added the
function as well to the untapped
selector so we got all of this we can
jump to the account page or we would be
brought back we can hide the toolbar
which completely hides our tabs now we
could show it back so these are I guess
the most common and important functions
off the super taps simply use the
controller I'm not sure if this fixed
anything or if this could be removed
let's give it a try
okay it works flawless without it so
simply leave it out but otherwise make
sure to notice this that you can use the
routing F controller if you got the
superchips controller and then make sure
to use the right navigation control I'm
not the one off the page and then simply
check out the documentation for the
super tabs a really great component
kudos to the developers of this plugin
thanks for making it it really rocks I
said I cannot swipe to the sides in here
but if you run this perhaps in your
browser or on the device you will see
that you can simply swipe to the
different tabs this bar will change and
it really looks awesome so I hope you
