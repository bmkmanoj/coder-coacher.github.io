from detecting today I going to show you
how to use drag and drop inside your
ionic 2 app and for this we will use a
component called dragula or dragula
whatever it is it's also available for
angular 1 but this lip is especially for
angular 2 so the demo of this looks like
this you can move stuff from one list to
another list you can have different
behavior like give it a color
once it's in another bag drag it out
keep a copy in place whatever it is so
there are many things but first of all
let's start our new ionic app we use the
blank template we use ionic 2 and we
also want to have typescript support so
let this install of our blank app run
through and then we can continue with
the NPM packages of dragula ok so once
the app is ready we can navigate to the
folder and we can start to install our
package we also want to save it to our
package Jason just if we need it later
whatever and on the page you can already
find the setup guide it's pretty easy so
let's open the text editor of your
choice whatever it is and hopefully yeah
navigate to your app folder and we take
the home ts file for now so first of all
we need to import the stuff we just
installed and we need to import dragula
and
a regular service I'm not sure if we
actually need it by now but let's keep
it there so this is not something I
really like but it's the only way I
found to use it by now mmm sorry I hope
we can find our package now it's not
finding it well it should be in that
place we will see an error later if we
made let's serve it already so we can
see if it's right or wrong so we can
keep the lock at the bottom of our
screen to see some types bit errors in
case we made something yeah actually I
think we need to go up one more path and
now the import is green so we don't have
any arrows anymore additionally we need
to specify an array of directives we're
going to use yes thanks for this app as
you can see only the faff I think is
missing well we don't care currently so
add the dragula to the directives and
also to the providers array and the drug
alert service in this case inside our
homepage we now need two buckets
our bags how they are called inside
dragula so q1 and q2 and inside them for
in our constructor we need the dragula
service just to show you how you can
react to events from that library you
don't have to use it but you will see
why we use it in a sound so to start our
simple demonstration let's make it look
good we fill our arrays with some some
numbers just just we get some data and
we push simply some strings and the
number just just to have anything we can
distinguish from each other so this will
be in the first bucket and those things
are going to be in the second bucket and
now we're going to use the drug last
service we defined and we can subscribe
to the drop event you already see there
some events I cancel Clos and drop
whatever and we can simply subscribe to
the drop event and we will get the value
of the dropped element inside call back
here and once it's called we want to
give out a simple alert so if we want to
use the alert we obviously need to
import it from ionic angular and we
create our alert message with simply
let's say title item moved
and the subtitle whatever so much fun
I'm not sure if we actually need a
button here or there's one already
existing but yeah I think it should be
come on really
I'm not sure what's the matter here so I
think we can use a load come on ionic
this should work now this is also not
working by now so okay give me a second
to see what's wrong
okay so the API has changed again from
the time I made this to now so now we're
going to use the alert controller and
call alert controller create
title/subtitle buttons and finally we're
going to use this alert and simply call
present on it so I think oh yeah do we
really need this yeah might be the case
that we need to add the alert controller
here of the type of the controller and
now we should be able hopefully our case
again no no problem now but the problem
is now we need to call this that alert
controller create okay so until here
everything is working okay
okay so yeah that's what it's like to to
work with beta versions come on it's
definitely existing on alert I'm not
sure what's the problem in this moment
so maybe some okay great
is somehow up the API and I can't
use present anymore okay well that's not
legit I don't like that so maybe I can
still use the navigation controller
whatever we will we will keep this for
now because it's not the most important
part of this tutorial so whatever we can
also just give out a look if this is not
working for whatever reasons yeah I
don't care anymore so greetings to the
team okay well let's start with a view
and this is IRF tactic drag-and-drop and
inside our content we obviously don't
need this stuff and we also don't want
padding but we want to have Rho and we
want to have two separate columns inside
our view so we're going to use I on call
and use the size 15 I'm not sure why the
sentence
and we will also add some CSS later on
oh yeah
obviously it's I on coal poof come on
inside our first column when you want to
have a little header so we'll has the
class header and this is the first
bucket and now we're going to use an ion
list so standard ion list now we can use
dragula and specify a name and this name
will be used on a second as well so
dragula knows that these two lists can
be dropped between each other and we
also use the regular model to say okay
please use everything that's in this
array which is q1 and inside well
actually it's not very interesting
what's inside but we want to have an
entry for to actually display the items
of our list of q1 ok nothing really
interesting there and finally close the
ion list ok so this is our first column
and the second one will simply be for q2
and well it has the class right and yeah
ok everything's cool ok we didn't close
the ion row so let's close it and we see
well it's not very very good looking at
this point so let's go to our CSS file
and I already prepared some CSS we don't
use the home class anymore but this is
wrong we will use some additional CSS so
this is simply for our components and
displaying them correctly but this stuff
here below is copied from some
repository related to trailer maybe in
the official one and this will help to
get a cool animation inside our view but
I already noticed some little changes we
need to apply and also like this so now
we going to use our drag and drop in
action hopefully so here are two lists
and we can now simply drag the stuff
from one list to another and you can see
that actually the item is copied to the
different list and removed from the
first one and as we wanted to have the
regular service the other controller
work not for some reason let's see what
happens
so now if we drag nothing happens but if
we drop we get the lock of the event and
there are a few events you can subscribe
to dragula so you can use them to catch
some information the lifecycle of your
regulator so this was how to add drag
and drop to ionic to app if you liked

great apps bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
