the effect in the ionic academy today we
will see how to add email attachments
for example images to our ionic app and
send out those emails so i've already
started a blank new ionic app nothing
special so far and we can directly go
ahead and add first of all the cordova
plugin for email and what we also need
is the cordova plugin for camera because
we want to capture an image and then
attach that image to our email so add
those to Cordova plugins and then go
ahead and install the email composer and
the camera from ionic native I recently
had some problems with ionic native so
for some reasons there are problems and
that's why I'm also installing the
latest core package of ionic native just
to make sure everything's working ok
good so once we are done we can go to
our app module and import the camera and
also the email composer and we have to
import both of course as well up here so
camera which is from ionic native camera
and the second one the email composer
which is also from at ionic native email
composer
ok fine so we got this we got this
inside our providers and we can go to
our page and implement a very simple UI
so let's call it emails
images let's see our FS the loading it's
a good sign so what we need are two
buttons one button will capture an image
and the second one will allow us to send
out the email so first is capture image
capture image and the second one is here
to send email and email all right below
our two buttons we put a simple eye on
card
let's give it a header and this will
display our current image inside the eye
on card content there's a typo yes like
this so our image will be inside a
variable in our class and we will call
it current image and we also only want
to display it if it's actually set so
otherwise we would have an ST yeah dummy
image says the image is missing or null
or whatever so this is what it looked
like right now now we go to our home
class and add our two functions capture
image and send email fine okay now we
actually get to the funny stuff so we
need to import the camera because of
course we need it and we also need the
email composer so where is it up here
okay now we got it in our example we
will simply capture the image from the
photo library it's quite easy we can run
it on simulated we want to our yeah
whatever you can
specify what you like so take this that
camera dot picture sauce type and then
select camera or photo library whatever
you like
perhaps I will just go with the photo
library and then we also set the
destination type when you would get auto
completion here I think if you import
the camera options up here this is also
any camera package and now you can see
that you directly get the properties we
can use here so use this dot camera
destination type and we will use five
URI because this will return us URL to a
file on the system and this is exactly
what we need so then we can go ahead and
actually get our picture we pass in the
options and then we should get some
image data back and now we can use this
data for our current image just in the
beginning not and set our current image
simply to the image data you can also of
course catch an error so whatever you
like print out an error just what you
like like this okay so this will capture
our image and then set it to our
variables so it will actually be
displayed now we are going to create our
email first inside the email you can
specify all kinds of things most
important might be the two so where do
you want to send it to of course you can
only also open a completely blank email
let's add some stuff here
like this and then the most important
part in this tutorial of course is the
attachment and this is an array of files
and our case we use our current image
and this is enough for the email
composer to get the right image you can
also specify a subject my cool image or
whatever and perhaps a body so there are
all kinds of things and inside the body
you can even use HTML tags if you like
to in that case simply put is HTML to
true okay so this is our email object
and the only thing we need now is to use
our email composer and call open you
could also check if it's a way little
actually before using open but for this
example I will just assume that it's
there and we will run it on a device in
a second the problem now is it's not a
problem but we can't use our native
Cordova functionalities inside the
browser so make sure that you now build
your app for iOS or Android and deploy
it to the device and we will check out
how it looks on the device now all right
so I've deployed the up to my iPhone and
now if I go ahead and click capture
image first of all okay in German but it
would like to access my photos I type
okay I select one image and the image is
displayed inside our card anyway now tap
send email email composer will go up
with the two email in my CC the subject
our body and the actual image at the
bottom so you're now ready to send out
your image as an attachment of course
you could add more images or files like
you want
