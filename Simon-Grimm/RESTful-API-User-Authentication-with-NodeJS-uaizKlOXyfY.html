from deaf tactic in this tutorial I will
show you how to build a simple server or
back end with no js' to get a restful
api with user authentication and for
this i already created a folder with
some files because yeah well we just
need them and you can find them on my
blog the link is below this video so
let's waste no time let's jump in it
first of all we got our package Jason
with some dependencies and make sure to
install them so we need some encryption
we need the Express server and for our
our our authentication we will use the
JSON web token technology and we will
have a MongoDB in the backend so make
sure you have installed that as well and
we also use passport Jas which handles
some authentication stuff inside note
JSF so as you can see our node modules
are installed and at the top level we
just have our server j s in which i've
already required all those things we
just installed and assign the body
partha to get the parameters once we
make a request some development we
initialize our passport j s but we don't
use it by now and we got a dumb you root
which we can call to see if everything
is working up here and finally a lock if
our server is running all right so what
you need as well is an app folder in
which we have our user J s so
I'm gonna put this down for a second
so our user is our user schema for our
MongoDB and the user will have a name
this will be a unique unique key but
yeah well it's just for this demo in the
real world you you might don't want to
have the name unique maybe if it's the
nickname in the game then it might be
unique but in general maybe not
and you also has a password which is
also required obviously and by the way
thanks to this block you can find the
link also on my blog where I've gotten
the idea for this user object and
especially the part below here because
we could store our user like this this
would be already fine but we don't want
to store the password in clear text so
therefore once we have the safe function
of our user we will salt the password
and hash it and well save it that way to
our database so the password is never in
clear text anywhere and we won't see it
and also if we do this we have to
implement a special compare function to
compare the password once we got it from
the user on the authentication we will
have to check the clear or the clear
text password with one from the database
but we don't want to see or check any
strings so the encryption library bcrypt
will handle all of this for us so this
is our user module and I've already said
it many times you can find all the
source code on my block as well all
right inside the config folder we have
two files data board and passport j/s
passport is empty right now but inside
the database we just export to variables
so secret which will be yeah well the
secret we use to encrypt our total
and the link to our MongoDB database so
this database does not have to exist by
now it's fine
MongoDB will handle this once we call it
so please make sure you have MongoDB
installed and once you have you can just
start it with Mongo or whatever system
you use and yeah however you use it I
also use Robo Mongo to inspect my
database but that's up to you we will
maybe check it later all right
so by now our server should be fine and
we should be able to start it so we got
the lock the server should be running
and let's try to get to our demo root
and I will use postman because this is a
great tool to test your REST API so get
localhost 8080 and that is the response
hello so the API will be under slash API
but this is just to see everything's up
and running
alright so if you've got everything
covered up here we are fine to create
some authentication and let's get
started with that so first of all open
your all this can be closed open your
passport is as I said we use passport
Jas and passport Jas uses the term of
strategies so we have to implement a
specific strategy to assign that
strategy later on to our route
so our JSON web token strategy will
require the passport JWT package dot
strategy so we have also installed this
right here
okay next we need to get the user so we
obviously need our user module or not
module model and we also want to have
our config secret so we need to require
our config the database and we don't
need to say J s at the end all right and
this point we want to export a function
so inside our server we will then use I
can show you how to write below this or
below that wherever we can say require
today record our config Passport
and we pass our current passport object
to this day a passport configuration so
we will call it like this and so inside
here we can handle the passport object
let's see first of all let's create an
options because you can sign some more
options for now I will just use the
secret or key parameter and this is our
config secret but you could assign many
other things just check out passport J
as to see what's possible alright what
we need to do now is say passport use
our new j WT strategy and we create this
one with options and the function which
will get a payload of our total and also
this done okay now the hell begins
alright so this will called
when the user tries to access protected
route and in my example I just look for
the user if it's inside our database so
this is obviously not completely a
recommended or this is not everything
you should do
I also posted this question below my
article but let me finish a few lines
right now so if we find the user and
some or accountant error
we return the done object with the error
and false because authentication was not
successful but if we find the user we
can just call our done function and pass
the user object we found and as a
fallback we also have to call it with
false so okay sorry at this point you
should maybe see already what's missing
think about it for a second yes so we
just take the ID from the payload and
try to find this user inside our
database and return it there's obviously
no password check right here but you
could easily implement this and this
part is left for you you will see how to
check the passport later in another
function but yeah I'll leave it open to
you right now because this is enough for
now
all right back to our server J as before
we use this we also want to open their
connection with Mongoose and for this we
use config dot database which is the
string you know to our MongoDB all right
we have our passport initialized and did
JSON web token strategy assigned so
let's see it on
and create a bundle for our API roots
and this will work like this after we
have to find all our roots and assign
them to API routes we can just say app
use use our API roots on the slash API
so this makes it a bit more easier to
structure everything I'm also putting
everything inside server J as you could
obviously have some modules more and
export and import them but for now this
should be fine so first of all our first
API root will be opposed to slash sign
up because we need users to register and
we have this function with the request
the response we put it to our API roots
and in all of those posts or get I'm
making or implementing right now you
will see a lot of your error handling
this sucks a bit but it's better to have
it so if anything's missing
in that case we have no success and we
will also always just return the message
so something's missing at this point but
if we can find the name and the password
inside the request we will try to create
a new user and we will pass the name as
the request body the name and the
password should be request body oh sorry
request body dot password so this is our
new user object we created we now try to
save this and again an error could
procure
and in that case again we will turn this
I'm not completely sure about the return
here I will just leave that away for now
yeah maybe yeah
whatever this might be username already
exists for example or more general error
but if we are lucky we can return true
and we have a great success successful
created user alright so this is our
signup method and right now we can
already test this so where is it yes
okay we kill it
what's wrong I don't know
let's start again and so our route was
API signup let's say Simon and the
mighty password is password and we get
success to successful created user let's
take a look at Robo mango right now so
find your database sorry
and there's the ID Simon and the
password just like we wanted to have it
it's completely hashed or salted or
whatever there's no chance we can see
anything of the clear password at this
point and that's exactly what we wanted
and if I send this request out again we
get successful because this username
already exists
and let's try this case no password
please pass name and password so this is
just like we wanted to behave let's move
on to our next function which will be
our authenticate function again we need
to post to authenticate and again the
function
and this time we start made with user
fine one and we can search just by the
name because the name is unique in my
example but otherwise you would have to
use the user ID or something like that
so here's a fine one and again we need
some error handling it's beautiful I
know we got an error let's just throw it
at this point but if we got and well we
don't have a user we also want to return
specific stages this time because if we
can't find him he's not authorized and
let's return the 403 you know he is not
allowed and the success will be false
the message will be authentication
failed user not found well maybe this is
No 403
this is just an yeah another error but
let's keep it so you know how to use
this alright so if we find the user by
his credentials we need to compare the
password
keep in mind we're not protecting this
root by the JSON web tour s 4j s this
root is public so at this point we need
to handle the authentication by ourself
so this is why we call user compare
password and we pass the request body
password and the callback function so if
we find a match so this is good and
there's no error well let's keep at this
right now this would be the case if
there's some error and this is not
correct
well at this point that would be correct
maybe wrong password something like this
because we have found the user the
password is not matching but if the
password is correct
we got the user and everything's fine so
this is the important point where we
create our JSON web token and we encode
the complete user object and use our
secret key for this so this is a very
important line because this creates the
token which will be used for
authentication later on and obviously we
then want to send out this token the
success would be true in this case and
the toe
would be JWT token so passport is or
especially the jason web token extension
or strategy once the term to be in this
yeah syntax with a space and with JWT in
front of it if we just have it at this
one position and yeah well later we need
to extract it
in the backend we can keep it I don't
really like that we have to use it like
this but for now or in general it's fine
for me because it's working and yeah
it's not that that bad alright so yeah
let's go back to our server start it
again and go back to postman so I
created a user with Sun and password I
think so no this is old okay I cannot oh
whatever
so well let's try it with a warm
password wrong password obviously but
let's try it with the correct one and as
you can see we get a success true and we
got this
Toton we don't know what's exactly
inside but yeah we just have to assign
this in the front end to every request
and our back-end will handle the rest
with the tone great right yeah I like it
too okay so you might be a bit concerned
because we encode the complete user
object in the total I'm not sure if this
is a security problem yes there's the
password in the user object but it's the
salted encrypted whatever password and
the total is also encrypted I'm not sure
if there could be any problems I'm not
the the mighty security guy maybe you
know this better so if you know if this
is bad or whatever please leave me a
note I would really love to hear your
comments about this let's finish our app
with our last root and this will be a
protected root so only users will the
JSON web token their request will have
access to this
so make a get route let's call it member
in for whatever you like and at this
point we call passport and say
authenticate and we have to specify a
strategy and this is the JSON web token
strategy we defined before and we also
have to pass or I'm not completely sure
if we have to pass this but session
falls because we don't have any sessions
in our example all right close this and
now comes our request response and first
of all at this point we want to get the
information which is stored in the total
of the requests so we have to extract
the toe and therefore we will just pass
the headers because well yeah I think
it's the best way to have the total in
the front-end always to the headers
aside and let's create a little function
get toe below
this comes because well we have this
special syntax and also we make the
security check or the check if the
headers are set and also especially the
authorization header because this is the
object which holds our JSON web token
later on so we crafted our mighty head
on now it's the time to split it I'm
sorry for this a bit maybe I don't
really like this code because we just
have it because the JWT is in front of
our tone and this would be novella token
if we decode it like this so we split
and we return the first which is just
the polluting or pure tone if for some
reasons this is not correct the token is
also not correct and we retired now and
also if we are not able to find any
headers
well we'll return well as well we could
get leave this way in just by the way
whatever we get the total or we get null
so back to our member info if we
actually got it open we can do stuff if
we don't get it till we return again a
403 because well the user has no totin
provided
but if we find the tone and at this
point we can also be sure that passport
authentication was successful because
this is running before all of the code
inside this route is executed so our
user is successful authenticated and we
got the correct tone from the header we
need to decode our JSON web token so
call JWT decode and pass the token and
again also we need our secret which we
use to encode our total now we can again
find our user just by its name and this
will be decoded dot name because the
complete user object was stored or is
stored in the JSON web token
so again if there's arrow for now just
let let it throw in production you will
get a problem if you just row an arrow
but for this example this is fine and
again if we are not able to find this
user something is wrong for some reason
but I think this case can actually not
occur because if this user is somehow
incorrect or whatever we would catch
this in the password strategy but it's
better to have it so just leave it there
and if we have a success we can create a
man object with success too and the
message will say welcome in the member
area and Oh welcome in the memory yes we
need to use a dot name and this so oh is
there anything wrong
yes ok so if we can identify the user
correctly we have access to all the
properties so we can greet him with this
name inside this area all right so this
is our member info route and let's go
back to our server restart it and ok we
have successfully set up we use the
authentication we copy this tote
we heat onto the get member info root
and we create a header called
authorization we paste our totin and we
get a success welcome in the member area
assignment without passing any member
information or anything else everything
is right here in this totem and if we
just remove one character we will get an
unauthorized with 401 this comes from
our passport security and yeah that's
exactly how we have achieved our
security inside the nodejs backend in
the next part I will show you the
front-end for this and how to yeah start
this tone and make the request but the
back end is more hard or it's here it's
complicated the front-end is way more
easier so if you like to get informed
