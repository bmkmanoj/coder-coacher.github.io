from the ionic academy in this quick one
I will show you how you can create a
wheel picker component for your ionic
app and let's dive right into it so I've
created a blank new ionic app and first
of all we add a cadaver plug-in called
Cordova wheel selector so you will find
this also under the name wheel selector
but in general this is called we don't
pick error I don't know why it's
selector but anyway make sure to add the
Cordova plug-in to your project and once
this is finished also at the according
Bionic native package for the wheel
picker once this is done we can go to
the app module file and import the wheel
selector Wow
automatically imported amazing and also
edit to the providers and we also want
to use some dummy JSON data so we will
use the HTTP client as well and
therefore import the HTTP client module
from an angular common slash HTTP like
this and at the HTTP client module to
your imports so that's all for the setup
part let's move on to our page perhaps
we can build the amazing view so we'll
pick whatever and inside we simply need
two buttons to trigger two functions so
the first will be open picker open
picker and the second one will call a
bit more advanced one
remote picker so not really a remote
picker but remote Jason pika
whatever that's all for the view and now
we can continue with our home TS so
first of all at the selector mm-hmm the
wheel selector and make sure the import
is right and I will also add the toast
controller just for some verification of
what we've picked then let me bring in
some dummy JSON data
so I've created this dummy Jason which
holds two arrays one with some days and
with some amazing people from ionic
perhaps you noticed the names and then
we got our two functions which were
opened picker and the second one was
good I took another look this would have
given error otherwise so we got those
two functions now let's start with a
basic one we can use our selector it
only has shown height so of course we
use show and then we need to pass in
some options and quite a few options we
can use and I will also add then block
already and that's it so regarding the
options first of all you can set a title
so let's say select your contact
whatever you want this will be at the
top of the picker
then you could say something like
positive button text choose also of
course negative button text and then the
most important stuff is actually the
items to display and this needs to be an
array and each entry of the area is one
wheel in the wheel picker so walden
column more or less and let's make the
first
this dot dummy Jason days and the second
one this dummy Jason dot people so now
we have a wheel with two wheels or a
pickup with two wheels
one day's born people and we can select
from them what you could do as well is
say default items so if you want to pre
select something so this would be for
the index zero which means this targets
the first wheel and the values should be
this dummy Jason days at the position
whatever you want dot description so you
have to specify the real value in here
let's also pre select one for the second
wheel and this time we use people one
dot description so we will say that
something will be pre-selected in the
result block we will get something back
and let's craft a string for our toast
notification which says selected result
at position zero which is the result of
the first wheel and there we also use
description of course you could use
something else so you will have the
index as well of the result so that
means you could access more data of this
block if there would be more data will
and now let's bring in the second result
of the second wheel and also let's use
description here so that's it
now we craft a little toast from this
toast controller create just to display
what we've actually selected we could
also have some scope variable a no scope
I've been with some angularjs lately
so no scope in here and then chose
present and that so this is basically
how you bring up a new wheel pickup
inside Europe
let me copy this for the remote picker
and for the remote pickup we will use
the random user API so we make an HTTP
request which we haven't imported right
so private HTTP HTTP client not sure if
this is right I'll remove it for now so
then go ahead this HTTP GET then we make
a request to this URL so random user
perhaps if I can bring it in you see it
will give us some JSON data inside a
result array so we subscribe to the
result here result and then we do
something with the result of course we
then need to put our show of the picker
inside this block because this isn't as
an operation and now select your content
whatever we can keep this like it is and
now for the items we pass in our result
at position results so you might have
seen it and we bring it in one more time
the result is an array itself so an
array which contains multiple users but
now the default value which the selector
tries to access is not there because in
general it will look for the key
description now we could map the data
but what we can do as well is pass in
display key and let's see the completion
so the JSON key to display by default it
is description and we say we want to use
the display key
email of this object and then the result
whatever but now it's resolved at the
position zero that may not description
any more so as we are using Cordova
plugins we cannot simply run this inside
the browser I will show you an
alternative but first let's see this on
a device in action
alright so use the app on my device and
let's start with the first function open
picker brings up the picker at the
bottom and you can see it really looks
like a native iOS picker and also we see
that we got some pre selected items so
for the first row we have the last day
Friday selected for the second we have
the first description which is mix so we
can now pick whatever we want
perhaps Wednesday with brandy and choose
nuc selected Wednesday with brandy and
of course you can bring it up all the
time it looks really nice you could add
more columns other later and customize
it completely to your needs so let's
take a look at the second one so if I
hit open remote Jason picker it takes a
few seconds to load or perhaps one or
two seconds actually but if you make a
request at that point perhaps show short
loading indicator and then we can see
that we got some random emails here at
the bottom I can select one and choose
it and we see is selected the email so
this means you can also bring in your
own Jason from your back-end and display
it somehow in this cool picker format
now this picker still has a few
limitations so first of all its Cordova
plug-in which means you can't use this
inside the browser if you're building a
PWA or deploy your app as a website this
is not really helpful also a little
problem is that you need to choose a
display key at this point and if you
have multiple columns and only one
display here
you need to somehow map your data to
match the given display key or the one
you pricked so you have to make some
transformation on the result of your API
because it's not very likely that it
automatically fits your needs so I told
you that I wanted to show you an
alternative so this is the ion multi
picker I initially wanted to create this
tutorial with this one but then pick the
Karaka one for some reasons and the ion
multi picker as you can see it looks
more or less the same but as you can see
it really looks like it's made for iOS
and on Android this might not feel so
native and that's why I picked the color
of a plug-in but this plugin has some
advantages for example what you can do
is specify parents so this means if you
would select some special value in the
first column the second would change
depending on which parent &amp;amp; parent you
selected in the first one and which
children you have added for the second
one so this plug-in would give you a bit
more flexibility regarding what can be
displayed but the actual UI is not that
native like the Cordova plug-in we have
right here so make your decision what
you need what's more important to you if
you can somehow make it happen try to
use the cutover one which will give you
the best UI experience for the user if
you have complex data and you need this
child structure perhaps go with the
other one or wait until somebody has
merged or fixed the error on this
cordova plugin but it's still open since
last summer so I don't know if or when
this might be changed but this UI is
just amazing with a quarter of a plug-in
all right I hope you enjoyed this quick
