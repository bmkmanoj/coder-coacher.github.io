the ionic academy in this video i will
show you how you can easily open a PDF
document with your ionic app and both a
local file and also a file which is on a
server so I've created a blank new ionic
app and we need to add a few Cordova
plugins so first of all we add the file
transfer plugin you might have heard
that this is deprecated but actually we
can use it still and still ongoing for a
long time because it works and it will
continue to work you might be able to do
this on a other way so they won't work
anymore on this plugin but still the
current world should work for a long
time and it's great for downloading
files to our device which we need if we
want to display a file from our remote
API or anything else like this so the
second one is Cordova plug-in file which
is also needed with a file transfer in
combination to write the file to our app
and also to specify the location of the
file inside our apps folder or anywhere
else on our device finally one more
plug-in which we need is the document
viewer and this is the plug-in which
will actually open our PDF file both the
local and also the other one once we've
downloaded it and what I've done so far
as well is I've added a simple PDF right
to the assets folder of the app so we
can try both simply add any PDF you have
run finally make sure to finish our
setup by installing the ionic native
packages for file file transfer and the
document viewer so everything that we've
just installed alright when this is done
you can go to
your app module and start by adding file
file transfer and document viewer and
then go ahead and add all of them to the
array of your providers so we can use
them inside our app later that's all for
the setup phase so far so let's continue
with the home page actually we just need
two buttons so button I on button
whatever nothing fancy here let's call
the first one open local PDF and open
local and then a second button right
below and this will download and open
PDF so download and open PDF okay as
well here let's get this right then we
can continue with the actual home ts and
we need a few things here so we need
private document which is our document
viewer then we need private file and
make sure that you're not selecting this
generic interface file but the write
import from ionic native and finally we
need transfer which is file transfer all
right so we got our imports right let's
add the two functions so the first one
local second was download and open so
for local this is actually super simple
we can directly use the document viewer
and say view document and then we need
the URL to our file which is in assets /
I think I call this five tools PDF right
it's five tools PDF perfect and this is
still read because we need the content
type and for this it's of course
application PDF and it's still write
read because we need the options you
could pass in an empty object or you can
create some options of the type document
viewer options so the import also from
this one and then specify whatever you
like for example the title my PDF and
then pass in the options if you want to
simply check out the page of the
document view are for all the options
you can set in here so this is already
enough to open the local PDF this also
works with the WK webview on iOS which
had a tiny problem if we would have used
only the file open up plugin so let's
continue with a download first of all we
need a path where it will be stored and
one thing we should add is platform also
from ionic angular of course right here
because we should check if this platform
is iOS so we can simply make a little
split in which path it should be stored
because the Android path did not work so
well with iOS for some reason I'm not
completely sure
normally the data directory is always
fine on iOS but in this case perhaps the
document viewer expect it to be in
another test so let's pick for iOS the
documents directory and Android the data
directory then go ahead and create your
transfer object by calling this dot
transfer create and
and transfer download and then we need
to fill in the barrios so first of all
the source let me copy in one source I
created so it's on my dev tactic block
something I just uploaded there then we
need the target which is actually this
should be passed plus whatever you want
to call it just call in my file and then
you will get back a file entry with a
downloaded object and from this file
entry you can now get the URL by calling
entry to URL like this and this URL is
now perfectly fine for again our
document viewer
so go ahead this document you document
URL perhaps leave out the options in
this case and that's it a cute little
function which will download the file to
our local folder and immediately display
it so all in one function super easy
super handy and easy to use as we've
used Cordova plugins we now need to
check how this works on a real device or
simulator so let's go ahead with that
here's the app on my iOS simulator and
we can go ahead and simply open the
local PDF immediately this nice view
comes up and we can close it and reopen
it we can zoom in so it's a nice preview
of our PDF now if we click download and
open it will take a few second perhaps
to download the file and then we are
back inside this document viewer we can
view the whole document we can somehow
zoom in but I guess I just broke my
simulator no it still works and you also
got these options at the top you see the
little images at the bottom so this is
really a nice preview
of our PDF and that's it for today's
quick win you can now open your PDF
files both from your assets folder if
you plan to ship them with your app or
you can also download them just with a
few lines from any server you're hosting
your app and then open it with the
document viewer inside your audio gap if
you enjoyed this quick win make sure to
subscribe to my channel check out also
the other videos and also go ahead and
join the ionic academy if you're
interested in becoming an ionic
developer
learn from all the courses the great
community and everything that we've
prepared over at the ionic Academy comm
have a great day and see you inside the
