from deaf tech take with a new video
tutorial on how to create a simple to-do
app with react native and firebase so
let's first of all start with the blank
app we also need to have a firebase
account so make sure you're signed up on
firebase it's free for a basic account
and you will have your first app here so
firebase is in short words a cloud
database and we will use it to push our
to dues to this firebase database and we
will also read the two deuce we have
pushed so our app is in complete sync
with our database so I already have this
first app here and it's currently empty
we will need this ID yours will be
different I think so let's wait until
our react app is ready okay it is and
let's see some code also we can already
open our iOS project because we can just
run it in the simulator and refresh it
all the time and we will see the changes
instantly which is one of the coolest
features of react native so first of all
go to your index I Oh SJS and for now
let's remove everything inside the
styles and also this create class
because we will use a bit different
syntax in our app
all right so we require react native
obviously and we will also require
firebase so also make sure to install
with NPM the firebase package so this
package will open up the connection to
our database and hopefully we are fine
now alright so as I said we don't need
that much inside here but first of all
let's also load some more references we
need component approaches three
stylesheet a text a view we need the
touchable highlight which is the react
native way of making a button right now
we need a text input field for our two
do's and finally we also need a ListView
for showing our two dues so at this
point at the top of our app we should
require our firebase reference package
so we can use it all the time later so I
said you should remove everything inside
you that's because we want to use the
new is-6 syntax which is looking a bit
better in my eyes and it will be the
standard in I hope not long time from
now so yeah so start to use it by now it
worked with react native and it's
everything we need so as you can see we
have a class which has an extensive
component this looks a bit like Java and
well it's fine it definitely looks
better than years ago in JavaScript so
our constructor should handle a basic
reference
to the firebase so we say my fire bass
riff is a new firebase and now we need
the URL so paste your URL inside and to
give it a short try let's say my
firebase ref set which means we want to
push an object to firebase and we give
it a title say hello world and the
author of this is me all right so let's
save it and let's try to reload it all
right yes that's correct
come on yes
all right so we don't have a render
function at this point but this is no
problem but if you look at your firebase
you now have those two entries which is
pretty amazing in my eyes for just using
this line and this line and we are able
to set data to the cloud database so we
don't need this let's remove it we can
remove all the entries from our
dashboard right here so we have a clean
- part now all right I hope this is
working for you at this point because
this is the base for our app if this
isn't working right now leave a comment
or yeah go to recode again just a few
lines this should be working all right
let's get started with our real to-do
app so first of all we want to keep
an array of items and also s wait a
second
we define the items array on our state
which is pretty yeah best way with react
native and we will also have a new to do
which is linked to our input field for
adding new to Deus so we got the to-do
source this is the source for our
ListView I'm not a big fan of this it's
not like iOS table view at the moment
it's more like a scroll view and some
more behavior to make it look like a
ListView but it doesn't feel that good
I have read some frets about this and
hopefully we will see a better component
in the near future or a standard iOS
table view so this is just to
differentiate every row okay and as I
said the items rep is not our items
array right now but this is a reference
to a child object on firebase or on our
firebase reference and we want to have a
child like the egg with items as you
have seen in Safari we had this object
right beneath our root and I want to
have an items well parent below the root
and all the Cheetos below the item
because otherwise yeah if you would have
other things in your database that will
just explode at some point all right so
we got the new to do a ListView
datasource the row has changed and yeah
that's pretty much everything we need at
this point so where's this red
yeah I should add some yes well let me
do this
give me a sink so I added and Jason
Darcy with es next true and this
prevents the errors we previously had in
our file another set we want to have a
reference to our items finally so those
are the real traduce inside items but we
don't have any items at this point so we
can just in it an empty array the max
function we want to implement is
component dismount so this one will be
called once our app is loaded and only
once and inside this method we want to
register our app on some firebase events
and those events are child edit and
child removed which means whenever an
item is added or removed to our or from
our firebase database our app will get
informed and this code will be executed
so let's go ahead
and inside so once that when a child is
added we obviously want to push it to
our items array and we always want to
keep the ID of the item and we just can
use data snapshot dot key so this will
be a unique ID which is generated by
firebase we need this for deleting our
items later if you may ask why we need
this and obviously we want to have the
text value of a to do so the to do is
pushed to our items array but we also
have to update our state or in this case
set the state so it's always better to
completely set the item you are the
variable you want to update and we say
this dot state to do so and we want to
clone the rows of our to use so this
will add all the to dues to the to-do
source which are currently not inside
the troduce errs but inside our items I
hope this is pretty much clear and so
this function will always be executed
when a child is added the second one is
child removed
and well a bit different but just in
what we do so first of all we want to
reset our items array and for this we
can use the filter method so we go
through every item inside our array and
we keep all those IDs which are not like
the ID of the snapshot I hope this is
clear I had this function previously in
like six or eight lines and then a
friend of mine told me how to use this
function and yeah please use it and this
will make your code a lot cleaner and a
lot shorter all right and this will stay
the same we obviously still want to add
or update our data source and yes set
our state again so those are the
functions to catch when something
happens on firebase now let's take care
of adding and removing a to-do inside
our app
oh yes I should have this sorry
yes now it looks good all right so
adding a to do is well quite simple but
we want to check if there are any text
inside our input field so make sure it's
not equal an empty string and in this
case we can use our item to ref which is
the reference to the child on firebase
and just call push and we want to push a
new object with the to do and this is
our new to do the ID we used here is
automatically created on firebase and is
unique so we don't have to handle the
the idea at this point and finally we
want to update our state and make the
input field empty again we don't have to
handle our arrays stuff or anything else
at this point because all of those
things will be handled in the colored
egg or add a function executed here and
as I said removing is also very very
easy we first of all get the item by
using the items wrap and also passing
the idea of this to do to get one
specific to do entry and then we just
call removed
that's everything for removing a to do
all right I hope you could follow to
this point we still have nothing inside
our app because we don't have a render
function so let's take care of this now
okay so we also need some styling and
I'm a bit lazy so I'm gonna copy the
styling this is not really interesting
this is just some style we can use from
now on and having it now will make it a
bit easier for you to understand what we
are actually doing
I hope so first of all we have a basic
view around everything and this is our
app container use the flexbox styling
and it has a flex of one right now at
the top we want to have sorry we want to
have a simple title view and inside the
title view we want to have a text
yes this takes a moment just skip this
if you don't want to see how to create a
react native view so this is the title
of our app we got a text we got the
title view and everything is wrapped in
the app container so below the title the
main part of our app takes place and
first of all we got our input container
yes like this and inside this container
we got this text input field yeah the
input container is also has the Flex
Direction row so we will have container
and button right to the container or to
their text input and the text input uses
styles that input and well do we need
this mmm yes maybe we should use it for
now but yes we need that
so whenever the text changes we say the
text should be set to our state and the
new to-do will be set to the text close
close close all right
and also the value of this text input
field should always be this state come
on Oh
notice this interesting well that's cool
all right so I hope this is clear and as
I said next to our text input we want to
have a touchable highlight which is a
button and we obviously need a bit of
styling to make it look like a button
and on press we want to call at - and
this will add our to-do and uses the new
to do we have in our state and also we
can set the underlay color well yeah so
this is for pressing the button and also
inside the touchable highlight we have a
text which is the button text I'm sorry
this is not really a cool way of
creating a button but it's currently the
only one I know about there are some NPM
packages or react native packages and if
you found a good package or anything for
creating a cool button please let me
know I would be really happy yes I'm not
sure where I get this arrow it's all the
time all right so our button takes is
simply add for our adding our to do all
right
the last part missing is our ListView
and it is not really hard we have to set
the datasource and so yes I just have to
type state that is really really cool
all right the data source is the two
juicers we have always set and updated
and we have to tell the ListView how a
row gets rendered and we pass a function
we currently don't have but this one
will be named render row and we bind the
current state to this function alright
that's our view it obviously won't work
because render row is not defined so
when the row and this one is the last we
need for our app I don't like this it's
better
okay so every row is in general a
touchable highlight which means the
button it should have the same color on
touch and also on press we define and
function so every time we press a row we
want to remove exactly that to do which
is assigned to this row okay this remove
data yes and inside the button we also
again happy' view and this view should
be around everything else I guess yes it
would be a better idea so this is the
view we will see actually and this is
styled row and inside no inside we also
have a simple text label some styling
and at this point we use raw data Dutch
text to display the to do of this row
you closes and next few is not closing
because we also have to add a separator
by hand as I said it's more a scroll
view than a list view and this separator
is just where is it yeah a gray color at
the bottom of a row so not that cool but
it's working
alright also what we call if our app is
working let's check it out
yes and there it is that's the title
view that the text input field and
that's the button for adding our to use
maybe if we have a bit of luck this is
already working right now let's give it
a try this is my first to do obviously
this this date is not defined but we
will find that spot where is it I guess
yes I hope I don't have any more of this
so once again this is my first to do
tada
this is my first to do and instantly we
see the items child as I said we see the
unique ID and also we see the to do this
is my first to do okay let's add some Oh
25
yes I really love the debugging with
react native this is just so simple okay
I'm not sure why I'm not seeing my
separator isn't it called separator
obviously it's a separator
yes sorry for my English and let's
refresh it yes
oh come on so this is a ListView as you
can see it repeals yeah it's okay for
now let's test the last function we want
to press this testing to row and the
object gets deleted and I think also
when we remove the object this point yes
our app gets informed and the to do will
be deleted all right so this is how you
create a connection between your react
native app and firebase firebase has
some paid plans but for testing and for
using some basic stuff it's completely
free you should try it out it's really
great for syncing your data across
devices or whatever you plan and yeah I
hope you like this join my channel and
leave a comment so have a nice day and
thanks for watching
you
