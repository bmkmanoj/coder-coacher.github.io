tactic today we will take a short look
at react native which was released some
days ago and this is a framework for
building mobile or hybrid applications
based on Facebook's react framework
which is here very well known so in
order to get started there are some
things you need to have so react native
is currently only available for iOS apps
so you need to have a Mac and you need
Xcode and furthermore you need note and
watch man
because ya react just use it so if you
set up all those things you can start
and install the react native CLI which
will help you to set up a new project
and that is exactly what we will do now
so react native in it detected react yes
so this will create a new project you
will notice from my ionic apps it's very
basic stuff okay so yeah you might know
that Facebook has a lot of open source
stuff you can see it on this page and
react is one of the biggest things and
now there's react native so let's see
what we what we have after our initial
build so we already have the Xcode file
we have a folder with some iOS stuff we
have the JavaScript file and node
modules and package Jason is some stuff
from nodejs
so at this point we can already open
this
we can also open the escort pro okay so
let's try and run our app first of all
so this will open react package our and
package all those things into the app
and our app comes up okay so here's our
welcome to react native and it says to
get started
heat the file and press to reload well
interesting let's take a look so here we
have the JavaScript file with yeah well
just take a look at part here we're
currently at so let's try and add some
more characters here whatever save it
and come on reload you need to press it
twice because at the back and you see
it's updated so that's that's a big
point for react Nate if you don't have
to rebuild your app you can just real
out on the level ice if you make any
changes here if you remote it reload and
it there so this will speed up your
complete development process a lot ok so
let's go through all this stuff one by
one so we start here the you strict is
just some basic stuff you general you
should always have when building
JavaScript apps it's a better error
handling and yeah just included so this
line might be known to you from all the
note stuff which
take this comadre cria so we require
this react native component okay so the
next lines are a bit crazy-looking so
that's a destructuring assignment which
means now from now on we can use all
those things inside our rest of the file
without always typing react dot app
registry so is here it here or a style
sheet which are all inside this so we
save a lot of time when we use this and
for our first little applet add two more
we need the component and we also need
the touchable highlight touchable
highlight is Facebook or react way of
implementing a UI button or a button in
general which is just something that's
touchable and you can see the the
background a bit more when you touch it
so it's a basic JavaScript
implementation of a button so no problem
at all so let's take this one out for
now and take a look at this first so
this is the styling of our app we create
a style sheet almost like CSS in the web
and you might know some of those
attributes here some might be new so
what will be new to you is the Flex box
which is a yeah somehow new styling or
layouting system which allows to have
all those components in the fluent
design so if you have one above the
other
you yeah you just have rows or you can
also make it well its horizontal or
vertical whatever you like it's a bit
hard to describe I recommend you take a
look at my
blog or just Google for flexbox because
that will be used a lot but it's not
really hard and it's also very useful so
for now let's take those two away and
add button text which will be on our
button with font size ad color white and
he should align himself in the center of
the button and ditional we make a
styling for a button which will have
standard hate the flex direction of this
button is his row so you will have a
background color which is well let's
take whatever you like and again we say
the lines self and this time we say
stretch which will make the button used
to complete space of his flexbox roll so
there's nothing else he will just use
the complete space and if there are any
other things in this row they would
split the the remaining space under each
other and you can say how much space
will the button have and how much the
other components so that's a big point
for the flexbox finally we want to
justify the content in the center ok so
that's a basic styling and you will have
this javascript styling over and over
again so let's continue to our component
or the real app I'm not using the D for
old syntax which was inside here I'm
using a bit newer approach which is
using classes so I think this is the
future and this also looks a lot better
and you should try to start with this as
well ok so inside our class we have the
most important function which is the
render functions so whenever they are
changes inside the view the render
function will be called if you think
this will break your performance don't
worry
Facebook has a cool way to yet to change
the view so it's a bit hard to describe
the state concept and so on you can take
a look for that at the facebook
documentation or whatever I don't want
to discuss that here but just you know
they will make diff internal with the
current state and the new State and just
update the component which needs to be
update so not your complete user
interface is redrawn every time render
is called so it might look a bit
confusing to you we returning something
but every view inside the react native
you represents a state and that makes
everything a lot easier so you always
know in which state you are what your
app is doing and how it should behave in
whatever situation so for now accept it
how it is and let's continue with the
basic view which will have
their containers styling we defined up
here and we can also already close to bu
okay so these jsn issues I don't know
I'm normally doing ionic stuff so I
think my atom doesn't know about react
so inside our view we will have text
which is a simple text label and let's
make it
welcome to react native okay we can
already save it and take a look at it so
as you can see still welcome to react
native inside our view and if you change
anything now if you change this to
whatever you can see the effect
immediately so that's really cool okay
so let's move on we have a little text
label now we want to make a button and
form a function so as I already said we
will use this touchable highlight and
again we assign style and on press we
want to perform
show alert which we need to implement I
can already do this flirt okay so when
we press our button this function will
be called very easy and touchable
highlight should be close and on the
button again we have a text where the
style Styles button text and this will
simply be I alert or whatever you like
and again run it and you see it here so
you can press it it's not really
beautiful at the moment but yeah that's
not why we are here so this button now
already called our shower alert function
but there's no alert at all so that's
where the api's comes into play as I
said we're currently only having iOS
components and ap is so you can take a
look at them on the react native
documentation there are already many
available I don't know how good or how
bad they are in detail sorry but for now
let's just look at this and let's take a
look how we can get this stuff into our
app because that's generally how we
would always work you will take a look
at what we need and how we can implement
it so let's shift this a bit to the side
okay so as you might have seen we need
the alert iOS API so let's add this to
our destructuring assignment so from now
we can use plug got iOS dot alert and we
can give it a title which is awesome
alert and the second one is the message
so saying this is my first react native
alert and we can also give an array of
custom buttons so let's create one
button just for yeah just for the demo
so add an array which consists of
objects which you can see here and I
will just make it text for now kiss
thank you
so
okay so it should be finished save it
reload it press it and awesome a large
my first react negatively Lord and thank
you okay so I don't have talked about
this line it's nothing special it just
loads your component as the root
component of the app so yeah you should
always have this line but for now that's
everything as you can see this might be
a very very mighty framework in the
future right now we're only having
support for iOS which yeah which is just
at this point now problem I think it's
on the development react native is in
version yeah zero point three point one
so there's a long way to version 1.0 and
i think we will see a lot of work from
the facebook team for react native as
they say they're using this inside their
own apps and they're using react so the
community is big and the support will be
big so i recommend you should really
take a look at react native and play
around with it and experience this very
very very very fast development speed
and just see if it fits your needs or if
you like it and yeah if you have any
comments or wishes for the next react
native tutorial or anything else i would
be glad if you leave me a comment or
tweet me so thanks for listening and
good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
