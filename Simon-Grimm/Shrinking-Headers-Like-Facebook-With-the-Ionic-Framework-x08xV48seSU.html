detective with a short video tutorial on
how to make ionic app with shrinking
headers like you might have seen in
Facebook app or some other apps it's a
very popular feature so I'm going to use
this custom ion from ionic and we will
start with a simple blank app okay so we
will install this custom ion with boa
and additionally I will add a Cordova
plugin to change the appearance of our
status bar because that just gives a
very smooth animation so first of all
bower install ionic ion Hana shrink and
save it to your Bower file
okay hopefully everything's working here
and as I said Cordova plug-in ad and
this is poor dot Apache Cordova dot this
bar it's a very common plugin okay and
ionic platform iOS I'm on a Mac so I can
build for iOS if you're not working on a
Mac you obviously can't at the iOS
platform or build for it so let's jump
into the code okay so the first thing
you must do is go to your fjs and if it
loads you need to add the dependency
into your array here so add ionic ion
add a shrink
okay so that's everything we need to do
here okay before we go to the real
including one more thing I recommend you
come on so slow I recommend you add some
custom styling here because otherwise it
might look not as you want it to have so
just insert these lines to get the
animation you want to have okay so well
we could go to come on what's wrong with
it one second please
I'm not sure what's wrong with it one
more thing we might want to do before we
go to the real index and occluding is go
to our App J's again and in this if we
want to set some values the first one is
overlays web view and the second one is
the background color of our stitches bar
and this value is from the ionic
positive color or yeah I guess it's
positive so I just looked it up and
gonna use it here so this way our
stateís Bob will have the same color as
our header bar so that will be a very
cool animation okay
now let's go to our index and here we
have our header your header bar we will
set it to positive so it looks cool and
now we come to our ion content where we
add our custom ion inside this tag so a
dash ring like a directive from
angularjs and test some variable we want
to set here
it's scroll event interval let's say
it's 5 that will make very smooth
animation and inside there repository
they recommend it to add well add some
space at the top so I'm gonna do this as
well if you have any other set up you
might not need this but you can
experiment with that and you will see if
you need it or if you're not needed so
now we want to have a scrolling list
because we want to see our shrinking
headers in action so I'm gonna make a
very simple ng-repeat with well some
cards
whatever it should be fine
and you might know this this is the
custom on a classic card you from ionic
for this case is very very simple so
inside here I need some dummy text I'm
not sure where I can get it from let's
say let me bacon text bacon ipsum okay
give me bacon whatever this is just for
testing so don't find the text it looks
perfect whatever it should be fine
so that should be everything we need
right now so let's try it out in action
as you can see we just had to add this
directive header shrink do you get this
feature we want to have on our ion
content and hopefully it will work
okay
okay obviously I made a mistake
somewhere so let me check it and you
repeat okay so obviously I had to
include this line in our index.html so
that our ionic header shrink gets loaded
so let's try it out okay so we should
have status power in this color and we
should have a small head of shrink
animation when we scroll our content
okay so here's our app with our dummy
text and we have a blue header and we
have the blue status bar and now if we
scroll up our header gets blurred out a
bit and leaves behind there so a very
cool animation you could obviously add
this to the bottom as well and if you
scroll up it comes back very cool I
think and with nearly no lines you just
had to add this and well not really
anything more so if you liked this
tutorial I would be very happy if you
subscribe to my channel or follow me on
Twitter so come back for new tutorials
in the next time goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
