from detective with a video tutorial on
real iOS push notifications with the
ionic IO push service so for this
example I have a simple starting
template which you can find on my blog
post to this video and if you want you
can start with that
I recommend that because that will make
things a lot easier I already had a post
on easy ionic push notifications some
weeks ago and those were just
development push notifications so this
time we want to send out real iOS push
notifications they will be in a sandbox
motors but there's no problem to change
them to real push notifications later on
alright so I already started my install
script which I put into this directory
so you can just call the init script and
this will install all the files the
services the Cordova plugins and
everything you need for this tutorial
and hopefully this will finish very soon
ok let's take a look at how our app
currently looks we got two buttons to
identify our user and to register for
push notifications and we also got tiny
controller doing some things so those
things you can find in the last tutorial
I won't cover that now the thing we must
change right now is the app ID and the
API key and for this we need to upload
our app to the ionic IO service so
called ionic upload and this will create
a new app in your ionic IO dashboard
which is currently empty
so we wait and once this is done you
should get an app ID year and also an
app in your account all right this is
our app ID which should be the same yes
like here and paste this one to your app
ID second step go to your app settings
keys and copy the public API key paste
it here and we're fine
currently we have development pushed on
so let's give it a try
we call ionic serve okay sorry
and this is our app we can identify and
we can register for push so this is our
key it's also here blocked okay now
let's test the push this is only
development push not the final iOS one
so call I only push - s in the directory
and you will be asked for your API
private key which is this one and also
the device toe which is the one we just
locked here okay copy that one paste it
a lot message hello this is tactic alert
whatever pitch count we don't need this
right now successfully cute the push and
here it is here's our alert message so
in general this is how development push
notifications work it's not that hard
but you should have your app up until
this point so you should be able to send
some development push notifications and
now the real fun begins I'm a bit sorry
for the steps but I also linked to this
one in my tutorial on the block so
there's the document from the ionic team
which guides you through all of the
steps so if anything is unclear after
this video just go there and check it
out again so we need to create some
certificates IDs and yeah a lot of
things Apple wants to have so let's
start and go to your keychain and from
the top select keychain certificate
create now request a certificate from a
certificate authority enter your mail
and select save to disk yeah whatever
okay now you obviously need to be in the
iOS developer program so go inside your
area select app IDs and create a new app
ID I will call it def tactic push and ok
this one will become deaf dot the tactic
push and also make sure you select push
notifications from down there okay
submit we're fine so somewhere yes here
it is
now go to edit go down go down until
this area so here we can create a
certificate for the development push and
for the production in this tutorial I
will just make development certificate
so if you want to use the service in a
production app you obviously also or
just have to use the second option so
this dialog asks for the file we just
created so selected alright once you
selected it click generate and this is
your Apple push services certificate
so once you've installed it
go back to your keychain and you should
find some development push certificate
here alright right click it and export
it and save it as a p12 file somewhere
where you can find it wizard will ask
for a password so please don't end
a password for the file but afterwards
you will have to pass your admin
password so make sure no password on the
file button select your admin password
all right
we've set up those things last thing we
need to do is create a provisioning
profile so select the iOS development
select the one you just created which is
this one in my example select the
certificates' yeah who's included and
which devices and call it whatever you
like yes and generate download and also
install that profile all right
those were the steps to create all the
profiles and things we need hopefully
now let's go back to our app we need to
make some minor changes
so one thing we need to do is obviously
we don't want to enable deaf pushes
anymore also one of the most important
steps is go to your config
I'm sorry go to your config and change
this ID to whatever your app ID was so
in my example it was deaf tactic the
tactic push I guess it's this true come
the dectective tactic push yeah that
should be this one all right
now I have not added the platform by now
so ionic platform iOS and once this is
done we call ionic built iOS I'm not
sure if this already happened at the
step before but well just do it it
doesn't take that long okay hold on
we're just a few steps away from sending
our push now we need to call the ionic
push service and pass them our
development push certificate so call
ionic push iOS - dev side and insert
come on no code completion I guess it
was this one
certificates yes hopefully okay invalid
okay yeah obviously it's not this but
this file okay successfully uploaded the
certificate perfect the last step we
need to do now is again call the ionic
push service and tell them the
production mode is development so n is
for iOS sandbox push notifications this
would be production notifications but we
just want the development push
notifications right now okay so I launch
the Xcode project and inside you should
see your bundle identifier right here
there's one more thing I have to insert
because I'm using iOS 9 on my device
I have to copy this part so if you
encounter problems at this step some
nsurl connection problems insert those
things or just ask me for the lines but
you will find them I am quite sure on
Google like the first result okay so
even I launched the application now on
my device you can obviously not see it
but there's nothing special happening so
again you can take a look at the console
I click identify user and I click
register for push and I get some air
alright so there are some minor issues
but I'm not sure I just remove the
project the iOS platform and edit it
again and called NPM install I don't
know there are some problems with Xcode
7 or iOS 9 I'm not sure so again maybe
you need to insert this key if you get
nsurl problems anyway I launch the app I
clicked identify I registered myself and
I got a token ok so this is good news
for now now go back to your dashboard
and right now where before has been a
video there is now a new tab for ionic
push so click new push and you can
compose your push so this is a push
my message
and this would be appear right here you
would have the option to insert stuff
like this once your users identified but
for now or in general I leave this
because I had some problems here but
well let's see what you can select at
this point you can select who should get
your push notifications so based on
device name user ID whatever settings
you might have assigned to your user but
what I want you to show is if I got
nothing selected and click search
I find this user so my name I'm awesome
and if we go back to our code that's
exactly the user we created in our app
so obviously in your production app you
would insert some real name here maybe
from a login or whatever or maybe you
don't even have that much information
about your user but in general you have
our app ID at which stated was created
the device and stuff like that
so I tried to match this user but for me
somehow this was not working even though
I enabled it right now and clicked on
live but I did not get a notification on
my device I'm not completely sure why
this is or what's the exact problem here
I read that some other people had
problems or that it took a very long
time for the first push oh maybe I can
just try it second push test
but I don't think this will work right
now so this should again match the user
I want to enable it and still I do not
get any push notification on my device
right now although you do not see it but
there's the option right here once
you've created something with a new push
it's called one time notification and
this is the spot okay I obviously got
the wrong okay here it is this is the
spot where you can take your token from
your iOS app and paste it and push a
message saying something like this is is
a test message you can also show your
request here but if you click send now
you should see this message ID and I can
see on my device there's the push coming
up and if you check this below you will
see successfully send and everything
what is expected so this is currently
the fallback to iOS push notifications I
will tell you if one of those will get
sent out but I don't think and I'm a bit
lost because I don't know why they are
not sent so if there's some kind of
magic I do not understand please let me
know I would really love to use this
service but I just can't get it working
maybe last try if I pass a name equal to
my name
it's enabled in new methods have sent
home immediately yes well I want to
enable it but I'm not getting Oh
come on ro I just got the message on my
device
so maybe the filter is the problem
interesting okay I take everything back
I just said and ionic push is really
great no sorry
if you've come this far just try around
it somehow seems to work although I'm
not sure why it wasn't working the first
place maybe you have to select any
filters there or it won't work
okay so on my block you can also see an
image of my iOS device
I won't power it up here in the video
right now because it's just well you
know one push notification on the screen
and nothing special if you want an image
go to my block you will find it there
alright I hope you enjoyed this video
you got the ionic push service running
in your app and if you encounter any
problems let me know on Twitter or
whatever on my block in the comments
section and yeah thanks for listening I
hope you liked it
