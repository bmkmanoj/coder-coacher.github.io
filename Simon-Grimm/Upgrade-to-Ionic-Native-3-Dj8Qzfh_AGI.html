Tech game the ioniq Academy in this
quick win we will take a look at how to
update our ionic native from let's say
words into something to 1/3 because
ionic native change while before
everything was just in this one package
and then now sub-packages with all the
other plugins so your bundle size will
be a lot smaller if you use the new way
so first of all we go ahead and install
the core package which is needed to
install all the other things if you're
starting a new ionic free app this
package will already be installed so in
that case you don't have to install
those as well you might want to install
the ionic native splash screen because
the usage changed as well and also the
status bar so let's see okay so inside
our package Jason we now have those
three entries and we can remove the old
ionic native import from here also let's
say we have inside our application the
text-to-speech plucking use okay this
could be camera this could be whatever
you think about packages like these are
now also I'm sorry
inside ionic native and they're in their
own sub package so make sure to install
the packages you need you have to look
through your app of course previously
you only had ionic native here and now
you need to install all of them one
by one and hopefully our file is updated
sometime let's close it don't save and
reopen and now we see we got the core
package we got those two and we got our
text-to-speech plug-in adding a Cordova
plug-in is still needed like code over
here ionic plug-in add Cordova plug-in
text-to-speech so this is the same like
before but now let's go and move on to
our F module because now we need to
import the status bar and also the
splash screen or is it yes splash screen
and as we're using the text-to-speech we
also need text-to-speech so we see now
this is not correct
maybe the automatic import is not as
good as I hoped no it's not inside that
package of course it's just like splash
screen we have the status bar from ionic
native almost stages bar and we will
have text to speech from ionic native
text-to-speech like this and now we can
use them and put them into our provided
array now it's working again Cordova
plugins won't work inside the browser I
just keep this open to see if we get any
errors but now we've already changed
those three imports inside our app
module and we can go to the F component
because this is the place where most of
the time have the status bar and the
splash screen used right here so we can
go ahead and update our constructor to
look like this now we are injecting the
status bar and splash screen here and
now we need to use
of course those words of the words right
here and as well we need to remove this
import which now becomes the same like
here so you can copy that and paste it
here and now your app component is also
fixed okay so this was updating the
starters well flip screen now let's take
a look at how to update our plugin
actually so it's not text-to-speech like
this anymore but now we import it from
add ionic native text-to-speech and
we're not using it like this anymore but
just like before we're injecting it
inside our constructor so let's call it
TPS of the type takes to speech and we
change this to be this dot TTS and if
you use it you already see that you now
get the options of the text-to-speech
and package speak and stuff so now our
text-to-speech plug-in is updated to
ionic native three also our status bar
on splash screen is updated and we have
removed all references to ionic native
too so if you want to update your other
plugins and apps just follow this scheme
so install the sub package of ionic
native you can find this in the
documentation what's the correct name
and you go our head and go to your app
module and add it to your provider array
just like I did here and then whenever
you use it you import it from the sub
package you inject it inside your
constructor and then you can use it with
this but your variable and you're good
to go to use ionic native three if you
