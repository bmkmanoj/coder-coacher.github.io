static and the ionic economy today we
will build an ionic app with some
dynamic styling so we already know that
we can theme our app using like colors
array or different themes but we can
only switch them before building our app
but what we want to do is building an
app where the user can actually toggle
like light and day mode on and out so
let's go start it and first of all
create our two styles so we will call
them theme dot light dot s CSS and
another file theme the dark as CSS okay
so those two styles will be eventually
applied to our app when the user toggles
on these nodes so for the light theme
let's implement some very basic stuff so
we want to give the ion content a
background color of pure white and also
our tool bar so use that tool bar
background and it will also be white
let's finish the dark theme first so
dark theme in that case ion content will
be yeah what was it again I think like
this looked pretty good also the header
Dutch tool bar background okay and also
we used a different border color in case
we have a dark background because it's
hard to see otherwise yeah it's a freaky
color get over it
so tool bar title it's also a bit dark
if we use it like this so we have to
change it to be more white the thing is
here we need to import
of those two files to our variables so
why do I even have this open I need it
so we need to put an import statement
into our variables as CSS and import
both the theme that light and of course
the theme dark and as we are importing
both styles we cannot use different
ionic utilities or variables inside them
because in general they are both
imported so we would override each other
and we can only interact with our CSS
classes directly inside the dark theme
or light theme block so this is why
we're not using like text background or
something like this but anyways we got
our two two themes files and we have
imported them so what we're going to do
next is we create a provider so run ion
Hg provider and I will call it settings
and this will eventually create a
settings provider and with the current
CLI it should also directly be imported
to your providers array where is it
there okay so most of the stuff we
actually don't need but what we need is
something really cool which is called
behavior subject and this is directly
from our XJS rx so we will see how to
use it it's quite a bit like an
observable but it has some different
functions and they will really help us
so inside our settings provider we will
keep a private variable which is the
currently selected theme and this is off
the type behavior subject and
okay okay inside the constructor we
don't need the HDP provider there's
something wrong be a subject like this
sorry for the spelling error okay inside
the constructor we want to set our team
to a new behavior subject and this is
first of all the first difference to an
observable because a behavior subject
can have a start value so if anybody who
retrieves our theme it will directly get
this dark theme because it is set to on
the beginning value so this is very
important and then we need two functions
here first of all we want to set the
active theme and then of course you
might know it we want to get the active
theme just set the active theme we need
to change our behavior subject and we
want to inform everyone who is
subscribed to this subject and we can do
this by using this theme dot next and
this will submit the value which we
passed the next to all of the
subscribers of the behavior subject so
all of them will get automatically this
update which is pretty cool and exactly
what we need now if we want to get the
active theme we will just return our
theme but we're not returning it as a
behavior subject but as observable so
for outstanding files it's more or less
like an observable they won't feel any
difference but we will see the
difference because we can use next year
we get the start value
and we will get all the updates so let's
go to our home ts and first of all
selected theme I'm actually not
completely sure if we need this no I
don't think we need this anymore but
what we need of course is the private
settings of the type settings provider
and inside the constructor of our page
we call get active theme which returns
an observable so we need to subscribe to
it of course we need this that selected
oh yeah okay so I was on the wrong file
but it doesn't matter let's commented us
sorry so what we need is to toggle of
course our apt beam and I tricked myself
okay so we really need to select a theme
here geez so we can go back here at set
to get the active theme we get an
observable where we can subscribe to and
once we get some melody we set our
selected theme to this value and the
cool thing is if our settings provider
calls next this block will be triggered
again with a new value and our selected
theme will be set to the new value now
if we want to toggle our app theme we
need to check our selected theme if it's
equal to dark being currently so in that
case we need to set it to the light
theme so we use again our settings
provider call set active theme and set
it to the light P
and of course if it's already a light
beam we go ahead and make it the dark
team now our home HTML perhaps some
changes night and day and here we can
say let's make it to the center and say
I shine at night and glow a day a little
bit
reminds me of Harry Potter and no water
anyways we need a button to toggle our
light and day mode
so go ahead create a button and call the
toggle app theme function and inside
perhaps we have an icon to the left just
like you know it from some apps and this
will be the bolt and we say toggle theme
now inside our HTML we probably already
got yes we got our text and we get the
function and currently that's not really
anything working because we're changing
the style but we haven't finished the
most important step so the idea behind
our dynamic styling is that inside the
root component just created here we add
the CSS class so let me do this first of
all we add the setting here as well so
settings provider and of course we also
get selected theme here and more or less
it's not even more or less it's exactly
the same like this so we put it here and
we get all the updates and our selected
theme is either light team or
and now we go to our HTML and add the
class to this component the name
selected theme so now you see the dark
mode is directly applied to our app and
for some reason our text is very dark
actually where's the problem
should it be headed up toolbar title no
it should be here right yeah okay so as
you can see we get the doxy our
background is dark the border color is
this freaky color and the text is white
this is what if we now hit toggle our
app comes back to the light mode which
is white background why toolbar the text
just like it is in normal and we can go
back and again so now we are dynamically
applying this style directly to we can
expect it actually to the topmost
element here let me find it there it is
you see the change right here at the
root iron app either the classic dark
theme or now the class is light beam so
this can change the complete styling for
your app at the top level and you can
put your light and dark theme here you
could of course also keep a miniature
for different themes you could offer the
user multiple themes this is just an
example but this is how you can
implement dynamic styling for your ionic
app which you can change even at runtime
so I hope you enjoyed this video if you

Academy for

challenges everything you need to build
great ionic apps so I hope to see you
next time
stay tuned have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
