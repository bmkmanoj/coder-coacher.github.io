special news series so if you're coming
from my regular youtube channel you
might be used to coding videos and not
seeing my face so surprised this time
it's a bit different this video follows
some of my new resolutions for the new
year especially two of them so first I
wanted to get a bit better with face to
face camera so 90% or more of the time
I'm only recording my desktop but I
wanted to change this and bring a built
more interactivity into the videos and
also from a more personal side I wanted
to create some monthly reviews to see
how I'm doing not only for you sorry but
also for me to track my goals and see
how I did so this is the first video of
this kind and I hope you will see eleven
more this year at least perhaps if you
enjoy this type of video leave a comment
and I will create more on different
subjects you can ask questions although
this video is on the deaf tactic channel
it's more related to my second project
which is the lifestyle business
transformation blog I started this blog
last year to record what I'm doing since
switching from a traditional developer
job in to doing all kinds of things and
so if you have any questions on this
topic I really enjoy talking about it so
please let me know so let's get into a
few things I noted for this month
review from the business side first of
all I finished a big client project
which I started in December so I built
it in January and this is already a
quick great income which will give me a
nice run away for the next month also I
started two new small client projects if
you're in this business you you kinda
get some connections over time and
people come back to you and you just get
the work
all the time so that's also why I am
very proud to be invited to speak at a
conference in April
I'm currently preparing the stuff and
doing some coordination but I'm really
happy to be invited and to talk about
ionic they're um also I release a
startup this month so we were working
for like half a year together me as the
developer and another friend more on the
business side of things and we launched
it more or less in January alone we're
not making it very very public by now so
we're more into 101 connections and
trying to get people on board and
getting the first feedback on what we've
built so far but I will keep you updated
on this as well as I'm really yeah I'm
really interested it's a new I new
endeavor we take together and I'll see
how it works out besides that on my more
or less main business I've created a
blog post so not super much but a lot
was going on January actually and
therefore I think it's kinda okay and
something that's really amazing you
might know I got this membership
platform called the ionic Academy and in
January we crossed 300 active members so
that's a great basic income I get every
month of course members can leave but
new members also join so my goal for
this year is to get to 500 at least
January was a very good start and I will
see how I can power up my marketing over
the rest of the year and do some more
promotions or do other kind of things
it's really funny to experiment with
this kind of stuff
now a bit more away from the business
side so from business side it was a
really great month enough income growth
and all projects and all kinds of things
you want to wish on the personal side
actually lost three kilos I don't know
if you can see it
I guess not because you haven't seen
that often before on video but anyway
I'm kind of proud because I was working
out four to five times a week
of which three were real work out days
and to work a do sessions of 60 minutes
so I hope it can keep up this sporting
aspect as it's really great to you have
a little break in the day to rewire your
brain and just get the blood going you
know besides that I also tried eating
more healthy so I got into low carb but
I don't know it's kind of not really
completely my thing I tried it out for a
few weeks but it was a bit stressful
than the end so I just switched back to
using my brain eating less calories then
I burn not eating so much sweets and
more vegetables in the evening and you
know if you stick to some basic rules
you will lose weight in the end you
don't have to stress too much about it
so besides that enough going on but we
got a new flat actually so in March I
guess we have the upcoming move I guess
a lot of things are involved with that
but I will reveal why we move to new
flat perhaps later in a video this year
and also a good thing directly at the
start of January we made our first
holiday of the year my wife and I went
to the Tegan Z it's in the south of
Germany I can really recommend it to
everyone was great great days there a
lot of wellness and yeah just it's great
to take some time off from time to time
okay um all of this was kind of positive
but I also want to reflect on some
improvements because if you make a
monthly review it's nice to take a look
at what what you achieved over the month
but it's also good to think about what
you can improve in the next month so one
thing is which I already wanted last
year I want to learn Spanish we tried
with a friend of us
she teach us some Spanish that was
really great but I want to increase the
effort and bought a book but I only took
the first election and I want to make at
least two a week perhaps even three to
really get into Spanish so if I'm
watching this at the end of the year and
can't talk a single sentence with you in
Spanish you know I've failed at that but
I hope it will not come like that
besides that my email inbox is kind of
full all the time I get a lot of
requests questions some of them are fine
so I'm not so but I'm really bad at
answering very fast most of the time I
just moved them to another box and bitch
processed them like we developers say
from time to time
but most of the time this day is well
maybe every two weeks and that's just us
so I want to get more to the Ohio
principle I don't know if who
established it but it's means only
handily at once so if you get the email
read it answer it then it's gone
perhaps I can establish it currently I'm
not so good but I will keep an eye on
improving working through my inbox more
often and also because of all the
projects going on because of some
private issues here because of all the
content I've created I've been through a
lot of stress lately and upward late
hours I've worked on weekends and this
is something I kind of don't want to do
with my lifestyle business you know I'm
my own boss and I can I can handle my
tasks and my time and shift things and I
want to keep a lot of freedom in my days
and especially in my weekends where I
got more time with my wife so therefore
I will try to either remove or do less
in the February or just set more borders
so that I will definitely finish work at
5:00 or 6:00 p.m. latest and don't do
anything on weekends because your brain
needs time to relax it's it's just like
that
just like you need sleep you need time
to relax and if you don't have enough of
that you make bad decisions you don't
get the good ideas you need as an
entrepreneur so taking some time of
playing walking around eating nice food
whatever it is watching Netflix it
doesn't matter but it's important to
take some time off for yourself and what
I also want to improve of course is the
quality of these videos okay this is the
first one I hope you enjoyed it
to some degree perhaps you can leave
some questions or feedback comments
whatever you got I'm happy for every
response on this video but of course I
know it's not perfect by no means you
know my room is not looking that good at
the moment
the setup here is not perfectly the
lighting is not perfectly and most
important I'm not perfectly comfortable
on video by now but I hope this will get
better over time perhaps I can get into
something like a flock one day I really
dream about this from time to time
carrying around my camera and showing
you some stuff perhaps you will enjoy it
maybe you can leave lots of feedback on
that but otherwise I hope you learnt a
bit from this video how I handle my
business as a lifestyle entrepreneur if
you want to follow these videos make
sure to either subscribe to my channel
or go to the blog lifestyle business
transformation comment subscribe I will
send out the email when a new article
comes out so you will never miss any of
these videos ok so have a great day do
your own review perhaps and most
important enjoy your time and upcoming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
