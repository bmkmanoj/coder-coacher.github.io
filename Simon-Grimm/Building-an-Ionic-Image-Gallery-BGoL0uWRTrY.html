from the ionic Academy in this video I
will show you how you can easily create
a nice-looking image model for your
images which is also a gallery so I've
started a blank new app and we can go
ahead and install this great
I own a gallery modal package and I've
also added some images to my assets
folder just so we can have something to
test out
let's also start our ionic lap right now
and then we can go to the app module and
import two things so first we need to
import everything as ionic and sorry let
me bring in this also right
first of all let's import the ionic
gallery so ionic gallery
modal from ionic gallery model there are
this and then we also have to import
something to overwrite so it's from Hema
or it's Emma just config from the
angular platform browser there it is
just of course now first of all add this
to your imports so call this with
gallery mol module and then it's ready
to be used and then also we need to add
something to our providers array which
is this hammer just config so we say
provide for this special class and use
the class
I own a gallery modal's dot
my config so now we will provide a
special class for this just check config
which is used by the modal alright
that's all for this one so let's
continue with our actual home page so
let's make this ionic gallery and we
simply need one button to trigger our
action so add button or whatever you
like or where you want your gallery to
open so open gallery open gallery and
then close it now we can go to our home
tears and implement the function and as
well our images array so we need to pass
in an array of images let's make this
type any empty array private images and
then we need to fill our array in the
beginning so let's make a simple foliot
I equals 1 lower than 5 and plus plus
because I got like images from 1 to 4 so
of course change this to your it needs
and then go ahead and push some images
into our array and those will be objects
and you need to set the URL for each of
the images so in my case it would be
assets images and then dollar e dot PNG
and now we got the array ready and what
you can do as well you could also
specify a title so for example let's say
the title right here this will be build
suck it io one of the courses let's make
a second one for the third image use
firebase storage alright so we've
configured our images array of course
that's up to you how you do it
and then the most important part is
opening our model and therefore we need
the model controller of ionic so go
ahead import it and use it to create a
new page and normally you would now pass
in a page that we passed in the gallery
model right here and like always we can
add some information to the model page
and in this case we need to set the
photos which are the actual images you
could set something like initial slide
so the index of the initial slide or you
could also specify the close icon I will
just keep it to bank this is I think the
stem and then go ahead call mobile
present save everything and hopefully
our app comes up after it is ready and
then we see we already got this nice
little modal dialog don't mind these are
bars right here this is just an error of
Chrome I always have but we can see we
got the image and we got the title at
the bottom we can swipe through them and
if we swipe down it would disappear also
if we click the button now I think
perhaps it's arrow back I'm not sure
what the actual name was yeah so now we
could have back arrow we could also make
this a close icon of course that is up
to the UI of your app but it's nice that
we can set this one as well what we can
do as well if you don't like the dark
background is making it
bit more transparent so we can target it
using gallery models yes as outside of
Page home because it's on top of the
homepage it's actual normally you would
edit to the pages CSS so we can do it
here if we want to you and say the
background it looks nice not seeing this
before let's see if this works not so
good so let's do it
normal wave zero zero zero 0.5 I guess
what's missing is yes important so now
you see we got this nice little
transparent background make it darker or
not so dark whatever you like but then
you get this really nice preview
function with gallery images and you
don't have to write any specific HTML or
CSS to achieve this behavior so that's
why I really like this package it's easy
to use straightforward easy to integrate
and really fast with a nice UI as a real
art if you want a different way of doing
this perhaps also some zooming into the
images let me know I will try to figure
something out and of course if you

developer I'll see you in the next video
have a great day and take care
