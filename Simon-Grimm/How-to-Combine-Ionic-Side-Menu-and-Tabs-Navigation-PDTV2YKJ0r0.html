deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy in
this video I will show you how to build
a full navigation which combines the
site menu pattern with a tab bar because
this was requested a lot and it is not
super simple so we got to take care of a
few things there but let's go because we
got a lot to do so as you can see I
started a blank new ion again and
afterwards we have to create some pages
so we need to create a page for let's
say we have a simple login where user
can login with the data and then they
will take to the actual site menu and
tap our combined interface which will be
some kind of the members area after the
login we need the menu page which will
contain the menu and also keep a
reference to the content which will be
displayed then we got the taps interface
so this will hold the different tabs we
got and then we need the actual tap
pages so for simplicity I will just call
them or tap one and tap to and I will
also add a third page so tip 1 tip 2 and
third page will be a special page so we
will also see how we can display a page
without the tab bar so we will cover
almost everything here let's go ahead
and I will remove this home folder
because the home folder in the blank
template doesn't come with this modules
file and we want to use lazy loading so
let's start clean I think we can close
this and this now becomes the login page
and we don't need the home page anymore
so we need to remove the homepage
reference here if we delete it if you
keep it just stick to it
so the login page will be super simple
we will not take care of a lot of design
in this example because it's about the
structure so we simply put an iron
button inside our login page which will
unclick call to login function of course
you can plug in your login logic here
and inside this logic lock in TS we put
our du login function which we'll call
simply this but enough controller dot
set root because after the login we
don't want to keep back button to the
login we just want to be on the menu
page after the login let's see and the
first thing we see we got the login with
the login button and we're on the menu
page but the menu page actually isn't a
real menu by now so we continue with
this sorry if this is a bit fast let me
know below the video of course if you
have problems to follow or if there's
anything not clear to you so we got our
eye on menu content will be content and
sorry and inside our eye on menu we
first of all put this stuff just a menu
header and then the content we don't
need padding here will be an eye on list
of some menu buttons let's go to the
controller in a second and below the eye
on menu we need to define what will be
inside the actual area so not the menu
on the left side if you
want it on the right side but what is
the content that is actually displayed
on screen in the center so we need to
set a root page this is now the content
si onyx says you should say swipe back
and abled to false if you're using the
site menu pattern because it just worked
better this way and makes sense so
inside our main UTSA I will craft a
little interface so the idea for this
interface comes from the ionic
conference app but inside the conference
app there are few more things that we
actually don't really need here so I try
to make this a bit more easy for you so
this interface will define some
variables like a title of the page a
page name the tip component and index
you will see what all of this means in a
second
I can should be pretty clear let's go
here so first of all we should set the
root page to something because otherwise
in the beginning it would be empty and
the root page will be our taps page
which is the base for holding the
reference to our tabs later on then we
need something else we use add view
child which is of the type enough so you
need to brought enough and view child up
here because we need to grab a reference
to the root navigation and we can do
this using this edge view child
annotation and this gives us enough
control that we need to change some
pages and for some interaction
so now we craft the array of our actual
pages array and now we use the
properties we have defined up there so
the first one is titled tap 1 this will
be displayed and we got the page name
this is more or less the root page for
this page which will be displayed so
this is the tab page again
now the tab component is what actual
content should be displayed so tap
component in this case is tap 1 page
just this one and then we got index and
icon
perhaps the index will be 0 and the icon
let's say home so the index will be the
index of the top of the top bar so if
you got 3 tabs the first is index 0 the
second is index 1 so our tab page has
the index 0 in this case now we need two
more of these so the second one will be
text to the page the the base root will
be again tips page now this is tab 2
which is the content the index will be 1
perhaps I don't know contacts and
finally as we said we wanted to have
this special page so this page is just a
special page and the tab component is
not needed because we don't need to
display it inside a tab NP index is also
not needed here we will see how to work
with this also in a second now let's
finish this up with our menu view now we
got our list of pages so we can cross
the list with ng 4 so button eye on item
we use menu closures so whenever we
press a button inside the menu the menu
will be automatically closed ng for flat
P of pages and on click we will cause
something to open our page P inside the
button we can define our icon if we want
to so all of this page interface array
is just to make it a bit more flexible
of course you could define all buttons
alone but by doing this you can see how
we can do it quite many quite flexible
within array so the name is defined SV
icon and another thing which I took from
the conference app is marking the active
item inside the site menu because this
is as well quite tricky and we will
though the function is active to see if
the current item is the active selected
tab and finally we got the title inside
the array let's see okay I think of
course we are still not having the menu
active because this comes for a reason
what was it again is active so currently
we're just and defining that the tips
page is the root page and the tab page
is still this blank one so perhaps let's
see well maybe before we implement these
two functions we could do something else
so both functions here we'll get this
and we will implement them in the second
because I think the hardest part right
here for now let's continue to our caps
template which will define our eye on
tips and we can set the selected index
and this will be my index and inside we
craft the eye on tap root equals tap one
root tap title I think we have to define
it on our own here I think that should
work tab icon is also equal to home and
the second one which is tap to root and
10 to now go to your tab key s because
we need to define the roots and also we
want to be able to set the my index on
this page so we need tap one root which
is the tap one page and same again for
the second one so by now our app will
start to come to life now this will be a
number okay let's see come on okay as
you can see we now got the two tabs so
by now we're going from login to this
interface the menu is there but we're
not seeing it by now but our tap
navigation is actually already working
now now actually the tricky part begins
but let's see if we can change these for
now so this is my tap one content and
inside the header we add I on
buttons perhaps to the start as our menu
is currently on the left side so button
iron button menu toggle so this button
allows us to simply toggle the menu and
I can name this menu as well now we can
put this into the three pages we
actually display so tap to remove this
tab to and this is my tattoo content and
finally the special page special this is
my special page okay let's see okay we
log in and for some reasons I currently
have to make a reload sometimes because
see I am button though I did not copy
this sorry did I miss it
on tap too as well yes of course but
this should work and tap one okay start
here and start so let's see okay for
some reason I don't know what's wrong
with my reload I enough
well I actually need to put this here
and now we are fine hopefully so come on
step one please be reloaded come on this
can't be true why is it why is my tattoo
working but not step one it's ridiculous
I'm not sure what's what's wrong with my
life reload perhaps I just need to well
yes I will start the live freeze out
again I'm not sure what's wrong here but
as you can see I already of course not
reloading I already got the menu toggle
up here so we now just need to make sure
that this menu toggle is actually
working but before we do this we can
take a look at our tips bar let's see
yes thank you so tap one tip to menu the
menu with the three items but of course
it will only close the menu but not open
anything so if we press step one we want
to display tip 1 and mark tip 1 active
if we select tab 2 we want to mark this
active and go to tip 2 and if we go to
the special page we don't want to have
this at all but let's start with the
first two cases so in these cases we
will pass the selected index to our tabs
page so this means inside our
constructor here we can set my index to
enough params dot data dot tap index so
we will pass it as step index or
otherwise it will be zero we're not just
passing this data through this page but
we will do within a sect so I think now
we're done with all of this and we can
focus on our menu functions because the
rest is more or less working now we just
need to make sure
at once we press this item or any of
these items the right action hats so
let's continue with our open page
function first of all we find an empty
params object and if our page has an
index set which is for the first two we
will set the params to tab index H index
so this is exactly the reason why where
is it yes here why we can access the tab
index of the nav parens here because we
will pass this page index through from
page touch come on index okay now we get
actually into the specific details so we
use our knife which is the injected view
child and call get active child knife
so give this active travel of is set and
if our page index is also set we can try
to select the active page so by getting
the child knife we actually get the taps
navigation so this is also a navigation
element so this means we can use the tab
navigation and call select page dot
index okay so this means I don't know if
it's already working by now but this
means if the tab navigation is currently
active and we click this we want to
select the tap with the index one so you
can see we press step one and the first
tab is activated we can switch between
them course
and it works completely fine already by
now but that is not all
in case the active child laughs is not
there we use something else because in
that case it means there's no top
navigation so we cannot select any page
so as a fallback we say set root in that
case to page that page name which is for
those two pages the taps page and for
this page it will be the special page
and we will also in that case pass
parents proof so this is exactly why we
edit this statement so we can set the
route to the top navigation and we pass
the active index through
now it's not really needed but once we
add this special page this folder is
definitely needed I think that should
work already also for our third page we
have no index defined so we will always
come to the else block and in that case
we will set the root to the special page
let's see if this works so tip 1 tip 2
is to the working and if I go to my
special page we see that the special
page is not inside the tips it's a
complete standalone page but it's still
reach over here and if we now go back to
tip 2 we can also see that the eye on
view at lotus calls and I think ok I
have removed the eye on here is load
from the taps but anyway in that case
the root will be again set to the top
page and the index will be selected and
so on so by now our navigation is
already completely working we can go
from login to our inside area where we
got the site menu the taps are active we
can change the tips we can change the
page
we can do almost anything we want but
finally we also want to mark the active
menu item and it should display which
tab is active or if we're on a special
page so therefore we implement the is
active function first of all we grab
again our child enough so they start
enough that get active child now now if
we get the child love we can do some
stuff we will first of all check if the
chat knife and get selected so this
gives us the selected index and I'm
sorry and if the child enough that gets
selected selected not root so the root
component of the selected is equal to
what our tap component is so you know
the tap component is either types one or
type two page so in case these are the
same we go ahead and return primary as a
class so this will mark it cool
otherwise we will just return and don't
add any color so this is our case for
the tabs let's see is action so we see
Tab 2 is active we select tab 1 step 1
is active tab 1 is active we change to
tab to tab to sector but it's not
working for our special navigation and
this problem here ok and therefore we
need a little folder here so if this
does not get active is actually set so
we actually have some sort of navigation
and this enough that get active dot name
is equal to our page name then we also
return primary and the page name is
again this one so for the special page
the active page of our nav the name will
be the special page and therefore it
should be marked in that case so we got
this special and you can see special is
selected okay I think we got it was
quite fast so let's have a short recap
we created all the pages we're starting
with a symbol login from the login we
set the root page to the menu page the
menu page holds our eye on menu and
defines which content should be a plate
displayed as the root page here we got
our interface and the different elements
here and the important part are these
open page and it's active function which
help us to or mark the active element
and otherwise for open page also select
the correct tap on our tab bar or
completely reset our root page to
another page the other pages are more or
less stupid pages and besides the tabs
which is the base interface for our
temper which needs to grab the tab index
so we can dynamically mark our active
tab from here okay I hope this video
gives you a good overview of how you can
achieve this full navigation with ionic
site menu in tips if you enjoyed this
