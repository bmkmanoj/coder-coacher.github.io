the ionic academy in this quick one I
will show you how you can easily access
your native calendar of your device on
iOS and Android so let's get started
I've created a blank new ionic app and
first of all we need to cut over plugin
for the calendar so go ahead and add it
to your project and as well once this is
finished we need to install the ionic
native package for the calendar as well
so go ahead and run this command as well
let this finish in the background and
also quick note as we're using a code of
a plug-in we cannot test this
functionality inside the browser so we
have to run this app on our device at
the end anyway let's continue with
importing the calendar in the app module
and then edit to the array of your
providers so that's it then we can go to
our first page and of course add private
calendar of the type calendar so now we
got it here as well
let's also add the platform ionic
because we will use it in the
constructor and we need to make sure
that the platform is ready so this means
we can use Cordova plugins otherwise you
might see strange results sometimes it
might work or it might not work so
better surrounded with this call if
you're using it directly in the
beginning then we can use our Kalinin
there are a lot of functions we will
just use a few so first of all let's
pick list calendars this will give us a
list of all the calendars on the device
so here's the promise and perhaps great
variable calendars right here which will
be in array and then when we get the
data back we can set it to our calendars
also let's add two more functions to
this page so add an event to a calendar
which is what we can do or we can open a
calendar as well to open another
calendar let's create another page and
call it calendar details like this and
when we want to open a calendar we say
this dot not control our push and we
push our second page just a quell
details page and as the params
we send over the name of the calendar so
at this point you can lock out the
information and you will see there is a
name and ID and also that type of the
calendar to add something to your
calendar there are many things you can
fill out you can leave them out it's
completely up to you I will just give
you one example so you can pass some
options and there you could specify the
calendar ID which would be the Cal ID if
we clicked on a calendar
this works for I think Android but for
iOS we need to kill a new name this is a
bit tricky as you might have calendars
with the same name this could result in
some problems so be aware of this
there's an open issue on the github page
for this plugin but anyway it should
work for us of course if you have a
calendar entry you could specify
something like a URL special notes
whatever or something like first
reminder
so the first remind perhaps 15 minutes
for the event actually starts then we
come to adding this event and this will
bring up the native dialog for your
calendar and we use create event
interactively with options and then you
can see the parameters first is the
title let's say my new event then we got
the location I'll just use my hometown
then we got two notes whatever some
special no it's completely up to you
then we got the start date and the end
date I will just use two times the thing
the same date and finally you can add
the options if you liked you and also
there's a promise again return something
not super interesting for us here but
you will see that this will bring up the
calendar view now let's continue with a
view for this calendar let's give it
some color and say my calendars and for
the content we will craft a simple ion
list with iron items and we have to
iterate over all of our calendars so let
kill off calendars perhaps they should
be capable we have some buttons in them
as well so button I can only item start
clear it's a bit complicated here but
chaining those works really nice and
this button will trigger the at event so
this will bring up the new event dialog
therefore let's give it an icon ad and
we can copy this
and put it to the nth item end and this
ball opened the calendar and then we use
arrow forward to display some forward
actually inside the item we can also
display the calendar name if you like to
or just for debugging perhaps the
calendar type okay so this is our first
view nothing really special in here so
far so let's continue with our details
page first of all get rid of the stuff
we don't need and then we need a few
imports of course we need the calendar
as well on this page then we might need
what do we need the platform right now
here's a little trick or something
special we have to take care of the
different functions for iOS and Android
and therefore we have to check if this
dot platform is iOS so in the iOS case
we have some special call we can use or
if this platform is Android because on
Android the function for iOS is not
existing so let's store the calendar
name as well and the name should be
passed through our Neff params so get
them from the nav params by calling get
I think we use name right yes name and
then we got the calendar name now we
want to retrieve all the events for one
calendar and on iOS we can simply call
this calendar find all events in named
calendar
as you can see iOS only so here we can
use our calendar name and
and get some data back and say this that
events equals data for Android this
function is not there but I was using a
simple other one so lists events in
range could also work it's not really
giving you the events for one calendar
but all the events in a specified range
but better than nothing I think so let
the start date be today and also new
date and then and set date and get date
plus whatever so perhaps all the events
for the next month and then if you go
back to the function you see we got the
start date just now start and the end
date which is end and again simply use
the rest of the promise like this and
then you will also be able to get some
events on Android finally we need the
View for the details page so move this
make it look a bit nicer and then we can
use kalam name as the title and for the
content let's put them in some I own
cards and iterate over our events right
add a little iron card header which
could be the title of the event and then
for the ion card content you can list
few options you can debug the
information you get back from the
calendar and see which items might be
interesting for you so
I can name calendar for the times so the
start time would be event dot start date
I was trying to use a pipe here but for
some reason that a form made the format
of the date was I would say not so good
so it crashed the app perhaps you find a
better solution you could use moment a
as to transform the date into something
more readable but otherwise for our
example I will just use the result we
get so this should be the view perhaps I
might you need add something but for now
you can run ionic Cordova build iOS or
Android whatever you get and then in a
second let's see this on a device once
your app is deployed and starting you
can see I got a big list of all my
different calendars with their options
and also I can go to the details of one
calendar and see some events like
superbowl upcoming or whatever with
their dates on my device now if I click
the plus icon in front of a row you see
that a new event comes up and this is
filled with the information so we got up
here my new event we got the city sorry
we got a start and end date we got the
right calendar selected we got an alert
50 minutes before the event and also at
the bottom we can see the URL and also
the notes were added and now you could
add this and the event would be directly
added to your calendar so it's actually
not very hard to use the calendar there
are a lot more functions like adding
deleting events changing event data you
can find all information on the ionic
native page for the calendar plugin or
the official github page of the plugin
so give it a try
and of course asked if you have any
questions also make sure to check out
the ionic academy.com if you want great
training resources for ionic and learn
to build amazing ionic apps with courses
project and a great community so I hope
you will see you in the next video have
a great day and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
