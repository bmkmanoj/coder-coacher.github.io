their technique and the ionic academy
today we will implement I only facebook
login and this is really very often
coming up question so I wanted to make a
video on this but before we get started
with our ionic app you have to create a
Facebook app so go to developer at
facebook.com slash EPS and add a new app
so I've already added a one app right
here and we can go into it once you've
created your app you should see
something like this as well which is
already kind of good because now we can
initialize our app and set up all we
need so I started a blank new ion again
and what we need now are two things the
first of all the ionic native NPM
package for Facebook and then we got
something a bit longer so this would
look like this I only Cordova plug-in at
the Facebook plug-in and then we need to
pass in our app ID and our app name so
we can go back and see this is the app
ID and for the app name we can pick of
course our f name now go ahead yes
whatever you want to install ionic is
fine for me and then we're almost ready
here if you already have an app and it
has published perhaps already you will
see that you have some specific widget
ID set here this is your bundle ID and
we need now to make sure that this
bundle ID is inside our Facebook app as
well and for me I already set this so
you can go to settings Thanks and hit
add platform for both iOS and Android
and
for the bundle ID I've added exactly
this string right here so this is your
reverse domain and the name of your app
I've edited for iOS and for Android that
might come a problem that the ID cannot
be found on the App Store if your app is
not yet released there is no problem so
just make sure you have the iOS and
Android blocks here and your bundle ID
here is the same as your widget ID right
here okay let me just remove no okay let
me test okay this should be it now
that's already all for the setup so
create your app on Facebook
set the or at the platforms set the ID
and then install the plug-in for
Facebook with the correct ID from
Facebook from your dashboard into your
name and then you're ready just make
sure that you import the provider and
now we can go to our pages and let's
remove a bit here and call this one
facebook login so we will just add an
ion button which will call our look in
event function so login with Facebook
and once we are locked in we actually
want to display some information of our
user so let's create a card and this
will only be shown if we get the user
data so perhaps we got some header data
which is
let's see use that data that username
perhaps we will fill the data before we
use it so let's go to our page we don't
need the Neff controller but we need
Facebook and of course like this so our
function was login with Facebook so
let's add this and the only thing we
need to do is use our provider and call
login and now you see that to the login
we need to pass an array of strings for
permission so this is what the app
requests as permissions now okay I will
just request the email and the public
profile perhaps the public profile is
already default I'm not sure but that's
fine and we need the facebook login
response we don't need it but it's nice
to have because now we can say our
response is of the type facebook login
response and you can actually see that
you've got the status and the auto
response and here would be the excess
total so this would be used for
something like firebase login but now
after the login is said before we want
to get some more data so we make a call
to the Facebook Graph API and this
string now let me copy it in because I'm
quite sure I will mess it up otherwise
this string is from testing with a graph
editor you see we're requesting the
current user which is me and then we
have to specify some fields like name
email first-name and for the picture we
can already set how we want the picture
to be and behind this we need additional
permissions array but we don't need to
pass in anything here so then we will
hopefully get some profile data from the
user bag and we can use this now to set
our own user data which we set to null
in the beginning and then we can say our
email is profile email our first name is
profile first-name and finally we got
the picture which is at profile picture
large data URL so you can lock out your
own response there and see what you get
but that's or perhaps finally also the
username because it's an profile name
come on what's wrong yes like this close
it here and want too much okay okay so a
very long string but hopefully we get
our data now and let's see if we have
any errors otherwise we can go ahead
okay it should work and of course log in
is not working inside our browser
because we need cordova so we need to
run ionic cordova build and in my case i
run for iOS so let's see how this app
looks on a device now all right so
here's my app on the device and if I hit
lock in now I'm taken to a web page so
on iOS I'm not sure it seems like this
is the
behavior for Android you should directly
come to the Facebook app but in our case
now I hit login with the Facebook app so
then I can open the Facebook app and
after a few seconds we should see that
our app requests to receive the public
profile and the email address just like
we specified so I continue as myself and
we come back to our app and see that we
actually haven't added everything we
need yeah of course
so let's go back here for a second and
finish our cut but we can already see
that we somehow got the data here so
this is now user data dot picture and
then we got some island card content
which could be for example our email
data dot email and what else on the
first name so first name okay
now we could run it again for iOS
perhaps it comes up soon so after our
login we are allowed to make requests to
this API and there's a graph IP Explorer
where you can test all these fields like
albums photos friends whatever so you
can access almost all data there and
it's really easy as you can see the
Facebook log in itself we wouldn't need
these lines so it would just be this one
line and yes I can rebuild it to set up
our initial develop for Facebook was
also like two minutes
perhaps so let's finish this up with our
new view is this my app yes so now I can
log in again again a few clicks too much
I think and now we have already
authorized this app so we can go ahead
okay and there we are my name my email
and my image from Facebook okay so I
hope you enjoyed this quick win for
Facebook log in with ionic I think it's
pretty easy if you have any questions
leave me a comment otherwise also leave
me a comment if you like the video make
sure to subscribe to my channel and also
check out the ionic Academy com I will
see you next time stay tuned and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
