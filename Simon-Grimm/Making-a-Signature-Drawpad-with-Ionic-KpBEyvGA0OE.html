tech tech and today I'm going to show
you how to make signature pad inside
your ionic framework app and for this
we'll use the tiny little JavaScript
library called signature pitch you can
find on github so well let's go ahead
and create a new ionic product so let's
wait for the Lightning's each of my neck
charm and meanwhile we can see if this
guy seems to be really nice you can
install his library with the BOA to it
so I recommend to do this but it's
optionally you can also download it and
include the and queue the files in your
project I also add the save flag so it
will position our Bower fire
you
so let's go to our index and in order to
use it
we must include our squib we just
installed so that's fine for now now we
can go on and include the stuff we read
so obviously we will need a control sign
to our body and now what we're going to
do is add a canvas element inside our
iron content in which the user can draw
make a signature or whatever he likes so
for this I will add the class to the
header to the iron content and as we
don't want the screen to get scrolled
when the user starts drawing inside our
canvas element so now the canvas we need
a ID for the canvas as we need to get
these cameras from our app tjs
afterwards so I will give it just
changes and we need some size obviously
additionally I'm going to add a little
border so you can see the area better
well that's our canvas element now
additionally to our drawing canvas we
might need some actions so I'm going to
create two buttons with a little button
bar tool and color to our buttons and
the ng click event will call create
canvas function but we will obviously
implement later on and the second button
color you like to guess what save our
canvas you'll see how this will work and
we are going to add these things and the
last thing we will add is an image which
will not yet be set but we will set it
with a signature the user has drawn she
uses our app so let everything for the
index now let's go to app Cheers
design the controller you must create
this controller and first of all we're
going to get our element do you remind
it and now we're going to create our
signature pad by the library and we get
our element to the library so now our
signature pad is ready to Epiphone
selections so let's create our actions
first one was to clear our canvas that's
one symbol just go ahead and type clear
so the user has brown stuff and click
one key on canvas will just be cleared
out not very special the second one was
our safe campus well it's not very hard
but it's a good function so here we make
use of the two data URL of the signature
pet library and this way we get the data
the user has drawn on the canvas and
this data is pretty good right now we
can just assign the data to our
signature which we have here as T in a
match
so that's pretty much everything you
need for now so go to your terminal and
well for my slide I'm going to add the
iOS platform pair the platform now do
the magic hopefully everything will work
out now
you
so here's our app here's our canvas
element and the two buttons and no image
right now so I'm going to draw some
simple elements and nothing happens or
it was unexpected
mainly typo
you
you
guess it's always type on my side
you
you
you
good thing let me know so I can show you
how to give up
you
all right pretty much always use console
and here on let's check now we draw to
save nothing happens that's typical for
JavaScript but why
you
you
you
total JavaScript epoch locator card
problem
you
you
Oh tiny typo can make many problems yeah
 my life
okay let's go back to our simulator
artists rebuild yet yeah that's the
thing I hate about JavaScript just one
wrong letter and you know was given
from anyone socks
here's our new app let's draw something
yay we are drawing e now clear the
canvas and it's cleared epic suprise
okay guys
sorry it took some minutes more but this
way you learned how to debug ionic app
and if you want to make something more
but the page you can see here just some
some smooth curves and some more options
here you could expect inspect like color
and width and much more so feel free to
check out these things and yeah and
happy if you subscribe to me bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
