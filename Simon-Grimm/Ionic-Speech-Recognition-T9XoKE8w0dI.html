from deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy
today we will build a simple speech
recognition app with ionic and we will
use a Cordova plug-in ported so first of
all I've already started a blank new
ionic app and now we go ahead and run
the command ionic Cordova plug-in it so
this is new with the ionic CLI version 3
you have to add Cordova before it was
only I only plug-in it so now it is this
command what we also need of course is
the NPM package from ionic natives so at
the ionic native speech recognition
package as well once this is ready we
can also start our ionic lab but I
already have to say that the speech
recognition is not working in the
browser so we can only test this within
a real device for iOS or Android for our
development it will be fine just to see
if our app is actually working so let's
pull this in right here and let's go
ahead now so first of all we have to go
to our app module and go to the
providers and we need to add our speech
recognition right here and we also of
course have to import it from the
according ionic native package so this
should be ionic native not core but
speech recognition like this Rick oh
it's hard work from me come on
speech recognition whatever I guess I
typed it wrong here
okay once you're at your spelling right
we can move on to the next section so
let's go to our current home HTML we
don't need the console anymore so what
we're going to do is we will add a few
buttons to start recording our voice and
we will print out the matches that the
package gives us back with some simple
cards below but first of all we need to
ask for some permissions so the first
button will call get permissions and
this will bring up a dialog and ask the
user to allow access to his or her
microphone once we got the permissions
we can actually start listening so this
button will call start listening and
finally we make one more button to stop
listening but actually this stop
function to not listen to our input
anymore is only working on iOS so we put
in an additional ng-if and this will
call them is iOS function within our
class we will implement it soon so when
we are when we are recording our voice
or package is listening we want to
display that we are somehow recording
like in your studio so we paint our
enough power in a different color
depending on is recording so if we are
with painted in some red and otherwise
it will simply have primary color now
what we only need now is to display our
results so I don't count head out say
this is what I
stood and within the content a young
card content oh come on
within the iron card content we craft
very easy list of ion items just to be
able to print out all our matches so
here we will iterate over Mitch's of
matches perhaps match of matches would
be better and printout that item has our
item okay we got this now we need to
actually implement it yeah of course we
need to plumb in some functions so let's
go to our class and we can start with is
iOS so it will be fine then for this we
need the platform from ionic angular and
we can return this dot platform is and
now we just given a string just iOS so
this will return true only on iOS
additionally what was the command for
closing window okay
that was another command it was yes like
this now we got a bit more space so what
we need is the speech recognition of
course and we need to make it as a
variable we already got the platform and
that's one more thing we need so for me
it was not really updating my view once
we got the result therefore this is like
a little heck is the change detect our
Ref
coming from an angular core change take
2 or F like this we can use this to
trigger our angular reload of our inputs
to see if there was a change I know this
is quite an ugly heck but I'm not
completely sure why I was not working
with a observable but I will come to
this in a second so we get our iOS
function which is kind of good we will
have our matches of the type string
array and in the beginning we can set
our is recording to false because we're
not yet recording anything so by now
how have you should hopefully load again
and we can go ahead yeah let's all of
you more won't work inside the browser
ok the first function we had was get
permission so within this function we
need to call our speech recognition and
call head permission and this will
trigger a box it will come up for the
user and once it returns it returns has
permission which is of the type boolean
and we can use this now so if if the
user not has permission we will actually
show the view okay so I got that one and
this will check if we already have the
permission and if we not have the
permission we need to ask the user so in
that case we call request permission
which will bring up this standard view
you might know from iOS or Android and
this will ask for the permission now
once we get this we can start listening
or call the function which calls start
listening
let me copy this before I make any
mistakes again and also stop listening
so when we start listening we first of
all kin so this is optional add some
options like language it's already
default to English but I just wanted to
at this so you know their options you
can specify also like for Android and
how many words the recognition should
automatically stop so the recognition is
a bit different for iOS and Android
you have to yeah work it to your needs
but now we can actually call the start
listening and this will return us
observable so we need to subscribe to
the matches we get back and this is the
point where I was assigning the matches
and they were not displaying inside my
view so therefore we're using our change
detector and call detect changes it's a
bit ugly but I think we won't die from
those two lines and of course once we
start listening we need to set our is
recording to true so we indicate that
our bar will be red perhaps is also
working here and I know if it's already
crashing after start listening in the
air for no problem we will run this
later so this is the first part we start
listening
the app will hear what we say and once
we say something we get matches back so
some sentences that might match what we
have said this can be only one or this
can be a few in our order where the most
likely should be at the top and for iOS
we can now also call stop listening and
again we use the speech recognition call
stop listening
and inside the completion block we add
that we set our is recording back to
false so we know from our status bar
that is Ola so it said before we can't
use this in the browser
so let's deploy it to an iOS device
okay so I've deployed the app to my
iPhone and if I now press get permission
the FF if I if she can use the speech
recognition service dialogues in German
but ok is quite Universal so yes ILO
access to my microphone and now I will
press the start listening so we can
answer something I love the ionic
Academy okay so what I just recognized
is the second button which is stopped
listening actually has also the name get
permission but what we can see is that
inside our list we now get I love the
ionic Academy and also I love the ionics
Academy so basically everything's
working let's try it again this is my
speech recognition example okay text is
a bit short here but you can see that
I'm quite clearly understood here and
just to clarify I was missing the
options for star listening and my get
permissions had the wrong name like get
permissions and so make sure your names
are correct and you don't get the
spelling wrong leg I did ok so this is
how you implement ionic speech
recognition for your app using this
plug-in as some special cases for
Android and iOS but I'm pretty sure you
will get around them if you liked this

channel for more videos quick links
tutorial and more and of course I will
love to see you as a member inside the
ionic Academy with courses projects a
community
and more in the next time so stay tuned
subscribe and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
