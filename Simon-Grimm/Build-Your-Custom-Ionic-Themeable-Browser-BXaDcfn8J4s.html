from the ionic academy today we will
build a simple custom browser inside our
ionic app and this is called a theme of
a browser so I've started a blank new
ionic app and we go directly into it and
start by NPM install the FEMA bill
browser package from ionic native once
the NPM package is ready we can continue
with the actual Cordova plug-in and also
edit like this so as we're using Cordova
plug-in this means we cannot test this
on our browser any more perhaps a new
browser window will open but of course
it won't be styled so therefore make
sure that you test this on a device so
let's continue the mobile browser from
add ionic native female browser okay
there it is right to our app module and
then to the array of our providers okay
so we're ready to use it in action and
let's go to our home HTML and add a
simple button so we can actually open
our browser I've written this in written
version of this tutorial this is like
the most basic view I've ever added in a
tutorial just a button to open our
browser and now we come to the actual
funny staff of this video so first of
all add to your constructor like always
the t-mobile browser of course we need
the variable as well and then we can
also import a few other things like the
FEMA bill browser options which we need
so if we want to open the new browser
we basically have to create a new
browser by saying browser of the type T
mobile browser this is actually a theme
about browser object I think like this
this third theme of the browser and then
we only get the function create right
here so we created and now you can open
a URL so this could be a website or a
PDF file whatever you want that you want
to display to your users I will use
simply the ionic academy.com and it
should open in a blank view and we will
pass in some options and this is the
important part right here so our options
object is of the type theme of the
browser options if we type it right the
mobile browser options and this can be a
quite big object actually but this is
what makes our browser look more like
our actual app styling if you go to the
class you will see there's quite a lot
you can do many buttons and behavior for
the browser we can define many buttons
toolbar stuff and all of this can be
found also in the Cordova page for the
plug-in if you scroll down there's an
example of different stuff and also the
properties are really good described
here so just see what you need for your
browser what you need your users to be
able to do inside the app our case we
will just do a few basic things so we
say we have a toolbar with a head of 44
and a color the color is actually 8
digits so we have the regular 6
for the hex code and then we get an
additional two now at the end for the
opacity but if you pass in this it's
like a peso to you one this would be
opacity zero and the rest I'm not able
to calculate in this moment but of
course it's somewhere in between them so
for the title we have a light slightly
blue background I think so the title
should be perhaps white and one looks
quite crazy with the eight digits but
that's how it works and we got some
auto-completion as we are inside this
object so show page title yes please and
I want to make it aesthetic text and
simply say Academy browser this could
also be the title of the page but I
wanted to show this option as well
then we got some default buttons like
back button forward and close button all
of these buttons can have custom images
and you can load those images either
from the native project Android or iOS
and this is also recommended but for the
simplicity here I will also show that
it's possible to use it without special
customization so perhaps we should add
some icons here create a new folder and
I got some free icons so back ok doesn't
look that good on this background but
they are now inside this folder so the
path to them in the final w-w-w folder
will be assets IMG and for the back
button its back
PNG I think right let's say we want to
align this one to the left side
and then we also can if we want to at
the event and we will see how the event
works in a second so let's add a few
more of these let's make this one the
forward button pressed
perhaps we use right side on this one
how we use right side on both of them
and then we got a close button because
we need an option to leave this whole
thing and we add the close press event
here okay so now we got a custom toolbar
with the title and three buttons oops
we got the browser object created with
the options and now we can do another
thing on our theme of a browser object
as you can see we could do different
stuff insert some CSS or execute a
script but what we want to actually do
is listen on the clothes pressed event
and this is just an example you can
listen to all the events of the buttons
- custom buttons and in this case we
call browser dot close perhaps this
would even automatically work just like
back and forward they just work
so let me already you run ionic Cordova
build iOS as I said you need to run this
on a device now to test it but this is
just one example of how to use the
events of our browser object so if you
have like a share button or something
else perhaps you have a Content search
where you can search the PDF file you
can add all of this just add a button
listen to the event and perform the
action you need to do inside your app so
let's see how all of this looks on
device all right here to the right is
the iOS simulator and I'm gonna go ahead
and open more browser
and we see that the ioniq Academy page
launches and at the top we got our
custom tool bus so this is not the
general in-app browser anymore but it's
this Academy browser title we specify
the colors and the icons so with home we
can go back we can open it go somewhere
and the back button becomes active so we
can jump back theoretically but we're on
the same page right now I think but if
we go here we can actually go back with
a back button or we could go forward
with a forward button and home again
ok so this is how you create your own
t-mobile browser of course this is just
a super basic styling the buttons not
look really good you could also add
pressed images so the image pressed
which should have a different color of
your general image you could change the
density of the image and of course add a
lot more buttons options whatever you
want here anyway I hope you enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to subscribe
to my channel for more ionic videos and
also check out the ionic academy comm
where you can become an ionic developer
with a great library of courses projects
and an awesome community so I will see
you inside
or in the next video have a great day
and take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
