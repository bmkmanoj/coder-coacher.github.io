from deaf tactic and the ioniq Academy
this is the first video of our two-part
series on building an ionic app with HW
s back-end or s3 integration let me just
get one two three four my zoom right so
in this first video we will take care of
building a little server Y server
because we want to make it secure and we
just want to allow upload to the s3
bucket once we got assigned request so
we have to build a little back-end which
can give us assigned requests and in the
second part we can then use our ionic
app to upload a captured image to s3
directly more or less after getting this
signed request and also we want to be
able to list the files and that's what
our back-end will do for us so first of
all I've created a new folder and I've
added a package Jason let me just run
NPM install it's very basic setup you
can find it in the link tutorial below
this video
basically we need the Amazon SDK and
some stuff for the Express back-end were
using so in order to make everything
safe we will use an environment file
where we will keep our secrets and we
will also make this ready so it could be
deployed to iroko for example and we
will also run it locally using Heroku
and Hiroko will take care of adding the
environment files to our process so what
we need is an s3 bucket name we need
our excess key ID and we also need a
secret access key so let's see I'm
inside my console and we need to do two
things so we need to go to a3 and we
also need our what again identity access
management yeah we start by creating a
new user right here
I already got to you but I will add a
new one we will simply call this test
user and it's important to have
programmatic access to our buckets then
we will attach an existing policy
directly and we search for f3 and we
want to give them full access to this
user then you have to scroll down to go
to the next view and we are ready and
then you will see your user this is the
access key of the user and if you reveal
this this is the secret access key of
course I will delete this fuser after
the videos so yeah it's not really of
any use once you're inside your s3
overview you will see your buckets and
I've already created a dev tactic packet
so if you don't have a bucket create one
and then add the name right here so this
was my bucket nothing special no
permissions so nobody can actually see
the files in here and not public
available and that makes our app a bit
more secure so then we need a secret
JSON file in which we will actually
export our keys so we got the a WS
bucket and this will be available
through process
and then we got I think this rias bucket
and then we got two more we got our key
and we got the secret and both can be
accessed through the process
let's see what's wrong in here no but of
course okay now these will be filled
once we run our server and we can then
use them inside our app so we need two
more files of course we need a server
file and we also need a controller which
will take care of all the actions of our
back-end so let's start with the
controller I will it use strict at the
top and then we can start by requiring
the SDK first of all and then we go
ahead with our secrets which can be nope
which can be also required using secrets
I think it should be secrets right yes
all right so now we got access to those
two and we can create a new s3 object by
using the SDK and calling s3 and we can
or we need to specify some parameters
here so I had to specify the signature
version 4 and also the region of my
packet and you can find this if you go
here you will see region and - my one is
in the Europe central one so make sure
to change this for your region inside
Europe
then we will create a few functions
which we will later assign to our
requests in the server file and let me
just create the outline here and I will
go through them in a second so get files
signed request what's wrong with you
come on list files and finally delete
file okay so the first one will give us
a signed request to actually upload a
file to the s3 bucket from our ionic app
the second one will give us a signed
request to access the resource on s3
this will list all the files of the
bucket and this will simply delete a
file you might also ask why we're doing
it like this I encountered this problem
when hosting an app on Heroku where you
are not able to store any data on the
service so Hiroko is not for hosting
stuff but I still wanted to use my
back-end and in combination with hws so
I had to come up with this solution in
it also the proposed solution from
Hiroko how to upload your files through
your server okay enough of this let's
start with the first one and we need to
access a few parameters from the query
parameter object we will just use file
name and then we will also get the file
type right here and then we create new
s3 params object which will hold some
more information for our request so
first of all the bucket and this is
start right here so we can use this the
key is more or less the file name under
which it will be stored we can set an
expired time and I would recommend to do
this because after you get the signed
request you should shortly upload the
file otherwise it will expire we can set
the content type to the file type and
finally it's some excess control and
make this resource definitely only
private available so these are the
params for our request and now we can
use the SDK again to call so many
options get signed URL so this will give
us a pre site URL for an operation and
our operation is called put object
because we want to put a new object into
our bucket we add our parameters right
here and then we will hopefully get
something useful back in the end right
here if we encounter any errors right
here and we can lock them if we want to
but also we can simply end this so not
the best error handling in this tutorial
but doesn't matter right here to return
we can construct a little data object
and put the data we got in it so our
side request will be data and the URL to
the actual file could be HTTP and then
the secrets
ABF AWS bucket s3 dot M
dot-com / so this would be the real URL
to the file and of course we then need
to send out the data s J's and back to
our client okay so in general this is
how it works all the time we get a
signed URL for a request we do it and we
return something to our user now to get
a file we can first of all copy this and
reuse it right here the bucket is still
the same the key is now in request
params file name and we will inspect
this and how the call should look like
with postman in a second so perhaps also
at an expert time and again use our SDK
to get assigned URL and this time for
get object because we just want to get
the URL to one image file again add the
params and then we hopefully again got
some data right here and we return
simply the data no transformation in
here okay so two more two more
operations to list files we just need
the bucket where we want to list the
files from and then we need the
delimiter which will or which hopefully
should give us only the top level of
that bucket so if you have folders in
that I hope this should work so then we
can use list objects and we only need
the parameters and just like before we
could
some arrow handling s pallone perhaps
here as well and here as well but in the
end simply return the data and finally
deleting a file from our bucket works
again more or less the same the key in
this case is again right inside our
request and now we want to delete object
params our staff arrow handling and
finally yeah we can also simply say 200
sent with a message we can display on
the front end side file I'll delete it
alright so this is our controller and
now we just need our server we already
got a lot of codings about copy in the
mandatory stuff and we will only look at
the interesting stuff so some imports
use helmet some security allowed our
environment used to body partha at some
course some handling start the app so
this is more or less some general nodejs
Express server setup what actually is
interesting is how to call our routes so
we need a get route first of all to hws
and sign and this will give us once the
app wants to upload an image a signed
request and we can use our controller
side request okay first one got three
more
three more okay then we want to list the
files so list files goes here then we
want to access one file by its filename
so if we do it like this we can access
the file name right here through the
params so this will be get file signed
request and finally we're going to send
a delete request to files again slash
file name and this time called delete
file so this is how our routes for the
upload like and now we can give all of
this a little try inside postman okay so
before starting make sure I had a little
type or in here which gave me
credentials arrows so these are also
used from the Amazon SDK another hood so
make sure you change it to XS key right
here and also right here but once we got
this let's see we can open postman with
our collection and we make the first
request which is to signed request the
first oh and one more thing so if you
started like note server - yes it will
work but you won't get access to the
environment variables that's why I
directly use the Heroku toolbelt to call
Heroku local and then you will see a lot
where he loads the environment file
directly into our app and then we can
make the first request right here so the
first one is used once we want to upload
a file we pass in the name and the type
and we get back this interesting URL
right here so now it's a bit hard to
fake this because our app would now make
a put request using this
URL to upload something to our s3 bucket
but actually we can also do this with
postman so I will put in the new URL we
got the headers right here and we should
choose a file right here
perhaps some image of a tutorial no
let's take a real jpg file and then send
it and wait for it because this file was
not small but if we go to our console
now we see that our file is actually
here if we want to open it through the
link we got access denied because nobody
else access to this file there are no
permissions set so it's completely
hidden from the world
let's continue by listing out the files
which was our second route here so if we
call this we got the response from the
SDK some stuff in here but what's
interesting is the array right here you
see keep my file some stuff we don't
really need it right now but it's
actually listed as one file right here
now we need a way to display this file
so therefore we make the third call to
get a file signed request I've prepared
this right here I think but this should
be my file so we just need the key of
the file of course my file is now really
bad name but with our app we will create
a bit more unique name so once we do
this request we get back a signed
request to this file and let's open this
and make a get request and yeah that's
what's happening if we don't set the
header
I'm not sure if this will now work yeah
if the content type is set correctly we
will also get the image back
so the put request as I said is a bit
tricky from postman
but our ionic app will handle this
finally we can of course also delete my
file if we want to no we don't need a
body I think just a request and we get
back file deleted and let's verify this
yep the file is gone and also if we call
the list content is empty so let's do
this I think we had enough of this right
okay so this is or was the first part of
our series inside the second part we
will use these routes inside our ionic
app to capture an image upload it to our
s3 bucket print or show a list of files
of that bucket and also allow the user
to delete files I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial
