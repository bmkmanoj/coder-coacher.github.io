the tactic and the ioniq Academy in this
video I will show you how to use
animations in your ionic app in two
different ways so one way will be the
standard angular wave and the second
will be an external package we will
start with the first standard angular
approach and I already started a blank
new ionic app so you can do the same and
then you have to call NPM install for
the web animations j/s and the angular
animations package so ll run this
already and be web animations package is
simply the JavaScript implementation of
the web animations API this is a
polyfill we need to include in our main
TS so this will work in the browser in
general but it won't work let's say
perhaps on an iPhone where the browser
is different so therefore we have to
import this polyfill which is web
animations j/s slash web animations dot
min so simply put it to your main TS and
everything will be fine okay so this is
our polyfill now we want to implement
the angular animations so we can close
our console and we go to the yep module
ts kurtz first of all we have to import
the browser module as always but now
also the browser animations module I'm
not sure why this is not automatically
imported in general I have automatic
import but anyway make sure to improv it
from add angular it's inside platform
browser slash animations as far as I can
reconsider let's check if our app is
still running and then we can heat on to
implementing animations so this is the
basic to making sure we can use
animations ok so no problems therefore
let's go to our home TS and home HTML
and close this okay so what we want to
do actually is very simple in the
beginning the only thing we want to any
made with our basic animation is a
simple block we will set up a button
which will trigger the animation so we
will toggle the visibility of course you
could do this on I guess 100 different
ways but we will do it with the angular
animations and here will be some block
with I am sometimes here and sometimes
there okay and we will see how to
animate this block now we go to our home
TF file again and inside this decorator
at component we can now add another
thing called
animations this is an array of freaky
stuff so what we need as well some
keywords but I hope they will be
imported automatically so first of all
we define the trigger and this is called
whatever you like I will call it my busy
bility okay and as you can see this
trigger is not imported automatically so
we go ahead and import trigger from and
now we use the package we installed an
angular animations ok the trigger is the
keyword which we will use in our HTML
later on so you will see how we use this
in a second but first of all we define
some
stuff for our trigger and what would you
find our different states so perhaps we
have one state visible and another state
will lend me invisible and to this state
we assign some styling as you can see we
need to import all of this inside our
block now it's fine I could also call
this state XYZ but of course visible a
little bit easier to use and
understandable so this is not related to
any visibility aspect of the element
it's just a really the word visible and
it is visible we say opacity one of
course not really fancy here and as I
said we can define multiple states here
so another state would be perhaps
invisible and in that case we have an
opacity of zero okay this is already
working and I will demonstrate how so
first of all we have our very able and
we set it to visible in the beginning
and then we use our toggle visible
function to simply change the state of
our variable so in case this but visible
state is equal visible this is the
short-form
then we set it to invisible okay and
otherwise we set it to visible okay this
is the short form for if this is true
then do this otherwise do that so if
it's already visible we change it and
vice versa so we can now toggle the
state of our variable which will be
either visible or invisible and now we
have to assign our trigger to our HTML
and therefore we simply use this syntax
with an ADD and then the name which was
my busy bility I guess
and close the brackets equals our
visible state okay so yeah perhaps
already here okay I guess I had a type
of that let's refresh it and in the
beginning we have of course state
visible passed to our trigger my
visibility which means the opacity is
one if we now change it we go to the
state of invisible with an opacity of
zero but actually as you can see this is
not really in animation just whatever
change of state so what we can do inside
this block as well is add transition so
of course imported as well and for our
transition we can now define from which
state to which other state we want to
animate and in this example we will
simply use wildcards so start to star
means from each stage to another stage
do this and what we want to do is we say
we want to any made over a duration of
0.5 seconds in an image as well you see
there are some comports okay so we could
also define different enter and leaf
States or transition from different
states in a different way but in our
case we only have those two states and
we just say in general this wildcard
expression create an animation of a
half-second so if we toggle it now you
see our Texas appearing and disappearing
just like we hoped it would be
so there's the very basics of creating
angular animations you define this
animations block you add a trigger which
will be inside your HTML
perhaps connected to a variable and then
you get some some states and transitions
and there's a lot more you could do here
you could use keyframes as well but more
or less it's always like this or in some
different way we you might have
transitioned first and then some state
so you can get a bit freaky on this as
well okay so this is angular animations
now to the second part the second part
is about using external packages and
therefore we first of all need to
install another package called CSS any
major I have it right here so this is um
some animation package with support for
angular 2 and what this package also
needs is any made CSS so this is a cool
library of all kinds of animations you
can check them out right here so Paul's
and you see well whatever some freaky
animations and we need to include any
Mesa CSS as well but there are two ways
of doing this so the easy way is like
this just import the CDN hosted file of
any made min CSS and another way would
be to install a package as well and
create some special copy configuration
that copies it to our build folder and
you can find information on how to do
this second way in the related article I
have linked to another tutorial how to
include J s or CSS files from NPM
packages there but for now we will keep
it simple with a CDN file and ok we have
installed it so we go back to our app
module because we need to import first
of all the animation service and also
the any mates directive
and we import this from CSS any major
now the animation service just like any
service or provider goes to our provided
array in the animations directive goes
to our declarations hopefully our app is
still working now which is always a good
sign that we've imported everything
correctly here it's still working
and now we already hit two ways but now
we got two ways again so the first and
most easy way is using and directive and
we simply create a div block with the
any maids and directive and then we have
to create a variable which we assign the
animator to and perhaps we Center our
text and now we create a little button I
can copy this actually inside our
animations directive and on the click
event of this button if we change it so
it's not confusing inside the click
around we can now already use this
animation variable and called start
which will start the animation on our
defined this block and this is from the
configuration so you can find out all
these types of animations there I just
pass the type rubber band and perhaps
also a duration of let's say I think
this should be one second
okay let's save it and heat back and you
can see this is just like if we tested
out the rubberband animation of course
we could also have like wobble I kind of
like to play around with these
animations because it's so easy to use
them so this is really really easy we've
installed one or two packages
important to our module and edit the
directive and now we already get this
animation which is kind of amazing
because to build this animation here it
really dive deep into keyframes and
building a cool transition from the
states and this is really handy and easy
to use now if you don't want to rely on
this very very basic implementation
using a director you can also go to your
home TS and do it
of course differently so what we need in
that case is the animation service of
the type of this of the type animation
service it's already imported perfect
and we also need variable called any
major of the type animation builder okay
so he doesn't know about this one now he
should and inside the constructor we can
now set our animator to animation
service dot builder so we need to follow
that pattern to have a workable and
finally we also need a reference to
element of our HTML and the angular way
of course is using view child and we
will call it my element and this will be
my LM import the view child from angular
core and we argued now another function
animate element which will be called
once we hit the button and now we use
our animator and call first of all set
type you already see that some things we
can set here
we will set the type to let's say flip
in X and now you can see a lot of
options that we use show to show it on
our element and there we have to also
use the native element okay
now the final missing part is to add an
element with a my element name so we go
back here let's comment this out again
and create a little eye on card which
will have my element and now we can
change this card I will also add an eye
on card header just so you see that
actually everything is animated this is
my animation card and eye on card
content oh so much awesome content and
animation Wow amazing perhaps yeah the
last last step is to add button which
we'll call our function which was called
any made LM I think we change it to any
made it and we reload so let's see and
then we got our animation working so
what is happening now is that we call
the animated LM function which will use
our local animator which is an animation
builder we built the animation of a
specific type and we call to show it on
a specific element which is gathered
using view child and this is our view
child with the ID or name my element
and that's how our card gets the
animation of the animation builder of
course you can again
use all kinds of animations here again
and just play around I'll have to play
around because it's really easy okay so
which of those two ways should you use
well it depends so if you're really
building an application that relies on
animation and you always need them to to
be a cool app I would consider getting
into angular animations because they
they will perhaps evolve and you my to
tweak some stuff of your animation
blocks but also they will always be
supported in any way and you can be sure
that you somehow will get them working
if you're a bit lazy or not interested
in getting into CSS or JavaScript
animations of course and external
packages like CSS any major is great you
see just with a few lines of code we get
a pretty decent animation but of course
you're now reliant on dependent on
third-party package which is yeah
perhaps not the best sometimes maybe
ionic updates may be angular updates and
at some point you can use the package
anymore and you either have to switch to
a different package or you have to
switch to anger animations or you have
to stay in on all I only get angular
word so this is a bit tricky but if you
just want some cool animations for yup
and if they're gone well and it's not a
big problem for you at all I would also
recommend just to give it a try and see
how far you can get with a third-party
library like this I hope you enjoyed
this video if you want to find out more
about animations there's a complete
course inside the ionic Academy and I
would love if you would subscribe to my
channel and take a look at the ionic
ketamine and I will see you inside the
next video
