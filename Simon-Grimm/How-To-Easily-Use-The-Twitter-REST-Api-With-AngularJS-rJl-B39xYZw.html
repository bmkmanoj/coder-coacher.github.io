deaf dekhti today I will show you how to
easily use the Twitter REST API because
there are many questions out there
asking how to get the timeline how to
post and it's a bit tricky to sign your
requests and all that stuff and that's
why I created angularjs library acting
as a wrapper for this REST API and I
will show you how to use this library
and maybe I can motivate you to use it
as well because it makes the complete
process really really easy and I will
demonstrate how to use it with a simple
ionic project so I will star the blank
project right now and we will go through
everything we need on the fly so my ng
Twitter needs and our token and keys
from the Twitter app you need to create
and I will show you how to do this very
soon so first of all we can install the
ng Twitter API which is my library and
also I want to install ng Cordova which
will help us to grab the OAuth token and
at the moment we need to take the master
branch because there are some unmerged
changes which we really really need for
our app to work
okay so additionally I'm a bit lazy
we need to Cordova plugins the first one
is the in-app browser which comes up
when the OAuth though dialog appears and
additionally with a new version of
Cordova we need the whitelist plug-in
because we need to access external
resources and otherwise
this would get blocked okay let's go to
our index.html and I'm still a bit lazy
so copy or insert this three lines above
Cordova so this is ng Cordova you should
find it here this is the ng Twitter API
which is my library and additionally we
need this encryption library and you can
find it I have a link in the blog post
and also on my library and at the moment
we need to take the tech 1.6 so this
goes to now to the lip folder okay
so now it should be right here and here
it's included so let's go to our fjs and
add the dependencies to our array so we
want to use ng cordova and we want to
use ng twitter okay one more thing you
need to have an app created at app start
with her comm and I already have this
app and you need to copy some keys from
this page which those too and if you
want your app to post to your timeline
make sure the Epis the exes level read
and write because I once had it on read
and I was just not able to get why it's
not working so make sure you have both
permissions because we want to use the
timeline and the writing in this
tutorial okay additionally I will copy
the complete body because well we can go
through it it's not very special we have
a controller which we will create or we
can do right now just the app controller
and well we will see what we need in a
second okay so we have the app
controller we have a header bar and we
also have a text input field which is
model to a scope variable with a max
length of 140 like twitter has and a
small button to submit our tweet so this
is for posting a tweet we also have
pull-to-refresh view at the top which
will refresh our home Timeline view and
the interesting part is down here where
we iterate our home time line array and
create very simple cards for each
with well they use a profile image the
name we call a function which we will
implement to correct the time string and
we will have the entry text which is
just the text of the tweet and if there
is image we will also show the image so
there are a lot of things in the Twitter
rest response so just yeah check it out
yourself there are many things you can
do or grab from there and once you get
their response everything will get
simple and you can do whatever you like
so let's go to our fjs and implement the
controller we will need the ionic
platform ready function and the Twitter
API which is the dependency from our ng
Twitter and we need Cordova both which
will help us to do the social login if
you follow my tutorial on the official
ionic blog you might know a bit of this
code right here so we have Twitter key
which is well whatever you like this is
your Twitter storage Twitter key and
here we will save our oil tone if you
got a better idea let me know so here's
a client ID and our client secret and
those are the two right here in your
Twitter app so just copy them and you're
good to go
and finally let's have a variable for
our total when the app is running
and this is for our tweet message we can
compose okay next the ionic platform
ready function and okay sorry
at this point we want to check if we
have a total stored in our window local
storage and that's where we need our
twitter key so maybe our user has
already locked in and we can just take
that tone but if my token is still empty
or maybe it's now we should login the
user again and at this point we need ng
Cordova which makes it really simple so
thanks at Nick for making all those
functions for social login
so just pass the client ID we define up
here and the client secret and it should
return a promise which is hopefully our
total and at this point if we got the
toe we want to set the item for our
Twitter key which is this totem
json.stringify
okay hope this is clear to everyone what
we are doing here if not just ask a
question below or tweet me something and
and now we can use our magic Twitter API
and before we can actually use all those
routes we need to once call this Twitter
API configure this is very important
because this sets the basic
authentication and well this will use
all this stuff in the future requests so
this is very important and obviously if
we can grab all of totin from the
storage we can just use write this to
configure our Twitter API at this point
in the else part and okay
maybe we can include an arrow function
just in case okay I will learn it so I
can see it okay so when this login is
successful either this or this one we
want to call home timeline to update our
home timeline okay perfect now this was
the hard part of this tutorial trust me
so the next one is really really simple
because our show home timeline function
will again just use the Twitter API and
call get timeline and this is really
everything you need to do to get this
complete user home timeline response
which is in the promise here
and at this point we want to fill our
home time line array with the data we
just received and that's everything to
grab the home time land area you can
include an optional parameter here so if
you go to the REST API and check for
well what's it home timeline you can see
optional parameter account for example
so if you just want to have some tweets
you can include this parameter here and
this will give you just 10 and this is
the way you can use on all those
functions they're not very much
functioned at the moment in ng Twitter
but there will come a lot more in the
next few days or weeks and you can also
help to create some because there are a
lot but I will I think it's very easy to
map all those and once we got all them
it will be really easy for us so show
home timeline is working at this point I
guess and okay yeah it looks better so
the second one was to submit a tweet and
this is just pose stitches update and we
should pass the tweet we wrote in our
field so as you can see it's model to
tweet that message and it's exactly what
we give you could also include an
optional parameter at this point but we
don't need this right now
and once we've submitted it we will
return something but that's not really
interesting at this point so we will
again just call show home time lines
timeline will get updated then we got
the pull to refresh function which is
again should update our timeline and
okay I will make it a bit easier I will
just broadcast the scroll finish event
at this point yeah I could also do it
here but well whatever for this demo
it's okay and finally we got the correct
time string function which receives the
string which is the timestamp we got
from the Twitter response and this
should return a new date well just a bit
better formatting of our timestamp
string and I guess that's everything we
need so let's give it a try let me
mention I'm gonna make you can't build
for iOS if you are not on the Mac and
additionally all this wealth and social
locking stuff will not work in the
process so please deploy it to the
simulator or an iOS device otherwise
nothing will work and hopefully our app
is already working now but most of the
time oh well okay
so you see you saw the simple interface
and this is the social login dialog so
let me insert my credentials okay I have
authorized the app and it's redirecting
and here we go as you can see all the
tweets including images including the
profile picture with the text
and a lot more and in really no time
this is no problem for anyone to
implement and that's exactly the reason
why I created ng Twitter so let's test
our second function
so there are some problems regarding
special characters I'm working on it so
if you can't get it working with let's
say dot or I'm not sure which characters
it is just try it with a very simple
sentence without any characters just to
make sure everything's working so let's
try it out and this is a demo tweet from
my Twitter so this is real this is not
just edit at this point I could show you
but yeah trust me I guess I'm not locked
in okay so here is really my demo tweet
everything's working at this point I
will delete it because yeah it's yeah no
I don't need that tweet okay that was
very fast very easy and ok let's try to
pull the refresh yes I deleted my tweet
everything works as expected if you got
any questions just tweet me I would be
very happy if I get a star on my
repository or yeah submit an issue or
pull requests let's work on this because
this is really a pain for a lot of you
and this rapper makes stuff really easy
