and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
troubleshooting methods this lesson
focuses on iOS device maintenance let us
begin with the objectives of the lesson
in the next slide by the end of this
lesson you will be able to use automatic
archive configuration commands discuss
incident recovery tools use different
show commands and debugging commands
list the various cisco graphical user
interface tools let us start our
discussion by understanding how to
restore operations after failure it is
inevitable that someday the router that
has worked for so long will fail how
does an organization recover from such a
failure preparation starts long before
the device fails the organization must
have the operating system and the
application software as well as the
license for the device a replacement
device is required along with a backup
of the device configuration information
the same model and software image of the
replacement device may not always be
available this means that the
configuration may need to be tweaked to
work as the failed device did you can be
prepared for such failures by taking a
backup of your operating system and
configuration information to a server on
a regular basis there are many protocols
that can be used for this purpose
trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP is
used extensively in Cisco installations
File Transfer Protocol FTP is also an
efficient way to transfer files in
addition hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP or the HTTP secure can be used for
secure communications another protocol
that serves the purpose is the secure
copy protocol SCP in the next slide we
will discuss automatic archive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
