analytics and I keep hearing about
machine learning and it's applications
what's it all about machine learning is
a field of artificial intelligence that
refers to the ability of certain
programs to learn and grow with data a
simple example would be a spam
classifier that's used by most email
clients spam classifiers can be trained
to differentiate between spam and
non-spam emails which can then be used
to filter out spam emails elsewhere
machine learning is all the rage these
days and is a very important skill to
have if you work in the analytics
industry that sounds interesting
are there any famous examples of machine
learning that maybe I've come across the
most famous example is Google itself
it's a machine learning recommendation
engine which processes a huge number of
inputs to bring you the most relevant
results if you're into social media then
Facebook's newsfeed and friend
suggestion algorithms are other good
examples the Amazon and Netflix is
recommendation systems which have
brought great value to both customers
and the companies themselves are well
known applications of machine learning
all these applications are learning to
improve over time with more user data
available making better predictions in
the process great so what's working in
the industry like why should I consider
a machine learning career the companies
like Amazon Google the Microsoft and
Apple are hiring aggressively for
machine learning specialists machine
learning engineers draw an average
salary of 100 to $15,000 a year
with rising demand and steep salary
hikes it's one of the hottest fields
around so how do I begin the best way to
launch a machine learning career is with
a good training course check out simply
learns machine learning certification
training it takes a unique case study
based approach to training ensuring that
you get practical and women
and exposure even as you study theory it
covers all the techniques of supervised
and unsupervised learning including the
deep learning and spark machine learning
the course also includes quizzes and
projects to reinforce your learning and
over twenty eight hours of
instructor-led online training with
cloud lab integration you have a hassle
free experimentation environment to
practice wow that looks great I will
register for the training right away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
