learn webinar today I'm Dan evener your
host and moderator today we're going to
be talking about how radical analytics
can uncover blind spots in your data so
if you still believe that when illness
is just meaning to finding objectives
asking about KPI is embracing a
data-driven culture well your ROI is
kind of sneaking out of the back doors
so if you want to dive into the ocean of
data and find that one unique golden
nugget of wisdom that will transform
your organization well you can't do it
like everybody else is doing mainstream
web analytics are dead it's time to go
radical and that's what this is all
about so today we're going to learn how
to break the cycle of meaningless web
analytics then begin to rule by breaking
all the rules so now before the end of
this webinar we'll have a question and
answer session so if you want to ask a
question then the best way to do that is
to open your control panel here you're
muted at the moment because we have so
many people online here and if you can't
see your panel just check that little
red arrow that's off the side of your
screen open panel and then type your
question into the question field and
then we will get to it we'll address it
as soon as we can so with that I want to
introduce to you our guest and our
presenter it is really happy to have our
speaker Stephane Amell named the most
influential industry contributor by the
digital analytics Association Stephane
is a consultant and distinguished
thought leader is recognized as a Google
product strategy expert in 2016 and it's
also the faculty chair for digital
analytics that simply learned he co
manages the largest google analytics
user community on google+ stephan holds
an MBA specialized in a business and
he's held board positions with the
digital analytics Association and taught
graduate level digital analytics
marketing courses at La Valle University
so Stefan thank you for joining us how
are you doing
great favor for the intro always a
pleasure to have this opportunity to
share my thoughts and share some of my
experience and the experience I honestly
grabbed from talking to other people
also so I'm glad that I didn't have to
go through all of the those pain points
that I'm going to talk about but
hopefully it's gonna help other people
you know kind of go faster and not
repeat those mistakes that's great well
if you're ready Stefano I'll pass the
the the controls over to you and we'll
sit down and get radical all right okay
so you should see my screen now that
looks great
okay perfect great so let's talk about
radical analytics no this is this is
something I've been starting to look
into after a while years a couple of
years ago I started looking at the comes
the concept of digital analytics
maturity now how some organizations are
very successful and most of ours are
basically struggling and failing at
reaping the benefits of digital analysis
or webinar Texas you want to call it
this way so in this webinar we're going
to talk about a grief overview of what
are the premises behind the concept of
radical analytics I'm gonna try to show
a couple of examples where we can use
those concepts to better define the
realistic roadmap or better better to
find objectives and KPI and why do that
obviously you know I I'm not I'm not God
I want you to keep in mind that anything
I'm gonna say you might you might find
it a little bit you know radical in fact
and and that's fine that's fine because
I want people to exercise critical
thinking and and there's really no magic
recipe some of those those points might
readily apply to your environment and
maybe some others won't make sense for
you but that that's perfectly fine
it started by you know just thinking
about the way we've been doing web
analytics for the past ten years and
more you know I've been doing it for
over ten years in fact I started in the
web twenty five years ago when it came
out and we've always mostly for the most
part we've had it's a very similar
approach to it let's let's see what are
the objectives let's start from the
objectives because it makes sense you
know what is the business objective
maybe what is your managers objective or
maybe what's even your own personal
objective let's start from that and
think about what what success looks like
and then we're gonna define KPIs and
dashboards and we're gonna add tags to
our websites and so on so there's all
those concept and and very I would say
classic approach to it and we've been
trying to do that for 10 years and then
it started asking people at conferences
and my clients and I'm coaching agencies
so they can develop their own analytics
practice so through those those
conversations with people I have a lot
of respect for in the industry I started
asking okay tell me really how is it
going for you is it really working what
have you tried and if that work and what
doesn't work and usually there's there's
a lot more conversation around what
doesn't work and then we hear about
those amazing organizations that are
very successful and they become flagship
flagship examples of how analytics
should be done but they are very
different from the vast majority of
organizations and clients if you are on
the agency side and clients that you
work with so where do we start
do we start from objectives do we turn
them into smart objectives because we've
been told that that should be the way to
go right do we take a more
investigation approach of asking the
five W's plus one age which you know
what when where how and so on is it is
it a right way to do it and then then of
course there's politics gets involved
the priorities get shifted and you end
up oftentimes guessing what is the
objective so you know if we could
achieve something would we have
something to celebrate if we could make
it work would we be able to celebrate so
maybe that's one way to ask what is the
the objective or if you know how our
bonus is is defined how it is calculated
maybe you should work to measure what
are the underlying metrics that will be
used for determining determining the
annual bonus for example but all of
those are nuttin certainly very easy
because in my experience usually what
happened is when you ask managers or
clients what are your objectives
oftentimes they simply don't know I've
seen that more often than the opposite
right and even if I was going to ask you
you know what is your personal objective
most likely it's not something that you
you know you think about every every day
every week every month it's something
maybe once a year twice a years you sit
down and you think about okay what are
my personal objectives so we heard about
the concept of the elevator pitch
challenge so I have a challenge for you
if I was going to ask you let's suppose
that you know we're in a conference
environment or we're meeting face to
face over coffee and I ask you what is
your current measurement framework or
analysis process would you be able to
explain to me in in five minutes what it
is that you're doing
how are you bringing value to your
organization and then
it's interesting because recently there
was an article where someone asked 42
people in the industry what is your
number one strategy to define actionable
KPIs and reading the results of that the
of this this simple question what I saw
is 42 different answers so if if we knew
how to do web analytics or digital
analytics it you know by now we should
have a you know one way to define
actionable KPIs
there should be a methodology a process
to do that and yet even people who are
experienced in the industry nobody
agrees on on what it is to define actual
KPIs
42 different answers that that was
shocking and and all of those answers
are actually pretty good but there's no
Universal recipe so so all of those
elements contributed to my my desire to
to think differently if we've been
trying to do it for 10 years and it
doesn't quite work the way we want maybe
we should try something different so as
I was mentioning I've been looking at
digital digital analytics metaphor for
nearly 10 years now and I created the
digital analytics metric model and it
goes into five different critical areas
and the first one being governance
culture and adoption so essentially what
is your organization already did a
driven or data-informed or or not what
is the level of buy-in from senior
management and so on the other dimension
is what is the scope of what you're
trying to accomplish are you trying as
as a digital analyst or as a marketer
are you trying to optimize AdWords
conversions at truths and conversions or
are you trying to optimize multiple
brands across multiple jewelry fees for
multiple products and different
audiences and so on so the scope is the
playground how big and complex it is
and the objectives of course of course
are what you are trying to accomplish
and then you have the team in it the
expertise who is part of the team and
that extends to external partners
consultants subcontractors and things
that what who is in the team and what
are their skill sets are they
complementary to each other and then we
have the continuous improvement process
in methodology so how do you go about
how do you do analytics what are the
steps that you go through and as part of
the maturity model there's a
self-assessment and this area is
systematically in the weakest spot if we
had a good methodology we would be able
to repeat success we would say okay
we've learned and we can apply almost
the same steps and repeat success and
over time become more efficient and the
last one is the tools the data in the
technology so you know I often say it's
not about the tools it's about your
ability to leverage those tools so I
don't care if you have the most
expensive shiny object if you're not
able to use it if you're not making good
use of it so I've seen an organization
that are that have just basic tools but
they they leverage those tools to the
maximum extent so the goal is in order
to be successful you need to balance all
of those five areas so if you have if
you have one aspect that is very very
high but the other ones are lower you're
gonna fail if you have one aspect that
it's much lower than the other one let's
say processing methodology is the weak
spot so everything on a scale of one to
five would be that's at level three but
your methodology is that level one then
you're gonna be struggling to bring
value to the organization so I would
rather see an organization where the
five areas are balanced even if it's at
a lower level because that would mean
that at this level of maturity you're
bringing the most value to your
organization
based on the capacity that you have to
bring those values so this this was
really a starting point and eventually a
couple of months ago I started looking
at reticle and analytics and I wrote the
manifesto for radical and enolates and
there's a premises so for the rest of
the webinar we're going to go through
each of those eight aspects and I'm
going to give you examples for each of
those okay so let's start with digital
analytics is dead so we called it web
analytics we called it online analytics
we call the digital analytics I think
we're getting to a point where it will
just not make any sense to make a
distinction between the fact that it's
digital or not and I came up with this
definition of analytics it's our own
organization arrives at an optimal and
realistic decision informed by data and
each of those words was carefully chosen
the how and arrive to something implies
that there's a process there's a
destination there's a goal organization
can be profit nonprofit can be you know
multinational can be government can be
academic doesn't matter optimal and
realistic is super important because the
oftentimes I see analysts that are
making a gradation based on what would
be the optimal what would be the perfect
scenario in an ideal world and obviously
they complain that management doesn't
act on their recommendation why because
they couldn't balance what is the
optimal versus what is realistic what
are the constraints of the organization
is a time money politics regulations
resources name it so if you could
balance the best solution given the
constraints there would be absolutely no
reason not to act on your
recommendations so when that happened
usually it's because you are missing
some elements there's there's things
that you don't know otherwise you're
elimination would be would be acted on
right away
and then decision implies that there's
actually there's gonna be some decision
some actions and it's informed by data
it's not driven by data we don't become
data-driven because the data doesn't
decide anything on its own even with
machine learning and artificial
intelligence it's because we've
delegated that responsibility but all of
its own data doesn't do anything it
informs our decisions so based on this
definition we could say that does it
really matter if it's digital or not is
it everything digital anyway
that the data we use typically ends up
being digital that's one one aspect of
it the other aspect is we need to think
about the consumer the user and the user
is a multi-channel online offline
experience of your brand looking at it
just from the digital lenses doesn't
make any sense and I wouldn't even push
further and say well looking at it only
from the marketing standpoint doesn't
make any sense either because the
consumer the customer experience
transcends all of the marketing
functions all of the business functions
I should say and marketing is one of
those functions so given this definition
what is what is the ultimate goal of
your of your own organization why why
does your organization's is in the first
place are your objective tied to that
ultimate goal would you be you know in
the food industry you are able to track
exactly where your stake is coming from
so are you able to track how this
specific metric is contributing
contributing to the greater goal and and
seeing how our it's making progress so
you know at the end of the day any
organization has a very similar
conceptually a very similar structure or
very similar ultimate goals we want to
increase revenue but we also
want to reduce costs and this will lead
to profits if you can't balance the two
if if one is if your costs are greater
than revenue obviously if you know
you're not in for a long run but then
you also need to increase satisfaction
you need to increase customer increase
and keep customer satisfaction but I
would extend that to beyond customers it
includes includes employees investors
government it includes any stakeholder
that have an interest to stay engaged
with your organization and when you
combine that it leads to a sustained
sustainable organization so you're gonna
be there in the long run so if you're
not able to tie your objective and your
metrics to one of those boxes then
there's probably something wrong that
you're doing you need to be able to do
the trace back of where it came from so
in reality you know a good business
objective shouldn't be channel specific
or marketing or business functions
centric it should transcend the customer
experience regardless of the touch point
and it should transcend the business
functions so now what is the next the
next premise DMAIC is your best friend
let's let's ask a simple question is is
your job hard if you're listening to
this podcast you probably have an
interest to to understand you know you
probably go through some struggles there
are some issues challenges where are you
gonna go with your career what's going
on right so your job is probably not
easy and and you know what that's
perfectly fine of course your your job
is not easy and that's why you're there
you're supposed to be an analyst you're
supposed to be a marketer so it's
perfectly fine that your job is not easy
otherwise you may be you would be out of
a job
they wouldn't meet you so if we said
that we had been definition foreign
analytics and now we cannot have a
definition for for analysis analysis is
how to break something complex into
smaller parts so that we gain a better
understanding and if we understand the
how it works we're gonna be able to
measure and we're gonna we're gonna be
able to optimize but guess what this
should start with your own job if the
worst thing you can do is to complain
about the fact that your job is hard
because you're you're gonna lose all
credibility if you're if you're the
analyst if you're supposed to be able to
break something complex into smaller
part and God knows your job is complex
the environment the business environment
is complex the technology our
technologies are complex but if you keep
complaining that your job is hard how do
you expect to convince management and
other people that you're going to be
able to break the complexity of the
business and measure it and optimize it
so maybe we should stop complaining stop
complaining and really do something
about it so good thing is we're not the
first ones to think about that we're not
the first one to think that there are
things that needs to be improved and
measure and optimize so leans the Sigma
is highly recommended it's a set of
practices that are that have been used
in manufacturing the environment
initially but are really applicable to
anytime you have a process and
everything is a process marketing is a
process who you define a campaign you
execute the campaign it there are steps
there's a process to it so you can break
it down into small parts you can measure
each step you can optimize each of those
steps this means the Sigma use a lot of
segmentation slicing and dicing of data
and it's perfectly suited for an
environment where things are shifting
and moving all the time so there's
there's just five simple steps to get
going there's define measure analyze
improve and control so define what is
the problem what is the opponent may
is collect the right data look at the
quality of this data analyze is fine if
there's correlations and patterns in
combining multiple sources of data for
example improve is where you might be
doing an a/b or multivariate testing
it's it's where you would make your
recommendations and there would be
because we call it analytics there would
be a decision there would be action
based on a recommendation then you want
to control so you in the define phase
you define what are the batteries what
is the scope who is involved what are
the processes what are the limits but
also what are the metrics so the control
is going back and looking at those
metrics over time does it really work
did you really bring change and value to
the organization and then you repeat
that so what we aim to do is to read to
reduce the cost of complexity that's
optimization right and we want to
increase velocity and velocity is is
your ability to reduce the time between
the moment you find a problem in the
moment you solve a problem or take it
another way the moment you see an
important T and the moment you can
actually capture this important team so
increasing velocity means that the wheel
is turning faster and you bring more
value faster and and you know it's in a
sense we could we could say well we want
to make it easy to do business with I
had a manager that kept repeating me
this statement and there's tons of books
and training and in fact there's an even
a good training from simply learn about
means to Sigma there was a couple of
courses this is one of them so you know
you don't have to be a vendor wheel
since the area from a maturity
standpoint the area of processing
meteorology the weakest weakest spot in
the self-assessment go and learn about
this it's going to be a really good
start next point
is never asked always proposed this is
one of my favorite one what's difference
between closed-ended questions versus
open questions so suppose you make a
recommendation and you ask your manager
ok
can we do it or not the manager is faced
with a yes/no answer there's no other
options either you do it or either you
don't that's it so this is probably not
the best way to approach it because
there's there's no alternatives well if
you if you just ask what is your
objective what do you want to track what
do you want to see in the report what
the risk is the person in front of you
and you can be guaranteed that they're
gonna make up something if they're gonna
find something to tell you because of
course there are not stupid
right so if you if you ask what's your
objective once they told you what once
they tell you what is their objective
you're stuck with that even if even if
it's not a good objective if it is if
it's not defined properly so when you
simply ask someone what is your
objective you basically open the door
that they're gonna tell you what they
want they won't tell you why they want
it and that's super and important from
an analyst standpoint you want to know
why you should always ask why why why
all the time and and when you just open
the door like this you put yourself in a
context where gradually you become a
reporting monkey now you know that's a
pretty negative term meaning that you
yeah you know how to extract data from
the various tools that you're using you
spit out reports but nothing get done
with it because you basically you
created that that possibility yourself
by asking the other person what what to
do so instead never ask always propose
so always come prepared give options
start with a B options and/or ABC
and ask questions so even if it's not
perfect at least you you go into a
dialogue so you resist the the fact that
the person will simply tell you what to
do you need to resend why you should be
doing it so that gives me important you
to talk about product thinking and
product thinking is a relatively new way
of thinking about objectives and what
and priorities and things that when you
have a start-up especially a technology
startup so you think about the user
first what is the problem that you're
trying to solve for a specific audience
and then division is it you know is it
aligned with your with your strategy why
are you doing this why do you want to
solve the problem the first place for
this audience and the strategy is okay
how are we going to solve the problem
for this specific problem specific
audience so you have a problem solution
fit right and next you have outputs the
the goal is what what do we want to
achieve by doing that and what are we
going to do specifically so now we're
getting more into the tactics of how to
do it and and we're going to be able to
measure success so if you combine those
three simple boxes or steps you can end
up with a nice statement in order to
achieve our vision or our mission as an
organization our product or service will
solve a specific problem for a specific
target audience by giving them something
they need that is aligned with our
strategy obviously and we will know it
works when we see a specific goal being
achieved using those specific metrics so
that kind of replaces the former smart
objective approach with something that
is more I think more tangible or more
appropriate for for what we're doing so
now instead of asking making
recommendation and asking yes no instead
of opening the door and asking
what you want to do what if you came
with something like two or three
statement like those and said okay if I
understand your objection the business
if I understand what we're trying to
achieve as an organization I think we
should be working on a B or C and this
will you lead the conversation and maybe
it's not perfect but at least you have a
dialogue and you it can be much better
than the other way around okay next one
eat your own dog food this one is
something I heard when when I was
working at Microsoft and at the time at
the time back in the days
Microsoft decided to embrace the
internet and they created their own web
server and I was used to run the
Netscape server so honestly when when
Microsoft decided that they'd add their
own they wanted to have their own web
server we had as a Microsoft employee we
had to switch everything from Netscape
to the microsoft iis server and in the
early days that didn't really work well
but we had to eat our own dog food we
had to preach what we or do what we
preach so let's let's apply what we do
in terms of analysis and optimization
and measurement to what to our own job
so anyone who have done some project
management or study project management
know about the triple Mott and triple
constraint model where you have cost
time in scope so if you if you want you
want something faster you either have to
reduce the scope or increase the cost to
allocate more resources to do it if you
want to reduce the cost increase the
time or reduce the scope and so on and
so on
so if you apply that to your own job one
of the thing I hear very often is how
digital analysts and marketers are just
won't buy too much work they are working
on so many things that they don't have
time to even think about ways to
simplify their job
so what if you what if you were asked to
cut 10% of what you do or 20 or even 50%
what if you were asked to destroy
destroy your business which is something
that Jack Welsh talked about the years
ago where if you had to if you had the
important T to start again from scratch
in your job in your current position
what would you do differently what what
are the tools what are the other people
you would you would hire if you're a
manager you know so thinking about that
is gonna be useful because there's
different activities you can do to
optimize your job you can review roles
and responsibilities you can think of
the 8 wastes of lean and and some of
them maybe they don't really apply to
our industry but waiting for example
might be a good example of how often
they have to wait for data to to be
ready to come in
why do you do reporting once a month
when it could be cell serves at any time
that could be a way of removing yourself
from a little value function which is
providing monthly reports and empowering
people to access those reports whenever
they want it and you wouldn't yeah of
course upfront it's gonna be a little
money it's gonna be more work but you
have to do those things in order to
improve your own job function learning
to say no given the the rows and
restaurant responsibilities how can we
can you say no to two requests that are
that simply don't make sense right and
lastly take the lead don't wait to be
told what to do
make make proposition make suggestions
based on what you control manage and
influence I'm I'm going to talk a little
more about those those three aspects of
control manage and influence so do all
of this to say think about ways to
optimize your own job because if you can
optimize your own job you're going to be
much in a much better position to
optimize the business so let's talk just
a little bit about the responsibility
matrix or racing matrix this is one way
to review the roles and responsibilities
of what you do and other people in your
team so you identify all of the tasks in
who is responsible for doing the work
who is accountable for let's say signing
up and approving it who needs to be
consulted and who needs to just stay in
the loop consulted our subject matter
experts for example if you if you work
on a project where you have some cookies
and you have some things that you're not
too sure from a legal standpoint well
you don't have a lawyer in your team so
you will consult a subject matter expert
on on those aspects informed are
typically stakeholders to whom you would
probably you know send your reports and
stuff like that so why is this important
because you have what you think your job
is that's your role conception and then
there's a disconnect with what other
people think that you should be doing
what is your role so that's the
expectation from other people and then
there's another disconnect and and
finding there is a role behavior which
is what you actually do in your job so
there's a big difference between what
you think your job is what other people
think
you are doing and what you actually do
right so you want to this this
responsibility matrix is a way to
realign those three aspects as much as
possible so this this is an example of a
workshop where we regrouped the five
member of the team and we categorize
different tasks into different
responsibilities so it's a coincidence
but the different colors represent
different type of jobs and we regroup
them into the outcomes and actions
basically what it's the business side of
things enabling capabilities like
tagging and managing data and stuff like
that creating reports and the analysis
is is where you particularly would do
the bulk of
work and notice how many post-it notes
there are on the enabling capabilities
side of things so a lot of tasks to
collect and get the data ready but on
the analysis side of things there's
actually less items than the two others
so this this is you know doing something
like this requires time dedication it's
it can get emotional because you are you
realize that what you thought was useful
it might not be that useful in the eyes
of theater team members and so on
but it's absolutely worth doing it and
again that's something that you can you
can find information about RACI matrix
you don't have to reinvent the wheel so
next one we have a couple of - a couple
of other points to go through don't see
executive buy-in so what we've been told
and Tom Davenport is very well respected
rights for wrote a very good book
competing on analytics and and one of
the thing is is like any major
transition becoming data informed
data-driven requires leadership from
executive at the very top we have have
passion for this this approach of being
data-driven that makes a lot of sense
right but the reality is executive
sponsor sponsorship is something that
you are really lucky if you work in an
environment where you you have a senior
manager who is all be data-driven and
then it's gonna trickle down you know
it's gonna start at the top and it will
gradually go through all of the
organization so the problem with that is
yes executive sponsors can overcome the
major roadblocks but they tend to work
on big issues they tend to have
grandiose you know novel solutions that
they want to work on and that's gonna be
time it's gonna take time it's gonna be
costly and it's gonna be risky so
when I go to conferences we were you
know it's a bit of an echo chamber where
we think as digital analysts all we
we're gonna become the CEOs of the
future right well not sure about that
maybe one day that would be great
but for the mass the vast majority of
other organizations there's there's
simply no it's not true that you're
gonna go knock on the door of the CEO
and say hey mrs. or mr. CEO I'm the
digital analyst I have this great idea
no that doesn't work this way you won't
get a seat at the big table that's not
how it works
if you're lucky yes all right good for
you but most of the time the way it
works is through grassroots ideas
grassroot innovation because the people
that are I would say at the bottom of
the food chain the people who are
actually doing the work they know what
works and what doesn't work they have
great ideas of small improvement quick
iteration that leads to incremental
victories that's a lot easier so rather
than trying to improve one thing by 100
percent
what about improving a hundred little
things by by one person at a time so the
result won't be a linear improvement
it's gonna be exponential because you're
gonna be able to bring additional value
faster you're gonna in you're gonna
increase velocity by bringing small
incremental improvements faster if
that's going to lead to an exponential
curve so I mentioned I was going to talk
about managed control and influence so
what are those three things the control
aspect is those are the tasks that you
already do you should control those
tasks if you don't this is the the first
place where you can improve your work so
improve your own processes then you find
ways to deliver more value at a lower
cost and lower cost means you know
oftentimes it means saving time or
completely getting out of the new
quantify your work measure what you do
this way you're going to be able to
to prove to your manager that you
actually bring bad new to the
organization think about in terms of
agile development they have ways to
measure the value of what they deliver
just read about that and learn about it
and use those same metrics that's gonna
work for you manage is what you are
accountable for so if you are in a
management position or if you if you
work with subcontractor for example you
are accountable for their work you
allocate resources and you have to
motivate them toward the goals so those
are the things you manage and influence
are areas where you are a subject matter
expert yourself and those are
potentially new areas where once you
manage and control the things that you
should be doing then you can think about
growing your influence and getting a
larger scope for digital analytics or in
Aleks in general and bracer John will
die
classic waterfall project management
simply doesn't work
foreign allocates it just doesn't make
sense in the digital world where things
are moving so quickly important things
are coming all the time there's always
new things to fix and so on
so so we need to be very agile in the
way that we address our work so
obviously I won't go through all of
those those 12 principles but what I did
is I borrowed the principle in the 12
principles of agile I looked at it I
thought well you know they all apply to
the way we should be doing analysis I
just had to do minor changes to those
descriptions but this is essentially
what we should be doing and then as
analytics is is not a one-time project
it's a way of living the organization
it's a way of thinking it's a way of
simply good it's not it cannot be
single project because the project has a
starting date it has a hen date and it
has a scope and what happened when the
project is over well everybody goes back
to the next project that doesn't make
sense right so analytics analysis is a
continuous process of improvement
uncovered on the unknown unknowns this
there's this famous statement from
Donald Rumsfeld so one of the other
reason why you want to embrace agile is
that if you try to have perfect business
objective perfect KPI is perfect
dashboard perfectly poor is perfect
tagging perfect everything you will
never get there so the sooner you can
start the sooner you can start to get
some data you're going to be able to
uncover the unknown unknowns the things
that you could never have thought that
they existed until you actually started
to do something until you actually
started to get data look at it and find
the unexpected and then react on those
things so one way to do that is I've
become a fervent advocate of pilot
projects or proof of concept more
experiment the funny thing is sometimes
when I when I say oh we should do a
proof of concept to a client they say oh
don't don't ever call it proof of
concept we've tried that before and you
know it's a cursed word we never used a
term proof well okay let's call it an
experiment or cut it apart project
whatever the term you want to use but
the idea is remember how analysis is how
to break on a complex topic into smaller
parts so that we gain we can understand
how it works we can measure we can
optimize well you know if breaking
something complex in small parts implies
lowering the risks and implies a right
to let a right to fail but I like to
learn because regardless of the outcome
of the experiment or proof of concept or
pilot project regardless of the outcome
now you know something you know
something that you didn't know before
whether your iPod is this turned out to
be false or true doesn't really matter
the important thing is now you know that
it works or it doesn't work and if you
think in terms of agile or in terms of a
start-up you would think okay what what
is the minimum viable solution that I
can put out there start to bring some
value start to make a change make a
difference not in not in a year from now
that in six six months from now but try
to work in a reasonable chunk of time
that would be every month or maybe even
every week if you can do it but if it's
a project that that is going to take too
long the risk and the likelihood that
you're gonna get there is much lower so
an actual example I have a client right
now who wants to create review their
dashboards they use to have Excel
reports and now they want to review
those they want to review dashboards and
KPIs and so on so we went through the
exercise of okay let's let's revisit
what are the goals of business
objectives they find some KPIs and so on
do we have the right data to do it but
in terms of dashboard we we shouldn't
wait to have the perfect solution that
will get all of the data from a data
lake and magically spit out amazing
dashboards that that simply won't work
so what I recommend it is let's start
with okay there's two KPIs that we we
can be pretty sure that the other you
know they are fine they are the right
one everybody agrees let's start with
those two kpi's that's it nothing else
and let's prove that we can actually
deliver value and the data like is not
there that's fine let's let's hook up
directly to do the ordered data sort the
original data source don't wait for
perfection because you will never get
there so I want to leave you with this
last one
analysts are change agents so what is
the
difference between an analyst and a
manager there's there's one simple big
difference
analysts were given the privilege of
making recommendation through their
analysis they have the privilege of
coming back to managers and saying okay
I looked into it this is what I found
this is what I recommend managers have
the power of decision so there's there's
a bit of a disconnect between the two
but imagine when you make a
recommendation imagine you are the
manager would you say yes to your
recommendation when you go forward if if
you wouldn't then it's obviously not a
good recommendation so what as as a
teacher to future MBAs and marketing
masters hopefully in the coming years
we're going to see and and with the
evolution of the industry also we're
gonna see more managers who are data
savvy they understand what is analytics
and they will want to leverage this
possibility and and eventually analysts
of today are going to become managers
and they will understand it the
importance and of doing analytics right
so in the meantime what can you do about
it what we want to look at is people who
have a depth of knowledge versus a
breadth of understanding so is it better
to master a specific tool or so that
would be very vertical or is it better
to understand the concepts as they might
apply in different tools
is it better to understand the concepts
of marketing which would be a breath of
understanding or understand marketing
for the specific vertical very deeply
the specific vertical where you work
let's say automotive or finance or
insurance and so on so when you build a
team you want to look at people who a
balance between people who have a death
of knowledge in some areas in some
specialties
I'm also a breath of understanding for
as different business disciplines and in
the market what we see is obviously
there's a lot of digital analysts and
marketers who learned through the
digital world they know about social
they know about the web do know about
mobile but maybe they were not exposed
to the concepts of writing very broadly
some people learned how to master Google
Analytics but maybe they they lack some
breadth of understanding of the concepts
of doing analysis right so in the
picture I showed about the racy
workshops there was the the the post-it
notes were positioned in a triangle so
we have the business outcomes and
actions it starts there
they said the strategy in the goals so
they can be communicated to as business
requirements and objectives to people
who are able to enable those
capabilities and that includes what are
the technologies involved what is the
information architecture of your website
how do you do tagging how do you
leverage Big Data technologies and so on
so they make it possible and they supply
the means the tools in the data so
people who have more of an analysis
background understand statistics have a
problem-solving approach are able to
send eyes a lot of information into
something they can communicate
effectively as actionable insight and
recommendations back to the business so
the thing is individually you have a
strong area regardless of the three I
guarantee you that one area you look at
it and you think yet this is really what
I like this is I'm good at it this is
what when I wake up in the morning this
is what I want to do and then there's an
inner area maybe you can you do a good
job you know you can manage and the
third area probably is something if I
have to make a choice this is not what I
would be doing so if you think about
someone typical web analyst or a social
media analyst they they might be
good at the enabling side of thing
because they need to understand the
specifics of where they are and now as
analyzing for is it social media is it
Facebook Twitter and so on is it a
website but they all they are probably
strong on the analysis side of thing
right so so they can do all of those
things but maybe they cannot be good at
everything right so maybe the business
is gonna be the weak spot think about
the data scientist data scientists are
super strong and a technology enabling
community side a side of things
and they are usually pretty strong also
on the analysis but business no not
really think about a marketer or now
marketers but they are good on the
business side they might be fairly good
on the analysis but typically they are
not the ones who are going to be drilled
by putting tags on a website and coding
some JavaScript and doing queries into a
database so find out what really drives
you and if you as a team what you want
to do is to balance all of those skills
in order to have empowered analytics so
that's why working as a team is always
better and find people or or train
people learn using the training from
simply learn to develop those activities
and those various dimensions so wrapping
up execution is not an event an
analytics is not a project it's not a
one-time push toward achieving a goal
it's a way of life so good analysis good
analytics I hope you enjoyed it and we
can go for some questions great thank
you so much Stefan
well those of you that want to ask some
questions feel free to click on the red
arrow if your control panel is docked
and open it up and then pop open that
question panel and feel free to type
something in there we already have a few
people asking questions one is Jamal
wants to know what is the difference
between a data scientist
a data analyst I know you kind of
explained this a little bit in your
triangle that you just showed but it is
a pretty a pretty distinct field yes and
and what's interesting is when you look
on your couple of years ago there was
virtually no training on how to become
an analyst be it very technical or be it
more business oriented and now you look
at there's there's just a ton of
different ways to learn about becoming a
data scientist and and there's a little
bit of a you know a buzz word around
that term honestly so data scientists
typically know more about the enabling
capabilities they know about the our
language for example they know about
Python they know about sequel queries
they can they can put against a database
they know about the data structure
behind it they are the one who will act
will actually look at the data and build
a model and that model so through their
skills here in the enabling capabilities
and their ability to learn to to
leverage statistics and predictive
modeling and stuff like that they will
build a model and that model is going to
be used by the business and well data
analysts typically they take and and and
building a model in data science you
it's not something like oh yeah ok let's
do a quick analysis and we're gonna turn
out a model in a day usually it takes
longer than that data analysts usually
start have a different approach because
they start with an a specific business
question that might be a one of maybe
it's an ad a question and they will use
their their ability to leverage so using
for example a Lean Six Sigma approach of
define measure analyze improve and
control they will take that that
question they will go and ask the right
questions to the data in order to come
back with an answer to the business so I
see that as being two different areas
the other difference also is that data
scientist
obviously they don't limit themselves to
to web data or mobile analytics or
social data you can work with any type
of data and they are used to work with
the low-level granular data while most
of the time data analysts they work with
a black box they work with Google antics
they work with Adobe Analytics they work
with packages that are extracting the
complexity of what is going on behind
the scenes so so they don't have to know
as much about deep underlying nitty
gritty details of how it's working
because when they want to get to is what
is the question what is the answer
great thank you
so Andre wants to know if is his hands
on experience better teaching daily
analytics then doing coursework or so
that would be a recommendation as to the
best way to learn this particularly in
the radical analytic side yeah well I
think it's a balance on the 2d for
example through sampling or in the
course that I'm teaching a non-central
learn I'm talking about the concepts I'm
talking about the the breadth aspect of
it so what are the broad concept that
you need to master that you need to
understand in order to be a good data
analyst but I won't go into the specific
details of how to use Google Analytics
to do this and that because there's
plenty of resources to do that but you
need you need both you need gradually
you need to to develop that that
experience with with specific tools
because that's how you become efficient
at answering those the questions knowing
what questions you need to answer to you
to ask is the breadth of understanding
that's where it comes from and that's
often time through either you know
formal academic learning to things like
simply learn or even reading books and
stuff and that I think it's a balance of
both that that you need and excuse me
for radical analytics a lot of those
things obviously you know I'm I'm
working on it right now so
it's a work in progress and there's
probably not many other places to learn
about except maybe going into I'm
writing articles on the the median
platform so if you go to this building
radical analytics you will find the
manifesto and from there there's links
to other articles that I've already
written about that and there's more to
come
thank you very much Stefan we're about
out of time and I'm I've been your
moderator Dave evener and please join us
again here it's simply learn and if
there's anything else you'd like to say
it's the fun
take us out all right thank you very
much for having me and always a pleasure
and if there's full of up questions just
reach out and happy to answer great
thank you very much everyone have a
great day
all right thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
