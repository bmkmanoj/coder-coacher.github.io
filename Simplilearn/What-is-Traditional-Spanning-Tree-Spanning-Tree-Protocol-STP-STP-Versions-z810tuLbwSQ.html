and switching course offered by simply
learn in the previous lesson we learned
about link aggregation in this lesson we
will look into traditional spanning tree
let us begin with the objectives of the
lesson in the next slide by the end of
this lesson you will be able to explain
STP and its versions configure root
switch port priority timer and cost
explained be PDUs and tiebreaking in
bpdu explain the functions of root
bridges described topology changes and
its types let us start our discussion on
spanning tree protocol in the next slide
STP solves three interrelated problems
in a switching domain when there are
bridging loops duplicate frames can
occur which leads to Mac table
instability this can cause broadcast
storms which may disable a network
always enable STP on all switches in a
layer two domain if STP is disabled
bridging loops are not detected and
prevented spanning tree is enabled by
default for all virtual local area
networks in the next slide let us look
into the different versions of STP there
are many versions of STP as seen in the
table
the original is 802.1 D common spanning
tree CST the default version used on
most Cisco switch platforms is P vs t
plus now known as P vs T our STP and
MSTP are additional standard versions
PVR st plus is Cisco's implementation of
rapid spanning tree RS T in the next
slide let us focus on bridge ID each
switch has a bridge ID which is the
basis for STP configuration most
switches use an
standard system ID this consists of a
four bit priority multiplier a 12 bit
VLAN ID and the mac address the bridge
ID is assigned in increments of four
zero nine six in the next slide let us
look at the root bridge also called the
root switch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
