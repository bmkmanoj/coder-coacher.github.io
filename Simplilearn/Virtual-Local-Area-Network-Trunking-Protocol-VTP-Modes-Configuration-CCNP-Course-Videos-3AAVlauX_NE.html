and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on be
lands and trunks this lesson focuses on
vtp let us begin with the objectives of
the lesson in the next slide by the end
of this lesson you will be able to
explain btp modes configurations and
advertisements explain configuration
revision number configure and verify vtp
pruning configure p VLAN identify the
structure of pv lon let us start our
discussion of vtp virtual local area
network trunking protocol or vtp is a
Cisco proprietary protocol other
manufacturers may use GV RP or MV RP for
the same purpose GV RP is supported only
on catalyst operating system Kat OS
switches cat OS is another cisco
operating system VLAN configurations are
exchanged over trunk links to connected
switches at layer 2 this particular task
can be accomplished with VLAN management
policy server vm PS but it is rarely
used let us now look at the benefits of
V TPS
BTW PS have several benefits there is
less manual interference for
configuration of vlans also consistent
configuration is easier you can also
track and monitor the network with bt p
however in the hierarchical network
model only local VLANs are used and they
are limited to about three on each
access which in this case btp is usually
not necessary as always if you don't
need it don't use it it just adds
complexity to your network for switches
in all modes vlan-id VLAN name and vtp
configuration is stored in the VLAN that
file in the switch this file is retained
between boots for a transparent switch
configuration information is stored in
the running configuration since vtp is
on by default you must be cautious when
implementing new switches or changing
configurations when using VLANs make
sure you reinitialize the VLAN DAT file
and start working on a clear switch this
is important because a switch is a vtp
server by default all connected switches
will learn any configured VLANs from
each other when they are booted unless
you clear the switches first to clear a
switch shut down all the interfaces on
all connected switches and delete the
VLAN file on all switches then reload
all switches now let us look at the vtp
