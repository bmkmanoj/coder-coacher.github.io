and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
troubleshooting NAT and DHCP in this
lesson we will focus on troubleshooting
voice and video let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to discuss the characteristics
of multicast exclaim the IGMP describe
the types of P I M let us start our
discussion with an understanding of
multicast multicast is used extensively
for video and telepresence for example
if a training course is streamed the
users who sign up for the course can
join the multicast group and receive the
training course the multicast address
range is 2 to 4 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0
through two three nine dot 255 dot 255
dot 255 the multicast address receives a
stream of packets that constitute the
multicast communication routers provide
the stream to each subnet device called
a host that has joined the multicast
group routers and hosts need a way to
communicate with each other for example
a host may leave the multicast group the
router needs to know this in order to
avoid wasting bandwidth one such
protocol is the internet group
management protocol in the next slide we
will look into a GMP host join a
multicast group by sending an IgM P join
message to their routers depending upon
the version IGMP messages are sent to
either the all host address 2 to 4.0 0.1
or the all routers address 2 to 4 0.02
these messages discover the routers and
hosts involved in the multicast stream
switches are also involved in a GMP a
switch uses igmp snooping to listen for
messages passing between IGMP routers
and their hosts in this way it
determines which of its interfaces pass
multicast traffic in the next slide we
will discuss how
IGMP information is used in protocol
independent multicast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
