and switching course offered by simply
learned the previous lesson focused on
Cisco's internetworking operating system
in this lesson let us look into the
network architectures wireless access
and troubleshooting of Cisco's internet
work let us begin with the objectives of
this lesson in the next slide by the end
of this lesson you will be able to
describe network architectures for small
office home office and small to
medium-sized businesses
explain considerations for wireless
access to a network follow a frame or a
packet through an internetwork
for troubleshooting purposes let us
first look at network architecture in
the next slide network architecture
refers to the way devices are connected
to form a network this is not same as
network topology topology refers to a
specific networks layout architecture
refers to the general approach to
designing a network different business
requirements dictate different network
architecture for small office/home
office Soho environments the
architecture is simpler than in
enterprise environments there may be an
all-purpose device instead of a separate
router switch and firewall for example
for home use most routers are really a
router and a switch combined there is
less redundancy which makes configuring
maintaining and troubleshooting the
network simpler usually one subnet is
used for all devices and static routes
are used for routing there is no
full-time network administrator in the
next slide let us look into small office
home office
architecture here it is seeing that
there is no longer one all purpose
device the switch and router functions
are separated as the number of network
devices increase a router no longer
provides enough interfaces to connect
them all
therefore a switch is implemented the
router uses firewall software in this
architecture a standalone firewall
device is normally not deployed note
that in the figure on the slide there
are two connections to the Internet one
through a tunnel and one straight to the
Internet
this does not mean that there must be
two physical connections to the Internet
this separation can be implemented with
software
let us continue our discussion on small
to medium-sized business architecture
the characteristics of a small to
medium-sized business architecture are
as follows depending on the business
there may be a site-to-site VPN that
encrypts traffic between this business
and its suppliers and/or customers there
are varied types of traffic on the
network network management and or
monitoring software is installed to
monitor the status of the devices and
traffic wireless access can be
implemented in any architecture in the
next slide let us look at how wireless
access works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
