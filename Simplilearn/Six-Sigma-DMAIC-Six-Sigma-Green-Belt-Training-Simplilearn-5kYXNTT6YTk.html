learns Lean Six Sigma Greenbelt
certification course the defined phase
is the first phase of a project that
follows the Lean Six Sigma process the
main purpose of define is to describe
the goal of the project and the steps
required to get there it's like going on
a journey and placing an X on the map to
indicate the desired final destination
the tools use the define phase help in
understanding the true problem that
needs to be solved and defining the plan
to get there the tools and techniques
used in the define phase support primary
deliverable which is a project charter
or a project plan hello and welcome to
the measure phase of Lean Six Sigma
implementation the main objective of
measure is to collect as much
information and data on the current
project process as possible the purpose
is to be able to understand the true
impact of the project and accurately
determine if the process has improved
after solutions are implemented we will
need to evaluate the measurement system
collect and summarize data determine if
the process is stable
check for normality of the data and then
lastly verify process capability if the
defined phase is like going on a journey
and placing an X on the map to indicate
the desired final destination the
measure phase is like calibrating the
GPS to make sure we can determine when
we have reached our desired destination
or goal the tools used in the measure
phase will help us validate the current
performance and analyze basic
characteristics or conditions of the
process hi and welcome to the analyze
phase the main objective of analyze is
to identify the critical factors our X's
in the process that impact the
performance of the process or the Y
variable the purpose is to be able to
determine where the problems are coming
from in order to eventually create
solutions to fix them it's in this phase
where some of our more advanced
statistical concepts will be discussed
and applied if the measure phase is like
calibrating the GPS to make
we will know when we have arrived at our
desired destination or goal the analyze
phase is like discovering the factors of
the trip that will slow us down from
reaching the final destination the tools
used in the analyze phase will help us
validate the current performance and
analyze basic characteristics or
conditions of the process in this
section you will learn to perform
exploratory data analysis to identify
root causes using multivariate charts
and regression analysis and use
hypothesis testing for normal and
non-normal data let's get started with
the lesson explore e data analysis hi
and welcome to the improve phase the
main objective of improve is to develop
solutions linked to critical X's that
are identified from the analyze phase
the purpose of improve is to be able to
determine where the problems are coming
from in order to eventually create
solutions to fix them using lean
techniques will help find ways to
streamline the process if the analyze
phase is like discovering the factors of
the trip that will slow us down from
reaching the final destination the
improve phase is like finding the most
effective route or shortcuts to ensure
we reach the goal successfully the tools
using improved phase will help us engage
with our teams process owners and
stakeholders to generate solution ideas
prioritize solutions and validate
proposed solutions for implementation hi
and welcome to the control phase the
control phase is the last lesson of the
course and the last phase of the domain
journey the main objective of the
control phase is to create a control
plan that acts as a roadmap for the
process owner and provides information
to sustain the improvements your team
made to the process the purpose of
control is to ensure the process gains
implemented are maintained long after
the product is over if the improved
phase is like finding the most effective
route or shortcuts to ensure we reach
the goal successfully the control phase
is like making sure we do not deter from
the define route
