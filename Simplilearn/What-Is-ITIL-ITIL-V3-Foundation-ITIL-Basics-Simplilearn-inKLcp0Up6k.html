technology infrastructure library that
includes a set of books focusing on IT
Service Management with guidance from
practicing IT professionals ITIL was
published between 1989 and 1995 by Her
Majesty's stationery office or HMSO in
the UK on behalf of the central
communications and telecommunications
agency known as C CTA which is now part
of the Office of government Commerce or
OGC its early use was principally
confined to the UK and Netherlands a
second version of ITIL was published as
a set of revised books between 2000 and
2004 in 2007 ITIL version 2 was
superseded by an enhanced and
consolidated ITIL version 3 consisting
of five core books covering the ITIL
Service lifecycle this version is also
sometimes called ITIL 2007 it was
decided that post 2007 newer versions of
ITIL will be known by the year in which
they are published example ITIL 2007
ITIL 2011 in July 2011 the third version
of ITIL was upgraded to ITIL 2011 with
some changes in the processes let us
look at an overview of ITIL in the
following screen ITIL is not a
theoretical view of how to manage IT
services it is a documented practice and
is easily adapted to irrespective of the
organization's size or complexity it
emphasizes quality management approaches
and standards and supports quality
systems such as ISO 9000 it is guided by
total quality frameworks such as the
European framework for quality
management or EF qm &amp;amp; the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award or MB in
QA since the time of version 2 ITIL had
become a
worldwide standard for IT Service
Management this is reflected not only in
the large number of people following
ITIL training courses and getting
certified but also in the adaptation of
ITIL by the British Standards Institute
the goal of ITIL has been to provide a
consistent yet flexible best practices
framework for IT Service Management this
framework should be suitable for all IT
environments ITIL also ensures that
there is a standardized vocabulary along
with platform-independent processes in
the next screen we will discuss the
course agenda there are four levels
within the ITIL scheme the first is the
foundation level which focuses on
knowledge or comprehension of IT Service
Management and provides a good grounding
in the key concept terminology and
processes of ITIL the foundation exam
carries two credits second comes the
intermediate level certification which
assesses an individual's ability to
analyze and apply the concepts of ITIL
this certification can be taken only
after clearing the foundation level and
is composed of two streams service
lifecycle and service capability the
service lifecycle stream consists of
five individual certificates built
around the five cores ITIL books that is
service strategy service design service
transition service operation and
continual service improvement
individuals preferring to stay on the
management side of IT can choose this
stream to enhance their IT Service
Management knowledge the exam for each
lifecycle phase and this stream carries
three credits the service capability
stream consists of four individual
certificates focusing on detailed
process implementation and management
within cluster groupings which are
operational support and analysis also
called OSA service offerings and
agreements or SOA release control and
validation or rcv and planning
protection and optimization or PPO
these certifications are meant for
individuals who would like to deepen
their knowledge in specific areas of IT
Service Management the exams in this
stream each carry four credits the third
level within the ITIL scheme is the ITIL
expert certification which demonstrates
that the individual has successfully
completed a number of intermediate units
in addition to the mandatory foundation
level and the managing across the
lifecycle capstone course the M ALC
module which has five credits sits
between the intermediate and expert
levels and is the final required
qualification for gaining expert status
the expert level certification requires
that the individual has 22 credits
across the qualification scheme the
fourth and final level is the ITIL
Master a senior level service management
certification that allows experienced IT
service managers to demonstrate their
knowledge of ITIL and its application in
the real world more information on the
ITIL 2011 qualification scheme can be
obtained from the ITIL official website
