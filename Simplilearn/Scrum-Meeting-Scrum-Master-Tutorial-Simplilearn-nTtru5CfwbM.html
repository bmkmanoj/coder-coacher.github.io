project called weather master the team
is planning to move to scrum methodology
and this is an outline of its first
scrum meeting time box to 15 minutes
Rick is the scrum master of this meeting
where the team members discuss what they
did yesterday their plans for today and
the impediments they faced all team
members are standing up including Todd
who's joined the meeting via video chat
Rick holds the meeting near a scrum
board Angela the product owner is absent
Rick reiterates that all discussions
would be parked until after the scrum
meeting and encourages his team to keep
the meeting short people can chime in to
resolve obstacles
hi team welcome to the daily stand-up
meeting for the product team on project
weather master we are in sprint 1 and
today is the second day as we are
planning to transition to scrum
methodology I hope you will find this
daily stand-up meeting helpful in this
meeting you will provide information
about what you did yesterday what you
plan to do today and what challenges you
faced
I think everyone's here let's start I
don't see Angela shouldn't she be here
I did add Angela as an optional attendee
to this meeting and since she hasn't
showed up we don't have to wait for her
Susan
scrum doesn't provide a specific
yes-or-no about the product owners
participation in the daily scrum the POS
primary role is to provide direction and
clarify requirements and priorities
since we don't always discuss those in
detail at this meeting the PIO is not
required to be here if the POS want to
attend they are generally in listen-only
mode for the duration of the meeting
they can use the information gathered
during the meeting for separate offline
conversations
what about Todd he works from his home
office right Todd will be a part of the
meeting through video chat it is
important that we include every team
member in the meeting hi Todd how are
you I'm fine thanks am i audible yes
Todd team let's all stand up for the
meeting
why don't you go first
Aaron yesterday I was working on
creating the mock objects to mask the
database calls from the unit tests the
difficulty with this approach is that
our server-side logic is so dependent on
the metadata that writing a true mock is
a mammoth exercise there are decisions
that are taken during runtime based on
the data some of the stored procedure
calls are also made based on the values
returned through inline queries that are
also embedded in the code
I was debugging the code until about 9
p.m. but for the life of me I couldn't
figure this out Aaron could we request
you to be concise when you provide an
update if you think some of the details
you described might be interesting to
others why don't you write a wiki page
on it and share the link so getting back
to your update did you finish the task
yesterday
No it turned out to be much more complex
than I had imagined I'll continue to
work on it today and see if I can figure
out an XML structure to mock the schema
and hard codes and return values but I
am really stuck as far as the inline
queries are concerned
I know what you're talking about there
is a reason why the inline queries are
there in the code this is mainly for
performance reasons when the overheads
of making a procedure called based on a
metadata value and then processing them
sorry for the interruption again guys
this is a really great conversation may
I suggest we write this issue in the
parking lot I'm not sure what you mean
by that Rick let me explain what Aaron
just brought up is a blocking issue team
members should bring these up during the
daily scrum so that everybody knows that
one of the team members is stuck however
the daily scrum is not necessarily the
meeting where solutions to every
obstacle can or should be found
it looks like Mary knows a thing or two
about the issue that Aaron is brought up
let's jot this down as a parking lot
topic this means the team can have
offline conversations after the daily
scrum to track it down
I'm also going to make a note that will
track the impediment Aaron faced daily
until it is removed you should let me
know if I can help in any way right
Aaron is there anything else you would
like to say no I am done thanks
yesterday I worked on developing the
Wizards for book order creation I'm
almost done today I need to write code
to handle some of the exception
scenarios before I can get them over to
Susan for testing that's it for me I
guess did you forget to mention any
impediments not really an impediment at
present but I would like to mention that
my computer probably needs to be
upgraded with more RAM it has been slow
for the past few weeks
okay I wrote up some scenarios to test
the book order wizard I'm looking to get
my hands on the code as soon as Mary is
done today I'm also hoping to complete
the company order testing that has been
pending for a while I'm okay for the
moment but I do have one question
shouldn't we all be updating the task
board as we speak we could it is up to
you guys if you think you want to do
this during the meeting if you ask my
opinion we should update the board as
soon as we are ready to move the tasks
and not wait for the meeting this will
ensure that the board is always up to
date and also that we use the meeting
time to focus on the conversations
that's a great point Rick I can't see
the board very well from here anyway so
maybe we should find a way to create an
electronic version of it to at some
point
great point Todd why don't you go next
with your updates all right hey Rick
would you like to know about my work on
the advertising module first or the
integration server whatever the team
decides is fine with me remember this is
really your meeting and I'm only here to
facilitate and ensure we get the most
out of this meeting
all right then I guess I'll start with
the integration server I would like to
inform everybody that I managed to set
up the integration server that we can
use as a sandbox to test the code before
checking in and source control I'll send
everybody a link with some instructions
and credentials I have also started
looking at the stories for the
advertising module it looks like there
are a lot of open statements in the
stories that I don't really understand I
guess I should have been paying more
attention during the sprint planning I
really need to have a conversation with
Angela about this that is my main
impediment right now I sent her an email
but haven't received a response yet
I don't have anything new to add today
I'm almost through with setting up our
project on the freeware tool that I
downloaded yesterday I'll show you guys
a demo in the meeting I set up later
today I'll try to chase down some of
these parking lot items anything else
before we close the meeting
all right that's it for today have a
great day do you have a moment to chat
about the inline queries real quick the
purpose of a scrum meeting is to keep
the team members updated and resolve any
impediments it's an ideal way to kick
start the day on a positive note the
scrum master reinforces the sense of the
self managing team facilitates
communication between team members
brings the team's focus back to what's
important and supports improvement hi
