a service is looked at both from a
customer's perspective and the service
provider perspective all human activity
is directed towards achieving desirable
results so as to finally create or add
value to various aspects of life or
business these results are achieved by
performing some tasks and are subject to
constraints
broadly speaking services facilitate
outcomes by enhancing the performance of
the tasks and by managing constraints
the result is an increase in the
possibility of desired outcomes
for example we all want to have a
healthy body and mind which is the
desired results this outcome is
dependent on a lot of activities one has
to do for example eat healthily exercise
take proper rest and so on and this is
subject to a lot of constraints for
example the availability of healthy food
and so on the desired outcome can be
facilitated by other parties for example
doctors the doctors will evaluate your
current condition and recommend change
in activities for example doctor can
suggest to eat less butter use refined
oil and so on or help one manage the
constraints doing a bypass surgery if
required is an example of managing
constraint other common examples of
services are postal services so that you
don't have to travel or worry about
travelling across seven seas to deliver
a letter coming back to a business
example let's say an online bookstore is
looking for a place to store all the
data related to his online book selling
business for example books details
customer details and so on or what in IT
is known as database or storage
solutions now
linking it to our description of
services the desired outcome is online
selling of books one of the activities
facilitating the outcome is storage of
data now the book store is not
specialized in managing storage as an IT
service and therefore does not want to
manage the associated costs and risks
which could come from infrastructure
staff facilities and so on however there
are organisations in the market that are
willing to do that for a cost commonly
called service providers say for example
Oracle Corporation who has specialized
knowledge and experience in large-scale
database systems and the confidence to
control the associated costs and risks
the bookstore agrees to pay for the
database service provided by the service
provider under specific terms and
conditions
so to get back to the definition the
service provider that is to say Oracle
Corporation provides a value to the
customer that is to say the online
bookstore by facilitating in other words
managing book selling company's database
and its associated costs and risks the
business outcomes of which is selling
books online just to clarify it further
in this case online book selling company
is the customer an Oracle Corporation is
a service provider Oracle Corporation is
providing database storage service to
the online book selling company so I
hope by now you understand what is a
service now let's understand the concept
called service management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
