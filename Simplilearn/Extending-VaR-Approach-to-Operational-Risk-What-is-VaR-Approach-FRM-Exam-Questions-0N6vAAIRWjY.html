financial risk manager frm par one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use extending var
approach to operational risk
welcome to the thirtieth session in your
preparation for the frm part-1 exam in
this session we'll introduce the concept
of operational risk management and how
different var measures are applied in
such cases operational risk is the risk
of failure due to internal factors such
as failed system failure and the part of
employees etc or failure due to some
external factors such as an earthquake
or hurricane by the end of the session
you will learn about the two basic
approaches to measuring operational risk
the top-down approach and the bottom-up
approach agenda the main agenda of our
discussion will be to analyze the two
approaches the top-down approach and the
bottom-up approach to measure
operational risk we will also learn how
hedging can be done to manage
operational risk finally we'll end the
session by learning about the
limitations of operational risk hedging
approaches to measuring operational risk
let us begin a discussion by comparing
the top-down and the bottom-up
approaches to measuring operational risk
the top-down approach analyzes the risk
by aggregating the impact of internal
operational failures it measures the
variances in the economic variables that
are not explained by the external
macroeconomic factors as such this
approach is simple and not data
intensive and it relies mainly on
historical data on the other hand the
bottom-up approach analyzes individual
risk in the process by using
mathematical models and is thus data
intensive this method does not rely on
historical data and is therefore
forward-looking
as opposed to the top-down model which
is backward looking another point to
note is that the bottom-up approach
differentiates between high frequency
low severity events while the top-down
approach does not make any such
differentiation top-down models let us
discuss the top-down models one by one
the multi-factor model gives the stock
return in the form of multiple factors
that is as a sum of the product of the
risk factor and the sensitivity of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
