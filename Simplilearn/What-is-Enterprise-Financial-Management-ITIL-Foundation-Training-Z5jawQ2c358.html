practices and local laws of financial
management according to their specific
business structure and culture financial
management for IT services is an
application of the financial management
policies and practices of the
organization as a whole the enterprise
financial management policies provide a
framework within which IT must work to
manage all financial aspects of its
services and organization policies that
impact an IT service provider might
include what level of financial
expenditure needs to be tracked for
example cost per desktop device or the
total cost of all desktops which
configuration items need to be recorded
as financial assets and how they should
be classified how fixed assets are
depreciated how taxes are managed for
example an IT service that is sold
externally is reported differently from
an IT service that is not only used
internally how costs are reported how
revenue is accounted for and linked to
IT services whether the cost of services
will be accounted for individually or
whether the overall cost of IT will be
calculated and allocated back to the
business unit requirements to comply
with the legislative or other regulatory
requirements an important policy
decision to be made is whether IT will
be a profit or cost Center this decision
made by the organization's executives
not by IT management this is because IT
as a business unit is subject to the
same governance as any other business
unit although IT executives may be asked
to participate in making that decision
this is ultimately a matter of
enterprise financial policy definitions
of these two options are cost Center two
definitions for the term cost Center are
commonly used in business although they
appear close in meaning they are
different in this context the
is used to indicate a business unit or
department to which costs are assigned
but the which does not charge for
services provided it says however
expected to account for the money it
spends and may be expected to show a
return on the business's investments in
it a cost center is able to focus
awareness on costs and enable investment
decisions to be better founded without
the overheads of billing however it is
less likely to shape user's behavior and
does not give the IT organization the
full ability to choose how to
financially manage itself for example in
funding IT investment the other
definition for the term cost center is
used in the context of accounting care
