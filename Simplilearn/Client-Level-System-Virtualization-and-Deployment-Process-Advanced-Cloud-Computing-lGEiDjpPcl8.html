the contents of a virtual hard disk file
to a drive letter in other words it
allows us to map the virtual hard disk
onto a host machine thus making the
contents of that virtual hard drive
easily accessible to the host operating
system it's the easier way to perform
any type of data backup operation in a
host system of course this can also be
accomplished by initiating the virtual
machine and establishing a shared folder
but this is a bit more involved than
simply mapping a drive letter to get
started we must be ready with the dot
vmdk file that we want to explore to
access the virtual disk onto the host
system click on file menu and go to map
virtual disk option from the drop-down
list once we select map virtual disk
option a new wizard called map or
disconnect virtual disks will appear on
the screen click on the map button given
on the screen to select the virtual disk
to be mapped in a physical system
i'm clicking the map button a new dialog
box appears on the screen click on the
Browse option to choose the dot vmdk
virtual disk file which is to be mapped
in the host system the next step is to
select the volume drive from the disk
that is the partition within the virtual
disk which needs to be mapped this
should be followed by selecting the
drive letter to be mapped in the host
system and clicking on the ok button to
continue on completion of the steps
mentioned in the earlier slides it will
be observed that the device is listed in
the panel it will be observed that the
mapped Drive is now visible in my
computer which is now accessible from
the host system in order to remove the
mapping of the disk from the host system
select the map disc and click on the
disconnect button given on the screen so
far we have understood the steps to map
virtual disks in the following slide we
will discuss the snapshot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
