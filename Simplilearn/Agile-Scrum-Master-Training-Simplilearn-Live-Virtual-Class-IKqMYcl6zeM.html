here with you I have been an exam prep
coach and project management trainer for
many years we're pushing 1213 years now
and over the years I've conducted
something like 250 trainings the
training sessions have been on the ASN
like this one the PMT pmi-acp PMI RMP
I've had over 5000 folks come through my
trainings over the years I've got a pass
rate that's about 99 percent so those
are the certifications that I have of
course the one that you're concerned
with is that one right there am I
qualified to do this
maybe I am with that kind of a pass rate
than I've been doing this course for a
while I actually love this course this
is a great course I have been doing
project management for many years and
I've had project management experience
in the business sector the public sector
and as an entrepreneur for example I was
a project manager a contact in HP vice
president of business development at a
company called legal net executive
director of the California Commission on
the bicentennial celebration of the
United States Constitution California
director of the national center for
constitutional studies you know it's
interesting is that even though sound
rather varied all of them had some kind
of content development and presenting
responsibilities with them so I've been
at this kind of stuff for 35 years plus
you know what's interesting is when it
comes to a workshop like this where
we're seeking a certification I don't
know if you know this or not but there
are studies that are done every year by
various organizations that compare what
certified project managers make compared
to what they're uncertain
colleagues make and depending on the
year it ranges between 15 and 20 percent
more if you're certified now that may
not be your driving factor to be here
and participate in this but to make more
money is a good thing and I just did a
calculation that you know of all those
that have gone through my workshops and
considering that average increase in
income I figure that they collectively
make sixty million dollars more more per
year now than they did before and I've
been with simply learned now doing
classes for them in these various topics
for over three years
and simply learn which you may or may
not know is the largest training
organization in the world and was
recently recognized as one of the top
ten most influential or education
organizations in the world so you are in
the right spot if you want to get
certified and get ahead in this or
another area simply learn is the place
to be and we have been around now for
about six years our journey started
relatively small and you can see that
from those more humble beginnings we now
have basically a presence throughout the
world and we offer training and
certification prep classes for all of
these organizations here of these
organizations this is the one that we
are focusing on for this workshop eggs
in and the ASM certification and we have
certification courses in all of these
different categories right here of
course with these categories the one
that is relevant for us right now is
agile scrum certifications but there are
others and you know kind of when we get
into a mode of the study and the prep
and they're getting ready for a
standardized test sometimes it's a good
time to take on more than just one thing
and somebody has simply learned came up
with this brilliant idea of what they
call Dan
access online classroom paths where if
you upgrade your tuition you can have
access to over 25 of our certification
exam prep courses 120 instructor LED
batches meaning live batches like this
for 90 days and so you can fast-track
your career at your place your pace
while you're kind of in the mode of
doing this and so the way it works is
you pick which of the certifications
that you want like you're doing for this
you can choose whether you want to do a
weekend batch or a weekday batch if you
do a weekday batch it's going to be a
three-hour session Monday through Friday
and if you do a weekend batch like this
one it'll be for our sessions on
Saturday Sunday Saturday Sunday etc so
and then not only do you get access to
the 120 instructor-led batches but you
have access to the e-learning content
for six months and if you're not happy
we'll give you your money back and it's
just you know a way to you know kind of
leverage your mode that you're in and I
have a number of individuals that have
been in other classes that we're doing
two or three at the same time so I'm not
sure if that's relevant to you or not
but that is an option and as soon as
this is displayed on my desktop I can
share it which I just did so you can see
that this is the course overview and
when you're finished with this course
you should be able to I know it says
right here after completing this lesson
but really what we're talking about is
the course here you should be able to
play the the role of an effective scrum
master you should be able to lead agile
and scrum transformations meaning going
from waterfall to scrum or from
waterfall to some other method in agile
be able to guide your team's using the
proven and recommended practices of
scrum describe practices of other agile
methods and adapt those that are
beneficial for your team's that are
relevant for your project and then you
should be able to also talk about scrum
in the context of dev ops as well as
linking scrum to IT Service Management
so that's and then of course be ready to
pass the exam so um you know scrum so
let me back up we've talked about
traditional project management versus
agile project management and different
kinds of projects lend themselves to
being best managed by either waterfall
or by agile and waterfall is the
traditional make a big plan upfront get
your baselines established make sure you
know you understand the requirements and
then go get the work done when you're
finished you know presented to the
customer and do the handoff and so while
you're executing on a waterfall project
you're looking at your actual results
comparing them to your baselines and
that's how you do it
agile which is really a family of
methods is a different approach it's an
evolutionary incremental approach that
fits well with projects where there's a
lot of uncertainty about the scope so
the solution to deliver the scope will
reveal itself or be discovered in an
evolutionary way as the project goes
forward and rather than completing the
project overall and then showcasing it
for the customer like in waterfall or
waterfall you can chuck it up chunk it
up into big phases and deliver it that
way
agile is different we do very small
increments and at the end of each
increment we're delivering value to the
customer and in the and we discover how
to actually get to the solution that the
customer wants so Waterfall you've got a
stable scope and you don't expect a lot
of change great in agile um there's
uncertainty and
relatively complex and of all of the
agile methods scrum is the most popular
of them about 50% of all agile projects
use scrum and then the next most popular
one is extreme programming and that's
about 30% so 80% of all agile projects
are going to be using either scrum or XP
and even though there's a lot of folks
that don't like the idea of doing
hypertech's those that practice scrum
actually end up using a lot of XP
practices as well so the bottom line is
is that when it comes to agile scrum is
the most used most proven and it
delivers it actually works and it works
well so our focus for this course is
going to be broadly on agile and I'll
even take you through a little bit about
XP and a couple other methods that
belong to the family of agile but we're
going to drill down on scrum and so when
we talk about project life cycles it
will be how to do a project using scrum
and there are a number of roles for a
scrum project we're going to cover all
of them but we're going to spend most of
our time on scrum master which is one of
the roles and then we're going to talk
about how to scale agile agile was
originally designed for small projects
with small co-located teams but as
things have changed over the years
agile can be adapted to very large
enterprise sized projects and so one of
our lessons is dedicated to that and
then also we're going to dedicate one
whole lesson to doing a transition from
waterfall to scrub so um this
certification is unique in that regard
there are
certifications like certified scrum
master
that's not offered by Exynos offered by
I think it's the scrum Alliance and
there's value to that but it's one that
doesn't require training you won't be
able to sit for the ASM exam until
you've finished the screen with the CSM
it's kind of an open book thing a little
bit more of you know you go do some
training and the test is proctored right
there and there's value in that I'm not
saying there isn't but the the scrum
master certified scrum master training
and certification it doesn't get in to
transition like this does there's also
another agile certification and this
one's offered by PMI so the pmi-acp and
that certification gets a much deeper
into the family of agile and so that
course will cover oh I think it's like
eight or nine different agile methods
most of the emphasis will be on scrum
because of its popularity but the course
itself is bored generic about agile and
there's value in that but the ACP
doesn't get into the scaling and agile
like this one so you know if you wanted
to go get another agile certification
this is me but the one I'd recommend is
the pmi-acp so you know I kind of back
to my career coaching thing
get your ASM and then if you want to
continue go get your PMP probably or
prince2 depending on your environment
and where you think you'll be and then
go get your PMI ac and once you have
that you are going to be well equipped
to run projects and you'll be very
desirable to employers out there not
that you're not now but you know they
like to see those you know those letters
after your name and then also in that
mix is DevOps and integrating into IT
Service Management so maybe you know
some DevOps and some IT o work would
also serve you well and you know I'm not
one that particularly
standardized testing is that great of a
way to measure someone's knowledge and
predictable potential in the real world
I'm just not I've seen people who just
really have a hard time passing a
standardized test who just crush it in
the real world and kind of ice averse I
said people who are really good at
taking tests and then you know put them
in the real world and they don't do so
well but that said there's no better way
to really present yourself to the world
as to what your skill sets and
experiences so well
standardized testing may not be the best
predictor it is the best way to
demonstrate your pedigree you know your
history and what you bring to the table
so it's important and learning how to
pass the test and get it done and have
those initials that you can put after
your name at the bottom of your emails
and on your business cards etc you know
like I was showing you earlier probably
means fifteen two percent twenty percent
more money plus if that's it fast tracks
your career so this course here down
down to this bottom box here this course
here is going to accomplish two main
things in summary it's going to train
you give you lots of knowledge and it's
also going to prepare you for the ASM
certification the target audience I
think we pretty well saw that when we
were introducing each other each of us
to ourselves and commented on that you
can see that you know those of us that
are here in this group the perfect
target audience and we were all in kind
of different places but yet all relevant
for this so you're at the right spot now
when it comes to prerequisites there are
none for this although if you want to
sit for the exams training is mandatory
eggs in will not let you sit for the ASM
course unless you have training
this course meets those training
requirements so at the end of this
course you'll get a certification
asserted as a certificate and what eggs
ian has you do is actually upload that
certificate to demonstrate you have the
training and then you'll have access to
taking the course I am in Utah in the
United States I am in the Salt Lake area
of about 30 miles south of Salt Lake and
I had a late night
my niece was moving and so family got
together to help move and we weren't
done until late I didn't even get home
till about midnight and and so right now
for me it's 913 in the morning so I had
to get up earlier than I wanted but I'm
glad I did I'm glad that I know you glad
that were acquainted and I love the
subject matter and I love assisting
folks in you know learning this material
and advancing in their careers
absolutely love it so I may not be good
at a lot of things but I got a lot
experience here and you know nothing
better than seeing folks like you go
through one of the courses that I have a
hand in and having success as a result
of that now the value of this course
goes beyond just getting your initials
and I think we've probably talked about
most of this here we're going to talk
about you know looking at the top left
here good practices in agile generally
and scrum specifically how to actually
implement things that you learn get a
lot of knowledge about scrum and if you
already have some deepen that knowledge
give you some guidance on how to deal
with transformation projects you know
well specifically I got a one slide
about criticism
you can get when you're doing a
transformation and have a whole slide
and discussion about resistance and how
to overcome it then of course we're
going to learn new things and we're
going to drive value not just from you
know getting your certificate but also
from the point of view of value for your
organization value for you value going
forward the course syllabus looks like
this lesson 1 is what we call the agile
way of thinking so it's what's agile
we're going to get into some agile
principles we're going to cover what's
called the agile manifesto and we're
going to kind of tease you a bit on
continuous improvement specifically when
it comes to an agile transformation
effort
lesson 2 is about other agile frameworks
so we will touch on waterfall again as
an approach and then we'll talk about
some other methods that belong to the
family of agile will touch on XP and
lean and crystal and dsdm a turn not
that you're going to be tested on those
but it will help you as a scrum master
to recognize that there's this family
from which you can draw some information
and experience that will actually
enhance your ability to be a good scrum
master this is the lesson where we're
going to deal with DevOps and you know
linking scrum projects with operations
so that there's things that are done in
parallel rather than doing some you know
development work and then doing a
handoff doing some more development work
and then doing a handoff have some
things going in parallel is a big thing
right now as organizations are trying to
improve efficiencies and be more
responsive to dynamic marketplaces so
we've got a couple of slides on that
that you'll find interesting and
then similarly linking agile with IT
Service Management and doing some things
in parallel there as well is helpful and
understanding that is becoming more and
more important as the marketplace for
projects and folks like us increases now
when we get to lesson three this is
where we start diving deeper into scrum
so we're going to talk about a scrum
project lifecycle we're going to talk
about the concept of timeboxing and what
ceremonies and events in scrum are
timebox we're going to actually also
talk about individually the ceremonies
that are part of scrum one of us in the
introduction talked about retros and
that was short for retrospective and
we're going to talk about retrospective
and when we're finished you're going to
realize that retrospectives are critical
to scrum and that they are the single
most important things that you will do
in scrum to make sure that you are
experiencing effective continuous
improvement and we'll also talk about
scrum artifacts things like you know
product backlog release backlog sprint
backlogs we'll talk about the definition
of done we'll talk about some
information radiators and you know
things like that
lesson four is about the roles that
belong to scrum so we're going to talk
first about the scrum master but then
we're going to touch on the product
owner and developer and then we'll get
into some of the best practices of being
an effective scrum master lesson number
five has to do with sort of doing scrum
and so we'll talk about you know user
stories and epics and we'll talk about
product roadmaps and how
do estimating both using point and ideal
time we'll talk about planning poker and
affinity estimating as common estimation
techniques and we'll get into
communicating the status and progress of
a project this is where we'll again
touch on some information radiators like
burn down charts burn up charts etc and
then how that allows us to stay in
control if you will of the project make
sure we're headed in the direction we
want to go lesson six is the one that I
talked about that has to do with scaling
agile and then the last one lesson seven
which is about adopting agile the the
you know transition projects the the
test itself has you know domains that
you're tested on and you might have
picked up on this the scaling of agile
and the transformation projects you know
transitions I like those a lot I
actually when I took the real exam I got
a hundred percent on these areas on the
exam I've ever a couple areas that I
didn't do great I did good enough and
and that might be how it is for you you
know we all have different strengths and
weaknesses you saw that we have varying
levels of experience and you know areas
of experience and so there'll be you
know parts of this whole experience that
are your golden on and then will be
others where you know it is a little bit
more of a learning process so and I'm no
different as I just mentioned so when it
comes to the exam itself you know when
we created this slide here we put a
hundred and twenty hours of study is
recommended and we are trying to set the
bar high for that and now we recognize
that if you have experience you're
probably not going to need that much but
you know what also weirdest
bring is that if you will stick with the
materials that we have and I got some
guidance for you and you know how to use
the materials you know after we're
finished with this and this isn't a
super long training course we're going
to have four sessions four hours each
right
16 hours now we're going to cram a lot
of stuff in there but you know it's
interesting is it turns out that we have
just really done a great job on what we
cover and this along with those standard
or practice tests rather there's a
pretty darn good chance that you're not
going to lead to need to do a whole lot
of other study I will have you do some
things between sessions and you know
it's not just being here for the four
hours so it's definitely more than that
but if you're willing to do it and if
you're willing to embrace my guidance
I'm going to get you there much faster
than if you were to do the more
traditional study it kind of stuff make
sure you can lead with knowledge we're
going to kind of focus on the exam part
of this as you know leaving with
strategy and not with knowledge the test
itself Oh
case studies I should mention this there
he is
something that I need you to download
and I think I already put it in the LMS
and it's the assignment can I do that
let me just double check LMS yeah it's
this right here team I don't know if you
can see my cursor or not it's the one
that says assignment scrum project now
there's nothing to turn in on this but
at the end of each session I want you to
return to this assignment paper and we
have some questions that build on the
lessons that we have just done using the
same scenarios for the project here so
this is a part of the course and you'll
need to
um you know promise that you've actually
done this in order to get your
certification nothing for you to turn in
on that though but you do to have that
homework assignment so the test itself
as i mentioning earlier it's 90 minutes
and i think i said a hundred an eighty
xsu so if it's an hour and a half ninety
minutes probably some of your life just
in an hour and a half any saying 180
minutes okay so there you go I'm awesome
at math there are 40 multiple choice
questions like the samples that you saw
a B C or D and you know when I first
embarked on getting my asam and I
thought you know a forty question exam I
thought easy peasy you know this isn't
going to be a robust certificate
certification and then I got into the
prep work and then I got into the
practice exams and I thought oh I get
this ASM is an awesome credential to
have and there might only be forty
questions but they're not easy unless
you've been through the workshop and you
know accepted some of my guidance on how
to approach a standardized test then
you'll be golden
let's see something over here do all the
lessons and concepts have equal weight
in the test or are some concepts more
important um it's all equally weighted
and your results are in the aggregate
it's not for each of the domains so
while everything's weighted equally you
can do really good in an area like I did
which will help make up for some areas
where you're not quite as strong good
question and I like that question came
because you're thinking about the exam
right and getting it done so your heads
in the right spot now here's also what's
interesting is you only need sixty-five
percent to pass meaning you got to get
twenty six out of the 40 questions
um and things well I get that it seems
well but you know after you've gone
through this workshop and you've taken
the exam you'll be like me to think wow
they really did a great job of crafting
this exam and making that credential
something of relevance in the
marketplace so that's about the course
if you're new to eggs in what you may
want to do is just at some point in time
just go to eggs in comm and poke around
see what kind of certifications they
have there and then eventually drill
down to the AFM one sorry about that
you're paying the price for me trying to
be a blessing for my Nisha and her
family felt good right win-win okay and
I noticed the the confirmation there
Viraj that we got your question answered
okay so that takes us to the end of
lesson one okay so at the end of this
lesson we should be able to explain how
to write a user story and Epix carry out
planning at the roadmap release and
sprint level Express estimates and story
points or ideal days and explain the
pros and cons perform agile estimation
using planning poker and affinity
estimation make progress visible by
using information radiators like burn
down charts burn up charts Kanban boards
etc and make use of the information in
order to keep track of project work okay
so first light here has to do with user
stories and epics and what I want to do
team is I want to before we get into the
user stories I want to go to the
whiteboard and I want to just give you a
little bit more information
that might help us in organising our
discussion that we're about to embark on
here so a word that is not in our slides
is themes themes are epics and user
stories grouped together you know
similar epics and user stories grouped
together for planning purposes so an
epic is big you would never do an epic
in or part to me a theme in a sprint
it's too big so it's used for planning
purposes below that I would put epic
epics
are low priority large user stories
meaning that an epic will eventually
have to be disaggregated into multiple
user stories the reason it would be low
priority is because if it was an epic
was higher up on the product backlog it
would have to be more detailed that's
when you would break it down so epics
are usually going to live at the lower
priority levels of a product backlog and
as user stories are completed in the
epic rises in priority it will
eventually be broken down into more
manageable user stories so great big low
priority user stories then we have user
stories themselves user stories are
functions or features that the product
owner wants to have developed a user
story turns into working software that
provides value to the customer and and
the product owners the customer voice
the product the owner is the one who
would accept the reject completed user
stories and then there are tasks
and a reminder when we were talking
about the sprint planning meeting we
said the sprint planning meeting is got
two parts to it the first part is
selecting all of the user stories that
are going to be included in the sprint
and then disaggregating each of those
user stories into tasks that's done in
the sprint planning meeting and then
those tasks are the things that are
actually then done when the work of the
sprint begins user stories can be
estimated in story points or ideal days
most teams favor story points they might
start with ideal days but they will then
usually end up going for story points
tasks are estimated in AI ideal time
which is usually hours okay so now back
to our slides so it's at the top left a
use case could be an example of a user
story so it's something that the user
wants to do and how the system should
support it like a use case could be
select and pay for items in a catalog
now that could actually be an epic or
maybe a theme because maybe it would get
disaggregated into log on screen catalog
shopping cart and checkout but so the
use case could either be a standalone
user story or it could actually be a
number of user stories that would result
from it below that requirement it could
be a functional requirement a technical
task or even a bug fix so I'm going to
go back to the whiteboard and a product
backlog is going to have a lot of user
stories that come from the customer
write whatever the customer wants them
but the team may know that it has to do
and development work in order for the
user stories to even be able to work you
know there's some system level
non-functional requirements that need to
be done and so there could be tech user
stories and then can you see this low I
can't see your chats but then there
could also be defect user stories there
could even be risk user stories now what
could happen is that the product owner
range these in priority so this one
first and that one then that one and the
team says well the only thing is is that
we have to do some development work
before we can actually do user story too
and so what we really need to do is
insert that before the the second
priority user story and so the priority
of the user stories in the product
backlog while it might start with just
being you know simple functional user
stories coming from the product owner it
will evolve until it includes some other
things that are also considerations when
it comes to priorities because of you
know successor predecessor relationships
dependencies and things like that are
considerations a user story be back to
the screen bottom left now the user
story can use a fictitious user or
persona to help the team or the the team
and the product owner to get an idea of
okay who's going to be doing this
function what are they going to need in
order to be able to complete the
function etc so you try and come up with
an actual well a fictitious but a person
who's actually doing it to kind of get
out of the realm of you know listing
requirements and you know specs and
things like that and say okay what's the
user experience need to look like top
right template a portion of a user story
is let me back up so a user story card
is usually going to contain a brief
description of the user story using some
kind of a meta language format like
we're suggesting right here as a user or
persona I want this feature so that I
can so not unlike our estimating session
here as a frequent traveler I want to
eat grapes so I can be healthier in the
one that we didn't do the inventory
system as a customer okay there's a user
I want to get cash back so I don't have
to wait in line at the bank okay here's
another user story as a consumer I want
the shopping cart functionality to
easily purchase items online and maybe
that could be customer as well as an
executive right as a suit I want to
generate a shelves report so I know
which departments need to improve their
productivity as a buyer so you can see I
tried to come up with these different
roles right here executive buyer sells
wrath etc and that's the format as a
type of user I want some kind of goal or
feature and so that's some kind of a
reason um that below that connect
connect the dots by writing all of the
user stories necessary to uncover the
entire use case so like we were talking
about right here if you want to be able
to purchase items online from a catalog
that might be multiple user stories in
order to support that use case and so of
course we would want to be able to
connect the dots and see where all the
user stories fit in into the overall
goal of the project or release and the
stories
excuse me are grouped to form an epic or
higher-level story so epic or theme
stories can then be split into child
stories or tasks and so that's what we
are covering before right you so you
have themes up at the top that's the
biggest grouping if you will use
primarily for you know high-level
planning purposes so you have your
themes then you have your epics which
are large user stories low priority and
they're going to have to be broken down
into smaller user stories like in the
question that we had at the end of the
the last section where the product owner
needed something done and the team said
well based on the size of this user
story it's going to take three Sprint's
to do well a user story has to be small
enough to be completed within a single
sprint so a sprint can contain more than
one user story but a user story cannot
stands friends so that feature or
function that was in the question was
probably more like an epic it was
something that would need to be
disaggregated into smaller user stories
or perhaps it was more of a use case
that would need more than one user story
in order to actually deliver the overall
use case key as a product supervisor I
want to see an unfinished part list at
the end of the day so that I can
reallocate work the next day great user
story description well-done Viraj did
you hear that team as a product
supervisor I want to see an unfinished
part list at the end of day so I can
reallocate work the next day
that is a well-crafted description of a
user story now here are some things that
I want you to memorize you were hoping I
was done with the memorization part so I
want you to
remember that we have to invest in our
user stories and I was going over to the
whiteboard and I didn't change cameras
so let me do that I recommend uh you
know figuring out how you memorize best
so that you can if well not if you
wanted to what I recommend is being able
to write out all of this stuff on plain
white scrap paper in about 14 minutes
because that's the amount of free time
you have in the tutorial when you're at
the or when you're taking the test eggs
in does a little bit different you maybe
won't have a tutorial the only time
you'd have a tutorial is if you were at
a Center taking a test eggs in has other
options like you can do a paper-based
test where you get a third party you
know a buddy or somebody who will agree
to sort of Proctor the test for you or
you can do it on your laptop all by
yourself and they have software that
watches you while you're taking the test
and they require you to take the laptop
and do like a 360 so that they can
verify that you don't have any cheat
sheets up on the wall or anything like
that but the point is is you got to have
this memorized whether you're going to
dump it out on the paper or not when I
took the test I actually did the paper
based option and that was because of
some time constraints and it was the
quickest way to get me into the test and
so I didn't write out any of the stuff
I'd memorize but I had it memorized and
I had it memorized well enough that I
could kind of recall it in my mind's eye
okay so we're talking about user stories
and you have to invest in your user
stories you know I like memorizing
things by creating these charts that
have the first letter of the word or
phrase that you're memorizing in a
separate column and then I make up a
story you know that reminds me that I've
got to have inv
st this one is pretty easy probably just
invest works but bitch so let's go over
that I stands for independent
independent meaning that each user story
stands on its own you don't have when
we're doing scrum you don't do a user
story that won't result in working
software we just talked about the
description of user stories right so
it's a user that needs some kind of
functionality for some kind of a reason
and they're all independent will they
work together of course they'll work
together if that's the necessity but if
you developed a log on screen you could
demonstrate working software for the
login screen there might be another user
story that is you know has to do with
displaying the catalog and being able to
flag or select items that you want to
purchase but there'd be working software
for that would they work together yes
but each user story would complete or
result in some kind of working software
and they have to be independent
negotiable negotiable in the way the
user story is going to be implemented
the product owner doesn't dictate to the
team the team doesn't say it it's only
this way and we don't want to hear
anything from you
so there are discussions about the size
and implementation for each users user
story so the product owner can't make it
so detailed that there's no room for
discussion and the possibility of you
know the team coming up with solutions
other than what the product owner was
attempting to dictate V stands for
valuable meaning each user story has to
create value for the customer or the end
user e has to be estimable as an
estimate of all accept estimate of
elizabeth's estimable and and as is for
small has to be small enough to be done
a single sprint if we're doing two-week
Sprint's has to be able to be done in
two weeks or less if we're doing four
week Sprint's it could be a larger user
story but it would still have to be done
in four weeks or less and then the last
one the T is testable every user story
needs to be testable and it needs to be
testable at two levels remember our
triangle needs to be testable at the
intrinsic quality level unit tests etc
and also testable at the extrinsic level
which is the customer point of view
which is acceptance so every user story
has to be testable okay so that's invest
and so let's add that to our list of
things to memorize invest and then the
next one we have here is the three fees
of a user story so the first C team is
card so user stories should be able to
be written on a 4 by 6-inch index card
or some media similar to that card the
second C is conversation the user story
card is the item that is used for the
team and the product owner to talk and
discuss in order to make sure that the
product owner and the team are on the
same page when it comes to what is
actually supposed to be developed and
what you know so what it's supposed to
look like at the end which leads us to
the third one which is confirmation each
user story essentially has to have
acceptance tests in it itself so card
four by six conversation that's the
starting point that's where the team and
the product owner dispatch
and then eventually there will be
acceptance tests included on the user
story card in order to be used during
the sprint review to assure that it's
acceptable that there's confirmation ok
so oh let's add that to the memorization
list so 3 fees all right now I've got an
example here of a user story card so
we're looking right here and if you were
to go out on the internet and search
user story cards they would be similar
there would be some differences of
course but typically what you're going
to have is you're going to have a title
or a name for the user story and then
there's going to be some kind of unique
identifier like user story 3:21 then
there will be the description like we
just talked about as a librarian I want
to have the facility of searching a book
by different criteria so that I will
save time while serving a customer then
there might be some other descriptive
words or links to other information that
might be necessary and then there would
be acceptance criteria or tests
sometimes these get included on the back
of the card but the point is is that
they are on the cord on the card rather
then there will be an estimate of size
it could be ideal days or story points
as I mentioned most teams do story
points that's more likely what you'll be
tested on as opposed to ideal days but
you know we'll cover Bowl so you
understand the differences there's
probably it's not listed here but
there's probably going to be a value
point assignment this is where the
product owner
kind of determined in a relative way the
value of the stories just like we were
doing in planning poker the product
owner might say well this story is twice
as valuable as this other one comparing
them together and this is what these
value points are what's used to
prioritize the user stories that's
supposed to be a V as in value points
and then typically there's also going to
be a indication sometimes it's just by
colors
it could be words that has to do with
you know where the story came from did
it come from the customer that would be
considered a functional requirement if
it came from the team that would be from
the technical domain I'm trying to write
where from you know it's not me team
it's the mouse clearly it's hard to do
that that's from where from here if that
customer attacked you could also have
defect you could maybe have risk and
then there's also going to be an X
Factor which would be some kind of word
probably like stable erratic incomplete
something like that to so the team is
designating the user's story in respect
to the amount of uncertainty or risk
that's associated with that user story
and because all of that's a part of the
story right the story is going to be
turned into working software there may
need to be some efforts to actually
figure out how to actually do that user
story so that's the X Factor over to the
right here on the same chart we have
some comments about if you are using a
software package
excuse me like Trello or JIRA or
something like that excuse me the user
story cards will generally be able to
contain more information using you know
dynamic links and things like that could
even include things like responsible
team member or depending on how you're
doing it you'd break the user story down
into tasks and you might have team
members assigned to various tasks for
the user story ok so that's typically
what a user story card is like sometimes
their cards sometimes they're like on
sticky notes and they're put up on a
Kanban board if you're using Kanban to
track the project if you have a story
that is too large to be completed in a
sprint it's going to have to be
subdivided or we call it disaggregation
into smaller user stories and there's a
three ways that we're proposing here
that you could go about doing that you
could split it based on operational
boundaries for example as an operator
one needs to manage reservations which
could be split for example there could
be one portion that is that has to do
with making a reservation another one
that has to do with modifying it and yet
another one that has to do with
cancelling it so that could be split
into in this construct here three
separate user stories you could also
separate based on exceptions or
cross-cutting concerns for example in
the beginning develop only one main path
like accept repayment for a loan then
address exceptions like what if a person
over pace then come up with a user story
that recognizes that and processes a
refund and or gives the option of
allocating the overpayment to a future
payment or something like that and then
also adds on other concerns like the
tech access restrictions or record name
of operator
so maybe you know when you're working on
accepting payments or processing refunds
it's going to check on who the operator
is or track that so that if at a later
time you know who is at the gate this
refund here well you could look and see
you know okay that the operators name
was recorded or maybe you put some
restrictions so that maybe not everybody
is allowed to do a refund and so you
would have levels of users that have
different privileges okay and then down
at the bottom split based on data
boundaries for an example you know as an
accountant one needs to enter your
balance sheet information which could
then be split in two summary information
and separately receivable details or you
know maybe you could have 80 you know so
you could have different portions of the
overall balance sheet activities that
need to be done so enter AR enter ap etc
make sense so just to kind of prompt you
give you some ideas about what to do
in a scrum project if you have the
scenario arise where a user story is
being estimated by the team and it won't
fit into a sprint it's too big now when
it comes to determining value for user
stories this is primarily owned by the
product owner right and it always comes
back to money but money you know the
value can be looked at from different
points of view so new revenue obviously
you know getting new customers and
having them buy stuff well below that
there's another consideration
incremental revenue so somebody's in the
process of placing an order maybe there
are some premium features that could be
add-ons at that point in time or maybe
added
later on so you have an existing
customer who actually buys more of or
enhanced parts of the existing thing
they already purchased or are in the
process of purchasing retained value so
this is you know retaining customers so
that they don't go to a competitor and
then the bottom one is operational
efficiency you know how could things be
done to speed up the process of whatever
it is so that the cost of delivering the
product is reduced so this then leads us
to a discussion about priorities
recognizing that there are some priority
concerns that come from both the
customer domain as well as the technical
domain and there are some prioritization
models if we look right here there is
value based prioritization and the
hierarchy of that would be high value
followed by high risk followed by high
value and then low risk followed by low
value and then low risk so you know we
might have written this a little bit
differently but that's value based
prioritization and this is primarily the
product owner with maybe some input from
the team just simply deciding what he or
she wants then most listening to the
team say well you know there's some you
know greater risks with this user story
than that and so you'd probably want to
persuade the product owner to take care
of high risk stuff first because that
would have an a excuse me sorry an
impact on the future things that need to
be done
there's the Ducato model which looks at
each of the user stories and classifies
them as being man
very linear or exciters and the
mandatory items are those user stories
that are mush and they'll never move
beyond move the customer the end user
beyond neutral it's if they're not there
it creates dissatisfaction if the the
you the product owner the team is done a
good job in identifying what are the
mandatory or threshold items you would
see that it just gets it to neutral
that's what's expected for the products
linear items user stories are those user
stories that as they are implemented
progressively throughout the project and
added to the feature set it will linear
increase customer satisfaction and it
can be you know in their absence
dissatisfaction all the way up to high
implementation creating a great deal of
satisfaction for the customer and then
the third category is exciters and the
lighters and those are features or
functions those are user stories that
are not mandatory and the absence of
them will never result in satisfaction
going below neutral but by adding them
you could create excitement and delight
for the customer
these would typically be things that are
features that would be included in a
premium version of the product or may be
add-ons that are promoted you know at
the point of sale you know if you
thought about this because it'll really
help you or whatever so that's a can o
model and then there's we Gers relative
weighting methods and this is all using
numbers so each feature is given a value
for its benefit and its penalty given a
value for penalty meaning what's the
pain is that feature or function is not
included and then there is the cost side
and the risk
and then those are all calculated
together and that results in excuse me a
ranking or a hierarchy which gives you
the priority for the user stories we
also talked about Moscow didn't we did
we talk about Moscow Moscow is another
prioritization model must could I said
that differently must should could won't
Moscow MS GW must should good won't and
we talked about that one thank you for
that confirmation does it seem like a
long time ago or is it just me I know
it's just last weekend but it's like
last year okay so now let's talk about
velocity Priyanka that is exactly right
so velocity is the capacity of the team
to complete work in a single iteration
so the team has estimated the user
stories I for size or ideal days and the
Sprint's are going to be free length
weeks and duration
obviously not all user stories can be
completed in a single sprint and be done
with the project well I guess maybe I
shouldn't say obviously what I'm saying
that I'm thinking well maybe you had a
very small short duration project so you
could but the point is is that it's the
team's capacity to complete work in a
given sprint and it is an observation
it's not a prediction so if we're
working on sprint 5 and we're working on
determining what our velocity is then it
would be the average of the previous
four sprints
if there were any outliers you would
disregard those and so it's an
observation if we look over to question
box number two here velocity is used to
deal with determining how many user
stories we are going to include in a
given sprint and also how many Sprint's
are we going to need to create a release
or a set of user stories and here's an
example in box number three a team
completed five user stories that were
sized 5 3 8 13 and 2 to user stories
each sized 5 were left half complete
what is the velocity of the team and the
answer is either going to be 31 or 36 31
is the sum of the completed user stories
if you were 36 you were claiming half of
the two that were 5 so that would be a
total of 10 so you claim half of it
would be 5 would take you to 36 but it's
not going to be 36 because the only
thing that counts towards progress is
working software so even if the team had
finished nine out of ten story points
for a user story meaning it's almost
done and then the Sprint ends that
doesn't get counted towards velocity and
you don't mess around with velocity you
can mess around with your estimating and
you can mess around with you know what
user stories are going to be completed
in a sprint but you don't do that the
velocity is not variable it is what it
is based on past performance when it
comes to levels of planning we have
what's called the planning
onion and let me walk you through this
here up at the the broadest area is the
vision level so the vision level
Bachelor suits right they're the ones
that have the strategy and objectives
for the company and where it's going and
so they have that overall big vision for
the company which is likely going to
include products and each product should
have a roadmap my example of that
website that I'm working on has three
versions which make up the product
roadmap version one is the free side
version two is the membership site and
version 3 is the the pay referral
Commission's version of the site and the
product roadmap is then supported by
releases so for my project I have three
releases so all of the user stories
needed for the free version are in
release one all of the additional user
stories that are needed for the paid
version the subscriber version and then
also for Version three those are all
releases three releases and then for
each sprint we will be pulling user
stories from the release that we're
working on a release is likely going to
take multiple sprints and and then the
sprints are populated by the individual
user stories which are then just
aggregated into tasks and we do the
excuse me the daily scrum which is the
daily level of planning and coordination
so we call that the planning onion we
already kind of talked about the release
and roadmap concept here so let's just
review this quickly prioritize
high-level epics and determine goals and
releases so we'll use epics and themes
in order to group things together you
know it should be included in what
what are the goals for the releases then
the first bullet point established goals
of release based on market demand
regulatory needs or customer
expectations for each release you want
to estimate the target stories repeat
until the target stories are assigned
and iteration length I should that it's
blending some things here be able to
estimate velocity and then assign
stories to the Sprint's so we keep
estimating the user stories and we keep
organizing that until we can do that we
can come up with an iteration length of
sprint length and then figure out what
our velocity for each sprint is and then
assign stories to the the sprints the
the next bullet down iterate until the
user stories and release date meets
conditions of satisfaction so that's a
definition of done their acceptance for
the release and try not to pack too much
into a release backlog so just like you
would not want to pack too many user
stories into a sprint you want to have
the timelines appropriate and what are
included in the event make sense okay so
here's a bit more about release planning
on this slide here you've got the
product backlog here on the left and
then we might come up with a release
plan which could be flipped and could be
looked at horizontally and you probably
plan about three releases in advance or
at least you're doing more of the
detailed planning on that because things
are going to emerge when we do you know
sprint one that's going to help in
sprint two and things that happen in
Sprint's one and two that are going to
help release three and then you've got
you know your subsequent releases where
we're just doing very high-level
planning it's called rolling wave
planning where we do detailed planning
for
in the future in tandem with doing
high-level planning for things in the
future did I say that right detailed
planning for things in the near-term and
tend them with high-level planning for
things in the future
and we talked about deciding as late as
possible I believe meaning that it's
better to actually plan the later
releases for purposes of making sure we
have more information the most
information available
okay so estimation let's start at the
top left the principles behind
estimation understand the cone of
uncertainty which is an estimate or best
guess to begin with and then
progressively becomes more accurate in
fact let's just take a break and look at
the cone of uncertainty so at the very
beginning of a project there's going to
be a high level of uncertainty if I were
to draw this chart I would make it a
little bit more like this so clearly
you're going to de-risk the project as
early as you can and then eventually all
risk disappears when the project is done
risk is uncertainty okay below that the
only estimate that matters is the one
given by the team supported by this
comment here nothing is impossible for
the one who doesn't have to do it so the
product owner is a keen come on you can
do this the teams like know we know what
our velocity is know the product owner
says I'm telling you there's no way that
that can't be done I know you can do it
I trust you I believe in you but the
product owner doesn't ask you do you
have to do the work okay top right over
estimation and under estimation is
always going to be an issue that we deal
with it's more likely that we will
underestimate
and overestimates and by looking at our
velocity from iteration or sprint to
sprint there could be some information
that is showing us that we're under
estimating for example meaning we're
thinking we you know the user stories
are smaller than they are and that we
can get you know a certain number done
in the sprint and then there's a fail
well that would mean then that would be
discussed during the retrospective and
then we would do something different
going forward which might include doing
some reactivating scrum estimating is
not necessarily more difficult however
scrum exposes bad estimates sooner which
is a good thing when we were doing our
planning poker you can see that the
first time as a team you know we didn't
know each other we didn't know
everybody's thoughts and concerns and
those kinds of things you know get
shared and absorbed as a project goes on
and so there's a higher awareness of
that so what we would say is that using
estimation technique scrum estimation
techniques might be more inaccurate at
the beginning of a project but they will
quickly become very accurate as the
project advances forward which is their
question here can velocity be increased
over a period of time for the project
yes it can now it's not that it will
increase if the team is learning how to
work together better and better you
would expect that if I can just use my
mouse here if we were tracking velocity
so this would be point completed over
here let me just do pts for points and
down here is time
and we go from sprint to sprint right
you would expect that maybe you know the
first couple of springe the team would
be learning how to work together and
there would be a steep curve and then it
would kind of flatten out and maybe have
you know a slow rise going forward as
the team emerges is a high-performing
team they get better at their
cross-functional behavior you know
somebody shake the team just keeps
chugging along other things you know
just oh sorry there I bump the thing on
my screen there so the team you know
learned how to work better together and
you know their estimates become more
accurate etc and you would expect a
hyper port a high-performing team to
have a a result like this for velocity
where there's quick improvement and then
it kind of stabilizes and then begins to
tick upwards okay we talked about the
cone of uncertainty let's talk about
ideal time when we do estimating for
user stories we do it in ideal days when
we do estimating for tasks we do it in
ideal time which means hours I think
that's on the whiteboard or was on the
whiteboard oh it was on it so ideal time
is the amount of time it takes to
complete a piece of work but that's
based on the notion that the team member
or members are available to do just the
work with no distractions or anything at
all so assuming that Priyanka could sit
down at a keyboard and code for eight
hours without taking a break for lunch
no phone calls no discussions no
meetings of any kind just work eight
hours how much could be done in that
eight hours by Priyanka
that's what ideal time is but the thing
of it is is that there is no such thing
as somebody being able to spend every
minute of every day only doing work
there will be distractions so it has to
be converted into a elapsed time
now we don't convert it to elapsed time
at the user story level but we do
convert it to elapsed time when we are
dealing at the task level and what that
looks like is you know for each team
member you're going to have to do it
separately because some team members
have more distractions than others some
might have other duties that pull them
away whatever the case may be you
determine how much time in a given day a
team member is available to do work so
say it's 5 hours out of 8 for one maybe
it's six hours out of eight for another
maybe it's four out of eight but you
figure out what it is and then you take
the average and that average
availability is used then to convert
ideal time into elapsed time I should
have circled this box here because we
talked about this as well and then I
already mentioned this year only
considers axl worked I'm not the
distraction so that's the concept of
ideal time when it comes to story points
it's different than that they are a
measure of size relative to each other
so we were doing planning poker this
morning where we were looking at grapes
versus apples and then we were looking
at oranges
and what else we have watermelons and
coconuts and we weren't trying to figure
out how much time it would take to eat
grapes as opposed to how much time it
would take to either coconut it's clear
that it's going to take longer to eat a
coconut because there's more effort
involved so we have a sensor it's going
to take more time but comparing the
coconut to our baseline of two right we
came up with a baseline of two for the
smallest user story we compare eating
coconuts for that baseline and we say
okay you know what it's going to take
more effort to eat the coconut than it
is to eat grapes or apples so you can do
it like we did you can also triangulate
for example when we did our planning
project this morning over this morning
for me rather at the beginning oh that's
not it that is the daily standup here it
is if I had said team I want you to pick
a small user story a medium user story
and a large user story and then we would
then compare other stories for those
three insulated would kind of
triangulate on it let's say that we did
you know two was small I'm sorry I'm
saying that wrong grapes were small
apples were medium and coconuts were
large well if we then looked at orange
and we said well you know orange is
smaller than apples but bigger than
grapes so we would know this would fit
in between grapes and apples and so
let's say you know we had apples at five
and grapes at two then we would say an
orange is probably going to be three and
the values you know now I used in our
example the modified Fibonacci series
what we do in scrum and agile ofor using
story points we're going to use a
nonlinear scale for the value
so down at the bottom here there's the
modified Fibonacci sequence the way the
Fibonacci sequence works by the way it's
the the value is the sum of the two on
the right so let me break this right
here because this is a modified
Fibonacci so 13 is 5 plus 8 8 is 3 plus
5 5 is 2 plus 3 and 3 is 1 plus 2 if we
were doing the real Fibonacci series
this wouldn't be 20 it would be 13 plus
8 which would be 21 I don't know why
some use modified Fibonacci and others
not but that's just kind of a common
thing to do if you're doing planning
poker you give everybody seven cards 1 2
3 5 8 13 and 20 another nonlinear scale
is doubling 1 2 4 8 16 you typically
don't go too far to the left of the
values because that either means that
you're being too granular or you've got
stories that are probably too big and
they need to be just aggregated now
somebody just chatted here should some
buffer time be included in the actual
estimate let me answer that question
first by going back to ideal time and
then I'm going to come back to story
points and answer the question when
we're estimating in ideal time we don't
add a special amount of time that we
would call a buffer we just allow for
the distractions and the interruptions
which could look like a buffer right
you're saying you know you know Priyanka
if based on your duties in the
organization and our work day of eight
hours you're typically available to be
doing your project work five out of
those eight hours so when we are
converting ideal time to elapsed time
you know we will be building in extra
time based on distractions and
interruptions we would not call it a
buffer but that's essentially what we're
doing
now when it comes to user stories that
we're using story points it is different
the point are for the entire amount of
the words and why might we need to have
some extra time for a user story well
it's likely going to be driven by
uncertainty there might be other things
that impact it but that's the main thing
sorry team so when the team is
estimating the size of the user story
they will be including in their
discussion and estimates any extra time
or buffer time that would be needed for
that user story to be completed so do we
accommodate uncertainty when we're using
story points yes we're looking at the
The X Factor and if we've got an
unstable user story then we're probably
going to say you know this is going to
be a bigger user story than one that's
similar but has a much lesser level of
uncertainty so that's the story points
let's compare the two ideal time uses
things like hours and days which is
easier to explain outside the team write
the suits like things in days and hours
everybody's estimate may be different
not a bad thing it's easier to do at the
beginning because we're oriented to
think about time and it does kind of
shine a light on waste of time story
points are harder to explain outside the
team you know the suit says well how
long is it going to take to do user
story 301 and our answer is um well
that's a 10 user story point user story
and the suit saying what does that mean
tell me how long it's going to take so
the suits have to be converted to story
points now here's the thing it's a lot
easier
to get consensus when we're estimating
in story points and once we get good at
it it's going to be much faster we have
to remember it's not comparable across
Kings so you know a team working
together will have its own tennis system
for sizing the stories and another team
that might even be working on the same
project will have a call a whole
different scheme and so if the velocity
of one team is 25 and the velocity of
another is 50 it doesn't mean that the
team with the velocity of 50 is able to
do more work than the teams whose
velocity is 25 and we did when we got
our day going we started with a planning
poker exercise and so you know we used
all of the team members so we selected
the team the product R was there to
answer any questions the team discussed
these of the story cards and then
decided what their vote was going to be
and then everybody voted at once if
there were outliers they were discussed
and the reasons for that those variances
those outliers were then part of the
discussion and then we did another round
of voting and we would keep doing that
until we had our estimates converge or
we reached consensus on them okay so
advantages of planning poker it's fun
it's quick it gets the whole team
involved that the team understands a
little bit about all of the stories
everybody contributes his or her
expertise and the discussion during the
estimation provides clarity in the
direction approach and even a bit of
design if we were in the same room team
and we were doing a planning poker
activity like we did at the beginning of
our day together we would be able to you
know model it a little bit better or if
we try to unmute everybody but you could
hear the background noise I've tried
doing and it doesn't really work but you
get the idea that if the team's
discussing and things like that you
would actually get to the point where
your estimates would converge and the
team with JFK this user story size is
you know whatever it is okay so we need
to wrap things up for the day so we are
ending right here and that means
tomorrow when we get together we're
going to be doing slide 20 you're
starting with that which is affinity
estimating and let's see affinity
estimating we go through that we're
going to talk about tracking progress
using information radiators and then
we're going to talk about what we do
when we find variances between the plan
and the actual results and then we'll
have our quiz so we're almost finished I
think we're good on time and I'm going
to just get us right back to where we're
leaving off which is right here and I'm
going to put that away and and let me
open it up team if there are any
questions about anything while you're
doing that I'm going to pull up our
wrap-up slides here so the first part of
that if you happen to remember is
questions and answers and that can be
about anything while you're
contemplating whether or not you're
going to ask questions let me take us to
the second part here which is what to do
between now and tomorrow and there were
some questions about the assignment
there we go so I see that came up as a
reminder for me let me see if I can pull
that up here okay so let's start at the
bottom we have some questions about this
assignment that have to do with what we
covered in Lesson one a separate
question or two based on what we learned
in Lesson number two as I say that run
lesson number one lesson number two so
you can see that we got through
three we finished four so the question
then based on the scenario here the
smart weather project itself and then
big bucks cafe and the Viva life
insurance who want to use the smart
weather software so they are relevant to
our discussions here about the overall
small smart weather project so just
between now and tomorrow just carve out
some time reread the assignment and ask
yourself what would a cross-functional
team for this project look like so
you're looking at the user stories what
needs to be done the fact that they're
likely going to end users are going to
likely be at big bucks cafe and that
would be the life insurance and then if
you didn't get the others then then we
just have questions for lessons one two
and three as well and you could backfill
on that so let's see shanty and Ritesh I
think you had questions on the
assignment did that help Rakesh is
asking can we please get this recording
in the next ten to twelve hours I know
that that's usually what happens I don't
control that I have no ability to get
you the recording one way or the other
so we're going to have to trust the
hosts to do that no I was not having a
question on the same okay so there was
another one so Sandeep are we good on
the assignment the assignment part
rather always thinking if we could go
into the detail that no it's and there's
a reason for it I want you to struggle
with it and there's no really right
answers or wrong answers I just want you
to get into it on your own when
I'm not here the team's not there so
that you can be thinking through it so
if you were looking for you know more
like a wrap-up quiz experience we're not
going to do that so you're pretty much
on your own and Sandeep you are up to
that task you can do that so there's the
assignment question for because we
finished Lesson four and then there is
you know one two and three if you didn't
do those I want you to go back and
review all the pages in the e-book
nothing new there that's you're chasing
the knowledge reinforcing it go back and
retake all of the quizzes and that's
reinforcing the strategy and then last
but not least work on your memorization
items when we get to the point where I
give you some guidance tomorrow about
what to do between the end of the
workshop and when you actually schedule
your exam one of the things is going to
be have those items memorized there okay
team so that is did I get that there so
there's the memorization item so far and
I think I've got another one I don't
know if I have two more I might just
have one more we will find out but get
those memorized remember they're simply
talk where you can download the tools
that we upload it there you can converse
with one another on the team as well as
others and then if you need to do a
support ticket you can always do that by
clicking in a link at the bottom of the
page and then when we leave the session
we are of course going to do your
favorite thing which is pop up that eval
that survey and I know it just takes a
couple of minutes so we make fun of it
we put it hard because it really does
help us and so you know set your
disbelief aside and trust us that on our
end it's important for us the last
question which has to do with whether
you would consider
recommending us to a friend or a
colleague
you got a select nine or ten if that's
the case everything else you're either a
distractor or you're passive or
something at some kind of ranking zones
and so came back pages to the end of
today thank you for your participation
and your questions I think this has been
a very productive session and tomorrow
we will wrap everything up we'll finish
up lesson five and then we'll do six and
seven six and seven or fun they're not
very complicated
they can go relatively fast lesson six
is going to be on scaling agile where we
talk about faith and lesson seven is
about adopting agile or adopting scrum
and that's a fun one too so we will get
it done and then we will wrap up
tomorrow with me giving you some
guidance on exactly what I want you to
do between the end of the workshop and
when you schedule your exam nothing
mysterious doesn't even take very long
but it is very specific so with that
team thank you again and I'm going to go
ahead and chat our host saying that we
are ending the session and I will just
put the participant partition are eager
to get the recording as soon as possible
okay so thank you King</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
