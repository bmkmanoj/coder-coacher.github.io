and welcome to the introductory session
of scrum from simply learn scrum is one
of the most widely used techniques or
methodology in the industry for the
development of products and is in huge
demand you might have come across the
term scrum often while interacting with
your colleagues or friends during the
office projects and might be wondering
what this is all about well to answer
your queries in this session we are
going to explain about scrum at high
level for instance what is scrum where
is it used who has used it how is it
used etc let us look into the agenda of
this session which will give you an idea
as to how we'll answer your queries
agenda first we're going to discuss
scrum history wherein we will address
the beginning of scrum and the current
state then we will look into the
definition of agile and the different
methodologies and how scrum is connected
with agile followed by definitions of
scrum and different terms used under
scrum framework the next part is about
different roles played and the scrum and
their importance also we're going to
address about the best practices of
scrum that we can learn from this
session after hearing the high-level of
scrum
you may be wondering am I the right
person to take up the scrum course or
certification well we will answer that
query as well when we discuss the target
audience also we will look into the
different certifications provided
available in scrum and in the end we're
going to cover how simply learn will
help you obtain the certified scrum
master certification which we also call
it as CMS
now let us look into the above discussed
topics in detail in the following slides
let us begin with the history of scrum
in 1986
hirotaka Takeuchi and ikujiro nonaka
described a new approach to product
development that would increase speed
and flexibility this was known as rugby
approach in the early 1990s Ken Schwab
used this approach which became scrum
Jeff Sutherland with John scum natales
and Jeff McKenna developed a similar
approach at easel corporation called
scrum methodology which they presented
at the business object design and
implementation workshop Schwab and
Sutherland collaborated during the
following years to merge the above
writings their experiences and industry
best practices into what is now known as
scrum in 2001 Schwab worked with Mike
Beadle to describe the method in the
book agile software development with
scrum due to one of ken Schwarz earlier
papers which capitalized scrum in title
some companies implementing the process
used it with capital letters although
the word is not an acronym now that you
have an idea about the history of scrum
where it came from
let's look into the definition of scrum
in the next slide so what is scrum scrum
is an agile methodology and is by far
the most popular agile methodology
practiced in industries the term scrum
refers to the team Huddle's or clusters
in rugby which happens just before the
game begins the scrum methodology
follows the practices similar to that in
the game of rugby scrum is a framework
within which people can address complex
adaptive problems while proactively and
creatively delivering products
of the highest possible value it is used
to manage complex product development
scrum demonstrates the relative efficacy
of your product management and
development practices so that you can
improve it consists of scrum teams and
their associated roles event artifacts
and rules each component within the
framework serves a specific purpose and
is essential to scrums success and usage
scrum is founded on empirical process
control theory or empiric ISM empiric
ISM asserts that knowledge comes from
experience and making decisions based on
what is known in the recent years there
have been a significant demand for scrum
awareness and scrum certification in the
industry as we said in the earlier slide
that scrum is one of the methodologies
used under agile software development
approach likewise we are having
different other methodologies that can
be used in agile in the coming slides we
will see a few methodologies at the high
level we will understand agile in this
slide
agile is most popular in software
development approach and is based on
ITER ative and incremental development
where requirements and solutions evolve
through collaboration between
self-organizing cross-functional teams
it is a time boxed item approach that
promotes adaptive planning evolutionary
development and delivery and encourages
rapid and flexible response to change
agile methods break tasks into small
increments with minimal planning and do
not directly involve long term planning
team composition in an agile project is
usually cross-functional and self
organizing without consideration for any
existing corporate hierarchy or the
corporate roles of team members agile
methods emphasize face-to-face
communication
over written documents when all the
teams are in the same location in the
next slide we will see reasons why agile
is vital for an organization agile
focuses on most important or
high-priority items and prevents waste
it produces working software quickly and
also delivers value to the customer at
the earliest
this helps to market the product fast
and in time and also recognizes customer
engagement the feedback from customer is
immediately incorporated in the next
incremental release also there is
flexibility in terms of prioritization
of features based on customer or market
demand for more details please look into
the website HTTP - double /ww agile
manifesto org in the next slide we will
get an insight into different agile
methodologies the different
methodologies can come under the
umbrella of two variants one is
lightweight approach and the second one
is fuller approach lightweight
approaches are characterized by a
relatively few prescriptive agreements
where as fuller approaches involve a lot
more detailed guidance in terms of
process prescriptions some of the
lightweight approaches are scrum extreme
programming and crystal some of the
heavyweight or fuller approaches are
dynamic systems development method or
dsdm a term which is quite popular in
the UK agile unified process which is an
instantiation of the rational unified
process for adapting it to agile and
feature driven development or FDD let us
address a few points about all these
methods as our main focus of this
session is on scrum crystal-clear can be
applied to
of up to six or eight co-located
developers working on systems that are
not life critical the crystal family of
methodologies focuses on efficiency and
habitability as components of project
safety crystal clear focuses on people
not processes or artifacts crystal clear
requires frequent delivery of usable
code to users reflective improvement and
communication preferably by being
co-located personal safety focus easy
access to expert users and technical
environment with automated tests
configuration management and frequent
integration feature driven development
also called as FDD is an interactive and
incremental software development process
the practices are all driven from a
client valued functionality or feature
perspective its main purpose is to
deliver tangible working software
repeatedly in a timely manner
the main goal of extreme programming or
XP is to lower the cost of change in
software requirements with traditional
system development methodologies like
the waterfall methodology the
requirements for the system are
determined and often frozen at the
beginning of the development project
this means that the cost of changing the
requirements at a later stage in the
project something that is very common in
the real world can be very high the five
core values of XP are communication
simplicity feedback courage and respect
the agile unified process or AUP applies
agile techniques such as test-driven
development TDD agile modeling agile
change management and database
refactoring to improve productivity
dynamic systems development method dsdm
is an agile project delivery
framework primarily used as a software
development method let us discuss about
scrum lifecycle in the next slide the
lifecycle of scrum is based on the term
sprint which is the heart of the scrum
sprint is a time box typically of three
to four weeks of planned activities you
may be wondering what is time box don't
worry we will cover time box further in
this course sprint has consistent
duration and the next sprint starts
immediately after the conclusion of the
previous sprint at the end of each
sprint we are going to get finished work
which can be for example a usable
product in the scrum lifecycle there are
different roles associated with it and
different types of meetings are carried
out apart from these we need to
understand different terminologies used
under scrum we're going to address all
these parameters in the upcoming slide
in the next slide we will look into
terminologies used in scrum here are
different terminologies used by the team
who are managing or practicing the scrum
so before starting projects which uses
scrum methodologies one should be aware
of all these terminologies to be in sync
with the process and people to list a
few terminologies like sprint time box
done and release are frequently used
other than these there are events and
roles which will be explained during the
latter part we're going to address each
one of them in the next slide
you
let's begin with basic definition of
sprint sprint is an agreed time within
which the team needs to complete and
agreed-upon set of deliverables as we
said earlier the duration of sprint
which we call as time box is about four
weeks at the end of the Sprint the
agreed software has to be delivered
which is fit for use one may be having
the question what happens when the
agreed software is not complete can the
timeline of Sprint be extended the
answer is no Sprint deadlines cannot be
extended but sprint duration can be
changed during the course of the project
but not within the sprint frame itself
hope you got the understanding of Sprint
in the next slide we see about the
definition and the characteristics of
time bugs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
