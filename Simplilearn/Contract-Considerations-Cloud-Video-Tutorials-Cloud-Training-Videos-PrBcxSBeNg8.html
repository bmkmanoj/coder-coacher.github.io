data should rest with the collector or
custodian which is the end user when
third parties are involved the end user
is at the disposal of an external
protection of data and there is a high
possibility of loss damage or misuse of
data third party could be service
provider it is wise for the end user to
enter into a legal agreement with the
service provider deciding clearly on the
roles and responsibilities of both
parties the laws and regulations must
also require responsible parties to do
due diligence or security audits let us
now discuss some of the main contract
considerations here first one is due
diligence once the consumer decides to
migrate cloud the organization should
evaluate its own policies practices and
identify any barriers related to the
proposed cloud migration
for example the company might have
policies where any change in the control
of data is not allowed also companies
might be required to do due diligence of
cloud service provider in order to
determine if the company is suitable to
its internal policies and capable of
protection of assets
contract is the second one the consumer
and service provider should enter into a
written contract mostly non-negotiable
which clearly enumerates the
responsibilities of both parties in
cases where negotiation is possible
consumer has to make it without losing
actual benefits financial savings and
also balance it with potential risks if
all issues are not clearly addressed by
the cloud provider the consumer should
choose an alternate provider to best
suit their needs for example if the
customer wishes to send HIPAA covered
information to cloud it is mandatory to
find a provider who adheres to HIPAA
HIPAA is the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act which
any standard healthcare provider has to
adhere to
the third one is monitoring testing and
updating cloud is continuously evolving
and both parties should actively adapt
to the changes constant monitoring
testing and updating are mandatory to
ensure whether processes and policies
are rightly followed also the legalities
and compliance policies evolve with time
organizations have to stay up to date
with these policies and ensure that they
are dear to it at all times
cloud audits and cloud trust protocol
are two mechanisms to automate
monitoring and testing the entire cloud
supply chain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
