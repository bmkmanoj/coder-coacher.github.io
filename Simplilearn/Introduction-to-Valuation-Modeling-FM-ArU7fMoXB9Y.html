lesson is about valuation modeling
valuation modeling is the study of the
basic elements used for financial

introductory path to business valuation
models and advanced models based on
sophisticated projections in
probabilistic environments the
presentation we will go over today
should give you a broad overview of the
important aspects of valuation modeling
with some concrete practical examples
now let's move on to our agenda
agenda we will start by an introduction
to integrated financial models by
wondering what it is that gives value to
a company will introduce the main
techniques used a value of business and
discuss the difference between the value
coming from revenue as opposed to
potential will then get to understand
scenario analysis we will discuss why
multiple scenarios have to be considered
in the context of financial analysis and
while looking at extremely adverse
scenario is very important this will
lead us to define the concept of
worst-case scenario moving on from the
topic of scenarios analysis we will
focus our attention to cash flows and
explain how financial analysis takes an
additional dimension when uncertain cash
flows are introduced we will discuss the
structure of cash flow uncertainty and
introduce the concept of probability
distributions we will illustrate the
topic through the cash flow projection
and valuation of a coupon bond finally
we will define the concept of interest
rate provide the various types and
definitions of interest rate explain
what a yield curve is and discuss how
yield curves are used in the task of
discounting cash flows now let's move on
to our exciting presentation
understanding integrated financial
models we will start our presentation
with the discussion on basic valuation
techniques there are three types of
primary sources that we can use when
trying to give a value to a business the
first source is the past financial
performance this means for example the
revenues from sales in the recent years
the level of profit when related to
sales the capacity to serve debt
interest and so on the second source of
information is the current structure of
the company's balance sheet this informs
us of the key financial ratios that can
provide a quick diagnosis on the
company's financial health finally the
current structure of the cash flows
enables us to relate the value of the
business to how it is expected to
continue during its business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
