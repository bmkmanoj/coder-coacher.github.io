hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on is tqb foundation
preparation this is the second session
that one needs to go through to complete
the is tqb training at the end of this
training you will be able to understand
the relation between development test
activities and work products of product
and project lifecycle we will also learn
about different software development
models that must be adapted to the
context of project and product
characteristics like in session one we
have quiz questions at the end of this
session and you are strongly advised to
answer these before you move on to the
following sessions let us now look at
the agenda for this session the whole
session is divided into four parts
software development models test levels
test types and maintenance testing
in the first session let us understand
the different software models being used
in the industry
what is SDLC SDLC is an acronym for
software development lifecycle usually
any software development process is
divided into several logical stages
which allows a software development
company to organize its work efficiently
in order to build a software product of
the required functionality within a
specific timeframe and budget software
development companies adopt the best
suited model which suit the team members
and the software product there are many
development life cycles that have been
developed each to achieve different
required objectives these life cycles
range from lightweight and fast
methodologies where time to market is
the motive through two fully controlled
and documented methodologies where
quality and reliability are key reasons
each of these methodologies has its
place in modern software development and
the most appropriate development process
should be selected to each project each
model has its own phases and the order
in which they are carried out so what is
the impact of a specific lifecycle model
being implemented on testing it will
have a big impact on the testing that is
carried out as testing there's no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
