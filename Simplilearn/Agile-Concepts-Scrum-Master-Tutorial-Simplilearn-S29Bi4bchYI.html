introduce you to agile as a project
management approach and scrum as an
agile method after completing this
lesson you'll be able to find what both
agile and scrum is you'll be able to
articulate the benefits of being agile
you'll be familiar with the agile
manifesto and it's supporting 12 guiding
principles also you'll understand the
concept of continuous improvement within
the context of scrum adoption there are
two main approaches to managing projects
there is the waterfall approach and the
agile approach we'll talk more about the
waterfall approach later in the workshop
but to summarize it involves big
planning up front in order to determine
the detailed scope of the project and
establish the project's performance
baselines once
executing begins actual results are
compared to the baselines in order to
determine the health of the project the
agile approach is for projects that are
more complex and uncertain an agile
there is no heavy detailed planning
upfront rather an agile project evolves
as short increments are completed one of
the thought leaders in the agile world
Scott Ambler defines agile this way
quote agile is an iterative and
incremental evolutionary approach to
project development which is performed
in a highly collaborative manner by
self-organizing teams with just enough
ceremony that produces high-quality
software in a cost-effective and timely
manner which meets the changing needs of
its stakeholders
close quote agile is a family of
lightweight quality driven approaches to
software development which evolved in
the late 1990s in response to the burden
of heavy documentation and frequent
change in February 2001
17 leading developers signed the agile
manifesto the agile manifesto is a
foundational document for all agile
methods and it reads like this quote we
are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others
do it through this work we have come to
value individuals and interactions over
processes and tools working software
over comprehensive documentation
customer collaboration over contract
negotiation responding to change over
following a plan that is while there is
value in the items on the right we value
the items on the Left more close quote
let's take a look at the four main
points in the manifesto one individuals
and interactions over processes and
tools while processes and tools are
necessary the emphasis is on individuals
and the interactions between them two
working software over comprehensive
documentation documentation does not
demonstrate progress or value therefore
the emphasis is on working software
three customer collaboration over
contract negotiation rather than
creating a detailed statement of work
and then negotiating contracts
developers and customers should
collaborate in order to progressively
determine the requirements of the
project for responding to change over
following a plan rather than being
constrained by an original plan
developers should embrace change in
order to meet the dynamic needs of the
customer there are also twelve guiding
principles that support the agile
manifesto let's go over each of them one
our highest priority is to satisfy the
customer through early and continuous
delivery of valuable software to welcome
changing requirements even late in
development agile processes harness
change for the customers competitive
advantage three deliver working software
frequently from a couple of weeks to a
couple of months with a
preference to the shorter timescale for
business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project 5
build projects around motivated
individuals give them the environment
and support they need and trust them to
get the job done
sticks the most efficient and effective
method of conveying information to and
within a development team is
face-to-face conversation 7 working
software is a primary measure of
progress 8 agile processes promote
sustainable development the sponsors
developers and users should be able to
maintain a constant pace indefinitely 9
continuous attention to technical
excellence and good design enhances
agility 10 simplicity the art of
maximizing the amount of work not done
is essential 11 the best architectures
requirements and designs emerge from
self-organizing teams and 12 at regular
intervals the team reflects on how to
become more effective than Tunes and
adjust its behavior accordingly in 1986
scrum was first introduced by hirotaka -
coochie and iku Jura no naka they
described it as a new approach to
commercial product development that
would increase speed and flexibility
they actually called it the rugby
approach and then in the early 1990s
this method was first referred to using
the single word scrum scrum is a proven
agile software development method
providing significant benefits over the
traditional waterfall approach for
example higher productivity and lower
development costs this is accomplished
by reducing waste and irregularities by
only developing what is absolutely
essential for the customer improved
customer satisfaction collaboration
between the developers and the customer
results in
about what is to be developed and the
ability to respond to changing needs and
priorities which leads to actually
delivering the value the customer wants
higher quality software using techniques
like test-driven development continuous
integration acceptance test-driven
development and refactoring can lead to
nearly defect free software improved
employee engagement and job satisfaction
by empowering a team to be
self-organizing the team is able to
determine how it is going to deliver the
value to the customer and establish a
sustainable pace forever faster time to
market and early ROI by incrementally
delivering value or working software to
the customer in short iterations working
software can be deployed sooner and the
customer can realize early return on
investment scrum is now the leading
agile method with more than 50% of agile
projects using scrum features that makes
Prem so popular include it offers
simplicity and proven results it
encompasses other agile engineering
techniques it emphasizes small teams and
team empowerment it welcomes changes to
requirements it allows working from a
single source of prioritized work items
it includes daily status meetings
it offers team commitment to potentially
shippable software at the end of each
sprint this chart illustrates how agile
methods deliver value faster in the
traditional approach the chart on the
right you can see that the customer has
to wait until the end of the project for
the delivery of the working software and
the realization of return on investment
rom delivers value or working software
at the end of each sprint looking at the
chart on the left you can see how value
is delivered clearly and incrementally
from the very beginning of the project
adopting scrum can be an effort that
takes some time there is likely to be
some organizational gravity that resists
the adoption of scrum so it's going to
be helpful to be able to definitively
answer some key questions like has the
investment in scrum paid off what is our
next area of improvement should we
continue with scrum are we better off
than before are we producing better
products do our products have fewer
defects are we able to ship faster than
before the answers to these questions do
not need to be necessarily arrived at
through a precise or scientific effort
however testing and measuring the
results of any effort is necessary to
discover whether or not we've been
successful hi there if you like this
