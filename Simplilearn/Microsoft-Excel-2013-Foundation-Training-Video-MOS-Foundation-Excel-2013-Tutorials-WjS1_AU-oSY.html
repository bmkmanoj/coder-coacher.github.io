hello and welcome to Microsoft Excel
2013 mos foundation course offered by
simply learned this is the second of six
lessons in the Microsoft Excel 2013 mos
foundation course before we get started
let us look at the objectives of this
lesson in the next slide
by the end of this lesson you will be
able to create a new workbook use
different worksheet operations add
values to workbook properties save
workbooks in alternate file formats and
to remote locations print workbooks by
setting print area in the next slide we
will discuss Excel 2013 workbooks
ms excel workbook is a file within the
ms excel application where one can enter
and store data a workbook contains
multiple worksheets each worksheet is a
combination of a number of cells that
hold information pertaining to a
particular subject and can be modified
as per the requirements a workbook
defines the data that is contained
within the worksheet
however the manipulation of data happens
only through worksheets and not
workbooks in Excel 2013 each workbook
has a separate window it becomes easier
to work on two workbooks or two monitors
at the same time as the name of the
workbook is displayed in the title bar
usually you can create a new workbook
when you start a new project there are
several ways to create a workbook in
Excel 2013 create a workbook with a
blank document create a workbook from a
template open an existing workbook in
the next slide we will talk about
creating a blank workbook
Excel 2013 allows users to create a new
workbook from a blank document there is
also an option to create a new workbook
based on the existing workbook by
default a new workbook contains three
worksheets however you can change the
number of worksheets in a workbook as
per the requirement let's see how to
create a workbook from a template in the
next slide
a template is a pre-designed worksheet
which can be modified to suit users
needs the template contains predefined
formulas and custom formatting this
saves a lot of time and effort while
working on a new project to create a
workbook from a template you need to
select an appropriate template as per
the requirement
besides Microsoft there are many
individual users as well as third-party
providers you create customized template
in the next slide we will look at how to
open an existing workbook
an existing workbook is one that has
been previously saved and stored in
computer or on the web one can open
existing workbooks from computer local
drives SkyDrive online storage and other
online storage places SkyDrive is a
Microsoft product and anyone can sign in
or register on SkyDrive for storing
files online let's do a quick recap of
the steps John performed
you
let us first understand what native and
non-native files are the type of file
format that each software program can
create or accept is called as native
files a software program that allows us
to work and save files in a different
format is called non native files below
a popular native file format in Excel
2013 Excel workbook xlsx it is the
default XML based file format from Excel
2007 to 2013 versions Excel workbook XLS
it is the default file format from Excel
97 to 2003 version excel binary workbook
XLS B it is the binary file format for
Excel 2007 to 2013 Excel workbook code
Excel SM it is the XML based and macro
enabled file format for Excel 2007 to
2013 Excel workbook code xlm it is the
macro enabled file format for earlier
versions of Excel
there are Excel workbook templates Excel
TX XML data XML and Excel add-in X L am
some popular non native file formats
used in Excel 2013 are text txt allows
user to save a workbook as a
tab-delimited text file user can save
this file as Macintosh an ms-dos
operating system compatible comma
separated values CSV allows user to save
a workbook as a comma delimited text
file user can save this file as
Macintosh an ms-dos operating system
compatible in the next slide we will
talk about connecting or importing
external files
in Excel 2013 the main advantage of
connecting to external data is periodic
analysis of this data without repeatedly
copying it repeated copying is a
time-consuming and error-prone process
by default connections to external data
may be disabled on the computer if you
want to use this feature first enable
the external data connections from trust
Center settings
there are two ways of importing data
delimited this option is used when the
text contains comma tab semicolon and
other symbols fixed-width this option is
used when all the rows have similar text
lengths
in Excel 2013 you can connect or import
data from the following sources from
access this option allows for easy
access of data from ms access databases
that store huge information once the
link to the Access database has been
registered in ms excel then any
information changes in the Access
database will result in automatic
updation of the excel file from web this
option allows for access of data from
web sites such as share markets and live
currency converters it is a time
consuming task to copy data from the
website to ms excel ms excel allows for
easy import of external data from the
website from text files this option
allows for access of text format files
as supported in many operating systems
there are some other popular data
sources in Excel to connect or import
data for analysis including SQL Server
ODBC analysis services Windows 0 Market
Place and Microsoft query we will
continue our discussion on connecting or
importing external files
external data can be imported in a
number of ways table this is a general
table format where the data will be
imported in rows and columns pivot table
report a pivot table report is a summary
of raw data in a table format if we
select this option the data will be
imported in a pivot table form pivot
chart a pivot chart represents data
series categories and chart axes the
same way as a standard chart it also
allows us to filter controls right on
the chart so we can quickly analyze a
subset of the data Power View report is
a new feature introduced in Excel 2013
Power View report is an interactive data
exploration visualization and
presentation experience that encourage
intuitive ad hoc reporting only create
connection only creates connection
option creates a connection between data
source and the excel file
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
you
a worksheet contains different rows and
columns intersection of row and column
is a cell various options can be
performed using a worksheet insert this
option allows you to insert new
worksheets to an existing workbook

can be differentiated by the use of
different tab colors if sheet tabs have
been color-coded the sheet tab name will
be underlined in the either specified
color when selected if the sheet tab is
displayed with a background color then
the sheet has not been selected next let
us take a look at how to hide and unhide
worksheet
sometimes you may want to hide certain
worksheets for security and later unhide
them when required for instance while
creating a dashboard for the top
management to review we can easily hide
the raw data worksheet when worksheets
are hidden there is no effect to
formulas all work sheets in a workbook
can be hidden but at least one worksheet
needs to be visible
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
you
Excel 2013 allows you to search for data
and replace old data with new data this
feature is very useful to search and
replace data in multiple records instead
of moving from one cell to another to
make changes this function also saves a
lot of time and effort in the next slide
we will talk about go-to and name box
options
goto and name box features in Excel can
be used to quickly move to different
cells in a worksheet this feature is
useful when you are working on large set
of data the go-to and name box
functionality can be used to select
named cells and a specific data range in
a worksheet the go-to function allows
you to select all comments constants
formulas visible cells conditional
format and blank cells in a worksheet

by default in Excel 2013 every workbook
uses an office theme a workbook theme is
a unique set of colors fonts and effects
these themes are shared across MS Office
programs so that all the office
documents can have a uniform look you
can browse for themes customize them
based on the requirements or even save
the current theme and apply it to other
workbooks this feature allows you to
change color and style with the
selection of a single theme also in case
any changes are done in the cell styles
and color they will be applied
automatically throughout the workbook in
the next slide we will talk about
modifying page setup
a worksheet sometimes contains large
amounts of data or even multiple charts
if you want to print worksheets or
workbooks you first need to fine-tune
the page setup options margins this
option allows you to change or modify
margins preferences based on your

content in the next slide we will
discuss how to modify a row height and
column width
in Excel 2013 by default each row height
and column width is set to the same
measurement we can change the row height
and column width in several ways such as
techs ramp and cell merge sometimes we
need to manually change the row height
and column width but displaying cell
content clearly or use auto fit the
content the row height value can be
changed between 0 to 409 and column
width value can be changed between 0 to
255 in the next slide we'll discuss how
to hide or unhide columns and rows

in Excel 2013 the Developer tab is not
enabled by default but we need to set it
up to use features given below write
macros in Visual Basic editor to
automate tasks run macros that was
previously recorded or written use XML
commands to work with XML data insert
any use form and active X controls
create applications to use with
Microsoft Office programs in the next
slide we will discuss macros security
options
when you open a workbook you can change
the macro security settings to control
which macro to run and under what
circumstance there are several macro
security settings options disable all
macros without notification if this is
set as the default setting then all

security alerts are disabled disable all
macros with notification if this is set
as the default setting then all macros
in the documents are disabled and the
security alerts will be notified disable
all macros except digitally signed
macros if this is set as a default
setting then all the macros in the
document except the digitally signed
macros as well as the security alerts
get disabled without notification this
function is similar to disabling all
macros with notification option enable
all macros not recommended as
potentially dangerous code can run if
this is the default setting all macros
in the document will run without any
alerts trust access to the VBA project
object model if this is the default
setting it provides a security code that
will automate an office program and
programmatically change the Microsoft
Visual Basic for applications VBA
environment and the object model in the
next slide we will learn how to record
macros
macros are a set of directions or
instructions for Excel to automate a
task to be performed in a particular
worksheet with a simple click of a
button a macro recorder registers all
the steps required to complete the
transaction that you want the macro to

backward compatibility means checking
the compatibility with earlier models or
earlier versions of the same product a
new version of a program is said to be
backward compatible if it uses files and
data created by an older version of the
same program backward compatibility is
important as it enables easy exchange
and accessibility of data irrespective
of the Excel version in use in general
manufacturers try to keep all their
products backward compatible however at
times you need to sacrifice the backward
compatibility feature in any product to
take the advantage of a new technology
in Excel 2013 you can check the backward
compatibility for earlier versions in
three ways inspect document this option
allows checking for hidden properties of
the workbook or personal information if
any check accessibility this option
allows checking for the accessibility of
the workbook content to people with
disabilities check compatibility this
option allows checking for compatibility
of the workbook features to work with
earlier versions of Excel Excel
application have only backward
compatibility
that means the latest versions of Excel
features cannot be used in the earlier
versions of Excel in the next slide we
will learn about the different workbook
views
2013 by default workbook views are said
to be normal and sometimes you need to
change based on the requirement Excel
application contains four types of
workbook views as listed below normal
displays the ruler and allows for data
to be entered into cells for insertion
of charts and pictures into the
worksheet page break view displays the
workbook with page breaks and page
numbers to adjust workbook content to
print page layout displays the workbook
as pages with rulers displays headers
and footers it is primarily used for
printing purpose custom view allows you
to change workbooks using custom zoom
options once this option is set and we
open the workbook it will automatically
zoom the workbook according to the
Gibbon specifications in the next slide
we will discuss how to use zoom for
workbooks
workbook contains huge data and does not
display all the content in the window
you can use the zoom feature you can use
zoom in and zoom out with a camera to
increase the size of an object in the
camera's viewer the zoom option is found
at the bottom right corner next to the
workbook view icons zoom out click on
this option to decrease workbook zoom
size and the minimum zoom level is 10%
zoom in click on this option to increase
workbook zoom size and max zoom level is
400% in the next slide we will discuss
how to freeze panes
sometimes if your workbook contains a
lot of content and is difficult to
compare sections in Excel 2013 you have
an option called freeze panes that works
in three ways as listed below freeze
panes this option allows for the rows
and columns
to be visible to rest of the worksheet
based on the current range selection
even while scrolling up and down the
worksheet freeze top row this option
allows for top row visibility and is
preferred when the top row contains any
headers freeze first column this option
allows for first column visibility and
is preferred when the first column
contains any headers to unfreeze the
rows or columns click the freeze panes
command and then select unfreeze panes
from the drop down menu in the next
slide we will discuss split window
sometimes you may need to compare
different sections of the same workbook
without creating a new window in such
cases you can use the split window
functionality this command allows you to
divide the worksheet content into four
parts with scroll bars and increase or
decrease the window size

in Excel 2013 by default workbooks will
be saved with xlsx file extension and
you can save a workbook in alternate
file formats as listed below PDF
Portable Document format / XPS XML paper
specification allows you to easily print
a workbook for instance if you don't
have access to the printer and someone
else does but they do not have the Excel
application installed in their system
this file format comes to a rescue then
text txt Sasa workbook as a tab
delimited text file txt files are the
most widely compatible format for data
they can be opened and viewed on any
computer they are usually called dot txt
files comma separated values CSV saves a
workbook as a comma delimited text file
comma separated value files are a kind
of text file which do not store
formatting information as contained in
the original worksheet they are usually
called dot CSV files in the next slide
we will discuss how to set the print
area or a workbook
sometimes you need to print a worksheet
which contains huge amount of data in
this case Excel allows you to set print
area this option allows you to set print
area based on your requirements and
cleared the print area if it is not
required you can print workbooks in
three ways they are print active sheets
this option allows you to print only
active worksheet content print entire
workbook this option allows you to print
entire workbook content print selection
this option allows you to print only
selected area of a worksheet print area
of a worksheet can be set using the page
break view mode
after looking at the employee data table
Jones manager has asked him to print the
employee and the school code last
underscore name first and the school
name SSN and region columns John needs
to set the print area to print these
click the demo icon to see how John sets
the print area let us do a quick recap

dot txt and dot CSV format this feature
ensures compatibility with other
operating systems SkyDrive is an MS
product that is used to store files
online so that it can be accessed from
