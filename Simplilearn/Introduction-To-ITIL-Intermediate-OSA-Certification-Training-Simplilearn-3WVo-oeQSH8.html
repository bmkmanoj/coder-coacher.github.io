hello and welcome to simply learns ITIL
2011 capability course on operational
support and analysis certification
course this is the introductory lesson
provided by simply learn on operational
support and analysis osa I am Alex who
will be with you throughout this
e-learning session this course consists
of 10 learning units apart from this
introductory lesson therefore it is
important that you go through this
lesson before accessing the remaining 10
learning units so what are we waiting
for let's begin with the introductory
lesson agenda we will first begin with
the objective of this lesson followed by
a few recap topics that you might have
covered during your ITIL foundation
level the topics we will cover our ITIL
basic introduction ITIL intermediate and
its relevant topics this is followed by
information about the accreditation
Institute os a course description and is
subjective we will then look at who can
attend this course next moving to the
exam section we will learn about the
exam prerequisites or say the
eligibility criteria for attending this
course exam format and the exam tips to
help you achieve this certification
lastly we will look at the osa course
outline and the duration required for
each learning unit and details about the
quiz provided by simply learn at the end
of each learning unit so go ahead and
experience this courseware
the objective of this introductory
lesson is to educate you on the
courseware that simply learn offers help
you on how this online course works
ensure that you are aware of all the
topics and subtopics covered in this
course let us move on to recap on ITIL
basics in the next slide ITIL is the
most widely adopted approach for IT
Service Management in the world it
provides a practical no-nonsense
framework for identifying planning
delivering and supporting IT services to
the business adopting ITIL can offer
users a huge range of benefits that
include improved IT services reduced
costs improved customer satisfaction
through a more professional approach to
service delivery improved productivity
improved use of skills and experience
and improved delivery of third-party
service we will study more about ITIL
under the topic foundation basics at the
end of this lesson let us now understand
ITIL intermediate which is the next
level in ITIL certification ITIL 2011
intermediate level is a next level after
ITIL foundation ITIL intermediate level
has a modular structure with each module
focusing on different aspects of ITIL
they are service lifecycle and service
capability the intermediate modules
focus more on detail oriented study than
the foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification while
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course the
thoughts on how one can become an ITIL
expert must have crossed your mind let's
get the answer to this in the next slide
let us have a brief look at the ITIL
certification path the diagram in this
slide is the graphical depiction of the
ITIL certification
path ITIL certification path is based on
credit point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage till expert ITIL foundation is the
first certification which gives you two
credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from two streams one life cycle and two
capability the life cycle modules have
all the standard five life cycle phases
as exams which provide three credits
each capability modules are more focused
towards implementation content and have
four exams which provide four credits
each you can choose any one of the
modules from either streams or make a
combination on the basis of your
experience in the industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 points plus
two of foundation that is 17 credit
points makes you eligible for third
level that is ma LC which provides you
five credit points once you are
certified ma L see your final score
credit becomes 22 to become an ITIL
expert there is no separate exam you
need to accumulate 22 credits to become
an ITIL expert imma sure we are clear on
the certification path let us understand
the service life cycle and its modules
in the next line the service life cycle
modules are for candidates who aspire to
handle a management or team lead role
which requires a broad management focus
on ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas the different modules and the
service life cycle are one service
strategy SS to service design s
d three service transition st 4 service
operation so5 continual service
improvement CSI similarly let us
understand service capability in the
next slide service capability modules
after the candidates Hugh aspired to
specialise in process level knowledge in
one or more processes which focuses more
on day-to-day execution the different
modules and the service capability are
one service offerings and agreements SOA
to release control and validation our CV
3 operations support and analysis OSA
for planning protection and optimization
PPO as we have an understanding of both
the streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide here is a difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you will see that life cycle is mainly
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also life cycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn more about the
differences on this slide
once you're done move on to learn about
mal C managing across the life cycle is
the last step in achieving the ITIL
expert certification therefore it is
mainly focused on individuals who want
to become ITIL experts on completing mal
C an individual can apply the ITIL
knowledge and it will provide skills
that can be used in the workplace in a
tangible way we already discussed on the
credit system in the certification Park
slide however just to mention the mal C
certification gives you 5 credit points
now
let us proceed to look at the
accreditation Institute for ITIL in the
next slide the governing body for ITIL
2011 Foundation and intermediate is the
Cabinet Office UK simply learn is
accredited by APM G and tuv as an ITIL
foundation an intermediate training
provider also simply learn is an
accredited examination center AEC by APM
g tu v and xn to conduct these exams so
this has been a basic introduction on
ITIL let us now focus on the osa course
description and objective in the coming

on some of the definitions and terms
used in ITIL the next section is on
foundation basics
well this section is provided to help
you refresh the learnings from ITIL
foundation here we will discuss about
service service management functions and
processes of OSA
introduction to ITIL the picture on the
slide depicts that each lifecycle phase
of ITIL call is represented by a volume
in the library the core set consists of
six publications and they are one
introduction to ITIL service management
practices to service strategy three
service design for service transition
five service operation and six continual
service improvement
let's study them in detail service
strategy as mentioned in the figure it
is considered to be the core of the
service lifecycle service strategy
provides guidance on how to view service
management not only as an organizational
capability but as a strategic asset
guidance is provided on the principles
underpinning the practice of service
management which are useful for
developing service management policies
guidelines and processes across the ITIL
Service lifecycle service design service
design provides guidance for the design
and development of services and service
management practices it covers design
principles and methods for converting
strategic objectives into portfolios of
services and service assets the scope of
service design is not limited to new
services it includes the changes and
improvements necessary to increase or
maintain value to customers over the
lifecycle of services the continuity of
services achievement of service levels
and conformance to standards and
regulations service transition service
transition provides guidance for the
development and improvement of
capabilities for transitioning new and
changed services into life service
operation this publication provides
guidance on how the requirements of
service strategy encoded in service
design
are effectively realized in service
operation while controlling the risks of
failure and disruption service operation
service operation embodies practices in
the management of the day-to-day
operation of services it includes
guidance on achieving effectiveness and
efficiency in the delivery and support
of services to ensure value for the
customer and the service provider
strategic objectives are ultimately
realized through service operation
therefore making it a critical
capability continued service improvement
continued service improvement provides
instrumental guidance in creating and
maintaining value for customers through
better design transition and operation
of services it combines principles
practices and methods from quality
management change management and
capability improvement organizations
learn to realize incremental and
large-scale improvements in service
quality operational efficiency and
business continuity well we have looked
at the publication's of ITIL let us look
into the definition of ITIL what is ITIL
well to define in one line ITIL is a set
of publications for good practices in IT
Service Management now the next question
you might have in mind or ask is why do
we need ITIL as ITIL focuses on
descriptive guidance on IT Service
Management that's easily adapted and
emphasizes quality management approach
standards as you have understood by now
the goal of ITIL is to provide
consistent comprehensive hygienic set of
best practice guidance provide a
platform for independent discussion of
processes in a common or say easy
language or standardized vocabulary ITIL
acts as a flexible framework which is a
two ball two different IT environment
and also compliment other public
frameworks best practice in the public
domain
why is ITIL considered as best practice
in the public domain organizations
operate in dynamic environment with a
need to learn and adapt there is a need
to improve performance while managing
trade-offs under similar pressure
customers seek advantage from service
providers they pursue sourcing
strategies that best serve their own
business interest to cope with the
pressure organizations benchmark
themselves against peers and seek to
close gaps in capabilities one way to
close such a gap is the adoption of best
practices across the industry there are
several sources for best practices
including public frameworks standards of
organisations and individuals ITIL as
best practices is considered over
proprietary ones why is that so let us
seek the answer to this question in the
next slide
good practices over proprietary ones why
choose good practices over proprietary
ones public frameworks and standards are
attractive when compared with
proprietary knowledge because of certain
advantages proprietary knowledge is
deeply embedded in the organization's
and therefore difficult to adopt
replicate or transfer even with the
cooperation of the owners such knowledge
is often in the form of tactic knowledge
which is inextricably and poorly
documented proprietary knowledge is
customized for the local context and
specific business needs to the point of
being idiosyncratic unless the
recipients of such knowledge have
matching circumstances the knowledge may
not be as effective in use owners of
proprietary knowledge expect to be
rewarded for their long-term investment
they make such knowledge available only
under commercial terms through purchases
and licensing agreement publicly
available frameworks and standards such
as ITIL control objectives for IT CMM
es cm sp
prince2 iso 9000 iso 20000 an iso 27001
are validated across a diverse set of
environment and situations rather than
the limited experience of a single
organization they are subject to broad
review across multiple organizations and
disciplines they are vetted by diverse
sets of partners suppliers and
competitors the knowledge of public
frameworks is more likely to be widely
distributed among a large community of
professionals through publicly available
training and certification it is easier
for the organizations to acquire such
knowledge through the labor market so
far we have looked at introduction to
ITIL ITIL publications and
ITIL as best practice let us now proceed
to learn about service management
starting with the definition of service
what is service so what is service as
stated in the cabinet offices
publications a service is defined as a
means of delivering value to customers
by facilitating outcomes customers want
to achieve without the ownership or
specific costs and risks services
facilitate outcomes by enhancing the
performance of associated tasks and
reducing the effect of constraints the
result is an increase in the probability
of desired outcome in the next slide we
will learn about service management what
is service management here we will talk
about service management the picture on
the slide depicts the process flow of
service management service management is
a set of specialized organizational
capabilities for providing value to
customers in the form of services the
capabilities take the form of functions
and processes for managing services over
a life cycle with specializations in
strategy design transition operation and
continual improvement the capabilities
represent a service organizations
capacity competency and confidence for
action the act of transforming resources
into valuable services is at the core of
service management without these
capabilities a service organization is
merely a bundle of resources that by
itself has relatively low intrinsic
value for customers however service
management is more than just a set of
capabilities it is also a professional
practice supported by an extensive body
of knowledge experience and skills a
global community of individuals and
organizations in the public and private
sectors foster its growth and maturity
formal schemes exist for the educate
Asian training and certification of
practicing organizations and individuals
influenced it's quality industry best
practices academic research and formal
standards contribute to its intellectual
capital and draw from it in the coming
slides we will learn about the roles and
responsibilities of service and process
owners service management roles service
owner this slide will focus on the
service owners role and responsibilities
service owner is the person who is
accountable for the delivery of a
specific IT service they are responsible
for continual improvement and management
of change effecting services under their
care example the owner of the payroll
service responsibilities service owners
main responsibility is to act as prime
customer contact for all service related
inquiries and issues and to ensure that
the ongoing service delivery and support
meet agreed customer requirements
service owners identify opportunities
for service improvements discuss with
the customers and to initiate changes
for improvement if appropriate lately
A's with the appropriate process owners
throughout the service management life
cycle for effective and efficient
delivery of service and they also
solicit required data statistics and
reports for analysis and to facilitate
effective service monitoring and
performance let us proceed to learn
about the process owner service
management roles process owner here we
will talk about the role and
responsibilities of process owner
process owner is responsible for
ensuring that the process is fit for the
design purpose and is accountable for
the output of that process example the
owner for the availability management
process responsibilities include
assisting with process design and
documenting the process process owner is
also responsible for the process being
performed
as documented and make sure process is
meeting its aim and also to monitor and
work towards improvement of the process
over time now we have understood the
roles and responsibilities of the
service and process owners in any
industry for smooth running of the
processes and functions the
responsibilities must be assigned to
respective owners
a RACI matrix is a right tool to assign
the responsibilities let us look into it
in detail in the next slide
connecting process and the functions
RACI matrix what is RACI matrix how does
it help in smooth functioning of the
processes RACI matrix is a concept used
for a distinct understanding of roles
and responsibilities the RACI model will
be beneficial in enabling decisions to
be made with pace and confidence our ACI
is an acronym for the four main roles
where R stands for responsible a stands
for accountable C stands for consulted
and I stands for informed responsible is
the person of people responsible for
getting the job done accountable is the
person who is answerable for the
respective activity and there should be
only one person accountable for each
task consulted role other people who
were consulted and whose opinions are
sold and informed role other people who
are kept up-to-date on progress service
provider who is a service provider
service provider is an organization
supplying services to one or more
internal customers or external customers
service provider is often used as a
short form for IT service provider there
are three types of business models
service providers namely type 1 type 2
and
type 3 type 1 is internal service
provider which is embedded within a
business unit for example one IT
organization within each of the business
units the key factor is that the IT
services provide a source of competitive
advantage in the market space the
business exists in type 2 is shared
services provider is an internal service
provider that provides shared IT service
to more than one business unit for
example one IT organization to service
all businesses in an umbrella
organization IT services typically don't
provide a source of competitive
advantage but instead support effective
and efficient business processes type
three is external service provider which
provides IT services to external
customers that is to say outsourcing the
next key term that we will get
introduced to is supplier who is a
supplier another important key word or
rather service provider frequently used
in the IT Service Management is supplier
who is a third party and is responsible
for supplying goods or services that are
required to deliver IT services examples
of suppliers include commodity hardware
and software vendors network and telecom
providers and outsourcing organizations
this marks the end of our introductory
lesson as to a quick recap of what we
learnt so far in this lesson we learnt
about what is ITIL ITIL intermediate
definition of service lifecycle and
capability we also got some information
about the ITIL intermediate examination
format itself and looked at the
prerequisite of taking up the
examination finally we covered the
objective illegible candidates os a
syllabus and foundation basics hope you
have a clearer view of how the tutorial
works thank you and happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
