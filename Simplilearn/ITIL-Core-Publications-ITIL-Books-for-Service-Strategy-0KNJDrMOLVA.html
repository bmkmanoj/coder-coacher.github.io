five books or publications representing
each of the service lifecycle stages the
first book on service strategy focuses
on design development and implementation
of service management so that the IT
services are able to provide value to
business service strategy basically
helps an organization identify what IT
services should be offered and to whom
how do we differentiate ourselves from
competing alternatives how do we create
value for our customers
the second book on service design
provides guidance for the design and the
development of services and processes
covering design principles and methods
for converting objectives of IT
organizations into portfolios of
services and service assets so the
service design basically deals with
design of new and changed services that
an IT organization wants to offer to its
customers the third book on service
transition covers the development and
improvement of capabilities for
transitioning new and change services
into the live production or operating
environment so the service transition
ensures that a new services or a change
to an existing services is properly
tested and deployed into the live
production environment
the fourth book on service operation
takes a look at the different practices
in the management of service operation
and includes guidance on achieving
efficiency and effectiveness in the
delivery and support of services meaning
service operation takes of coordinating
and carrying out day-to-day activities
and processes to deliver and managed IT
services the fifth book on continual
service improvement is focused on
creating and maintaining value for
customers through better design
introduction and operation of services
the aim here is to continually align IT
services to changing business needs by
identifying and implementing improvement
so in other words the aim is to
continuously look for ways to improve
efficient and cost effectiveness as part
of ITIL version 3 foundation course one
module is dedicated to each one of these
ITIL core books so we have module 2 on
service strategy module 3 on service
design and so on knowing about these
five books is our entire syllabus of
ITIL v3 foundation course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
