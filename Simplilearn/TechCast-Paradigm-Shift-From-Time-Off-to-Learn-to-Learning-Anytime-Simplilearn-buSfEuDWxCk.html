a session for now you have any questions
before we get started I'm good thank you
wonderful okay all right thank you thank
you hello everyone once again as a bitch
good morning Nolan good evening
depending on where you are logging in
from it's a pleasure to speak with you
this traffic in Bangalore and I want to
do it's just an opportunity to give you
my thoughts on on on where learning is
headed and happy as the title of the
takest says that we are actually going
through a real paradigm shift from time
where we could take time off to learn we
are moving into learning all the time
and I have intentionally corrected that
title slide to see it's not learning any
time but it is really learning all the
time
you know it's sort of a continuous
learning that we are we are looking at
so that's really the you know paradigm
shift and we are going through and
hopefully by the time we finished you
would be convinced of that and you would
also know that you have access to
resource to do that so I mean this is
this is basically you know a TV saying
that everything around us is changing
and I'm sure all of you will agree and
all the people also agree that the rate
of change has significantly you know
multiplied over the past in the recent
years so many of you who are
technologies would have heard about
Moore's law of computing where it
basically simply states that the
computing power doubles every 18 or 24
months but I think we've reached the
stage where even that is being proven
wrong
that is not 18 24 months of density is 6
to 6 months to 8 months to 12 months at
the maximum I to be so the change is is
really sweeping
you know and it is really you know a big
change that is that is you know that is
happening and unless you know you you
you would probably you know but the
other time then many of us would have
just enjoyed watching the gadgets in in
a James Bond movie or or the Star Wars
you know or the Star Trek or you know
things like that and you know if you
really looked at you know these movies
these science-fiction movies five years
ten years back and look at what we have
today and you would realize that that
many of them are real you know I mean
simply one cars at one point in time I
didn't even exist in you know in cycle
and today it is a reality right and
robos are reality that they're doing
work so you know the whole concept you
know of science fiction is going away
and the rate at which science fiction is
becoming reality is really really very
very fast and I'm sure all of you are
are experiencing experiencing that
change look at the mobile penetration in
India for example you know how quickly
this caught up and you know where it has
reached and that things like that so I
think we need to first understand that
that that consent that everything around
us is changing and changing at a very
fast pace right so you know you many of
you probably know Thomas fry man who
wrote the book the world is flat several
years ago and one of his current books
is called thank you for being late in
this he brings up an interesting you
know aspect and you know he he says that
the rate of change
technology has finally overtake the
human adaptability and you know so there
was a time probably in the 20th century
early 20th season even even up to late
20th century is where the technology was
lagging behind you know the human
adaptability but you know you look at
things like for example electrification
right I mean I'm sure it took several
several years before it became became
common public transportation several
years before it came I know
available to common man and things like
that you know flying it took really
several years before his scale so these
are all technological changes that that
have been having going on but the human
adaptability was always faster than what
the technology could offer so in other
words we human beings were actually
waiting to see you know what's what's
coming next and and we could we could
easily adapt to it but today we are it
is no more the case it is really no more
the case today we are swept by the
change or a change in such a manner that
we are not able to adapt at the same
rate it has technology is changing
before we know something before we learn
something you know the technology has
changed and it is entirely something
different or something new that is that
is happening so we are we are we have
certainly crossed over from that point
of view where technology is growing at a
much faster rate than before human
beings you know can adapt to so this is
really a fact that I know through the
examples that I have given to you
because I compared the disparate of
electrification with the spread of
mobile phones and you can actually see
what was the difference how many years
it took or or for for telephony for that
matter
you know how many years it took for the
old you know these old mechanical
exchanges to get replaced to where we
are today where you know it has become
so so so accessible to everyone and
things like that so it is it is a real
fact that the technological changes are
suddenly overtaking the pace at which we
human beings can adapt to them if you
look further into this you would really
see that you know that the rate of
change in technology you know I mean
that there are different different rates
at which different constituency is
catch-up to this change I mean I mean
the good thing is it is people who catch
up to the technology fast it is in which
ones who catch up to the you know to the
to the to the technology change faster
businesses catch up prosody looking less
less you know this is slower and then of
course the public policy comes you know
comes up lagging behind you know you
will know typically if you take an
example of for example if you take the
case of uber right the whole concept of
this you know shared car service came up
and it was working before people started
thinking about how to be able believe
that type of an activity so it is it is
not the not a public policy which came
first but it is the technology which
came first and it is several years later
that the public policy on on regulating
back on bringing them under labor laws
or safety laws or whatever it is you
know it comes in together so you can you
can really see the gap between what
technology can do and how businesses or
public policy are lagging behind you
know again the good news is that we as
human beings are are the closest to
adopting technology as individuals and
businesses are or
public policy is you know if you look at
the employment scenario let's go to the
employment area and take a look at what
is happening there and if you really
look at the you know employment scenario
and in there you will realize that you
know that the you know many of the and
the best pictures of course ultimately
essentially right and even there you can
see that the labor intensive rules are
almost vanished right through the to the
20th century and you know technology
jobs and service you know service worker
what workers and things about are the
ones which have taken over and and grown
significantly right so you would see
that that the the job scenario is
sitting where is the employment it is no
more and maybe than see those but it is
way into professional technical service
oriented you know those and
entrepreneurs for example you could see
those managers officials and operators
it is more of entrepreneur
entrepreneurship that is that is you
know coming up there so you know so you
will see the employment scenario
shifting from where it was to where it
is in other words knowledge workers are
certainly becoming more you know more
and more and their dog is a lot more
compared to the traditional you know
labor force and things like that I mean
that is of course 20th century but if
you look at the 21st century itself or
you know late 20th century to early 21st
century that we are in if you look at
our our century and you would again see
that the the employment you know again
complete in employment ecosystem is is
undergoing a major change right that you
can see some of them like you know
almost all the all the jobs actually you
know
you would see the rate of growth is
going down it is no more growing at at
the same rate as it used to be earlier
yeah you know and and and and some of
these some of its interesting to know
some of them are showing very strong
negative growth you know for example
they they'd be the production
manufacturing a production you know
other laborers sales force and
interestingly even managers you know the
organization's are actually becoming so
flat that the role of manager itself is
becoming you know not required
irrelevant and the growth of rate of
growth of management is going going down
so you can actually see that many jobs
are vanishing and you know because they
have already started the negative growth
rate you know I mean for example
manufacturing is you know you know let's
let's take the example of an apple for
the APLA phone is you know how many all
of us know that it is manufactured in
China while the design and the concept
that stuff like that happens in the
Apple off is in the US and it is
manufactured so if you're looking but if
you compare the revenue per head in a
manufacturing plant it might probably be
in the range of two thousand three
thousand dollars per head while if you
look at the you know revenue per head of
the Apple Design Center it is almost
fourteen to fifteen thousand years
dollars per head so that's the type of
difference that is coming to again from
between knowledge innovation and
creativity to
repetative you know production
activities and things like that so I
mean and I think Ashley is pretty pretty
clear pretty evident what is causing
this dropping in you know in all these
jobs it is obviously the device of you
know artificial intelligence and machine
learning you know robotic process
automation
and stuff like that many of you know
about so it is no more so in other words
you know robots are no more no more
science fiction stuff they are they are
real and you know under that it wouldn't
be probably me in an exaggeration to say
that probably the next job that we could
aspire for could be to become an
assistant to a robot right of course it
is another thing to know that if the
robot itself needs to be created by a
human being and played of the human
being and you should be programmed and
all that stuff
but you know but this gives you an idea
about where our you know our jobs going
to be it potentially be you know so so
things like artificial intelligence
things like you know simply when cars
driving class things like internet of
things where you know where the
refrigerator could be ordering your next
stop appliance you know you don't need
to you don't need to test for me and it
will be automatically you know without
any manual is manual intervention your
refrigerator could place an order and
you know and a drone could deliver it it
could potentially replenish the
refrigerator by itself it's updated and
it closes things so it is going to that
extent where things are becoming
automated to to a great extent I'm not
sure all of us by now know the the
shopping centers of future payments you
know I mean the banks might actually
become extinct and you know it will all
all be just just virtual banking I'm
sure many of us nowadays do not walk
into a bank I to do a to do transactions
probably you know maybe once in a year
or once in two years is when we actually
might walk into a bank branch and
so I mean so so basically what we are
saying is you know that the the whole
scenario of employment is is certainly
certainly changing and another level
what's also happening is life itself is
getting a looking we define the stages
of life itself is getting we define
there's a book written by you know by by
Linda Drayton an actress called which is
called the hundred year life
maybe it's someone and I'm you could go
and read it very interesting book what
it says is of course about the longevity
or life life expectancy is increasing
and so people are living four more years
and that creates a problem the problem
is when you when you live for a lot more
years what do you do with all those
years you know and then you can't just
be working for you know 30 or 40 years
as it used to be today you would
probably be working for 16 17 years
right so that you are you're productive
you're learning you are you are able to
sustain yourself and all that stuff so
if you really look at a conventional way
of you know the conventional life stage
it more or less look like this you know
you you're bored you put school in
college so there's an education phase
and then you join an organization or are
you know you you start working and the
after work you retire
so it basically used to be of course a
pre-staged life model you get educated
you get to work and you retire like that
used to be a simple model of life that
most of us know about right but what is
happening currently with especially with
life stages getting expanded and the
lifespan is so getting expanded and the
innovations that are coming in and it's
fun and they know the job scenario
changing as I explained that the
previous slide what is happening is the
whole life is becoming multi stage it is
no more at three
stage life that we are looking at it is
no more you know a life where we get
educated get a degree work and then
retire no it's no more that it's an
actually getting into a stage where you
know by educating itself they might
start exploding and they might start
amplifying and by the employed in an
organization we might go back to
education and things like that and then
we transition from one pole to another
goal we sometimes you know try some
self-employment we try what we call as a
portfolio a voluntary work and and you
know paid work you know the economy for
example where you are not fixed to an
organization but you are you're doing
something that you love and you do that
for one organization for sometime get
paid and then go to another organization
to do this same thing or something
different and stuff like that so you
know so the whole you know the whole
concept what are the stages of life is
is changing so now there are people who
take a sabbatical while while working to
go and study something what just they
work and then come back people who
people out there there are people who
leave our messaging to start become
entrepreneurs and and then you know the
startups happen I know this whole
startup culture itself becomes comes
from that and then sometimes the
startups get acquired by the government
sessions and the person who left the
organization becomes again another
employee of the organization unless that
person decides to leave and go back and
you know and get going with another
startup and take a step back so you can
even see i mean basically what is
happening is the whole life stages are
getting a lot more complex than what is
the you know what the earlier model of a
three stage life model as we have used
to know about it right you know so what
is happening is obviously the main key
carrier you know the nature of carrier
changes the length of carrier is no more
thirty to forty years it could be from
anywhere between 60 to 70 years
and what is also predicted is that the
average dinner job would be as low as
four and half years that you know a
skill could maximum last of the five
years right no more than that and after
that I know it is a little more relevant
and things like that so so so these are
some of the changes that is happening
from a from a from a career or from life
overall life point of view so we got to
be able to prepare ourselves for all of
this
so let us take let us now switch switch
our attention and see one of
organizations doing so we spoke about
you know the technological change you
spoke about the life changes and let us
now look at organizations
what are organizations going through
actually again from I'm going to look at
our musicians first from a parent's
point of view to also be the talent and
transformation activities and
organizations are now centered around
three elements and the first one is
engagement the second one is the
capability and the third one is the
organizational design it's the design of
the organization itself right now what
what what what is so basically what is
happening in the engagement side is that
the organization's need to prepare the
Purser's to engage with very diverse you
know workforce
you know like you spa it's 60 to 70
years of work so you will have multiple
generations of people who multiple
people with very very different thinking
preferences and abilities and age group
and gender and sexual orientation and
all that right and then of course people
generally
nowadays especially people of water very
well connected by so do some of the
things that are different the engagement
point of view from a from a capability
point of view you know what we are
looking at is actually you know the
innovative nature of how can how can
organizations be in a video
okay how can the talent help the
organization be innovative how can they
provide a and narrative instead of you
know instead of just going by the whole
book and stuff like that and and how how
do they adapt to a digitized world it's
right and of course of the
organization's themselves are changing
significantly they're becoming a child
decisions are made on the side they're
becoming project based hierarchical
organization structures are no more
valid or no more more active becoming
flat they'll be giving global you know
part of the focus and some part of the
world and mostly area so those are some
of the some of the changes that are
happening from an organization point of
view you know so if you look at your
message of the future and see you would
you would see that things are going to
be very very different they're going to
be very different it is not know you
know efficiency or effectiveness that
will matter it is learning innovation
and customer impact you know that will
matter it will not be hierarchical
anymore
it will be collaborative right it is now
it will not be based on business
functions or silos and stuff like that
but it will be based on work projects
what what is most relevant to the client
and things like that it is not really
the proverbial corporate ladder where
every climb up the corporate ladder step
by step and finally this to see your
position will not exist anymore
watchman's might as well mean that you
you know you go through it's more like a
you know ball of wool
you go through many assignments and
experience as multifunctional stuff and
all that stuff before you you know
before you can maybe grow into a
leadership position right and and it is
not to promotion or not - no it is not
no authority but it will be it'll be to
influence that people you know become
become leaders and they would be you
know the culture would be that of safety
and just taking an innovation by the
bath of fear of failure and perceptions
of others side we now people need to be
in a deep and be able to you know go by
a playbook of course part of that
rule-based approach and so roles and
responsibilities will change regularly
there's no more than I have a job
description I stay with that job
description and then can can succeed in
my job and things like that so so this
is going to have a significant impact on
careers and learning - because it is no
more that managers or organizations can
tell people what to learn what they need
to learn and stuff like that because
employers decide what they what they
need to learn because they look embody
their team needs and what I what they do
what their career goals like and we
already talked about it careers will go
in all directions it is not just you
know it will go in all directions and
people are self driven they will find
their own career directions from others
cooperate in any function for example do
not be in honor of any learning activity
or learning content but it will finally
you know focus on providing curated a
curation and you know technology and
stuff like that learning of course the
topic of this tech cast itself people
will all the time to bits and pieces and
micro learning classrooms groups on the
job you know and all that stuff so you
know learning technology will be sort of
always on
it's likely it likely that the broadband
came into existence right the always-on
internet so it's going to be like that
but then you know you some of you might
remember the switch from the dial-up to
broadband so it is no more a dialog mode
of learning it will be always on more
opening that will be prevalence okay and
content will be available for everyone
and you know the credentials will come
from anyone you know it will come from
peers if you come from someone who is
sitting next to you you know actually
Google for example promote this culture
of learning primarily from peers and
they actually hire very little content
outside but they strongly believe that
that the best learning can come from
Sacramento is sitting next to you and so
those will be those the changes that
will happen you know from the from the
careers point of view so what
organizations do is when they create the
learning strategy what I'm going to show
you is my organization when they create
learning strategies they even look at
you know stuff like this of course the
the expected outcomes will not change it
needs to be the client success business
or engaged engaged workforce and stuff
like that of course today we will add
the digital culture also into it and how
do we how do we reach there how do we
reach the is through you know to
providing the learners with with a great
experience right
his devices nothing just in time and
stuff like that the the learning
function will become an enable reporting
tool quite an thought leadership and
platforms and parts of ecosystems and
stuff like that and work and engaging
the learners you know by providing
insight of the client needs and by my
providing innovation in learning
activities and by linking the competency
to be learning and that stuff like that
and providing determination and all that
stuff so the learning strategy I mean
this is my organization strategy by the
way but what I wanted to highlight is
the organization's are changing their
learning strategy to meet the current
you know current trends in the in the in
the learning field to make sure that
learning is available all the time
and people can demand should learn all
the time and I'm not not pushed learning
not that there can't be a learning month
in a year people anymore it is it is
just just there all the time all the
time all the time you know because
things are changing so fast and the same
same turnings at the same time you know
the learning access the access ability
to learning itself will change the
learning will become a lot more
collaborative learning platforms a lot
more collaborative it'll become
omni-channel
you know you you obviously across
platforms across devices and you know
one channel which will provide any type
of learning that you need whether it is
technology or business skills or domain
knowledge or or or leadership skills and
all that right and it will become
exploratory you know you go and study
explore something and then try to
practice it and things like that and it
will become highly highly personalized
because what is relevant for you know
one person might not necessarily
right so it will need to be so that is
where the artificial intelligence starts
and where you know it would be are able
to identify what are the what are the
sources of wanna be what are the
specific personalized needs often
learner and thereby being able to offer
personalized learning activities right
so that is that is going to be be really
and of course it is going to be
interactive it's not going to be just in
town you know you can you can ask
questions if you have some questions you
can get into simulation and all that
stuff you know again what we are working
on now organization is to provide what
they call us and my digital learning car
it provides all these types of learning
accessibility so what I want to
highlight here was the fact that
organizations are changing their
learning strategy based on what is
required for the future and creating
learning learning that is accessible you
know through various means and which is
personalized which is interactive which
is engaging and and you know and stuff
like that so I mean the question very
simply put is this how do we become
future ready how do we become things
already and to me the answer is simple
the answer is that we got to be able to
be the time we got to be able to learn
all the time it is no more bad than that
we can afford to take time off to learn
but we need to be able to really learn
all the time and to enable that there
are sources available today you look at
the Internet you look at TEDx you look
at the books you look at the
organizational learning platforms you
will find that learning sources are all
over the place and it is available
obviously within organizations next to
you know someone who is sitting next to
you so and it is again you know even
even even the you know the education
system the colleges the universities all
of them are taking their ways to make
sure that nobody learning sources
multiple learnings or something used
self-directed learning is becoming a
major major thing and it is it is
important that each one of us jump into
that bandwagon of learning it is a
buzzword in itself but no mortgages
which is driven by you and hence you
know you learn what you need at your
pace and then sources are available
today and today again the learning
sources available at learning content
available are there to help you learn
based on your learning preference
whether you want the weed you want to
hear you want to see you want to play
around with you know everything is
available there so whether it is you
know books audio books videos are our
games or simulations well you can become
all sorts of those learning material
available which means any learning
preference so I mean none of us really
can have a excuse to say that look you
know I mean I can't find something that
suits my learning preference you know
what ability learning preference
theories learning source and available
there which really means your learning
preference you know butters says that
that you know you know it is no more you
know that you got you got to spend
10,000 hours skill right
George Kaufman says that that you know
you can really learn anything in 20
hours you know that's and he actually
goes on the diversity with its special
examples of language learning music and
stuff like that you know he was learning
to learning technology He is calling
samples in that book where he says you
can really learn anything in 20 hours
provided of course you follow a
particular path there you know so there
is you you can learn things rapidly and
that is the that that is the you know
the our you've got to be able to learn
learned rapidly and of course you know
social learning learning from each other
learning from peers and co-created
material not necessarily from something
that experts write and many of the menu
I mean there are there are sources which
allow that that I post on this thing and
learning today is seamless I mean you
you start learning at home on your home
computer you pop into a cab or a bus and
then you can switch over seamlessly into
your mobile and you come to your office
you can switch it to your desktop and
the office is you know wherever wherever
you are it is actually and it is
seamless you can just move from one
place to another to another very very
clearly so that is those are some of the
you know so basically what I want to try
and say is this that you know that the
ecosystem around you has changed and it
is providing you with an opportunity to
learn all the time you know everything
that that I have listed here and more
right and you know so so basically to
wrap it up let me just let me just State
this when when technology change was
lacking behind him adaptability or when
human adaptability was you know was was
was was was changing at a faster rate
than technology we could afford to take
time off to learn and come back and we
wouldn't have lost anything we can we
can easily catch up because we would
anyway I kind of the technological
change and just right so there were
sufficient time for us to get off you
know the grid as it is called go learn
something new and come back and pick up
from left all because you know the
technology wouldn't have caught up right
so there was a gap and and we could
afford to do that afford to do that
but you know but you you you you you
remember where we are we are on the
other side of the girl we had on the
other side the curve where the the
technological changes are happening at a
much faster pace than what human beings
can adopt to and and which means there's
only one way we can we can catch up one
day we can adopt and as shown in the
previous slides of the beginning the
only way we can catch up is by learning
faster and of course the governing
smarter and things like that but for us
as individuals it is only by learning
faster and and learning all the time so
unless we we really learn all the time
we have we have no we have no hope of
catching up so this is really what I
want to you know I want to leave you
with right what I want to leave you with
is this that you know that that the
analysis significantly significantly
changed and the technological changes
are happening at a rate much faster than
what human beings are adopting to
professions are changing like nobody's
business
the own jobs that we knew about
vanishing like no for example the you
know many of the BPO jobs are going away
right and and so and so you know so
basically the quality is taking or a lot
of lot of things constant jobs and stuff
like that right to start with right then
and it could be tomorrow be drivers or
or who knows airline pilots next or
whatever right or for people who you
know wait on us at the beta
and stuff like that so things are
getting changing in a very different way
and jobs the job job situation job
scenario is changing hugely thirdly the
life stages are changing very different
life stages are you know is changing in
a manner that you know that that
basically shows that he and I we are the
other one second okay so life stages
start changing you know in a very
different way and you know we we are no
more than a three phase life where we
get educated get get a job and then
retire yeah we are getting into a
complex life stage which is you know
which is which is defined by multiple
things that happened during our life not
like so you know so we got to be able to
move through that life stages and that
requires very different types of very
different types of skills and those
skills need to be updated
quick basis and databases and
organizations are changing and and adopt
the new organizations we again need to
be need to change our mindset and the
skills that we have so that we can fit
into the new organizations and to repeat
the good news is that the the co system
is providing all those opportunities so
we don't really have you know he have an
excuse as to not to learn you know why
are on the go it is that all all in all
those learning resources available to us
are there so that's what I want to stop
and ask see see if we can have you know
answer some questions and things like
that or do you do we have any questions
I think fantastic sir thank you so much
for all the expertise opinion you
provided
yes of course we have a couple of
questions coming in let me start off
with the first question from Bala the
question is is robotics will not become
a threat to the human being yeah yeah
this is a good question and I my
personal belief is never you know and
see you know if you look at the history
Bala you know if you study history you
will see that no there was the same
question was raised when computerization
first started you know I think when core
banking computerization started in banks
people used to be afraid that not a lot
of people in banks are going to lose
their jobs and you know at that point in
time the trade unions raised this issue
and all that stuff but say the same case
happened with rain barrel oscillations
for example what happened two main ways
and you know if the reservation is the
reservations and things like that are
computerized and you know things like
that you know when when when you know
when uber and Ola and all started I
think they still have those confusion
about hey Arden be normal taxi driver is
going to lose their jobs right when when
when big supermarket started we started
complaining hey the declarer shops will
will close down and people lose their
jobs
stuff like so I think this question has
always been there when something better
comes up won't we be you know losing
losing jobs and things like that so I
think actually that know that that human
beings are created in a very very
special way and so we will all face and
we will always find higher higher
value-added work to do and that really
why we are saying that now that we need
to learn all the time because if we
don't learn all the time we will not be
able to catch up and we will you know we
might likely to be so the answer to the
question is yes there is a risk of is
becoming a threat if we don't learn but
if we learn all the time
feeling learning your habit no way it is
going to be you know applied to you
because you would be the one would be
controlling those robots
thanks thanks for the wonderful
explanation sir and the second one is
coming from one of the managers is how
manager can transform into themselves in
to sustain the future in I mean to
sustain their future in the job market
oh yeah yeah that's that's that's that's
something that I love you know talking
about so so the trigger is very very
very simple I think you know managers
first and foremost have to accept the
fact that they cannot you know they
cannot manage code encode manage by
using power or position or authority you
know you you again
let me call Google X out for example
Google actually a couple of years back
took away all the powers that a manager
has typically when you look at a manager
you know you you know that the manager
is the one who who can who has the power
to hire who has the power to recommend
termination the power to command a
promotion you know to give give a salary
increase to do a performance appraisal
and rating all that stuff you know so so
you generally associate the word manager
with these type of powers that that that
are there but what Google did was for
breaking they took away all these powers
from managers and that is going to be
the trend what Google did is just
setting the trend it is going to be the
trend so what managers need to do to be
able to be relevant and to sustain in
the future is to be able to manage or I
would use the word lead without
authority in other words influence
without authority right I mean I call it
servant leadership but then not
everybody like term servant leadership
as such but if you don't like the term
servant leadership it's alright but the
fact is that all of us will need to
learn how to influence with our
authority so that we can we can
still you know producers we can still
produce and/or drive the team to the
goals that are said without necessarily
having to rely on our you know our power
authority position and stuff like that
and to do that I think we need to
basically focus on three things
one is we need to be content experts we
need to have an expertise in some field
or the other you know so we need to be
what we call a t-shape leader we
generally know a lot about some things
but we also know something in beef you
know so the t-shi a leader is what I
would submit content expertise in some
area that would be of value to the
organisation the second is of course the
relationship or let me put the process
you know the process of leading which is
again but like I said you know without
without without the authority without
the power without position how do we
still lead in the process in the
organisation and the third is what I
call as a relationship which is which is
which is self-explanatory you got to be
able to build the relationship with our
team members and be able to do that and
if you want to remember this you can
remember the CPR which you know you know
what CPR is all about right so what
managers would mean in future in CPR to
really you know lead with big with
influence and not Authority
great thanks thanks for that and two and
uh one more question coming in in terms
of our distance education okay so he
says the distance learning courses and
the degrees are not been considered for
most of the organizations and finding
the right job and from the B schools
what's your opinion on it so will will
there be any improvement in the thought
process of an organization so yeah that
is that is that is certainly true at
this point in time you know the the
distance learning
I mean big rays taken through distance
learning is suddenly considered inferior
to be degrees taken to residential
programs right but my my my assessment
is it will change it will change now how
soon it'll change is not something that
I can predict but it will change and you
know and and there will be a time when
you know when the decrease through the
distance learning mode or online mode
will be as valid I mean for example that
it's already in the Western Western
pearl it is already changing the Western
world nowadays does not differentiate
between a degree that that you've got
through you know an online online degree
or residential degree they have already
you know reach that stage and I'm sure
the other possible will will soon catch
up and give that the same thing now to
do that of course you know it will not
happen automatically what that is we're
not be educators also need to not have a
have a greater role to play the quality
of online education needs to you know
needs to improve significantly and and
then be and par with what can be done in
the residential education so there is a
responsibility on the educators too so
it is not just a policy that needs to
come but the educators also remembered
as I
one of the first nights that I I said
public policy always plays catch up but
it is it is the public policy that takes
maximum back to you know adopt the
technological changes so be patient it
will come great again thank you so much
for that answer
and there is one certification question
where is certification the only way to
adapt to a new way of learning how would
the working mother cope up with this era
so they are working mothers I have a
different responsibility at home taking
care of their kids social responsibility
exercise so how will they cope up with
with the technology involved at the
current situation
yeah actually technologies making it you
know I would say a lot easier for you
know for people like that who need
flexibility working mothers especially
who need flexibility you know to
flexibility to learn from anywhere any
place and things like that so if at all
if at all anything is being done
technology is actually helping them so
that they don't necessarily need to you
know more way and and then they can
learn at their own pace in their own
place and you know and using and being
being where they are so it is just a
matter of you know I think planning in a
manner that it can it can still be done
so I would say technology is an enabler
for for for I know working mothers to
acquire additional skills and things
like that
now the the certification of course is
is always basically organizations when
you go go for a job and things like that
they do mean some sort of credential to
show that is you have a particular skill
because they can't obviously done with
all the skills that you have to an
interview or a test and that's what I
you know that's why organizations rely
on certification so it's always better
to you know to take up skill development
skill development which will provide you
with some sort of sapphic
which are valued in the market so and
then technology today enables it so yeah
so that's my answer to that ah thank you
thank you so much and that and again um
as a learner we get distracted often and
that inhabitants learning how to how to
overcome yeah good question
you know I it is it is told that about
wheels back the attention span was 20
minutes and nowadays that is minus three
minutes or maybe even less cells so I
think we will be the availability of you
know entertainment that others have
really you know made us distracted so I
I don't have it I don't have a you know
simple led to give you on this all I can
say is that you know that as individuals
we need to whenever we are doing you
know whether it is for three minutes or
five minutes or whatever it is
stay purposeful you know and what I mean
by purposeful is stay focused and stay
energetic in what you are doing and if
you are intentional in doing that that's
enough and you can learning bits and
bytes you know you don't need to learn
everything at the same time but when
you're doing something stay focused on
it and stay energetic put all your
energy into it and and you know and then
that way you would be able to you know
avoid the distractions oh great uh thank
you so much on that as well okay uh lot
of questions are coming in and I really
enjoy our taking of questions especially
related to learning and development okay
the question is uh as a learning and
development individual what is that one
must or do to ensure the maximum
employability option in future I mean
keeping the automation in mind employee
once employability or options in future
job securities in future keeping the
automation oh okay all right
yeah I'm kids too you know
to look at the future and be proactive I
always say that no answer learning
development professional you've got to
be an axe innovator of of organizational
transformation you can't be a follower
right I mean in other words if you are
turning in development professional and
you are basically taking orders from
others to know what is required to be
done if somebody comes to you saying
that I need this training you are
providing the training you're no more
correct I mean you you you you it will
be very difficult for you to survive
right so I think what we need to do is
we need to be ahead of the game and and
we need to be truly accelerators so so
you know you've got to be connected with
the business you've got to be connected
with the technological changes so so
have have thought leaders in your team
have people who are you know who are
really subject matter experts who are
tracking the technological changes and
thanks for that in your opinion in your
team as an organization as a Learning
and Development professional and most
most importantly most important of all
make sure that that what you do has a
business impact so I always ask this
question how is this learning activity
going to impact the business what impact
will it have on the business and if you
have an answer to that you will be able
to make sure that not that we the stuff
that you put out there would be useful
to the organization and that will ensure
important the risk image and security
and stuff like that
wonderful wonderful
ok and again the next question is again
on certificate the costs of certificate
are very high across the globe and there
are agencies or the service providers
certification training providers who
provide certification at the economical
cost do they have the weight edge in the
industry I mean how does how does our
one understand which service provider or
the certification provider to go with
there is no I mean there are obviously
you know I mean the problem is that a
lot of you know fake agencies around who
throw away certifications at a very
minimal cost and most of them you know
don't give the skills and stuff like
that so my suggestion is to always try
and go with the you know with the OEM or
maybe with the product company itself as
far as possible at least through their
authorized you know agents do not go
with you know with the fly-by-night this
thing now remember the cost is a
one-time activity in place you know once
you get the certificate it is it is a
skill that will matter and not the cost
will be forgotten
so I agree sometimes we have to take
that call on getting the cost and things
but there are workarounds around that
you know through through educational
loans and stuff like that if it is
important enough but I would always
advise not to go with the you know
fly-by-night operators who come who
surfers who give you certificates at
there and tie prices and then vanished
and have no no market value at all so
they're ugly completely agree with you
sir and one more last question and with
this we can close it does online
certification have the same weight age
as or offline certification yes there's
no you know basically if you are looking
at technological certifications yes
multiple certifications done online have
got the same value as probably done to
assert to a classroom and things like
that
some of them quiet let you go through a
couple of classrooms classroom sessions
and things but they are changing right
now so from a technological point of
view yes
you know the certificates that you gain
Oh like plus it is it is the same but I
also have to you know say that when it
comes to let's say an Academy degree
that is where there is still a
difference you know a residential
program is always considered at a higher
by online or distance education type of
thing so I'm not sure which constituency
the question was addressing they talked
about modifications yes it is the same
great and thank you so much all right
guys with this we will come to a
conclusion of today's session and thank
you so much dr. Madera Kumar for all
your expertise and any question
unanswered on on the session we have
charted out and will ensure that we will
get those answered by our speaker at the
earliest and we will send out email or
we'll get in touch with you to give the
answers okay once again thank you so
much for the time sir it was a exciting
and very informative session for me
