advisory board member for simply learn
in this video I'd like to talk about
Amazon Web Services q 4 2016 earnings
and how they represent a real
transformation in the role of IT going
forward into the future amazon announced
its results februari second and you'll
notice that they had a really good
quarter right the very headline it says
up twenty two percent sales forty three
point seven billion dollars so big
numbers interestingly if you look in the
next paragraph where most companies
would talk about their earnings amazon
focus on is cash flow and i've circled
all the places it talks about its free
cash flow and that's important because
amazon really tracks that as a way to
expand its business it's really
concerned about how much cash that bring
in how much cash you to spend and how
much can it hold on to because that's
what it used to fuel its growth so very
good quarter for amazon overall but what
about AWS well you can see that it had a
very good quarter three point five four
billion dollars in revenue that's just
for AWS and you can see that it had a
steady march of revenue growth those are
the bars over the past two years just
started reporting it AWS revenue
separately two years ago when they
became material enough that amazon
basically had to buy the rules of
accounting however the line represents
the growth rate you'll notice that it is
declining it's on a clear linear trend
and trending downward however a dubious
still achieved 44 seven percent growth
rate in the quarter
and you know most companies in the IT
industry would kill for that kind of
growth rate just by way of comparison
most of the stalwarts that we know of
the IBM's the Cisco's the HP's the Dells
are at flat revenue or even declining
revenue in the same quarter so Amazon is
in comparison absolutely killing it even
though it's declined over the past few
quarters let's talk about eight of us q4
highlights what did it accomplish look
did it show up in q4 well first as I
already mentioned it has 3.5 four
billion dollars remember that is a lot
of revenue interestingly it also had
nine hundred twenty six million dollars
of operating income and again that goes
back to that kind of cash flow that
Amazon pay so much attention so it's got
a twenty-six percent margin now in the
past many companies vendors would say
well amazon prices it's tough solo this
AWS stuff because they don't have to
turn a profit they subsidize it they're
losing money we have to turn a profit
well obviously that's not correct at all
amazon achieved in nine hundred and
twenty six million dollars of operating
income a twenty-six percent margin is a
very healthy business for them over the
course of 2016 amazon web services
released a thousand plus feature
improvements some of those are new
services some of those reflect
improvements to existing services and
some of them are relatively small
improvements where they might tweak the
kind of instant size that they offer
within an instance family something like
that so not all of these future
improvements are major but clearly it
had a huge number of improvement it's
constantly improving what they offer
interestingly Amazon identified 38
accomplishments are highlights in its
earning reports and of those 38
accomplishments or highlights AWS
account
all of them and that shows the
importance of AWS within the context of
the overall Amazon business nearly a
third of what it identified as being
highlights for the quarter associate
with AWS so clearly this is a very
strategic business for Amazon and not
contained in the earnings results but
the reinvent which is Amazon's yearly
conference where they focus on AWS had
thirty two thousand attendees it was a
giant conference and that was fifty six
percent up on the previous year so
clearly there are many many many more
people who are interested in learning
about AWS want to go to the source want
to gather real information and it
reinvent is very focused on education
it's really not a marketing not a sales
event it's primarily focused around
delivering educational content in many
many sessions so huge uptake in terms of
conference attendance so what does it
all mean well here is a chart that shows
a serve the results of a survey that JP
Morgan did they surveyed CIOs across
large enterprises average spend with six
hundred million dollars that varied
across the entire survey sample anywhere
from 20 million all the way up to
several billion dollars but at average
of six hundred million so very large
enterprises and ask them what proportion
of your application portfolio is placed
into public clouds with the environment
today and this survey is done in 2016
and what percentage will be done in 2020
and what they found was an enormously
dramatic change in application
deployment plans in 2016 about sixteen
percent of applications were deployed
into public cloud environment but by
2020 it was going to be forty-one
percent that's really getting on toward
nearly half of the total application
portfolio fleet for large enterprises
was going to be placed in public cloud
environment a dramatic change in the way
that enterprises manage their
application portfolio
now Jason Warren didn't ask about what
about after 2020 we're just going to
stay at forty-one percent or was it
going to continue to grow and my
speculation is that it will continue to
grow there's no obvious barriers to
additional applications being placed
into public cloud environment certainly
some proportion of the overall
application portfolio wouldn't be
suitable for public environment but a
larger percentage of forty-one percent I
would envision so we can see that maybe
this line will be extended and continue
to grow upward past 2020 so that's the
context for what enterprises are
planning to do in abuse itself is on a
sixteen point five billion dollar yearly
revenue run that means it's a very large
business I mean that's obvious but that
means that it's a large business and
growing quite rapidly in fact it's the
fastest growing enterprise technology
vendor ever I've gone back to research
there's never been any other companies
Cisco Oracle any of the high flyers that
I can find that grew at this scale at
the size of revenues this fact now AWS
does have a declining growth rate as I
mentioned in the previous slide but
forty-seven percent is still the envy of
the industry when most participants are
flat or down forty-seven percent is
unbelievable so AWS is exceeding
extremely well and being adopted by many
many enterprises they are placing your
application ser that's how they're
achieving that forty seven percent
growth and a fifty percent growth rate
AWS would be at about sixty billion
dollars by 2020 and even if it's at
forty-five percent it would still be
about a 45 billion dollar business
that's really getting into the territory
that Cisco HP IBM and Dell are all at so
it could potentially be one of the
largest players in the industry
depending on how of that growth rate
holds up so it's certainly going to be a
major player
the industry and again going back to
that thousand plus improvements over the
course the year it abuse has a
staggering pace of innovation it is
really quite remarkable and in fact you
know I often think how do they manage to
do it they've got upwards of 10,000
people working native us obviously
tremendous coordination that has to go
on between all these different services
and yet they still seem to be able to
roll out improvements at a pace that
really nobody else in the industry does
so unclear it's it's kind of a mystery
in a way but certainly they continue to
have a staggering pace generation and
probably they're going to be on the
order of 1500 improvements this year
something like that overall this is
unprecedented I don't think there's
really ever been a vendor that is like
AWS and that makes it hard to really
understand how dramatic the impact it
has on the industry so from the
perspective of enterprise IT
organizations something like thirty to
seventy percent of staff will be AWS
involved if you accept this sort of
forty-one percent deployment you know
that means that developers operations
people finance people you know whole
range project managers will be involved
with AWS very large proportion of the
overall employee base of any Enterprise
organization and that means AWS skills
are going to be critical for your future
success I mean there's no way to get
around it AWS is going to be a major
strategic supplier to every Enterprise
IT organization and every Enterprise IT
organization has to have a plan on how
it's going to manage and run all of
those applications how it will build
them how it will architect them how it
will operate them how it will monitor
manage them so critical for the feature
of enterprise IT well there you have it
AWS is fourth-quarter results and their
meaning I hope you've enjoyed this video

you haven't liked it go down to leave a

thinking and if you have questions that
you'd like me to address in a future
