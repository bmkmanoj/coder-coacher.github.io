course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project cost
management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define project cost management
differentiate between cost estimation
and cost budgeting explain control
accounts describe the project cost
management processes apply earned value
management technique to track project
performance identify key terminologies
used in project cost management in the
next screen let us take a quick look at
the project management process map there
are 47 processes in project management
grouped into 10 knowledge areas and
mapped to 5 process groups in this
lesson we will look at the fourth
knowledge area that is project cost
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand the concept of
project cost management project cost
management involves activities like
estimating the cost of each of the
project activities adding the cost
estimates of the related activities to
arrive at the cost budget and
controlling the cost to ensure that
project activities are completed within
the defined budget in the next screen
let us discuss cost management plan the
cost management plan is a vital step and
project cost management it contains
information like planning the project
cost managing and controlling the
project in relation to the cost baseline
and managing cost variances project cost
management plan is a part of the project
management plan the methods used in
estimating the cost of each of the
project activities are similar to the
ones used in estimating project time for
example time estimation methods like
expert judgment analogous estimating
bottom up estimating and reserve
analysis are few of the techniques that
are also
used in estimating activity cost let us
discuss control account in the next
screen control account is an important
concept in the project cost management
project cost is generally estimated at
individual activity level it becomes
difficult to manage cost at the activity
level in large projects therefore the
cost is managed at a higher level
this requires related activities to be
clubbed and their cost being managed
together as one unit this unit is called
control account while estimating the
project time WBS is created to break
down the project into smaller
deliverables these deliverables are
broken down into work packages and these
work packages are in turn broken into
activities control account is defined at
a level higher than the work packages
for example if five work packages are
part of the one control account the cost
of all activities belonging to these
five work packages are managed as one
unit in the next screen let us discuss
the project cost management process
project cost management has four
processes they are planned cost
management estimate costs determine
budget and control costs the three
processes planned cost management
estimate costs and determined budget are
a part of planning process group and
control cost process is a part of
monitoring and controlling process group
let us look at each of these processes
in detail let us begin with the first
process that is plan cost management in
the next screen managing costs on a
project is a critical exercise if the
activities are planned well it becomes
easier to achieve harmony with the
overall cost and budget of the project
plan cost management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning managing
expending and controlling the project
costs let us look at the inputs required
for the
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and
guides the cost planning activities on
the project the project charter provides
an overall context and high-level
product and project description which
help determine the approach for cost
management for example for some projects
budget could be a constraint whereas for
others budget would not be a constraint
but subject to the other objectives
enterprise environmental factors provide
the organizational context to the
project including the culture of the
organization and the infrastructure for
instance the scheduling systems
available the key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base now let us look at the
tools and techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources experts can devise
an approach to govern the costs on a
project by using their previous
experiences meetings may be organized to
determine the cost management plan
everyone responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager representatives from the
appropriate accounting or financial
organization sponsor customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the cost management
plan these techniques help to map the
impact of various decisions on cost for
example how do risk management processes
impact cost etc cost management plan is
the primary output of this process it
establishes the units of measure levels
of precision organizational process
links control accounts to be used rules
for performance measurement and
reporting frequency and methodology of
monitoring the costs and various other
details that lay the overall framework
for cost management on a project in the
next screen let us discuss the second
process under project cost management
estimate cost estimate cost is the
approximation of the monetary resources
required to complete a project activity
cost of a specific activity is estimated
based on the information available at
that point of time as the project team
gets more information about the project
the activity cost estimation may change
let us look at the inputs of this
process scope baseline is the most
important input as it details out the
project scope of work along with that
project schedule is also important this
contains information like when and which
resource is required for the project it
is good to remember that the same kind
of resources may have different costs at
different points of time human resource
management plan is another important
input various elements like personnel
rates rewards or recognition programs
etc are covered in the human resource
management plan which is important in
approximating the cost estimate human
resource management plan will be
discussed in detail in the human
resource management knowledge area risk
register is also an input because risk
mitigation costs should be considered in
cost planning more information on risk
and its effect in the project will be
looked at in detail in risk management
knowledge area another input enterprise
environmental factors provides
organizational context to the project
organization process assets is listed as
an input as organizations might have
standard set of cost estimation policies
or templates cost management plan is
another important input the cost
management plan lays the framework for
the cost management processes in the
project it provides guidelines such as
the units of measure accuracy desired
methodologies and tools to be used at
set
let us now look at the tools and
techniques used in this process expert
judgment reserved analysis analogous
estimating cost of quality parametric
estimating project management software
bottom up estimating 3-point estimating
vendor bid analysis and group
decision-making are the various tools
and techniques used in this process most
of the tools and techniques used here
are similar to the ones used in the time
management knowledge area vendor bid
analysis is a technique used to estimate
project cost for example a project
requires material procured externally
through suppliers in order to get that
you invite bids from three or four
suppliers and assess their quotations
based on their quotations you can get an
idea of the cost that will be involved
in getting the material for the project
group decision-making technique is
another important technique for project
cost estimation cost estimation is an
exercise which may be carried out by a
group or committee in order to gather
well-rounded input therefore group
decision-making techniques may be used
to arrive at a decision that team can
work with the outputs of this process
are quite straightforward estimates of
each of the activities are arrived at
basis of the estimate includes things
like how the estimate was developed what
were the assumptions made in estimating
etc project document of needs is also
one of the outputs because the cost
estimates may result in updates to other
aspects of the project for example
quality risk time etc in the next screen
let us discuss the third process under
project cost management determine budget
once the estimate of each of the
activities is arrived at the next
project cost management process is to
determine budget it is the process of
aggregating the estimated costs of
individual activities or work packages
to establish an authorized cost baseline
this is where the control account
concept comes into picture the estimated
costs of the activities are aggregated
to arrive at the cost budget at the
control accounts level once approved
this cost budget becomes the cost
baseline of the project project cost
performance is measured against the cost
baseline that is how much more would the
project cost be compared to the original
cost baseline the cost baseline includes
all authorized budgets but excludes
management reserves the inputs used in
determining the project budgets are the
activity cost estimates and the basis of
estimates which are the output of the
previous cost management process the
cost management plan lays the framework
for the cost management processes in the
project it provides guidelines such as
the budgeting cycle tools and techniques
used to prepare and approve the budget
etc in addition to these two important
inputs scope baseline is also looked at
project schedule provides aggregate cost
in a particular calendar period to
ensure how much money can be made
available during that time
similarly resource calendar provides
information on the resource which is
assigned to the project at a particular
point of time this information is then
used to indicate resource costs over the
duration of the project risk register
gives an understanding of the overall
level of risk on the project and
therefore the level of contingency
reserves that need to be built into the
budget agreements entered into with the
suppliers are also required to finalize
the budget again organizational process
asset is an input because organization
may have few policies for reporting the
cost budget or there might be some cost
budgeting tools being used there are
various tools and techniques used in
determining budgets cost aggregation
technique involves adding up the cost
and aggregating them at the control
account level so that the cost can be
managed in a better way in reserve
analysis once the costs are estimated
extra amount is added to the estimate as
a management reserve to take care of any
unplanned activities expert judgment is
a technique in which an experts help is
sought to estimate the activity cost
expert is someone who might have worked
on a similar project in the past and has
a good idea to estimate the activity
cost involved historical relationships
are used to predict the total project
costs using mathematical model this is
similar to analogous estimate or
parametric estimate method funding limit
reconciliation technique is used to
ensure that cost on the project is
budgeted or spent as per the
availability of the fund for example if
the project can get the funding of only
$50,000 a month the project budget
should be planned accordingly the output
of this process is the cost baseline
this is an authorized project budget
over a period this is used to measure
monitor and control overall cost
performance of the project in addition
to this the project funding requirements
are also arrived at funding requirements
means how much fund the project requires
monthly quarterly or yearly for the
execution the last output of this
process is project document updates an
understanding of determining budget may
be useful when answering questions in
the PMP exam so make a note of the
inputs tools and techniques and outputs
of determining budget in the next screen
let us discuss the last process of
project cost management that is control
cost control costs is the process of
monitoring the status of the project to
update the project budgets and managing
changes to the cost baseline updating
the budget involves recording actual
costs spent until date any increase to
the authorized budget can only be
approved through the perform integrated
change control process some of the
typical activities then happen as part
of the control cost process are ensuring
that cost expenditure
not exceed the authorized funding
monitor the cost performance to
understand variants and monitoring the
work performance against the funds
expended the inputs to the process our
project management plan organizational
process assets project funding
requirements and work performance data
work performance data contains the
information about the project progress
the important tools and techniques used
in controlling costs are earned value
analysis management forecasting to
complete performance index other
important aspects of controlling costs
are the review the performance analyze
the reserves to make sure the project
has enough budgetary reserves to meet
the expenses and project management
software which helps in tracking and
managing costs now let us look at the
output of this process the key outputs
of this process are work performance
information in terms of cost variance CV
schedule variance SV and earned value
evey and forecasts about the cost
performance this process may also result
in change requests arising out of cost
control measures as well as updates to
project documents the project management
plan and organizational process assets
business scenario based questions on
project cost control can be expected in
the exam so if you have questions on
these concepts get them cleared as that
will help you score higher in the next
screen let us learn about earned value
management and its related terms earned
value technique is an excellent way to
track the project progress against the
project plan it is a method of measuring
the project performance objectively and
comparing it against the project
baseline results from an earned value
analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule baselines
baseline is the initial approved value
along with approved changes therefore
scheduled baseline is the
first approved project scheduled along
with approved changes there are various
terms used in earned value technique
planned value is the authorized budget
assigned to the scheduled work earned
value is the work performed in terms of
budget authorized for that work actual
cost is the cost incurred and work
performed budgeted completion is the
budgeted amount for the total work
estimate at completion is the expected
total cost for the project estimate to
complete is the expected cost to finish
all the remaining project work variance
at completion is the projected budget
surplus or deficit at the end of the
project all the parameters displayed on
the screen are measured in terms of cost
you may come across business scenario
based questions on earned value
management in the PMP exam so ensure
that you develop a clear understanding
of this topic let us look at an example
of a planned value in the next screen
planned value is the estimated value of
the work planned this value is measured
in terms of currency say dollar if the
planned value is $340 then the work
planned is worth $340 how do you
calculate earned value the solution is
add the budget allocated to each of the
activities that have been completed at
the point of time the resulting value is
the earned value in the next screen let
us look at the formula used to calculate
earned value in cost variance negative
means the project is over budget
positive means the project is under
budget
similarly in schedule variance negative
means the project is behind schedule
whereas positive means the project is
ahead of schedule the value of the next
two parameters cost Performance Index
CPI and schedule Performance Index SPI
values vary between 0 and 1 for example
a CPI of 0.8 implies that 80 cents of
work is obtained for every dollar spent
in the project
similarly if SBI is 0.9 it implies that
project is progressing at only 90
percent of the speed originally planned
the next parameter is estimate at
completion or EAC
there are different ways of calculating
the EAC value the method used depends on
how the cost and schedule variances are
expected to play for the rest of the
project
BAC by CPI is used if you expect that
the current cost performance will
continue until the end of the project a
C+ BAC - Evi is used if you expect that
the rest of the project will be managed
at the budgeted rate a C+ BAC - Evi by
the product of CPI and SBI is used if
you want to factor in the impact of the
cost as well as scheduled variances AC +
e TC is used if you want to re-evaluate
the project based on a forecast value
for the estimated cost of the remainder
of the project the next parameter is
estimate to complete or e TC which is
the cost of project from this point to
the end this is calculated by
subtracting the actual cost from the
estimate and completion in addition
variant set completion can be calculated
by subtracting the estimated completion
from the budget at completion variance
at completion is the cost estimation
whether it is over or under budget
another parameter is the to complete
performance index or tcpi
this is the cost performance needed to
achieve a desired outcome for example if
the project needs to be managed to the
original budget BAC then tcpi that is
the CPI that must be maintained for the
rest of the project is calculated as BAC
- Evi by BAC - AC similarly if it has to
be managed within a revised target say
EAC then T CPI is calculated as BAC -
Evi by EA C -
see before the start of the PMP exam
please make a note of the formulas of
earned value technique in the next
screen let us look into a business
scenario to understand this concept
better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer let us take
the example of a software development
project there are four phases and each
phase takes a month to complete and is
expected to cost $10,000 the phases are
planned to be completed one after the
other the status of the project at the
end of the month 3 is summarized in the
table requirements definition is
completed and actual spending on this is
$10,000 architecture and design is done
and actual spending on this is $12,000
development and unit testing is only 50%
done though it was supposed to be
completed by 3rd month it has cost
$9,000 until date system testing and go
live has not yet started note s
indicates start time F indicates finish
time and PF indicates that it is partly
finished at the end of the month based
on the above information calculate the
CV SV CPI and SPI of the project let us
look at a solution in the next screen
before we end this lesson let us also
look at a few definitions that might be
useful for your PMP examination law of
diminishing return this means the more
you put into something the less you get
out of it for example doubling the
number of resources working on a project
will not necessarily have the time
working capital the amount of money the
company has to invest on the project and
the day to day company operations
funding limit reconciliation the process
of comparing the planned expenditure in
a given period with the available
funding for that period large assets
purchased by the company lose value over
time this is called depreciation there
are two forms of depreciation
straight-line and accelerated
same amount of depreciation is taken
every year for instance a car with a
price tag of $10,000 and useful life of
ten years is depreciated $1,000 per year
at the end of the tenth year the value
of the car is considered 0 for all
accounting purposes accelerated
depreciation depreciates faster than the
straight-line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of $10,000
depreciates $3,000
the first year 1500 the next year 1000
the third year and so on let us now
check your understanding of the topics
covered in this lesson here is a quick
recap of what was covered in this lesson
project cost management includes the
processes involved in estimating
budgeting and controlling costs so that
the project can be completed within the
approved budget cost management plan
contains details on how to plan manage
and control the project cost in relation
to the cost baseline and manage the cost
variances cost estimate is an educated
guess of how much an activity or project
will cost budget considers the cost
estimate and accordingly sets aside
funds for the completion of the project
under control account technique related
activities are clubbed and their costs
are managed as one unit the four project
cost management processes are plan cost
management estimate costs determine
budget control costs earned value
management technique indicates potential
deviation of the project from the cost
and/or scheduled baselines with this we
have come to the end of this lesson in
the next lesson we will discuss project
quality management
