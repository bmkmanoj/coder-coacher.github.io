consists of the following elements
Kartli depending on the review type
logging phase discussion phase and
decision phase during the login phase
the issues for example defects that have
been identified during the preparation
are mentioned page by page reviewer by
reviewer and are logged either by the
author or by a scribe every defect and
its severity should be logged the
participant who identifies a defect can
make recommendations about the defects
and defect handling in the decision
phase all marked issues are discussed
the final decision phase is the phase
where the decision is arrived different
types of reviews differ in their
approach on how to conduct the review
meeting while some reviews will follow a
round-robin pattern to record all issues
before any one issue is discussed other
reviews will leave it open to discuss
any specific issue as it is being
recorded such discussions need to be
moderated well to ensure that too much
time is not spent on discussing only one
issue rework based recommendations from
review meeting author of the document or
reviewed product need to fix the defect
and update the defect status accordingly
not every defect that is found leads to
rework it is the author's responsibility
to judge if a defect has to be fixed if
nothing is done about an issue for a
certain reason it should be reported to
at least indicate that the author has
considered the issue changes that are
made to the document should be easy to
identify during follow-up therefore the
author has to indicate where changes are
made for example using track changes in
word processing software
follow up the moderator is responsible
for ensuring that satisfactory actions
have been taken on all logged defects
process improvement suggestions and
change requests
although the moderator checks to make
sure that the author has taken action on
all known defects it is not necessary
for the moderator to check all the
corrections in detail if it is decided
that all participants will check the
updated document the moderator takes
care of the distribution and collects
the feedback moderator will gather
required metrics and evaluate if exit
criteria is met to close the action
