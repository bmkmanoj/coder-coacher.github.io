computing alone course by simply learn I
hope you had a chance to go through the
third part which was titled as implement
if not I would advise you to go through
the same as you would require the
knowledge of Amazon Web Services which
is discussed in this part this part is
titled as practice we will go through
the two exercises which will use Amazon
Web Services to solve real-world
business problems the practice part of
the day to session covers two different
cloud computing use cases as hands-on
exercises will first go through use case
one where we attempt to set up a static
website on amazon web services the
second use case will involve setting up
a highly available web application both
of the use cases take advantage of the
powerful amazon web services and the
cloud infrastructure it provides
let us start with the first use case
to set up a static website on Amazon Web
Services there are six steps to be
followed the first step requires us to
create an s3 bucket we will follow it up
with creating a simple website with one
HTML file and an embedded image next we
need to upload the HTML file and the
image to the s3 bucket once the files
are uploaded we will have to set public
access to the HTML file and the image we
will then configure the s3 bucket as a
website on doing so the s3 bucket will
be able to host the static site let us
now go through each step one by one
the first step is to create a bucket we
have already covered the basics of
creating a bucket earlier we named the
bucket as clowned workshop test website
we will create a simple HTML file we
will embed a sample image file
we now have to upload the created HTML
file and the sample image file to the s3
bucket
as everybody will access the HTML file
and the image we need to set them make
everything public option this option is
available under properties for each file
once the files are uploaded we require
configuring the bucket cloud workshop
test website containing the HTML file
and the image as web site we have to
also provide the index documents as
index dot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
