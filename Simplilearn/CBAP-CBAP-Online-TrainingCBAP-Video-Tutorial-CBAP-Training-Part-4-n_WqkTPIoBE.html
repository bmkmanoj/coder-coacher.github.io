of so to find a business analysis
professional cpap preparatory course
offered by simply learn in the first
module we covered the overview of the
cpap test we discussed planning the
analysis approach in the second module
we learnt about elicitation in the third
module in this module we'll discuss
requirements management and
communications this knowledge area
focuses on the project requirements
management to ensure that the important
elements of the project are up-to-date
prioritized and deliverable as a
solution as the project progresses
information uncovered may alter the need
which may necessitate new or additional
requirements to employ the solutions the
project team and stakeholders need to be
constantly updated communications helps
to ensure the right people are involved
in developing understanding and
approving the project requirements also
the requirements should be accessible
and managed during the requirements
development phase and the project
lifecycle let us look into the agenda of
this module in the next slide we will
start with finding out how to manage the
solution scope requirement next we will
discuss the ability to trace back to the
origins of the root of the findings this
is called traceability and inputs of the
solution scope management is the next
topic to be discussed this will be
followed by understanding how to manage
the requirement changes we will then
discuss how to prepare the requirements
package outside vendor requirements will
be dealt with next followed by
communicating requirements and approved
requirements traceability finally we
will look into a structured walkthrough
let us begin with managing the solution
scope requirements in the next slide
defining solutions and needs can be an
ongoing process that takes place at the
BA and project team drill downs in the
solutions to the defined needs as the
solution morphs or changes direction the
requirements to support the solutions
may also change
hence the requirements will
to be defined sometimes a requirement
for a solution may require outsourcing
or specialized equipment and can affect
the financial viability of the project
the project team does not want to
approach the sponsor with some new
costly requirement if all the possible
less costly requirements have not been
explored first hence there should be
constant documentation updating whenever
there are any changes in the need
solution requirement chain there should
be an ongoing management of the solution
scope to help keep track of the solution
scope at any point of time a baseline
description of the scope should be
documented this helps identify and track
the various changes and current status
of the solution scope and the
requirement if costly requirement
changes are needed written proof for the
additional man-hours or equipment will
make it easier to obtain the approval
when the solution scope has reached the
point where the key stakeholders and
SMEs agree that the solution and
associated requirements have been met an
approval from the sponsor or their
designated person will sign off the
current solution scope this does not
mean that the solution scope may not be
altered in the future however as a
matter of procedure before any actual
implementation takes place the
underlying blueprint for the solutions
and requirements must be signed off by
the appropriate authority this important
procedure can become a legal issue if
the project goes wrong the next slide
deals with traceability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
