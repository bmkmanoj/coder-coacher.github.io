in this slide let us discuss audit to
effectively govern an organization
audits and assurance are mandatory audit
is nothing but one of the methods to
provide assurance to all stakeholders
that all operational activities and
potential risks are tested and reviewed
audits are done on a periodic basis
across the organization
in cloud both internal and external
audits have important roles to play for
both consumer and cloud service provider
maintaining transparency right from the
initial stages of adapting to cloud is
necessary
an audit plan should be designed by the
senior management of the organization
regular audits of systems and controls
will be very helpful to maintain
efficiency audits are ideally plans that
act as a guideline enumerated the best
practices protocols and standards in an
organization
organizations use maturity models such
as CMM capability maturity model tqm
total quality management as frameworks
for analyzing process effectiveness
cloud uses a more revised and enhanced
approach instead of these frameworks in
the next slide we will discuss
recommendations
cloud providers are being involved
during an audit it would be appropriate
to use legal procurement and contract
teams from the customer end the standard
service might not necessarily include
compliance standards and negotiation as
needed special compliance standards are
needed for highly regulated industries
such as healthcare finance while using
cloud services organizations should
consider the potential risks involved
while using a distributed model as cloud
where the service providers might
operate from different geographic
locations analyze the current compliance
requirements and how it will be impacted
by using cloud services especially with
respect to information security some
policies that will be impacted are
reporting data retention testing of
controls and privacy policies the
controls vary with each deployment model
control rests with the consumer in IaaS
while control rests with the cloud
provider in SaaS it is important to
understand the contractual obligations
of parties involved
complies with laws is mandatory any
information that falls under the radar
of personal identifiable information PII
faces numerous compliance regulations
across the globe since cloud is designed
to be operated across different
geographies data might be stored
processed retrieved from multiple
locations
since cloud works on a distributed model
some compliance standards may be
difficult to achieve with it consumers
and cloud providers must come to terms
with each other on how to collect store
and share data for audit
in the next slide we will be dealing
with requirements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
