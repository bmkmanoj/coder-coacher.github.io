your seat please sir a very good morning
to all of you some of the delegates are
yet to come so but we will start off
because it's already 1030 and I would
like to thank VC circle for giving us
this opportunity where we couldn't have
you all as our guest it's an honor to be
your host and this session will be taken
forward by kashyap Talal who is our
chief product officer and he has joined

knowing a little bit of background about
him he comes from inkfruit and he was
the co-founder of eng fruit and he has
joined us as the chief product officer
before taking off this session i would
like to take you through a small
presentation which basically briefly
talks about simply learn
I would like to call upon kashyap belong
to deliver and then you actually just
open it down window very very you know
open discussion where all of your can
you know pitcher we would love to make
it more of a storm other than a one-way
talk from our side mi audible yeah I
believe it yeah so so give me this power
to give you a sense of Washington is
doing right now so that you know in a
sense we are on the same page and then
we treat this more like a brainstorm
where we talk about where the company
aspires to go from here and then love to
have your ideas questions you know
anything at all that you would like to
discuss so that all of us benefit from
it right so so we the startup
he respects of it will share what our
vision for the future is and then we
will just open it now tree to ignore
destruction word how we would get there
and they begin so we can answer
questions as well as we would love to
know your ideas and thoughts on in 20 so
like many a start-up simply learn
started small where Krishna was a
founder of simply learn actually
launched a dog training blog and PMP in
that Saudi entire you know the start of
the business happened within a few
months there were thousands of people
who had actually used that blog to train
for the PMP exam and I was great
response to it and as a result of which
it actually metamorphosed into more a
formal training business and it has
gained very very rapidly from then we're
starting with PMB we've diversified
across over 80 courses as we have today
and across different training types
online classroom like virtual classrooms
and so on a socialite's that's been
their journey and all of this has
happened in three short years so it's
been very very rapid in terms of
starting as a small raiding block to
reaching a scale we're simply none is
today one of the largest training
providers internationally for working
professionals right so so that's a bit
about how critical of the product right
now
we also have which is one of our using
Pakistan smoggy probably down to the
category sighs enduring formats
available extra meaner and you're
accessing scale across all the ways of
different markets online there are
people format so nicely packaged our
another perfect sir almost half of the
reverse of us is suing that sense is it
to be given of me we shall recover if
you can you move over the wind is what
if i said so what
it's a monster I'll think of business
whistling so when we basically have the
same time we produce a smooth
is a market and how we are meeting with
me every morning to be a lil bit awkward
for the vision sweater oh the visible
you want to be will always come here
not more than a selfie before you
consolidate that leadership and the
winner so that's what we aspire as I say
we just we are we are division oh I just
think how we get their money from Isaiah
this one if we win enough for any parts
missions so and they say I think we can
you go like a decision this is what you
see so does the company you have
how do you ever searched it whether sure
awesome also we have a failure
apparently we have 160 people already
working on the content of the process is
heavily in the removal as we first
reported by the exploit we're exiting
external 474 hydration us this will be
their muscle moves in teaching
it was done today with the subject
matter expert there are
whatever it is the quality
seems like your design so aluminum in
the saucer x.x opinion as a process and
university name oh we also create so i
guess but individual subject what is
relative what are the specific next in
the sense that you know is a multi
talented person
I am starving age looking red bush but I
aged me using the variables it wasn't
made me by doing the hustle
vs because if audiences that this was
her husband it's really not even the
name is one of very fun
so the services and status
also by this is assessing absolutely
bizarre do is to get a certification
from target that's differences how do
you this I'm name is any recipes and so
the other side I think they invaded by
most explicitly inefficient on a mission
field design moves are amazing for a
given investigating of information no
means I mean if you want to learn about
you know something like putting or using
Excel something that would severely
disagree simple but even being a concept
so on a second I'll uses an 80 foot
slightly and over there it's a challenge
to get angry I so the energy is actually
found a sexy cleaner superior poses are
also in acus the home collecting the
corner customers in terms of tools like
Coursera which are more
the business was going so it's not a bad
little full of emissions and
disappointed even win forward into Egypt
is a dissertation body to open it there
are critical say for example big nigga
as it is no
and the other is usability so even if
you see you at home only to B to B to C
platform what is it
he was of the app in pacifica busy he go
primarily beer song music mrs. but you
were here to play some poker so from
here
Oh
Oh something positive solutions from
we use so how you make that will see me
you see are we to be a DVD
because that are different prescription
based learning it's more generalized are
the main and only
cooperative
so are we
have to be a problem so what should you
actually believe it is a zoo
party store by yourself it is not
monitored
no further it's amazin starts observer
might work
PCCs
quickly was your content unless your
hand who teach with our CSS has to be
fuzzy final experience that viruses in
that when you have ten its operating
system to that one because of the
sometimes people with the process you
have only have a majority of the cases
because we have a certification it is
the rainy weather
we cannot claim that process it edited
by NDTV so that is absolutely
because they are people who have
actually having done that not just being
greedy wishes that process how we get
them I was it was it
you got the product
one probably languages was all the
second part is easy very nervous and how
easy they are super we
so you disagree
and
the expiry another person has is one of
you know into this product is amazing
exhale back so soon
awesome for me or
in one
not the actual usual
what single reason
so you actually enjoy the input to
decide which forces invade idea what
should
but choosing the product is something
alluring use the individual send
something
