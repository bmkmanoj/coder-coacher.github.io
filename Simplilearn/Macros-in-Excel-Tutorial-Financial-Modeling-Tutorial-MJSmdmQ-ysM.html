to a part one introduction to the use of
macros introduction hello and welcome to
module two a part 1 of the financial
modeling course by simply learn this
lesson is an introduction to the use of
macros macros are a very important part
of Excel workbooks macros are like short
programs that can allow ultimate eyes
some tasks in Excel or to perform some
more complicated calculations and
manipulations in Excel workbook this
presentation will give the reader the
basics about macros how to create one
using the Excel macro recorder function
or by coding the macro directly in VBA
at the end of this training one should
feel confident in using macros for
practical applications to financial
modeling now let's move on to our agenda
agenda we will start this presentation
by an introduction on how to write and
use macros will first learn how to write
a macro either directly using some VBA
coding or using the Excel macro
recording function we will then see how
a macro can be run either from the macro
menu in Excel or by linking the macro
name to an object in the Excel workbook
we will then wrap up this part with case
study 13 where we will apply our
knowledge through a practical example of
a macro for the pricing of a fixed
coupon bond our next part will then
focus on the use of cells and ranges in
Excel we will learn how to manipulate
ranges and cells in Excel tabs how to
work with arrays and finish this section
with case study 14 through which we will
learn how to apply a function to an
array the last part of this presentation
will then focus on the use of VB forms
for applications where the graphical
interface is important and the
formatting of inputs and outputs require
better control than on mere excel tabs
we will see how to output data on a vb
form instead of on excel tabs now let's
move on to our next slide and get
started
with this exciting presentation
writing and using macros macros are bits
of VBA code that can be executed like
small programs there are two types of
macros the first type of macros is
macros built as procedures of functions
by directly writing the VBA code
yourself the second type is for macros
that are recorded rather than written
directly the recording happens during
the Excel functionality of macro
recording writing a functional macro is
not done directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
