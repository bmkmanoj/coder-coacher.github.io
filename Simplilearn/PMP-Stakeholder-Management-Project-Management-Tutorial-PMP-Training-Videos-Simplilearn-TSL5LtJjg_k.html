course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project
stakeholder management there are 47
processes and project management grouped
into 10 knowledge areas and mapped to
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the 10th knowledge area
that is project stakeholder management
and its processes in the next screen let
us understand who stakeholders are a
stakeholder is anybody who has a stake
in the project a stakeholder may be an
individual a group or an organization
who may affect or be affected by or
perceived to be affected by a decision
activity or outcome of a project further
the nature of the impact can be positive
or negative thus giving rise to the
notion of positive or negative
stakeholders irrespective of whether a
stakeholder is positive or negative it
is important to engage with the
stakeholders and get them involved in
the project this can make a critical
difference to the success or failure of
the project a single disgruntled
stakeholder can bring the entire project
to its knees
whereas an actively engaged and
influential stakeholder can have the
opposite effect let us understand who
the common stakeholders of a project are
there are several categorizations of
stakeholders the project managers
themselves are important stakeholders
the project team members represent
stakeholders in the project the senior
management of the organization which is
working on the project has a stake in
the project the sponsor that is the
person or entity that provides the money
and resources for the project and
essentially champions the project is an
important stakeholder the customer which
may be different from the sponsor is a
stakeholder as well for instance and
many of the projects in the social
sector the sponsor may be the government
or a development agency whereas the
customers would be the people who
actually benefit from it the end-users
which may be different
from the customers or the sponsors our
stakeholders to the vendors or suppliers
who provide goods or services to the
project are important stakeholders
people whose lives may be impacted by
the output of the project are also
stakeholders for example if a highway
project requires possession of privately
owned land people whose land is being
taken away are the stakeholders if the
construction of a dam or water reservoir
benefits the downstream farming
communities they are the stakeholders
here competitors who provide alternative
goods or services are stakeholders -
sometimes environmentalists or other
social groups may become stakeholders
the government or political leadership
may become stakeholders for projects in
the public domain it is sufficient to
state that there could potentially be
hundreds of stakeholders for a large
project it is in the interest of the
project manager and the project team to
clearly identify all such stakeholders
up front and then actively manage them
throughout the project in the next
screen let us discuss the classification
models for stakeholder analysis not all
the stakeholders have the same amount of
influence or power over the project
therefore the way to manage each
stakeholder needs to be calibrated based
on a proper classification of the
stakeholders this is the role of the
classification model you can come up
with a grid that maps the power of the
stakeholders the interest they have the
influence they may have or the impact
that they can have on the project
through the power interest power
influence or influence impact grids it
can be represented by mapping
stakeholders to a power or interest grid
the diagram on the screen has x-axis
which represents interest level and
y-axis which represents the power level
based on the various combinations of
power levels and interest levels the
grid can be divided into four quadrants
the stakeholders on the top right
quadrant with high power and high
interest need to be managed closely that
is you have to monitor their involvement
and engagements very closely the
stakeholders on the bottom right
quadrant with high interest but
low-power need to be kept in the loop
that is you should share information
with them and keep them regularly
informed the stakeholders on the top
left quadrant with high power but low
interest can be managed by keeping them
happy for example by making sure that
their interests and opinions are taken
into consideration the stakeholders on
the left bottom quadrant with low power
and low interest may be managed less
actively by simply monitoring how things
are going with them the salience model
describes classes of stakeholders based
on their power ability to impose their
will
urgency need for immediate attention and
legitimacy appropriateness of their
involvement level this is a useful
framework to guide the stakeholder
management strategy on a project
practice creating power grids for
business scenarios this will help in
understanding the level of engagement a
project manager needs to maintain with
various stakeholders in the next screen
let us discuss the stakeholder
engagement assessment matrix the
stakeholder engagement assessment matrix
allows visualizing the current and
desired states of a stakeholders
involvement in the project the five
levels of involvement are as unaware
resistant neutral supportive and leading
unaware is where the stakeholder is not
aware of the project or its impact
resistant is where the stakeholder is
aware of the impacts and is resistant to
change
neutral is where the stakeholder is
aware of the project and is neither
supportive nor in opposition to the
project supportive is where the
stakeholder is aware of the project and
its impact and is supportive of the
change leading is where the stakeholder
is aware of the project and impacts and
is actively engaged to ensure that the
project is successful let us now look at
the matrix the table has one row per
stakeholder identified you place C in
the column which best indicates the
current level of engagement for that
stakeholder then you place D in the
column which best indicates the desired
state of engagement this table can be a
quick visualization to
that helps understand where work has to
be done in the stakeholder management
activities in the next screen let us
discuss the skills required for
stakeholder management stakeholder
management is both an art and a science
since it involves dealing with people
and people are inherently nonlinear and
unpredictable there is no one size that
fits all strategies or tools that will
work while managing them however a
project manager may use a few traits and
techniques while managing stakeholders
which are classified as interpersonal
skills and managerial skills a project
manager must possess good interpersonal
skills that is must invest the time and
energy to build trust this involves
multiple things such as establishing a
personal rapport following through on
commitments being punctual etc once the
trust is established it helps in
smoothing many difficult bends conflict
management is an important skill for a
project manager while communicating with
stakeholders the project manager must
practice active listening
they must not assume that they have all
the answers instead they should spend
some time to understand the issues and
the stakeholders points of view this
alone can go a long way in smoothing
ruffled feathers and building
constructive relationships resistance to
change is natural a project manager must
know how to convert that into a positive
energy in its favour managerial skills
that may help in accomplishing the
project objectives a project manager
must be able to build consensus among
the group while absolute uniformity may
not always be possible or desirable the
project manager must use techniques to
ensure widespread discussions and arrive
at a path that the group can buy into
the project manager must be able to
influence people often without
necessarily being in the position of
authority the project manager must be
skillful to negotiate agreements the
project manager must be able to
understand and modify organizational
behavior in order to move the project in
a certain direction
