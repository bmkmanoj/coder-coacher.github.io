topic 1 software development security
introduction hello and welcome to lesson
6 of the CISSP
certification course by simply learn
this lesson is about software
development security software
development security is one of the 10
domains of the common body of knowledge
cbk for the CISSP certification exam
software development security domain
refers to the controls that are included
within systems and application software
and the steps used in their development
for example SDLC software refers to
system software operating systems and
application programs such as agents
applets software databases data
warehouses and knowledge-based systems
these applications may be used in
distributed or centralized environment
software development security involves
processes and activities regarding the
planning programming and management of
software and systems somewhat
recursively the field also deals with
those controls that may be installed
within software systems to ensure the
confidentiality integrity and
availability of either the software or
the data and the processing in addition
this domain concentrates on concepts
involved in databases and database
management and web applications because
database applications are a major and
unique field of applications and systems
and the world wide web is ubiquitous and
widely used interface to all manners of
systems and is particularly widely used
for access to a variety of public
database applications as well as
discussing the proper and secure means
of designing and controlling
applications we also review maliciously
created software or malware objectives
according to the ISC to candidate
information bulletin a cissp candidate
is expected to understand the security
and controls of the systems the
development process systems lifecycle
application controls change controls
data warehousing data mining knowledge
based systems program interfaces and
concepts used to ensure data and
application integrity security and
availability agenda the agenda for this
lesson is as follows we begin this
lesson with the introduction of system
environment this will be followed by
system lifecycle and systems development
objective oriented programming and
software security and the Shu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
