able to define Kafka describe some use
cases for Kafka describe the Kafka data
model describe Kafka architecture list
the types of messaging systems explain
the importance of brokers Kafka is a
high-performance real-time messaging
system it is an open-source tool and is
a part of Apache projects the
characteristics of Kafka are Kafka is a
distributed and partitioned messaging
system that is highly fault tolerant and
scalable it has been tested to process
and send millions of messages per second
to several receivers Apache copter was
originally developed by LinkedIn to
handle their log files and later handed
over to the open source community in
early 2011 it became a main Apache
project in October 2012 a stable Apache
kafka version 0.8 to zero was released
in February 2015 and a stable Apache
kafka version 0.8.1
was released in May 2015 which is the
latest version Kafka can be used for
various purposes in an organization such
as messaging service millions of
messages can be sent and received in
real-time real-time stream processing
Kafka can be used to process a
continuous stream of information in real
time and pass data to stream processing
systems such as storm log aggregation
can be used to collect physical log
files from multiple systems and store it
in essential location such as HDFS
commit log service Kafka can be used as
an external commit log for distributed
systems event sourcing a time ordered
sequence of events can be maintained
through Kafka Kafka can be used to
aggregate user activity data such as
clicks navigation and searches from
different websites of an organization
such users activities can be sent to a
real-time monitoring system and Hadoop
system for offline processing an example
is illustrated in the image the
information from customer-facing portals
are sent in real time to the concur
cluster the Kafka cluster consists of
one or more servers that process the
messages in parallel the information is
sent to a real-time monitoring system to
monitor the user clicks navigation and
searches the information is also saved
in a hadoop system for offline
processing the Kafka data model consists
of messages and topics messages
represent information such as lines in a
log file a row of stock market data or
an error message from a system messages
are grouped into categories called
topics for example log message and stock
message the processors that publish
messages into a topic in Kafka are known
as producers the processes that receive
the messages from a topic in Kafka are
known as consumers the processes or
servers within Kafka that process the
messages are known as brokers a Kafka
cluster consists of a set of brokers
that process the messages the image
illustrates the Kafka data model it
shows a Kafka cluster that consists of
three brokers there are two producers
sending messages to the Kafka cluster
and to consumers receiving the messages
from the cluster producer one creates
messages for topic one for as producer
two sends messages for topic two these
messages are processed by the three
brokers in parallel and sent to the
consumers consumer one is interested in
topic two so it receives the messages
for topic 2
similarly consumer 2 is interested in
topic 1 so it receives the messages for
topic 1 the brokers in the Kafka cluster
handled a process of receiving storing
and forwarding the messages to the
interested consumers a topic is a
category of messages in Kafka the
producers publish the messages in two
topics and the consumers read the
messages from topics a topic is divided
into one or more partitions a partition
is also known as a commit log each
partition contains an ordered set of
messages each message is identified by
its offset in the partition messages are
added at one end of the partition and
consumed at the other the image
illustrates a topic simple that is
divided into two partitions the writes
are completed at one end and the reads
are completed at the other it shows six
messages in partition zero and five
messages in partition 1 the offset of
message one in partition zero is zero as
it is the first message the offset of
message six in partition zero is five
the messages are written in the order
one two three four five and six whereas
they are read in the same order as one
two three four five and six the next
message in partition zero will be
message 7 which will be written at
offset six the next message for
partition one will be message six which
will be written at offset five topics
are divided into partitions which are
the unit of parallelism and Kafka
partitions allow messages in a topic to
be distributed to multiple servers or
brokers so that the messages in a topics
can be processed in parallel a topic can
have any number of partitions each
partition should fit in a single Kafka
server the number of partitions in a
topic decide the parallelism of the
topic the image illustrates two
partitions of a topic simple partition
zero consists of six messages whereas
partition 1 consists of five messages
part
can be distributed across the kafka
cluster each caucus server or broker may
handle one or more partitions the
partition can be replicated across
several servers for fault tolerance one
server is marked as a leader for the
partition and the others are marked as
followers the leader controls the read
and write for the partition whereas the
followers replicate the data if a leader
failed one of the followers
automatically become the leader
zookeeper is used for the leader
selection as explained in the previous
lesson the image illustrates the
partition of a topic simple here the
partition 0 is assigned to server 1 and
partition 1 is assigned to server 2
these servers process the messages in
parallel to increase throughput the
producer is the creator of the message
in Kafka producers place the message to
a particular topic and decide what
partition to place the message into for
example a producer may place a message
into partition 0 of topic simple another
producer may place a message into
partition 1 of topic simple topics
should already exist before a message is
placed by the producer messages are
added at one end of the partition by
kafka the image illustrates a producer
that creates three messages and sends
them to different topics and partitions
in Kafka message one is sent to
partition 0 of topic test one message 2
is sent to partition 1 of topic test 1
and message 3 is sent to partition 0 of
topic test 2 the consumer is the
receiver of the message in Kafka each
consumer belongs to a consumer group a
consumer group may have one or more
consumers the consumers specify what
topics they want to listen to a message
is sent to all the consumers in a
consumer group the consumer groups are
used to control the messaging system the
image illustrates the three consumer
groups they are consumer group one
consumer group two and a consumer group
three the consumer Group one consists of
three consumers called consumer one
consumer two and consumer three the
consumer group two consists of two
consumers called
were for and consumer v the consumer
group 3 consists of a single consumer
called consumer six Kafka architecture
consists of brokers that take messages
from the producers and add to a
partition of a topic brokers provide the
messages to the consumers from the
partitions the producers create the
messages and send them to a particular
topic and a partition of a Kafka cluster
the topic is divided into multiple
partitions the messages are added to the
partitions at one end and consumed in
the same order each partition acts as a
message queue consumers are divided into
consumer groups each message is
delivered to one consumer in each
consumer group zookeeper is used for
coordination among the kafka brokers the
image illustrates the Kafka architecture
that consists of two partitions called
partition one and partition two the two
producers are sending messages to the
two brokers in the cluster the brokers
add the messages to the partitions and
the messages are taken from the
partitions in the same order as
insertion the messages are sent to two
consumer groups the image also
illustrates that the Kafka cluster or
brokers interact with zookeeper for
distributed coordination Kafka
architecture supports two types of
messaging systems known as published
subscribe and queue system the publish
subscribe system is also called pub/sub
in this system one system broadcasts the
messages and the consumers subscribed to
receive the messages each message is
received by all the subscribers so if
there are 100 messages published each
subscriber receives all the 100 messages
in the same order that they are produced
in the queue system each message has to
be consumed by only one consumer if
there are multiple consumers each
message is consumed by any one of the
available consumers in the same order
that they are received the image
illustrates the implementation of a cue
system consumer one consumer two and
consumer three belong to the same
consumer group so out of the six
messages two messages are received by
consumer one
messages by consumer two and two
messages by consumer three note that the
messages are received in the same order
that they are produced so consumer one
receives message one consumer two
receives message two and consumer three
receives message three after this
consumer one receives message for
consumer two receives message five and
consumer three receives message six the
image illustrates the implementation of
a publish/subscribe system consumer one
consumer two and consumer three belong
to three separate consumer groups so all
the six messages are sent to all the
three consumer groups called consumer
group one consumer group two and
consumer group three since there is only
one consumer end consumer Group one it
receives all the six messages in the
order one two three four five and six
similarly consumer two and consumer
three also receive all the six messages
in the same order brokers are there
Kafka processes that process the
messages in Kafka each machine in the
cluster can run one broker the brokers
coordinate among each other using
zookeeper one broker acts as a leader
for a partition and handles the delivery
and persistence whereas the others
actives followers brokers receive the
message from the producer and send it to
the consumer groups Kafka guarantees the
following guarantee one message is sent
by a producer to a topic and the
partition are appended in the same order
this ensures that the message is
produced earlier do not get ahead of the
messages produced later the time order
is maintained very strictly guarantee to
a consumer instance gets the messages in
the same order as they are produced
which means that the messages are never
out of order if the messages are
produced in the order one two three four
five six they will be received in the
order one two three four five and six
this is important in messaging systems
as the dependency is on the time order
of messages guarantee three the topic
with replication factor in tolerates up
to n minus one server failures for
example when the replication factor is
specified
there will be no loss of messages even
if two machines fail LinkedIn or the
website w-l-k-y-dot-com is the largest
network of professionals and is the
originator of Kafka coffee is used by
LinkedIn to manage streams of
information some of the uses of Kafka at
LinkedIn are as follows monitoring Kafka
is used to collect metrics from various
systems and to create monitoring
dashboards messaging Kafka is used as
message queues for content feeds and as
published subscribe system for searches
analytics Kafka is used to collect page
views and clicks from customer facing
websites and to store the information
into a central Hadoop based analytic
system a building block for distributed
applications Kafka is used as a building
block for distributed applications and
for building distributed databases and
distributed log systems Kafka uses the
primary backup method of replication in
primary backup method one machine or one
replica is called a leader and is chosen
as the primary the remaining machines or
replicas are chosen as the followers and
act as backups the leader propagates the
rights to the followers and wait until
the rites are completed on all the
replicas if a replica is down it is
skipped for the right however copier
will write a copy to the machine once it
is back if the leader fails one of the
followers will be chosen as the new
leader this mechanism can tolerate n
minus one failures if the replication
factor is in which can be specified at
the topic level persistence means a
message can be delivered even if the
machine that handles the message fails
qapla uses the Linux file system for
persistence of messages persistence
ensures no messages are lost coptor
relies on the filesystem page cache for
fast reads and writes all the data is
immediately written to a file in a file
system so that they can be recovered
even if the machine fails
messages are grouped as message sets for
more efficient writes message sets can
be compressed to reduce network
bandwidth a standardized binary message
format is used among producers brokers
and consumers to minimize data
modification here is a quick recap of
what we have learned in this lesson
Kafka is a high performance real-time
messaging system
Kafka can be used as an external commit
log for distributed systems
kafka data model consists of messages
and topics Kafka architecture consists
of brokers that take messages from the
producers and add to a partition of a
topic Kafka architecture supports two
types of messaging system called publish
subscribe and queue system brokers are
