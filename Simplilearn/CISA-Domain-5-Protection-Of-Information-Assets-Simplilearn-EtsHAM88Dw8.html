understand the techniques for the design
implementation and monitoring of
security controls including security
awareness programs security needs to be
aligned with business objectives to
provide reasonable reduction in risk
security objectives may include the
following ensure the continued
availability of information systems
ensure the integrity of information
stored on its computer systems and
security while the information is in
transit preserve the confidentiality of
sensitive data while stored and in
transit ensure compliance with
applicable laws regulations and
standards
let us continue discussing design
implementation and monitoring of
security controls in the next screen
ensure adherence to trust in obligation
requirements for any information assets
accordance with the applicable privacy
policy or privacy laws and regulations
prudence in application of controls is
important because controls entail a cost
either directly or indirectly by
impacting on business operations the
business impact analysis BIA is the
process used to establish the material
adverse events the business should be
worried about the following screen lists
the main areas to be covered under this
knowledge statement the main areas to
cover here are key elements of
information security management critical
success factors to information security
inventory and classifications of
information assets network
infrastructure security in the next
screen we will learn about information
security management effective is M is
the most critical factor in protecting
information assets and privacy the
factors that raise the profile of
information and privacy risk include
electronic trading through service
and directly with customers loss of
organizational barriers through use of
remote access facilities and
high-profile security exposures viruses
denial of service do s attacks
intrusions unauthorized access
disclosures and identity theft over the
internet etc let us continue discussing
information security management is M in
the next screen security awareness and
education through training and regular
updates written policies and procedures
and updates non-disclosure statements
signed by employees newsletters webpages
videos and other media visible
enforcement of security rules simulated
security incidents and simulated drills
rewards for reporting suspicious events
periodic audits monitoring and
compliance control includes an element
of monitoring and usually relates to
regulatory legal compliance incident
handling and response in the next few
screens we will learn about roles and
responsibilities under the information
security management the security
objectives to meet business requirements
are to ensure continued availability of
information systems to ensure integrity
of information stored in systems and
while in transit to preserve
confidentiality of sensitive data to
ensure conformity to applicable laws
regulations and standards to ensure
adherence to trust and obligation
requirements to ensure protection of
sensitive data data integrity as it
relates to security objectives generally
refers to accuracy completeness
consistency or neutrality validity and
verifiability of the data once loaded on
the system integrity refers to
reliability of data let us continue
discussing information security
management is M in the next screen the
key elements of is M
senior management commitment and support
the risk management begins at the top
policies and procedures the framework
that captures top management declaration
of direction organization clearly
defined in allocated roles and
responsibilities supplemented with
guidance usually relates to regulatory
legal compliance
let us continue discussing information
security management is M in the next
screen roles and responsibilities must
be defined documented and communicated
to personnel and management is security
steering committee is represented by
individuals from various management
levels it also discusses and approves
security policies guidelines and
procedures with input from end-users
executive management auditors security
administration is personnel and legal
counsel the committee is formally
established with appropriate terms of
reference executive management
responsible for the overall protection
of information assets and issuing and
maintaining the policy framework
security advisory group is responsible
for defining information risk management
process and acceptable level of risk and
reviewing security plans it is comprised
of people involved in the business and
provides comments on security issues to
chief security officer CSO it also
advises the business whether the
security programs meet business
objectives chief information security
officer C ISO is a senior level
corporate official responsible for
articulating and enforcing policies used
to protect information assets he has a
much broader role than CSO who is
normally only responsible for physical
security within the organization
information asset owners and data owners
are entrusted with the responsibility
for the owned asset including
performance of a risk assessment
selection of appropriate controls to
mitigate the risk
and to accept the residual risk process
owners insurance security measures
consistent with organizational policy
are maintained users comply with
procedures set out in the security
policy and adhere to privacy and
security regulations often specific to
sensitive data for example health legal
finance etc chief privacy officer CP o
is a senior level corporate official and
is responsible for articulating and
enforcing policies used to protect
customers and employees privacy rights
external parties follow procedures set
out in the security policy they adhere
to privacy and security regulations oven
specific to sensitive data for example
health legal finance etc information
security administrator is a staff level
position he is responsible for providing
adequate physical and logical security
for is programs data and equipment
normally guided by the information
security policies security specialists
and advisers assist with the design
implementation management and review of
security policies standards and
procedures IT developer's implements
information security within their
applications is auditors provide
independent assurance on appropriateness
and effectiveness of information
security objectives and controls related
to these objectives in the next screen
we will learn about system access
permissions system access permission is
the ability to do something with a
computer resource read create modify or
delete a file or data execute a program
or use an external connection it is
controlled at the physical and/or
logical level logical controls govern
access to information and programs it is
built into operating systems invoked
through access control software and
incorporated in application programs DBS
network control devices and utilities
as continue discussing system access
permissions in the next screen physical
controls restrict entry and exit of
personnel movement of equipment and
media they include badges memory cards
keys and biometrics access is granted on
a documented need-to-know basis with
legitimate business requirement based on
least privilege and unsegregated duties
principles access principles relate to
four layers of security namely network
platform typically the operating system
database and application in the next
screen we will learn about mandatory and
discretionary access controls the
mandatory access controls ma C's are
logical access controls ma C's that
cannot be modified by normal users or
data owners they act by default and are
used to enforce critical security
without possible exception only
administrators can grant a right of
access guided by an established policy
of the organization discretionary access
controls da C's controls may be
configured or modified by the users or
data owners access may be activated or
modified by a data owner da C's cannot
override MA CAS and they act as
additional filters to restrict access
further in the next few screens we will
learn about privacy management issues
and role of is auditors privacy issues
relates to personally identifiable
information for example personal
identification number then regulations
generally restrict use of such data by
giving the subject individual rights to
access and correct that data it also
governs how such data is obtained
requiring knowledge and consent of the
data subject impact of risks including
marketing risks transported data flow
and variations in regulations and may
require privacy experts during risk
assessment the goals of a privacy impact
assessment are ID
the nature of personally identifiable
information relating to business
processes documenting the collection use
disclosure storage and destruction of
personally identifiable information
providing management with an
understanding of privacy risk and
options to mitigate this risk ensuring
accountability for privacy and
facilitating compliance with relevant
regulations is audit considerations
relating to privacy include adequacy of
privacy assessment for example
compliance with privacy policy
laws and other regulations and the
manner in which IT is used for
competitive game another consideration
is the ongoing assessments conducted
when new products services systems
operations processes and third parties
are under consideration
besides transporter and multinational
laws should also be considered focus and
extent of privacy impact assessment may
depend on changes in technology
processes or people as shown below in
the next few screens we will learn about
information security and external
parties human resources security and
third parties security roles and
responsibilities of employees
contractors and third party users should
be defined and documented in accordance
with the organizational security policy
information security policies to guide
employees contractors and third party
users information security and external
parties security of information and
processing facilities must be maintained
when external party services or products
are introduced controls must be agreed
to and defined in a formal agreement
organization must have right to audit
the implementation and operations
external party arrangements include
Service Providers ISPs network providers
manage security services customers
outsourcing facilities and/or operations
IT systems data collection services
management and business consultants and
auditors developers and suppliers
cleaning catering and other outsoar
Support Services others include
temporary personnel student placement
another casual short-term appointments
the risks related to external party
access is information processing
facilities required to be accessed by
external parties these types of access
include physical access logical access
network connectivity organization and
external party value and sensitivity of
information involved and its criticality
for business operations and legal and
other regulatory requirements security
in relation to customers involve
identifying security requirements for
customers access the customer access
security considerations asset protection
description of product or service to be
provided reasons requirements and
benefits for customer access access
control policy arrangements for
reporting notification and investigation
of information inaccuracies target
levels of service and unacceptable
levels of service right to monitor and
revoke any activity related to an
organization's assets intellectual
