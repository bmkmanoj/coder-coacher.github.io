based security service there are various
security concerns surrounding the
service such as compliance multi-tenancy
and vendor lock-in the security and
cloud environment revolves around the
visibility of the security controls
implemented unlike traditional data
centers in cloud it is not locked down
and this is a constant worry the
providers of security is a service
understand this and run extensive
physical and personal security checks
the providers of security as a service
also take significant steps in adhering
to policies and compliances they
identify the legal and regulatory
formalities for each jurisdiction and
work accordingly with the consumer the
SLA document discusses all the
regulatory components as well
multi-tenancy being a unique
characteristic of cloud also poses
problems
the providers of security as a service
take significant measures to ensure
anonymizing and compartmentalizing the
data to protect the identity and the
source in the next slide we will discuss
the advantages of implementing security
as a service security as a service
offers various benefits such as
aggregation of knowledge broad
actionable intelligence and having
various security professionals at any
given time the organizations which
actively promote the concept of
centralizing security gain long-term
benefits in terms of cost and efficiency
of their system organizations that
employ service providers enjoy
competitive edge as they have an early
access to information this is helpful in
understanding the risk proposition of a
given IT strategy most of the time the
third-party vendors are used to report
on regulatory compliance and any legal
obligations connected to data and
identity this can save the company from
any unwanted litigation also third-party
providers provide assurance as per their
SLA which leads to better relationship
between clients in the next slide we
will discuss different services
categorized as security as a service
the implementers should ensure secure
communication channels between the
tenant and the consumer the providers
should supply automated secure and
continuous notification throughout the
supply chain on a need-to-know basis the
providers should supply secured logging
of internal operations for SLA
compliance the consumers should request
addition of third-party audit and SLA
mediation services now that we have come
to the end of this module let's do a
recap we learnt about ubiquity of
security as a service we also discuss
the different concerns and advantages in
its implementation we discuss the
different services categorized as
security as a service lastly we
understood the recommendations for
implementing cloud-based security models
this brings us to the end of this course
