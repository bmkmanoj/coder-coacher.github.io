comes to IT services what exactly is
value also to keep in mind value of
something intangible such as service is
hard to quantify value is defined not
only strictly in terms of the customers
business outcomes it is also highly
dependent on customers perceptions there
are two key elements which combine to
provide value to services utility or
what the customer gets and warranty or
how it is delivered utility is perceived
by the customer from the attributes of
the service that have a positive effect
on the performance of tasks associated
with desired outcomes removal or
relaxation of constraints on performance
is also perceived as a positive effect
it means if we are able to support the
performance of customer services or
remove the challenges at the customer
end the service utility is on the higher
side the customer would treat the
service utility as high as the service
is meeting the customer needs meaning it
is fit for purpose in short it is a
services fitness for purpose which
defines the utility of a service so if
you want to use email as a service the
ability of the service to allow you to
send and receive email is utility
warranty is derived from the positive
effect of being available when needed
insufficient capacity or magnitude and
dependable in terms of continuity and
security it is the services fitness for
use so if the email service is available
twenty-four-seven it's secure enough
that nobody hacks into your account and
so on is warranty utility and warranty
go hand-in-hand customers cannot benefit
from a service that is fit for
purpose but not fit for use and vice
versa we may have services with high
utility and low warranty or services
with low utility and high warranty
depending on the customer needs but
there cannot be services with either
just utility or just warranty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
