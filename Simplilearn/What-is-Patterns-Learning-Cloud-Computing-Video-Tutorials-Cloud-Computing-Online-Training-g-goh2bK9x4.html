cloud computing elearning course by
simply learn I hope you had a chance to
go through the first part which was
titled understand the cloud if not I
would advise you to go through the same
as you'd require the knowledge of cloud
to understand the patterns which is
discussed in this part this part is
titled as patterns will attempt to
unravel the need for varied cloud
providers bring out the technical and
business aspects of adoption we will
also look at a basic cloud fitment study
aimed to make easy for you to find the
right provider for the business problem
let us move on to the next slide
the patterns part of the day to session
is divided into two sections we will now
look at the first section on finding out
how cloud providers fit in we will first
start with fitment study wherein we look
at the key motivations to adopt I as
pious and science next we will find out
how to select a right provider for the
business we will end this section
looking at some sample problem solution
views the problem solution will cover
two important questions around cloud
services and the solutions around them
let us start with fitment study of cloud
providers first we will learn about when
do we require is
the first question to ponder upon in the
fitment study is when do we require is
we will look at the circumstances that
require a customer to evaluate and
eventually adopt is as the solution the
first factor in deciding the use of is
is high latency in traditional
infrastructure provisioning
traditionally any requests for hardware
is a tedious process and involves
consistent delays across all levels of
the approval in one study it was found
that the delay can be as bad as four to
five weeks and this depends on the type
of infrastructure requested not only is
this a critical waste of business time
it slows down the organization
infrastructure as a service provider can
provision a running instance in less
than two minutes in most cases the
consumer can also request for as many
number of infrastructure as required
this is indeed an incredible opportunity
for IT to react as business grows the
next point which needs to be taken into
consideration is existing hardware
unable to take upload upfront capability
planning fails to deliver as the
business grows and new stakeholders are
added this is an industry-wide problem
when the time comes to scaling the
infrastructure internal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
