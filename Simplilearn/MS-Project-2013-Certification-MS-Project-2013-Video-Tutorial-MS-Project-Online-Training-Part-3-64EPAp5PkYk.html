manually scheduled tasks and auto
scheduled tasks in this slide a task can
be scheduled manually or automatically
when you enter a new task it is added as
a manual task by default in the case of
manually scheduled tasks you need to
enter the duration and start date of the
task the finish date is calculated
according to the duration entered
manually scheduled tasks can be used
when a task has specific requirements
with respect to dates you can manually
schedule tasks in order to accomplish
the date specific requirements and later
switch to the auto schedule in the case
of auto scheduled tasks you need to
enter the duration of the task the start
and finish dates are calculated
automatically the start date of the
first task is by default set as the
project start date it is ideal to enter
task duration instead of start or finish
dates to appreciate the auto scheduling
features as the project manager
continues to enter more tasks linked
them and assign resources the start and
finish dates in the project plan get
adjusted automatically if the project
manager directly edits the duration
start date or finish date of an
automatically scheduled task the task
will switch to a manual schedule mode in
the next slide we will learn about the
project outline
while creating a task list the project
manager can create a project outline by
grouping tasks tasks are grouped as
summary tasks and subtasks the
screenshot of software development
project is displayed as an example on
this slide related tasks are grouped
under an appropriate title this title is
called a summary task in Microsoft
Project 2013 summary tasks are easily
recognized as they are in bold a summary
task encapsulate the details of all its
subtasks
a summary task consists of several
subtasks in Microsoft Project 2013
subtasks are indented below the summary
task that they belong to the expand or
collapse arrow next to a summary task
can be used to expand or collapse the
outline Microsoft Project 2013
automatically generates the project
summary task however it does not display
the project summary task by default in
the next slide we will discuss how to
create task dependencies with links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
