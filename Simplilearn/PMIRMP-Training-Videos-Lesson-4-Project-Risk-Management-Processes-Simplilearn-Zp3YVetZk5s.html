management Institute's risk management
professional certification preparatory
course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will understand the processes
carried out during the project risk
management let us look into the
objectives of this lesson in the next
screen after completing this lesson you
will be able to define project risk
management explain project management
identify project risk management
processes in the next screen let us
begin with project risk management
project risk management includes the
processes of conducting risk management
planning identification analysis
response planning and controlling risk
on a project it has been mentioned in
practice standard for project risk
management that project risk management
aims to identify and prioritize risks
and advance of their occurrence and
provide action-oriented information to
project managers project risk management
is an integral part of the project
management it provides an approach
through which uncertainty can be
understood assessed and managed within
the projects effective project risk
management is essential for the success
of a project let us discuss the inter
dependencies between project risk
management and project management in the
following screen when you say risk
management is an integral part of
project management it means that they
are dependent on each other the output
of many projects management processes
can be considered as an input for risk
management and vice versa for example by
getting the information about the
project progress in terms of schedule
you realize that it is not in line with
the expected progress which can become a
risk for the project so risk management
plays an important role to decide what
response must be given or what actions
are to be taken
similarly based on the response of risk
management the project management plan
with respect to the deliverable will
change as you already know all the
projects have uncertainty project
management can be seen as an attempt to
control this uncertain environment
through the use of structured techniques
like estimating planning cost control
activity allocation earned value
analysis monitoring and review meetings
project risk management provides an
approach by which uncertainty can be
understood assessed and managed within
projects so effective project management
is a critical success factor for project
success let us continue this discussion
on project risk management and project
management in the next screen the
management or project manager should not
look at project risk management as an
optional activity or overhead the
interface between project risk
management's and other processes of
project management must be cleared to
address the uncertainty the outputs of
project risk management should be
considered within the project management
processes they can impact various
aspects like estimating resources cost
or duration assessing the impact of
scope changes resource allocation and
project progress reports to the
stakeholders the effectiveness of
project management process is increased
by using the information and results
from project risk management on the
other hand some of the outputs of other
project management processes such as
work breakdown structure WBS estimation
of schedule and cost and the sumption x'
are important prerequisites for project
risk management let us first discuss how
we can make risk management process
effective in the next screen you make
risk management more successful
effective or
consistent by using processes
methodologies or a set of activities
however before using these processes you
should keep some points in mind risk
management process should be scalable to
meet different elements like available
resources methodology and processes used
tools and techniques used supporting
infrastructure review and update
frequency and reporting requirements it
is important to have a clear
understanding of the risk threshold that
defines the views of key stakeholders on
acceptable levels of risk it is equally
important to identify the framework to
manage the risk starting from the
initiation stage to its successful
implementation project risk management
activities resources and attention
should be appropriated to the project
since different projects warrants
different levels of risk management
application some of the actions required
for tailoring are defining objectives
against which risks will be identified
defining how the elements like resources
methodologies tools infrastructure and
communication are scalable for the
project and defining risk thresholds
tolerances and the assessment of
framework the outputs should be
documented communicated reviewed to
ensure common understanding of the scope
and objectives for the project risk
management processes in this screen we
will look into the high level activities
carried out in the six project risk
management processes the first process
is planned risk management in this
process you define the scope and
objectives of the project risk
management processes the key output of
this process is the project risk
management plan the second process is
identify risks in this process you
identify maximum possible
known risks you will be focusing on the
tools and techniques used in the process
of identifying risks the key output is
the risk register the third process is
perform qualitative risk analysis this
process is about prioritizing risks and
ranking them as high medium and low for
further action the focus will be on
tools used to prioritize risks the
fourth process is perform quantitative
risk analysis in this process you
evaluate the combined effect of risks on
the overall project outcome the risks
are quantified numerically the fifth
process is planned risk responses this
process helps us determine appropriate
response strategies and actions for each
individual risk and for overall project
risk and integrates them into overall
project management plan the sixth and
last process is control risks this
process focuses on implementing risk
response plans tracking identified risks
monitoring residual risks identifying
new risks and evaluating risk process
effectiveness throughout the project in
the next screen we will look into the
flow of all these six processes and how
it works logically here is a quick recap
of what was covered in this lesson
project risk management and project
management provides an approach through
which uncertainty can be understood
assessed and managed within the
project's risk management can be
effective by using processes or
methodologies or a set of activities
project risk management has six
processes plan risk management identify
risks perform qualitative risk analysis
perform quantitative risk analysis plan
risk responses
and control risks this concludes an
introduction to project risk management
processes the next lesson covers plan
