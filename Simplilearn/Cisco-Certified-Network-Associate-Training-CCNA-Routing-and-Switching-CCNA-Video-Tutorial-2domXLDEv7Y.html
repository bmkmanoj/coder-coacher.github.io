and welcome to the CCNA routing and
switching course offered by simply learn
this introductory lesson will give us a
brief account of the CCNA routing and
switching course and its objectives
Cisco Certified Network Associate
abbreviated as CCNA is a certification
from Cisco it is a first-level cisco
career certification this certification
confirms a person's ability to install
configure operate and troubleshoot
medium sized routing and switching
networks the ability will also include
the execution and confirmation of
networks to distant sites in a wide area
network we will begin with the
objectives of this course in the next
slide by the end of this course you will
be able to outline the fundamentals of
networking and tcp/ip define spanning
tree protocol STP and ether channel
describe VLAN and inter VLAN routing
describe ipv4 addressing and iOS
licensing describe the managing of Cisco
internet work and devices describe the
configuration and troubleshooting of
OSPF EIGRP and ipv6 define wide area
networks when
now let us look at the structure of the
course this is a five-day training
course designed to prepare the
participants to take the Cisco Certified
Network Associate CCNA routing and
switching certification exam
the Cisco exams expect the participants
to be able to configure Cisco devices at
a basic level to achieve this virtual
labs are provided with this course prior
to attending this course participants
are expected to familiarize themselves
with the content available online and
practice the sample question papers this
is necessary to reap the full benefits
from the course a set of three sample
test papers will be provided to prepare
for the exam there are quiz questions at
the end of each lesson to check the
understanding of the participants let us
learn about this course in the next
slide there are 21 lessons in this
course lesson one will address
internetworking including topics like
network and network models lesson two
will address the fundamentals of
networking including network topologies
and Ethernet it will also explain data
encapsulation lesson three will be an
introduction to transmission control
protocol internet protocol tcp/ip
focusing on layers seven three and four
of the OSI model lesson four will deal
with ipv4 addressing and subnetting
lesson five will discuss VL SMS
summarization and troubleshooting tcp/ip
in lesson six the use of cisco
internetworking operating system will be
discussed
we will continue our discussion on the
next set of lessons in the following
slide lesson seven will describe how to
manage a Cisco internet work including
network architecture lesson 8 will
address Internet Protocol routing
subjects include static and default
routes lesson 9 will deal with managing
Cisco devices including hardware
components and remote access lesson 10
will address layer 2 switching in lesson
11 VLANs and inter VLAN routing will be
discussed in continuation to the course
details we will discuss the next five
lessons in the following slide lesson 12
will address spanning tree protocol STP
and ether channel security is the topic
for lesson 13 lesson 14 deals with
network address translation and 80 in
Lesson 15 Internet Protocol version 6
addressing will be discussed lesson 16
will present DHCP NTP and high
availability we will discuss the last
set of lessons in the next slide
enhanced interior gateway routing
protocol II I gr P is the topic for
lesson 17 lesson 18 will discuss the
open shortest path first OSPF routing
protocol and lesson 19 deals with
advanced topics in OSPF which is multi
area OSPF
the subject of lesson 20 is wide area
networks lens less than 21 will address
troubleshoot it in the next slide let us
look into the Cisco CCNA exams there are
two methods to achieve CCNA
certification the first method is to
pass two exams 100 101 IC and d1 and 200
101 IC and d2 the second method is to
pass one exam 201 to Oh si si na X which
includes more material than icnd1 and IC
and d2 combined we will focus on the
exam pattern of CCNA in the next slide
the Cisco exams include different types
of questions multiple choice questions
with single answer multiple choice
questions with multiple answers drag and
drop and fill in the blank and router
and switch simulation questions these
tests the participants level of
knowledge in using maintaining and
configuring the devices in the next
slide we will look into CCNA X exam
there are no prerequisites for the CCNA
X exam Cisco does not divulge the
grading pattern of the exams or the
cutoff scores for passing the duration
of CCNA X exam is 90 minutes with 50 to
60 questions most questions test
fundamental knowledge and critical
thinking to pass the exam theoretical
and practical hands-on knowledge of
Cisco devices is necessary if you pass
the exam the resulting certification is
valid for 3 years you must recertify or
achieve a cisco certified network
professional or cisco certified internet
work expert certification before that
time let us find out the value of CCNA
routing and switching certification in
the following slide Cisco certifications
are some of the most respected in IT
services the industry recognizes this
certification as a demonstration of the
knowledge and skill required to maintain
today's networks
according to Robert Half networking
professionals with Cisco Networking
administration skills
can expect to earn a 9% premium above
average salaries in the industry the
next slide gives us the sources of
information from which additional
material can be obtained further study
and practice is advisable before taking
the certification exams one way to
accomplish this is to visit the Cisco
press website to order course material
for each exam the official certification
guide offers an overview of the material
the foundation learning course material
is an in-depth treatment in addition the
general Cisco website provides
information about concepts and commands
specific information for each router or
switch platform is available there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
