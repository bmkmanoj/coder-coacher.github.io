five scrum artifacts
welcome to lesson five of simply learns
agile scrum training program in this
lesson we shall talk about the various
artifacts associated with scrum in this
context we would understand how
requirements are managed in scrum we'll
first look into the agenda of this
lesson in the next slide
agenda let us now look at the detailed
agenda for this lesson we start off by
looking at the backlog the backlog
consists of user stories and epics and
we discuss those in detail the starting
point of any successful project is
requirement definition which will try to
understand how to write good
requirements finally we look at how to
split up stories
splitting stories is important because a
story should be small and deliverable
independently as a unit through an
incremental iterative approach now we
will proceed to the next slide to start
with the product backlog
product backlog backlog is a somewhat
unfortunate choice of term backlog is to
be understood here is everything that is
yet to be done not necessarily that the
team has fallen behind the product
backlog is the collection of everything
work that the team could do to add value
to the customer
every such work item is expressed as a
user story or an epic all the items in
the backlog need to be ranked and
prioritized by the product owner ideally
the product owner needs to have a fair
amount of detail in the requirements or
stories that will be taken up for work
within the next two or three sprints the
rest of the stories can be kept at a
very high level the backlog is obviously
a live document or list that the product
owner continuously updates next we will
continue with a product backlog
product backlog let us look at a small
list of items that can be part of a
product backlog each item in the backlog
is essentially a short description of a
requirement or change that is needed to
the system to meet a particular customer
need or to add value to the customer the
description of the item is provided by
the product owner in consultation with
the stakeholder who</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
