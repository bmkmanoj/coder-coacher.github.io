the JSON again an important feature
while learning MongoDB that JSON is an
open data interchange format it is
language dependent independent users
conventions of the Shi family of
languages Java JavaScript role and
Python again suppose the basic data
types or the numbers strings boolean
values arrays and hashes yes so someone
is asking what is an open data
interchange format it again means this
is a format which can openly interchange
between each other what I want to say
with that is that JSON is not actually
dependent on any other languages and
again is open source so what I want to
say is a JSON will look something like
this so oh I can write over here name is
summit and page is say X so what do you
see over here is that I have a key
and a value so basically a JSON is
nothing but and amalgamation of keys and
values which together
form a document and the document will
always be in form of a JSON and what you
see in front of you is actually a JSON
so another beautiful thing with this
address I can add n number of keys and
values inside the JSON so it means the
second one I can have name this Sunday
is a shame why
and I can also add a hobby as TT so this
thing has three key values and this ll
is a JSON document so MongoDB will
always store documents in the form of
JSON which again will conform to this
particular scheme pointing to the third
slide it talks about the JSON structure
so JSON is built on the following two
structures first there is a collection
of Nimal appears a collection of the
name will appears such as an object
record struct dictionary hash table
keyed list or associative arrays so that
solves the different kind of things a
document can contain and that too in a
collection so number two and all third
list of values such an array Victor list
or a sequence so that is what a JSON can
internally have he'll see an example of
a document where the stuff we have is we
have ID as a key one is the value name
is the key here we have a spring coming
in here again the third key value we
have an array coming in such as four
values then over here you please see
what we have is we have applications
which is a key which is having an array
which again has two documents very
important over here applications
internally has two documents one
document is this name is forward domain
is ecommerce and one document is name is
Calypso
domain is content management so what you
see is you see this is an example of fun
embedded document a document inside
Buckland this is the final document and
we see this document embedded inside
that so now what we study is Abby's on
now what's Abby's on so be fun
so binary be son is called binary JSON
that is binary JavaScript object
notation so binary JSON RB son is a
binary utilization format which is used
for storing documents and making a
remote procedure calls in MongoDB this
on has the following three
characteristics so B's on again is
lightweight beasts on again is
traversable beasts on the game is if
gent so white is lightweight because
again then you so we're going to work
this on is internally how a MongoDB
document is stored so if the document we
have at our hand is suppose something
like this suppose the document is like
name is Sanjay
and say it is XYZ so this is how we want
the document to be stored but internally
how the document will be stored will be
something like this 0 1 0 0 is 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 but some padding bits as well so
this format is what internally is called
the beasts on so again the storage be
some may require some more data to be
stored internally to store a beasts on
it mean suppose it is on document was 10
MB it may be possible at the beasts on
for the same document of 10 MB is say 12
MB but again at the added data file
makes the beasts on get a readily
reversible across the network which is
why it is the preferred measure of how
the data should be stored inside a
MongoDB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
