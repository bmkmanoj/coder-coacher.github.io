learning experience as you would have
noticed in this course we have covered
all the key topics that will help you in
successfully applying the concepts of
Six Sigma we started with an overview
and then moved on to the defined phase
which helped us learn how to define the
business problem and plan the
improvement initiative then we covered
the measure phase where we learned how
to collect data from the process and
understand the current quality or
operational performance levels in the
next phase analyzed we studied the
business process and the data generated
from the measurement phase to identify
the root causes of the problems in the
improvement phase possible improvement
actions were identified and prioritized
these were then tested to finalize the
improvement action plan finally we
covered the control phase where the Six
Sigma team goes for a full-scale
implementation of the improvement action
plan and sets up controls to monitor the
system in order to sustain the gains
coming back to our example of the food
manufacturing company let us now
understand how they solve the problem
with the texture of the icing using Six
Sigma the Six Sigma team started by
defining the problem using vo C f MA and
the CTQ tool it was identified that the
CTQ was thickness of icing based on this
a project charter was created with a
clear business case problem statement
goal statement milestones and scope of
the project after this details of team
members communication responsibilities
risks and dependency for the project
were also defined the team then created
a high-level process map si POC to
understand the flow of work in the
measure phase the team built performance
standards to understand the operational
definition of the problem ways to
measure the data type and source of the
data along with target and effect
definition of the problem the team also
built l2 and
l-3 process maps to understand the as is
process and its gaps MSA was done to
understand whether the measuring
instrument the people involved and the
process were aligned to the expected
standard during a brainstorming session
the team identified the potential causes
of the problem it was found that the
amount of water in the product and the
temperature of the product had
correlations with viscosity it was also
noted that the viscosity was being
measured after the product was already
made which resulted in scrapping the
product the potential causes were then
segregated into categories using C at a
matrix to understand which category
caused more trouble whether the amount
of water present in the product or the
temperature of the product or both after
this the segmentation was done to
understand the controllable and
measureable causes to arrive at the
vital few causes of the problem in the
analysis phase the team validated the
vital few causes related to the problem
by using Six Sigma tools like hypothesis
testing graphical summary analysis etc
based on the analysis and conclusions
they suggested the solution by providing
the proper recipe that included the the
amount of water required for the right
viscosity and the exact temperature ie
230 degrees required to heat the product
for the proper texture besides this in
order to ensure the viscosity is
accurate they also decided to place an
inline Brix meter that would measure the
viscosity during the process the action
plans but the same were put in place in
the improved phase the action plans were
validated and prioritized using the 2x2
matrix and the FMEA these action plans
were piloted on a sample batch and then
implemented across the process the
action plans were attract for
improvement using a tracker and then
presented to the team these improvements
helped ensure the product have the right
texture and viscosity before it was
packaged and shipped finally the results
were controlled using a control plan the
control plan ensured that temperatures
were recorded during the
manufacturing of the product viscosity
was measured during the manufacturing
process and again after the product was
packaged to ensure consistency this is
validated by the Six Sigma champion
sponsor and black belt different types
of control charts and poka-yoke methods
were used to track and sustain
consistency in the performance the
project was highly successful and
resulted in savings of 1 million dollars
per year end of the day Six Sigma
benefits its practitioners and
stakeholders by leading to greater
efficiency productivity and in turn cost
savings further its results are
quantifiable Six Sigma practice has to
begin with the management but flow both
top-down and bottom-up meaning all
employees at all levels need to be
engaged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
