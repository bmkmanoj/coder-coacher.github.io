ITSM is used in many ways by different
management frameworks and organizations
seeking governance and increased
maturity of their IT organization the
standard elements for most definitions
of ITSM include description of the
processes required to deliver and
support IT services for customers the
purpose primarily being to deliver and
support the technology or products
needed by the business to meet key
organizational objectives or goals
definitions of roles and
responsibilities for people involved
including IT staff customers and other
stakeholders involved the management of
external suppliers or partners involved
in the delivery and support of the
technology and products being delivered
and supported by IT the combination of
these elements provide the capabilities
required for an IT organization to
deliver and support quality IT services
that meet specific business needs and
requirements there are four perspectives
ie four p's or attributes that drive the
concept of ITSM first is partners or
suppliers perspective this takes into
account the importance of partner and
external supplier relationships and how
they contribute to service delivery
second is people perspective this is
primarily concerned with the soft side
IT staff customers and other
stakeholders for example does the IT
staff have the correct skills and
knowledge to perform their roles third
is products or technology perspective
this takes into account IT services
hardware and software budgets and tools
fourth and final perspective is process
perspective
this relates to the end-to-end delivery
of service based on process flows
quality IT Service Management ensures
that all of these four perspectives are
taken into account as part of the
continual service improvement of the IT
organization it is the same when
designing new or modified services
themselves in that these four
perspectives need to be considered and
catered for in order to enable success
in its design transition and eventual
adoption by customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
