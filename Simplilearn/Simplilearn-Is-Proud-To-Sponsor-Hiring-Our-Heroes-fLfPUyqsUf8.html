simply learn America's I'm excited to
announce our partnership with hiring our
heroes eyeing our heroes is an
initiative sponsored by the US Chamber
of Commerce foundation to help our
active duty military personnel their
spouses and veterans transition back to
the civilian work force my name is Logan
Halliwell I'm a former Marine and of1
veteran and a military program manager
at simply learn America's I'd like to
take this time to introduce you to the
HOH corporate fellowship program the
fellowship program is unique in that it
allows active-duty transitioning service
members to participate in a 12-week
internship with participating corporate
partners one of the challenges I faced
during my transition was articulating my
military skills and training and
language that perspective employers
understood a program like this corporate
fellowship program allows the
transitioning service member to
internalize that dialogue to learn about
what their military skills and training
actually mean and how to translate that
to civilian employers 200,000 Plus
service members get out of here how can
we translate their skill sets into
corporate America we owe it to them the
corporate fellowship program kind of
alleviates that whole process for these
candidates as they're coming into a
corporate America environment for
corporate America it was an opportunity
to witness veteran talent within the
organization and see what they had to
offer and no cost of them a fully funded
program and for three months the fellows
would be there doing work and projects
and tasks that were commensurate with
their education and experience level HOH
is role in the corporate fellowship
program is we're the executors so all
across the country at the different
basis we have our project manager that's
actually us on the base themselves and
they work very closely with the base
leadership to recruit interviews screen
the service members they're gonna be
eligible for the fellowship and then
once the fellowship actually begins
they're the ones that facilitate the
weekly meetings with guest speakers the
educational component and sort of help
coach teach and mentor and hold the hand
of for lack of a better term the service
members that are
the program if it start with about a
week immersion so the first three days
they would immerse and then over the
course of the next 10 to 11 weeks they'd
get a lot of transitioning touch where
they've learned a little bit about our
resumes structures and what we're
looking for and target of resume we'd
look at interviewing tips and tricks and
techniques they would also get a project
from the actual team that they were
working with and they would do check-ins
with their leadership progressively up
to the vice-president level our
corporate partners that have also seen
what the potential talent of these
individuals are our educational partners
who have come to the table to really
provide the educational backbone to this
transition and then of course HOH and
some of the other partners that have
come to the table to really make this a
program that can be launched nationally
and be a benefit to not only the service
member but also the company's hiring
we've had several fellows come into the
program and they get the opportunity to
prove themselves three four weeks into
the program really surprised everyone
that they were even more talented than
what we thought during the initial
interview their co-workers are so
excited to be a part of this program
everyone that I've told is just in love
with it they think it's so neat and it's
so different from anything that we've
done before but we've hired about you
know two-thirds or three-quarters of the
fellows that have gone through the
program I think the program is changing
the way military recruiting looks and
the landscape of military recruiting I
think this is the future to how veterans
transition and it closes that transition
gap much more quickly the American
military is the best trained military in
world's best trained cannon and pull out
there if we just give them a short
opportunity for 12 weeks to showcase
what they can do
they're gonna when I looked at the
attributes of this particular fellowship
and that I would get a look at an
employer for about three months and they
would get a good look at me I I thought
it was a great opportunity as a former
base commander myself I said you know
it's very important that they sort of
take on this transition mission you know
they've been tasked for it they're
required to support it all and there's
no greater program that really meets
those needs and most require mister
tasks with so I will say a base
commander's should just you know get out
of the way and let the magic happen
between your great service members and
those companies
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
