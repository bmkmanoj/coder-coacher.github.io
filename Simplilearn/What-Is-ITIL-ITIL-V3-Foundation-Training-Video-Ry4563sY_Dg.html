but what is ITIL and what's the added
value for any organization adopting ITIL
ITIL is an abbreviation for information
technology infrastructure library a
library because it is a set of books
focusing on the area of service
management for the IT industry with
guidance captured from practicing IT
professionals so what is service
management for the IT industry we just
explained that on a previous slide if
you are still not clear no problem
this concept is explained again later in
this module in detail to give some
background ITIL was published between
1989 and 1995 by Her Majesty's
stationery office or in short HMS o in
the UK on the behalf of the central
communications and telecommunications
agency also known as CCTA
which is now a part of the office of
government Commerce or the OGC in short
it's early use was principally confined
to the UK and Netherlands a second
version of ITIL was published as a set
of revised books between 2000 and 2004
in 2007 ITIL version 2 was superseded by
an enhanced and consolidated third
version of ITIL consisting of five core
books covering the service lifecycle I -
is not a theoretical view of how to
manage IT services it is a documented
practice it is easily adapted to
irrespective of the organization's size
or complexity it emphasizes quality
management approach and standards
supports quality systems such as ISO
9000 and is guided by total quality
frameworks such as European framework
for quality management
or e fqm in short and the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award or the
MB n QA in short since the time of the
introduction of version to ITIL has
become a world wild li facto standard
for IT Service Management this is
reflected not only in the large number
of people following IT training courses
and getting certified but also in the
adaptation of ITIL by the British
Standards Institute this involved the
incorporation of the ideas behind ITIL
in the British Standards Institute
standards bs 15,000 which is now ISO
20000 standard the ITIL z' goals have
been to provide a consistent yet
flexible best practices framework for IT
Service Management having a standardized
vocabulary and platform-independent
processes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
