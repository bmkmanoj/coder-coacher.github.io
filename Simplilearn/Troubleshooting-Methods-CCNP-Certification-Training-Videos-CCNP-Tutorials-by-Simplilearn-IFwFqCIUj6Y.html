network professional ccnv routing and
switching course offered by simply learn
the last lesson focused on network
maintenance this lesson focuses on the
troubleshooting methods let us begin
with the objectives of this lesson in
the next slide by the end of this lesson
you will be able to list the different
Network troubleshooting process steps
discuss the sub steps involved in
problem diagnosis explain structured
troubleshooting methods let us start our
discussion of the troubleshooting
process in the next slide the steps of
the troubleshooting process are as
follows the troubleshooting process
begins with reporting a problem in many
cases users report a problem however
there are also instances when IT
personnel report a problem in the course
of maintenance step 2 deals with
diagnosing the problem diagnosis is
complex and time-consuming
the reported problem can be distantly
related to the underlying cause of the
problem in step 3 the problem is
resolved
it is important to remember that a
problem is not resolved until the user
confirms it let us look into problem
diagnosis in detail in the next slide as
discussed earlier the problem diagnosis
step is complex and time-consuming there
are five sub steps within problem
diagnosis the first sub step is to
collect information as the problem
report often does not contain sufficient
information the troubleshooter collects
additional information by talking to the
users and the IT personnel involved the
next sub step is to examine the
collected information in addition to the
information collected from people within
an organization the troubleshooter uses
network information to diagnose the
problem such information includes
baselines collected when the network is
operating normally furthermore network
event information such as syslog can
also be helpful
at this point the troubleshooter needs
to eliminate potential causes to make
troubleshooting more effective
elimination is based on the information
collected in the previous steps however
eliminating probable causes relies
heavily on the Troubleshooters knowledge
of networking in general and his
specific network in particular in the
next sub step the troubleshooter answers
the fundamental cause of the problem
this may involve coordination with other
IT personnel to check how specific
technology may behave under varying
conditions structured troubleshooting is
instrumental in this sub step of problem
diagnosis in the last sub step the
troubleshooter verifies his hypothesis
the only way to be sure is to take the
appropriate steps however if changes to
the network are required the
troubleshooter must follow the change
control procedure and develop a rollback
plan in the next slide we will discuss
structured troubleshooting procedures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
