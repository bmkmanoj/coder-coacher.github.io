and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on iOS
device maintenance this lesson focuses
on network monitoring let us begin with
the objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to discuss the requirements for
telnet and ssh State the components of
SNMP and their functions explained the
different versions of SNMP discuss be
span and are span interfaces let us
start our discussion by understanding
remote access methods the two most
common remote access methods are telnet
and secure shell protocol ssh telnet is
the default method for BTY lines however
it is not encrypted SSH is encrypted
hence cisco recommends using SSH
whenever possible in the next slide let
us discuss the requirements for telnet
on the target device the target device
must be configured with one of the three
authentication methods the first method
is configuring a password on the vty
line the second method is local database
authentication the third method is
server authentication for example radius
can be configured an enable secret
password must also be set on the target
devices else access will be denied to
the privileged mode on the target device
you can have parallel telnet sessions to
suspend a telnet session enter commands
on the source and return to the target
my typing the resume command or the
Enter key the show sessions or where
command can be used to show the present
and suspended sessions the disconnect
command is used to disconnect a telnet
session by starting a telnet connection
on each subsequent device you can hop to
the next device
in a chain of attached devices in the
next slide let us focus on requirements
for the SSH</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
