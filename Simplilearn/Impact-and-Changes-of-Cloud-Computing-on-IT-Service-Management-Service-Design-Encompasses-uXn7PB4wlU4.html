design is the next layer after service
strategy here we can define service
catalog that is the different services
IT can offer risk management policies
and provide compliance we will also
define the service levels for the
several IT services which the company
offers next we will need to ensure that
this design is in coordination with the
supplier we should also understand
capacity availability IT continuity or
disaster recovery security etc at the
same time we need a clear idea about
managing all this in alignment with the
overall architecture of IT that is that
hardware and software that an
organization offers in the next line we
will discuss service transition once the
service design is in place it is time to
move on to the service transition during
this phase there is utilization of
various processes functions and systems
in order to build stabilize and deploy
services service transition encompasses
change management to change control
change control is nothing but
controlling the changes directly on the
cloud as opposed to change management
where you manage them locally
consequently once the new cloud service
is implemented it adheres to the
specific standards of the company the
change management process basically
takes care of standard revisions that
are applied to new or updated cloud
services under service asset and
configuration management we can store
all information about IT services and
resources we know that cloud providers
make both scheduled and unscheduled
releases from time to time
it is important that new updates also
reflect on the user interface or UI and
functionality which in turn should
benefit the customers the knowledge
management process ensures that each
service provider provides the right
level of support to an organization's
users to facilitate informed decisions
in cloud it is important that cloud
vendors update information online for
their services service transition also
includes change evolution project
management release and deployment
management application development
service validation and testing service
asset and configuration management
knowledge management etc in the next
slide we will discuss service operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
