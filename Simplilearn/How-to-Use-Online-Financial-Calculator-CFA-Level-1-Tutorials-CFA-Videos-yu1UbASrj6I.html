financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in the risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use use of financial
calculator welcome to the session on the
use of financial calculators for the frm
part 1 exam the use of the calculator is
simple but some practice is required to
enable quick calculations during the
exam you must practice the questions
with your calculator frm recommends a
few calculator models we will cover the
tutorial using the BA 2 plus model which
is sufficient for both levels of the
exam similar steps are to be followed
for other models as well agenda the main
agenda of our discussion would be the
use of a financial calculator for the
frm part 1 exam we will use the BA 2
plus model in our description steps for
other models are the same in this
session will learn the time value of
money calculations such as annuity
present value future value etc we will
then learn the steps in calculating bond
valuation such as the present value of a
bond bond yield etc approved calculators
the table lists the approved calculators
for the CFA and frm examinations in our
session we will cover be a2 plus which
is applicable for the BA 2 plus
professional model as well these are the
two most widely used calculators time
value of money first step first we need
to clear the memory of the financial
keys after switching the calculator on
press the second key and then Fe CLR
tvm please note that the calculator has
alternate text above some keys as in the
case of the FV key there is the CLR tvm
function above it this alternative
function is activated after pressing the
second key let's now learn to calculate
various parameters in the time value of
money calculations remember to execute
this first step before any calculation
time value of money present value of
annuities the present value of an
annuity or equal annual payments is
calculated by following these steps
clear tvm as explained in the previous
slide enter the value for the number of
years and then press n similarly enter
values for the interest rate I over Y
and payment PMT now press CPT and then
press pv
time value of money future value of
annuities the future value of an annuity
or equal annual payments is calculated
by following these steps clear tvm as
explained in the third slide enter value
for the number of years then press n
similarly enter values for the interest
rate I over Y and payment PMT now press
CPT and then press FV time value of
money payment amount the payment or the
equal annual payments is calculated by
following these steps clear tvm as
explained in the third slide enter the
value for the number of years then press
n similarly enter values for the
interest rate I over Y and payment TV
now press CPT and then press PMT time
value of money number of periods value
for the number of periods is calculated
by following these steps clear tvm as
explained in the third slide enter value
for interest rate I over Y similarly
enter values of the present value pv and
payment PMT now press CPT and then press
n time value of money interest rate the
annual interest rate is calculated by
following these steps clear tvm as
explained in the third slide enter value
for the number of years then press n
similarly enter values for present value
pv and payment pv now press cpt and then
press I / y time value of money
annuities jus annuities do implies that
the payments are received or paid at the
beginning of the period and not at the
end of the period as in all previous
cases for this we need to set the
calculator to BGN
you need to follow these steps to change
the calculator mode press the second key
and then PMT / BGN now press 2nd and
enter to change the mode you can exit
the screen after pressing 2nd and cpt /
quit uneven cash flows for all cash flow
and bond calculations we need to first
clear the cash flow memory by pressing
second and then siiii over crl work as
shown in the slide present value of
uneven cash flows NPV to enter the cash
flow mode press CF the calculator will
prompt you to enter each cash flow and
then the frequency with which it occurs
for now just accept the default
frequency of one each time enter the
value for the first cash flow and press
enter to enter next value press down
arrow after pressing enter now press the
NPV key and enter the value of discount
rate when prompted for I over Y and
press enter to compute the value press
cpt future value of uneven cash flows
once you've determined the present value
as in the previous method you can
compute the future value by using time
value of money calculations thirst clear
the financial keys by pressing second
and then f v over c lr t vm now enter
values for n I over Y PV and then press
CPT and press FV
internal rate of return irr soul in for
the irr is done exactly the same way as
calculating NPV except that the discount
rate is not necessary this time you'll
press I RR and then CPT bond valuation
bond valuation is similar to the
calculation of NPV as explained before
however in this method we can use the
frequency function to enter multiple
coupon payments for future periods only
the last cash flow needs to be entered
as a sum of the coupon and the par value
of the bond bond yield the calculation
of bond yield is done by calculating the
IRR for the cash flows as explained
before bond duration bonds duration is
calculated by entering the cash flows as
a product of cash flow and the time
period in which the cash flow occurs
then the mpv is calculated as explained
before after calculating the mpv we can
divide the value with a bond present
value to arrive at the duration of the
bond
