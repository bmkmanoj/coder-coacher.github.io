financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in the risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use use of financial
calculator welcome to the session on the
use of financial calculators for the frm
part 1 exam the use of the calculator is
simple but some practice is required to
enable quick calculations during the
exam you must practice the questions
with your calculator frm recommends a
few calculator models we will cover the
tutorial using the BA 2 + model which is
sufficient for both levels of the exam
similar steps are to be followed for
other models as well agenda the main
agenda of our discussion would be the
use of a financial calculator for the
frm part 1 exam we will use the BA 2 +
model in our description steps for other
models are the same in this session
we'll learn the time value of money
calculations such as annuity present
value future value etc we will then
learn the steps in calculating bond
valuation such as the present value of a
bond bond yield etc approved calculators
the table lists the approved calculators
for the CFA and frm examinations in our
session we will cover be a 2 plus which
is applicable for the BA 2 plus
professional model as well these are the
two most widely used calculators time
value of money first step first we need
to clear the memory of the financial
keys after switching the calculator on
press the second key and then FV CLR
TVM please note that the calculator has
alternate text above some keys as in the
case of the FV key there is the CLR TVM
function above it this alternate
function is activated after pressing the
second key let's now learn to calculate
various parameters in the time value of
money calculations remember to execute
this first step before any calculation
time value of money present value of
annuities the present value of an
annuity or equal annual payments is
calculated by following these steps
clear TVM as explained in the previous
slide enter the value for the number of
years and then press n similarly enter
values for the interest rate I / y and
payment PMT
now press CPT and then press PV
time value of money future value of
annuities the future value of an annuity
or equal annual payments is calculated
by following these steps clear TVM as
explained in the third slide enter value
for the number of years then press n
similarly enter values for the interest
rate I / y and payment PMT now press CPT
and then press FV time value of money
payment amount the payment or the equal
annual payments is calculated by
following these steps clear TVM as
explained in the third slide enter the
value for the number of years then press
n similarly enter values for the
interest rate i / y and payment pv now
press CPT and then press PMT time value
of money number of periods value for the
number of periods is calculated by
following these steps
clear TVM as explained in the third
slide enter value for interest rate I /
y similarly enter values of the present
value PV and payment PMT
now press CPT and then press n time
value of money interest rate the annual
interest rate is calculated by following
these steps clear TVM as explained in
the third slide enter value for the
number of years then press n similarly
enter values for present value PV and
payment PV now press CPT and then press
I / y time value of money
annuities jus annuities do implies that
the payments are received or paid at the
beginning of the period and not at the
end of the period as in all previous
cases for this we need to set the
calculator to BGN
you need to follow these steps to change
the calculator mode press the second key
and then PMT over BGN now press second
and enter to change the mode you can
exit the screen after pressing second
and CPT over quit uneven cash flows for
all cash flow and bandha calculations we
need to first clear the cash flow memory
by pressing second and then c e / c RL
work as shown in the slide present value
of uneven cash flows NPV to enter the
cash flow mode press CF the calculator
will prompt you to enter each cash flow
and then the frequency with which it
occurs for now just accept the default
frequency of 1 each time
enter the value for the first cash flow
and press enter to enter next value
press down arrow after pressing enter
now press the NPV key and enter the
value of discount rate when prompted for
I / y and press enter to compute the
value press CPT future value of uneven
cash flows once you've determined the
present value as in the previous method
you can compute the future value by
using time value of money calculations
first clear the financial keys by
pressing 2nd and then FV / CLR TVM now
enter values for n AI / y pv and then
press CPT and press FV in
rates of return IRR soul in for the IRR
is done exactly the same way as
calculating NPV except that the discount
rate is not necessary this time you'll
press IRR and then CPT bond valuation
bond valuation is similar to the
calculation of NPV as explained before
however in this method we can use the
frequency function to enter multiple
coupon payments for future periods only
the last cash flow needs to be entered
as a sum of the coupon and the par value
of the bond bond yield the calculation
of bond yield is done by calculating the
IRR for the cash flows as explained
before bond duration bond duration is
calculated by entering the cash flows as
a product of cash flow and the time
period in which the cash flow occurs
then the NPV is calculated as explained
before after calculating the NPV we can
divide the value with a bond present
value to arrive at the duration of the
bond
