course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project scope of
management there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to 5 process
groups in this lesson we will look at
the second knowledge area that is
project scope management and its
processes let us begin with the first
topic of this lesson that is project
scope management project scope
management includes the processes
required to ensure that a project
comprises all and only the work required
to complete the project successfully the
project scope management is concerned
about the scope what is not there in the
scope is also clearly identified in the
next screen let us look at the key
activities performed under project scope
management let us look at a few of the
typical activities that happen as part
of the project scope management constant
monitoring is essential to make sure
that all the project work is being
completed the gradual uncontrolled
increase in scope of the project is
referred as scope creep it is necessary
to define the project scope boundaries
and not let people randomly add to the
project scope gold-plating is doing more
than what is required as part of the
project scope this has to be avoided in
projects as per the published statistics
about projects done globally less than
40% of projects can be considered
successful therefore the focus should be
on what is required rather than
squandering around with what is not
required 40% might be considered less
but a project is classified as
successful only if it meets all its
objectives and is done within time and
cost budgets in the next screen let us
understand the differences between
product scope and project
scope project scope management deals
with managing both the product scope as
well as the project scope product scope
refers to the features and functions
that characterize a product service or
result the word product may also include
creation of a service for example in the
banking industry each of their services
is called a product likewise a savings
account is one of their products mutual
fund is another on the other hand
project scope is the work that needs to
be accomplished to deliver the output of
the project which could be a product
service or result with the specific
features and functions for instance to
deliver a product you may also need to
produce a requirements document or a
design document these are not part of
the product scope but it may very well
be part of the project scope in the next
screen
let us discuss a few key terms used in
the project scope management WBS stands
for work breakdown structure it means
breaking the project deliverables into
smaller and more manageable components
called
work packages the last level of work in
such subdivision is called work packages
and the whole structure is called WBS
for example a typical software
development project would have various
activities like finalizing requirements
designing the new system coding testing
and going live with the new system each
of these translates into high-level
deliverables which can be further
subdivided into smaller activities which
are more predictable WBS dictionary like
any dictionary contains the explanation
of the terms used in WBS a typical WBS
dictionary has details like the control
account name of the work package
description of the work package resource
assigned if there are any assumptions or
dependencies to complete the work
package the due date to finish the work
package technical dependencies and so on
WBS dictionary
is useful for the person or group
working on the work packages as it
further elaborates the decomposed work
package control account is a level
within WBS at which management wishes to
exercise control for example perform
earned value analysis track performance
