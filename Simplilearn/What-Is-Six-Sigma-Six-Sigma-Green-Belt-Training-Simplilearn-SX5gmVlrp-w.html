process that focuses on delivering
near-perfect products and services
consistently its strength is that it's a
continuous improvement process with an
unwavering focus on change empowerment
seamless training of resources and
continuous top management support these
three are known as the pillars of Six
Sigma
if Six Sigma is implemented methodically
it will give sustained results for any
process now the question arises as to
what is a process this will be explained
in the next screen a process is a series
of steps designed to produce a product
and/or service according to the
requirement of the customer a process
mainly consists of four parts input
process steps output and feedback input
is something put into a process or
expended in its operation to achieve an
output or a result for example man
material machine and management output
is the final product delivered to an
internal or external customer for
example product or services it is
important to understand that if the
output of a process is an input for
another process the latter process is
the internal customer each input can be
classified as controllable represented
as see non controllable represented as
NC noise represented as N and critical
represented as X the most important
aspect of the process is the feedback as
can be inferred from the image any
change in the inputs causes change in
the output therefore y equals f of X
feedback helps in process control
because it suggests changes to the
inputs let us understand how Six Sigma
works in this screen Six Sigma is
successful because of the following
reasons
Six Sigma is a management strategy it
creates an environment where the
management supports Six Sigma as a
business strategy and not as a
stand-alone approach or a program to
satisfy some public relations need Six
Sigma mainly emphasizes the DMACC method
of problem solving focused teams are
assigned well-defined projects that
directly influence the organization's
bottom line with customer satisfaction
and increased quality being byproducts
Six Sigma also requires extensive use of
statistical methods the organizational
benefits of Six Sigma are as follows a
Six Sigma process eliminates the root
cause of problems and defects in a
process sometimes the solution is
creating robust products and services
that mitigate the impact of a variable
input or output on a customer's
experience for example many electrical
utility systems have voltage variability
up to and sometimes exceeding at 10%
deviation from nominal value thus most
electrical products are built to
tolerate the variability drawing more
amperage without damage to any
components or the unit itself using Six
Sigma reduces variation in a process and
thereby reduces waste in a process it
ensures customer satisfaction and
provides process standardization rework
is substantially reduced because one
gets it right the very first time
further Six Sigma addresses the key
business requirement Six Sigma can also
be used by organizations to gain
advantage and become world leaders in
their respective fields ultimately the
whole Six Sigma process is to satisfy
customers and achieve organizational
goals
