frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
risk-taking corporate governance
perspective
agenda so let us begin by getting
introduced to the topics that will be
discussed in the coming slides the main
agenda would be to cover the overall
risk management in a corporate
governance perspective here you will
come across various topics and
terminologies that you are going to
learn in more detail in subsequent
readings throughout your preparation for
the examination in this lecture we will
begin with viewing risk management as a
value creating activity we will then
learn how corporations create risk
profiles we will learn about enterprise
risk management we will then learn about
the various approaches in managing or
valuing risk such as the risk adjusted
approach certainty equivalent approach
and probabilistic approach will also
learn about a ir m IC enterprise risk
management process in detail later in
this reading we will learn about hedging
and how firms must implement a proper
risk management framework in an
organization and the best practices in
risk management to start with let us try
and understand risk and value creation
in detail in the coming slide
risk and value creation let us first
define risk risk is a concept linked to
human expectations it indicates a
potential negative effect on an asset
that may derive from given processes in
progress or given future events in the
common language risk is often used as a
synonym of probability of a loss or of a
danger in the assessment of professional
risk the concept of risk combines the
probability of an event occurring with
the impact that event may have and with
its various circumstances of happening
this definition mainly implies the
negative consequences of risk while in a
true sense it is a mix of danger and
opportunity which means that risk is
usually associated with reward we can
classify risk into operational financial
and market risk financial risk can be
further classified into internal risk
such as insolvency counterparty risk and
financial structural planning risk or
external risk such as interest rate risk
currency exchange risk and inflation
risk we can also view risk as a value
creating activity which means that the
risk analyst needs to estimate the
effect of each risk on firm value and
determine the cost of reducing each risk
if risk reduction is costly the decision
makers must decide whether the benefit
to firm value justifies the costs in
short the firm must seek a value
maximizing risk management strategy
moving on to the next slide we will
discuss risk profile how it is
categorized along with it we will also
find what risk governance is
risk profile and risk governance usually
a firm identifies potential risks to the
firm using judgment experience and
assumptions these risks include
operational financial and market risk
all these risks are then categorized
into different groups such a profile is
called a risk profile of the firm risk
governance is a systematic approach to
decision making processes associated to
natural and technological risks adopted
to achieve more effective risk
management it seeks to reduce risk
exposure and vulnerability by filling
gaps in risk policy it incorporates such
criteria as accountability participation
and transparency within the procedures
and structures by which risk related
decisions are made and implemented the
next slide discusses the concept of
enterprise risk management we had
understood risk profile and risk
governance in this slide so as we move
on to the next slide we can find out
what enterprise risk management is and
how does it help maximize firm value
erm enterprise risk management
enterprise risk management is a
comprehensive and integrated framework
for managing credit risk market risk
operational risk and economic capital
and risk transfer in order to maximize
firm value today there are two widely
disseminated erm approaches cos 02 erm
and cas erm cos 02 erm is a risk
framework from the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway
Commission that is geared to achieve
strategic operational reporting and
compliance objectives while CAS erm
framework was developed by the casualty
actuarial society the framework focuses
on hazard financial strategic and
operational risks erm addresses risk
management in several ways as listed
here first it overcomes the isolated
approach to risk management for example
in a conglomerate in which one division
is long in currency a and another
division is short in the same sum in the
same currency responsible division
managers might decide to purchase
separate currency hedges this represents
a siloed approach which does not enhance
value taking an enterprise-wide approach
instead using erm renders such actions
unnecessary because the conglomerate
already has a natural hedge it focuses
on risk management as a value creating
activity in this approach managers
estimate the effect of each risk on firm
value and determine the cost of reducing
each risk
calculating risk adjusted value pursuing
value maximizing risk strategies
requires that decision-makers assess the
value of the risky asset in this section
we will learn to determine the value of
the risky asset by discounting the cash
flows from the asset to present value
the three steps involved are outlined in
the slide the first step involves
estimating the cash flows from the
project asset or business let us keep
the cash flows at time period t as cft
we will now find the relation for the
value of the asset in the second step we
find the risk-adjusted discount rate
that will be used to discount the cash
flows in the future this discount rate
is found using the expression that is
risk-free rate added to the risk premium
the risk premium is a surplus return for
taking the risk this is found by
multiplying the beta of the asset with
the difference in the market and
risk-free returns the beta of the asset
is the relative sensitivity of the asset
with respect to the benchmark index this
is the cost of equity to the investor if
the asset is composed of debt and equity
then we need to find the total cost of
capital using the expression for the
cost of capital as given in the slide an
important point to remember is that the
risk premium is usually calculated from
historical data and has high estimation
error also the beta does not reflect the
current business mix and financial
leverage of the company finally in the
third step we calculate the value of the
asset by discounting all the cash flows
found in step 1 using the discount rates
found in step 2 and summing them up with
this we conclude the valuation method of
the assets next slide demonstrates the
method using an example
risk-adjusted method example let us
demonstrate the valuation method we
learned in the previous slide with an
example in this example we are given the
cash flows from the asset for its life
of 10 years the risk-free rate risk
premiums and beta are also given it is
given that the acid is financed by forty
percent debt the tax rates and cost of
debt are also given using the expression
for the cost of equity we find the cost
of equity to be eighteen point three
percent using the expression for the
cost of capital we find that the
discount rate is twelve point six
percent we use this discount rate in the
PV function of the financial calculator
we get a value of 120,000 994 as the
value of the asset you can similarly
apply the formula for different figures
and calculate the value of risky assets
in the certainty equivalent approach
which we will be dealing with in the
coming slide we try to understand how
expected risk cash flows can be adjusted
instead of the discount rate the
different ways of cash flow adjustment
is mentioned here
certainty equivalent approach in the
certainty equivalent approach we adjust
the expected cash flows for risk rather
than the discount rate and use the
risk-free rate at the discount rate
the adjustments can be done easing
several ways the first method is using
utility functions the second method is
to subjectively estimate a haircut to
decrease the expected cash flow another
method is to convert expected cash flow
to a certainty equivalent
when compared to the risk-adjusted
method cash flows are estimated in risk
adjusted approach while they're
guaranteed in certainty equivalent
approach and the discount rate is the
risk adjusted discount rate in risk
adjusted approach while it is the
risk-free rate in certainty equivalent
approach</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
