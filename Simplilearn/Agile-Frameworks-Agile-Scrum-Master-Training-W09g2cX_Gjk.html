simply learns eggs an agile scrum master
workshop after completing this lesson
you will be able to explain the features
strengths and limitations of software
development using approaches including
the traditional waterfall approach as
well as various agile methods including
lean extreme programming crystal and
dsdm you will also be able to describe
the role of DevOps as a discipline that
is critical to the success of agile
teams you will also understand how to
apply agile methods to IT Service
Management any method which is
incremental and iterative is inherently
agile under the agile umbrella is a
family of methods including scrum
extreme programming also called XP
crystal Kanban lean feature driven
development and dsdm all of these
methods share agile practices and values
like embracing change lightweight or
lean documentation daily stakeholder
collaboration incremental delivery and
continuous improvement before we talk
about some a j'l methods let's review
the traditional software development
lifecycle when using waterfall this
approach is called waterfall because of
the series of steps that are used to
create the final product you can see
that the initial step is to collect all
of the requirements necessary that's
followed by the design phase which is
where the software structure is
determined then in the implementation
phase the software is actually developed
in the verification phase the software
is tested both for correctness and
acceptance and then of course once the
software has been deployed there's the
maintenance phase this traditional
approach is perfectly suitable and
logical for project management however
when it comes to software development
where there's a high
of complexity and uncertainty challenge
is dealing with change change is not
only difficult it's very expensive for
example if you discover a critical
design flaw during verification or if
the requirements change during
implementation the amount of rework
needed to correct these can be
prohibitive the results is a tendency to
resist change which in turn compromises
the spirit of customer collaboration
nevertheless if you have a project that
is very clear in terms of its
requirements and is unlikely to
experience too many change
Waterfall could be a reasonable and
effective approach for projects to
simply migrate features or products from
one platform to another keep in mind
that both the problem and the solution
must be clear for this approach to be a
good choice now let's look at a few
agile methods and see how they are
likely a better fit for projects that
are complex and uncertain like software
development let's turn our attention to
extreme programming XP was developed
primarily to respond to the high cost of
changing requirements and establish
strong engineering practices to improve
the quality of software and then take
them to the extreme
for example if testing is good let's do
unit testing integration testing and
acceptance testing if design is good
let's do design all the time and make
sure we do retrospectives at the end of
each iteration if simplicity is good
let's eliminate anything that does not
add value and make sure we always do the
simplest thing if review is good
let's continuously improve by making
sure we do reviews and retrospectives at
the end of each iteration if
communication is good let's make sure
our team space and tools encourage
face-to-face and osmotic communication
if using short iterations is good let's
make sure we get regular stakeholder
feedback in order to improve the quality
of our software and make sure we're
delivering the value the customer wants
by doing the shortest possible
iterations
XP introduced a number of revolutionary
concepts to software development and
many have become standard practices
perhaps you recognize some of these
practices test-driven development this
is where the team writes the tests
before developing the code continuous
integration this is the practice of
regularly integrating new code into the
system and using automated testing to
determine the status of the integration
on-site customer xB essentially made the
customer part of the team the customer
is expected to be on site and
participate with the team on a daily
basis user stories this practice is a
quick and effective way to capture
customer requirements and make sure
there is agreement between the customer
and the developers regarding what's to
be developed other xB practices include
creating a coding standard for the
project collective code ownership pair
programming establishing a sustainable
pace forever
creating a system metaphor to increase
communication effectiveness as well as
others XP teams have the following
characteristics they are self-organizing
teams are empowered to decide for
themselves how they're going to execute
the work of the project without top-down
management and control they are
cross-functional the idea is to have
generalizing specialists as team members
these are team members who specialize in
one area but have enough knowledge to
participate in the other roles that are
part of an XP team they compromise and
collaborate team members including the
customer the coach the programmers the
trackers and the testers collaborate in
order to reach agreement on exactly what
needs to be developed
XP roles fall into three different
categories customers programmers and
testers customers are the business
experts and can include product managers
domain experts interaction designers and
business analysts ideally there will be
for each three programmers programmers
are the implementation experts as we
said they are generalizing specialists
meaning programmers can exchange roles
as necessary during the execution of the
project
ideally there are six to ten on a team
testers are the quality experts and
focus on unit testing integration
testing acceptance and exploratory
testing there are ideally one for each
six developers the crystal method was
developed by Alistair Cockburn
and was designed for projects ranging
from small teams developing low critical
solutions to large teams developing
critical solutions the four levels of
criticality and crystal are comfort
discretionary money essential money and
life depending on the criticality level
of the project there may be an
additional need for verifications
validations and traceability measures
the seven key principles of crystal
include frequent delivery focus
reflective improvement ease of access to
experts personal safety technical
environment and osmotic communication
now let's talk about dsdm dsdm stands
for dynamic systems development method
it was developed in the 1990s and is a
comprehensive method documented in the
form of an e-book that is available
freely at the URL below
dsdm links well with conventional
project management techniques like
prints to making it quite popular in the
UK
dsdm embraces five key principles
involvement is necessary in order to
develop the right business solution
requirements may evolve
however the timescale is fixed this is
the concept of time boxing which we will
explore in more detail later in the
workshop early delivery because it
results in early return on investment
from that the value created
it's implemented based on the 80/20
principle this is based on Pareto's
80/20 rule which in this context that
80% of the value is going to come from
20% of the features
nothing is built perfectly the first
time it's futile to think that
perfection can be achieved the first
time rather the best solutions evolve
through iterative development in the
traditional planning approach the scope
is fixed and the schedule and budget is
variable
however in dsdm that's flipped upside
down so the schedule and the budget are
fixed and the scope is variable this
means that the project will end once the
schedule and budget constraints have
been met the 80/20 rule is used to
establish a guaranteed minimum usable
subset of features and then if there is
remaining schedule and budget capacity
additional work can be done the five
core techniques in dsdm are iterative
development this of course is the
evolutionary approach to software
development that is a founding concept
in agile time boxing time boxing is the
technique where the amount of time for
the duration of an activity a meeting or
an effort is fixed in dsdm iterations
are time boxed and once the duration has
been established it is never changed
moscow prioritization where M stands for
must S stands for should C stands for
could and W stands for won't the items
in the product backlog are prioritized
where m are the must-haves s's are the
shoulds and are highly desirable these
are those things that would be nice to
have and the W's are the won't items
those are the things that do not add
value and should not be developed a
facilitated workshop is a collaborative
event in which the participants focus on
creating correcting or documenting a
solution or deliverable
in dsdm facilitated workshops are used
primarily for planning efforts modeling
is a discovery technique used to create
the best solution for the requirement or
feature okay so now we're going to talk
about lean the genesis of lean software
development is in lean manufacturing
which originated with the Toyota
Production system
Tom and Mary poppendieck applied lean
manufacturing to software development
this method focuses on the elimination
of waste irregularities and overuse and
includes the following principles
eliminate waste anything that does not
add value to the customer is considered
waste
amplify learning learning is amplified
by using short iterations refactoring
and integration testing as well as
frequent customer feedback sessions the
site as late as possible the best way to
manage uncertainty is by gaining
information minimizing assumptions
deferring commitment to the last
responsible moment and breaking
dependencies between components deliver
as early as possible short iterations or
small batches provide valuable feedback
opportunities and allow for effective
decision-making empower the team the
team is the source of decision-making
and management turns to the team to
understand the best options and their
costs build integrity in ensure that
quality is embedded throughout the
system by requiring automation of
testing through builds installs and
continuous integration lean software
development can be summarized as follows
think big act small fail fast learn
rapidly waste can constitute up to 90%
of a process therefore we must be
constantly looking for ways to eliminate
it Mary and Tom poppendieck contrasted
waste in manufacturing with software
development and came up with the
following types of waste in software
development
overproduction looks like extra features
excess inventory looks like partially
completed work unnecessary processing
looks like extra processes unnecessary
movement of goods looks like
task-switching unnecessary movement of
people looks like endlessly splitting
resources across teams and then waiting
time and defects are the same in both
manufacturing and software development
Kanban also has its genesis in the
Toyota Production system
Kanban a Japanese term for a signal
board is used to manage the throughput
of processes by identifying bottlenecks
setting work-in-progress limits and
displaying the status of the entire
process in one view in a Kanban board
the value chain or the steps in the
process are represented by columns and
as capacity is available or the need
arises items are pulled from the left to
the right across the columns in a
just-in-time manner
Kanban uses three steps visualize the
workflow by creating columns for each
step in the process manage the flow by
minimizing the work-in-progress and
continuously improve the process by
applying Kaizen principles DevOps is an
emerging discipline that is fast
becoming a critical element of agile
methods let's take a look at how and why
it works in short agile teams develop
functionality and create value for the
business operations teams are the
interface with the business and take
over this functionality from the
development team then they deploy this
functionality into production and that
is when value is realized by the
business we can see here how a dev team
delivers valuable features sprint after
sprint after sprint
however the operations team is only able
to deploy them once every three months
in other words much of the vow
that was created by the development team
was on hold and not able to be realized
by the business DevOps does as you can
see here is it combines the dev and ops
teams into a synergistic process that
ensures quicker deployment of the value
created by the development team ops
teams are involved right from the
product and visioning to initiation to
building to testing
they provide the non-functional
requirements and provide the
infrastructure necessary for deploying
the system up front as soon as the dev
team has completed working software at
the end of a sprint the ops team is
ready to take over and set it up ideally
in an automated fashion
in short DevOps is the science of moving
code from development to testing in a
stage environment to production or in
general from one environment to another
in an automated and efficient manner
agile teams cannot do this without
strong support from DevOps DevOps is
supplemented by a strong toolset related
to build and deployment management
systems our discussion about DevOps
leads us to another important thing the
systems development by agile must
ultimately be transitioned into
operations and be integrated into the
services that IT renders to the business
these services are managed and delivered
through IT Service Management which is
governed by ITIL practices just as we
need to get ops working closely with the
dev processes we must also connect the
IT lifecycle with the development
lifecycle
the product owner brings up a product
requirement in the form of an improved
user story or epoch with a business case
which must also become part of the
overall IT service strategy the
transition of the features into the
sprint backlog must be aligned with the
design of the service as the agile team
is developing the feature
the service transition plan must be in
place so that the developed features can
be integrated into the operations in a
smooth and seamless manner agile and
ITIL roles must either be combined or
they must collaborate closely to enable
smooth transition of products into the
service management world looking at the
top left the service owner and the
product owner could either be the same
person or they must collaborate closely
to clearly represent the customers needs
when a product is deployed it
transitions into the delivery of a
service to the business and the
end-to-end understanding of the
lifecycle enables clearer visualization
of customer value the product owner must
either be part of or lead the change
management advisory board or cab because
the product owner is responsible for
determining the priority of user stories
and releases just as the scrum master is
working with the development team to
continuously improve the development
cycle the continual service improvement
CSI manager works to ensure the services
linked to the products are also
improving if there are any issues across
the value chain the two must collaborate
to ensure that they are constantly being
reviewed and improved let's summarize
the topics covered in this lesson the
traditional waterfall approach is
logical however change is cumbersome and
expensive when it comes to agile methods
Crystal is strong on communication dsdm
is good at time boxing and
prioritization and XP has robust
engineering practices agile and scrum
techniques have to be complemented by
DevOps processes in order to ensure that
the value developed can be deployed
quickly and seamlessly agile and scrum
should also link to IT Service
Management because products are
ultimately tied to business services
supported by IT operations
