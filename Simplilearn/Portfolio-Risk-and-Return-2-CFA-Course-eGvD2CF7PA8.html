simply learn your pace your place
portfolio risk and return to volume for
study session 12 reading 44 portfolio
management
how I candidate welcome back this is
reading 44 of the simply learned cfa
level 1 tutorial in a last tutorial we
discussed the measures of return and a
risk including the variance of a
portfolio and the covariance of two
assets we learn to calculate the
variance of a portfolio we discussed
various theories to attain an optimal
portfolio one of the theories we
emphasized was utility theory and
indifference curves and how indifference
curves and utility theory relates risk
and return we studied the concept of the
efficient frontier line and we analyzed
various graphs and use the capital
allocation line to get a clear
understanding of the optimal selection
of a portfolio this session is on
reading 44 as prescribed by the CFA
Institute loading outcome statement or
LOL we have learned about LOL in the
first session please go through the
learning outcome statement for a
detailed list of learning outcomes after
this lesson the candidates should be
able to interpret the risk and return of
a portfolio and ultimately choose an
optimal portfolio for a better return
agenda the agenda of the session is the
cover reading 44 as prescribed by the
cfa level one curriculum you can go
through this reading from volume 4 of
the cfl level 1 curriculum made

this lesson we will start by
understanding the basics about the
market and how the optimal risky
portfolio is formed we will discuss how
the capital allocation line is
transformed to the capital market line
for a market portfolio we will learn how
the capital market line extends beyond
the optimal risky portfolio for leverage
portfolios we will learn about
systematic and non systemic risks and
various return generating models under
return generating model we will focus on
single factor models and the capital
asset pricing model we will discuss
assumptions limitations and uses of capm
as per the learning outcome statement
after completion of this lesson the
candidate should be able to describe the
implications of combining a risk-free
asset with a portfolio of risky assets
explain the capital allocation line or
see Al and the capital market line or
CML explain systematic and non
systematic risk including why invest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
