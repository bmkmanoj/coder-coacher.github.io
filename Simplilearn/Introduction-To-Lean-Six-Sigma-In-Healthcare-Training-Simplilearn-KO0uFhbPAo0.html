applications in healthcare course
offered by simply learn hi my name is
Patrick presswire and I'll be your
instructor for this course
I'm a certified Lean Six Sigma master
black belt with over 15 years of
hands-on experience in continuous
improvement methodologies in both the
public and private sectors out of which
six years have been in the healthcare
domain I have completed numerous
projects resulting in increased
efficiencies and improved service
quality and have taught coached and
mentored numerous practitioners along
the way today I'll be teaching you to
apply Lean Six Sigma methodologies and
tools in a healthcare setting as you
already know there is little room for
error when it comes to healthcare simple
mistakes can impact hundreds of people
and worse yet can lead to fatalities
according to the Journal of healthcare
finance medical errors cost the US over
nineteen point five billion dollars in
2008 the Institute of medicines 1998
breakthrough report to err is human
estimated there were 98 thousand
preventable deaths that year due to
medical errors in 2008 that figure had
ballooned to 200 thousand deaths a year
that's five hundred and forty eight
deaths a day or 23 deaths an hour almost
every two minutes somebody in the u.s.
dies because of a medical error besides
the fact that continuous process
improvement can decrease waste improve
productivity and also increase
effectiveness and efficiencies in health
care or any other industry for that
matter Lean Six Sigma can go a long way
in reducing these devastating
preventable deaths a health care
practitioner who understands how to use
the tools and methodologies to
systematically resolve problems and
improve the quality of care is well
positioned to become a highly valued
asset to their organization they not
only prevent deaths but also improve the
quality of patient care and reduce
operating costs there are plenty of
opportunities for improvement in health
care just take a look at the news
headlines on any given day to get an
idea of how many health care and
provement opportunities there are in
this course we'll go through a sample
project that takes you through the
entire process of conducting an
improvement project starting with
identifying the problem defining the
project measuring and analyzing the data
in order to determine the vital few
factors that will lead to the greatest
improvement then we will learn how to
determine and implement a solution
successfully in the long term in
addition to the introduction and
concluding modules this course is
divided into six main modules each
covering a different phase of the Lean
Six Sigma methodology it is highly
recommended that you follow the modules
in the order that they are presented as
this is how a typical project will be
conducted at the end of this course you
can expect to have a practical
understanding of how to use the
methodology and some of the tools to
conduct your own improvement project in
a healthcare setting please keep in mind
that this course is in no way meant to
replace actual Lean Six Sigma
certification courses which cover all
the tools you can have in your
improvement arsenal the objective of
this course is to demonstrate through
the use of a relevant sample project how
to apply the methodology and use some of
those tools a key takeaway is to realize
that you don't need to use every tool
available to you on every project that
would be the same as using a saw hammer
pliers and drill for every home
improvement project it just doesn't work
that way that being said as you gain
experience with improvement projects you
will find that some tools are used more
often than others the sample project in
this course highlights some of those
tools so without further ado on behalf
of simply learn I wish you good luck for
the course welcome and let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
