technology is changing by the day there
is an urgent need for working
professionals to stay relevant by
retooling and rescaling themselves fill
in this huge skill and knowledge vacuum
is the bangalore base simply learn the
brainchild of krishna kumar ranked among
the top 10 most influential education
brands by LinkedIn simply learn is the
world's biggest provider of online
training and certification courses with
over 400 courses offered simply learn
has trained more than 5 lakh
professionals since its inception in
April 2010 interestingly simply learn
which has a footprint in over 150
countries started out as a blog by
Krishna Kumar in 2009 to share ideas and
tutorials on project management our
philosophy has always been professionals

look at professionals who has already
worked in that area has a credibility
and he works along with us in designing
our courses so that he can teach to

first round of institutional investment
of three million dollars from calorie
capture in 2012 in 2013 it raised 10
million dollars from Helion in Series B
funding in 2015 it raised 15 million
dollars from Mayfield in the same year
it also acquired market motive a silicon
valley-based leading digital marketing
training company according to Kumar the
aim is to shake professionals out of
their stupor that once they land a job
the process of Ries killing and
relearning is on the company it's trying
to instill into people that the onus
here is on individuals to train
themselves to rise up the corporate
ladder but I think it's high time for
people to realize that the way you
invest and real estate the way you
invest and born you need to invest in
yourself which is like upgrading your
own knowledge and once people start
doing it once people they start
realizing that they have to take care of
their career not really leave it to fate
I think that will be the point
this market will really start growing
very rapidly and it's good for them good
for the country good for everyone well
simply land is giving more power to
working professionals to scale up the
corporate ladder further and faster
