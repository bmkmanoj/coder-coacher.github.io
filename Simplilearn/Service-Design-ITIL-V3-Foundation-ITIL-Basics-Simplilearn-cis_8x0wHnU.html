design IT services in alignment with
governing policies IT practices and
processes another purpose of service
design is to understand the service
providers strategy so that these
services can be incorporated into the
supported environment ensure high
quality services delivered and
cost-effective service provision and
customer satisfaction is achieved the
objective of service design is to design
IT services efficiently and effectively
to avoid major improvements identify
changing trends in business which may
lead to opportunities for the
improvement of services and solutions
and ensure that continual service
improvement is included in all service
design activities to sustain their
effectiveness the scope of service
design is to interpret and design new
existing or modified business
requirements management information
systems and tools technology management
and architecture systems measurement
methods and metrics and all processes
essential for effective service design
service design offers benefits to
business such as lower total cost of
ownership TCO of services improved
quality of service delivery improved
consistency of the service as services
are designed within the corporate
strategy architectures and constraints
simpler implementation of new or
modified services improved services
being aligned with the needs of the
business improved effectiveness of
performances with incorporation and
recognition of capacity financial
availability and IT service continuity
plans and improved IT administration in
the next screen we will discuss the
responsibilities of a process manager in
the service design phase two key roles
in the service design phase are the
process manager and the process
practitioner the responsibilities of the
process manager include collaborating
with the process owner to plan and
coordinate process activities
managing the resources assigned to each
process coordinating with other process
managers and service owners for smooth
running of services working with the
process owner and the CSI manager to
check and prioritize improvements in the
CSI register and ensuring that all
activities under process are carried out
as required throughout the service
lifecycle and improvements are made in
their implementations in the next screen
we will discuss the responsibilities of
the process practitioner the
responsibilities of the process
practitioner include ensuring all
activities are carried out in a process
working with stakeholders process
managers co-workers users and customers
to ensure that their contributions are
effective ensuring inputs outputs and
interfaces for activities in a process
are correct and creating and maintaining
records to ensure that tasks are
executed correctly there are four p's or
attributes that drive the concept of IT
service design they are partner or
supplier people product or technology
and process the partner or supplier
perspective takes into account the
importance of the relationship between
the organization and the partner or
external supplier which contributes to
service delivery the people perspective
includes IT staff customers and other
stakeholders for example it involves
identifying whether the staff has the
required knowledge and skills to perform
their roles the product or technology
perspective takes into account IT
services technology and tools the
process perspective relates to the
end-to-end delivery of a service based
on the process flow it includes
activities responsibility assignment
matrix also called RACI and dependencies
quality IT service management ensures
that all four perspectives are taken
into account as part of the continual
service improvement of the IT
organization when designing new or
modified services these four
perspectives are considered and catered
in order to ensure success in service
design transition and eventual adoption
by customers
in the next screen we will discuss the
service design package a service design
package or SDP helps document all
aspects of an IT service it is produced
when a new IT service is offered or a
major change is expected in an IT
service it is also produced when an IT
service is retired the SDP should be
created during the design stage and
passed to the service transition stage
an SDP starts with documenting the
business requirements of an IT service
for each stage of the service lifecycle
it also includes service applicability
and contacts such as customer contacts
and functional and service level
requirements other components of an SDP
