support static testing help us in
identifying the defects early in the
development lifecycle thereby improving
the cost-effectiveness of identifying
and fixing the defects this broad
category can further be divided into
review tools static analysis tools and
modeling tools let us look at each
category of tools for better
understanding of their features review
tools provide support to the review
process typical features of these tools
include review planning and process
storing review comments and
communication with relevant people
tracking review comments metrics
collection and reporting on key factors
static analysis tools are normally used
by developers as part of the development
process and for component testing the
key aspect of these tools is that the
code is not executed or run features of
static analysis tools include support to
calculate metrics such as cyclone metric
complexity or nesting levels in force
coding standards analyze structure and
dependencies aid in code understanding
identify anomalies or defects in the
code modeling tools supports the
validation of models of the software or
system modeling tools are typically used
by developers and can help in the design
of the software one strong advantage of
both modeling tools and static analysis
tools is that they can be used before
dynamic tests can be run which enables
any defects that these tools can find to
be identified as early as possible when
it is easier and cheaper to fix them
there are also fewer defects left to
propagate into later stages so
development can be speeded up and there
is less rework features modeling tools
include support for identifying
inconsistencies and defects within the
model helping to identify and prioritize
areas of the modeling for testing
predicting system response and behavior
under various situations such as level
of load helping to understand system
functions and identify test conditions
using a modeling language such as UML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
