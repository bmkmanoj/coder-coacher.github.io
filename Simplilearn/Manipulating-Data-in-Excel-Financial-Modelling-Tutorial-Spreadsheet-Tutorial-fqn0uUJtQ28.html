to be part one spreadsheet data
manipulation introduction hello and
welcome to the lesson on spreadsheet
data manipulation of the financial
modelling course by simply learn this
lesson is about advanced Excel functions
for financial modeling a financial model
can be built to represent a financial
asset portfolio business project or any
other investment the model will perform
calculations in order to analyze the
performance of the investment and
provide direction regarding possible
actions or alternatives financial models
can be constructed in many ways by the
use of computer software or even with a
pen and paper although purpose-built
software does exist the vast proportion
of the market is spreadsheet-based this
is largely since the models are almost
always company specific Microsoft Excel
now has by far the dominant position the
presentation we will go over today will
show how to use Excel to provide
financial modeling solutions and with
the use of some concrete practical
examples should give you a broad
overview of the built-in functions which
provide efficient and accurate financial
calculations now let's move on to our
agenda agenda in corporate finance
investment banking and the accounting
profession financial modeling is largely
synonymous with cash flow forecasting
this usually involves the preparation of
detailed company specific models used
for decision-making purposes and
financial analysis to create these
models as accurately as possible large
amounts of data will need to be collated
in this presentation we will show you
how to use search functions to filter
and sort through the data to get what we
require we will also look at how to sort
through the data easier by naming
columns and cells and finally we will
look at the use of excel solver tool for
performing analysis on our sorted
now let's get started with this exciting
presentation search functions are
extremely useful and powerful in Excel
when dealing with data tables as
mentioned previously when modeling we
have large and complex data tables which
we will need to extract specific data
from there are two main search functions
which are used which are vlookup and H
look up vlookup allows you to search a
table that is set up vertically that is
all of the data is set up in columns and
each column is responsible for one kind
of data h lookup is the exact same
function but looks up data that has been
formatted by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
