the cloud service provider CSP security
security risks associated with cloud
computing are unique a holistic
understanding of all the parties
involved in the cloud supply chain such
as people processes and technology the
important in evaluating the right cloud
service provider this model of
philosophy of CSP must be resolved
approved and closed before proceeding
let us look at few factors to be
considered to assess the CSP security
the first factor in assessing the CSP
security is procedures providers must
make a list of consumer related
documents and also keep them available
for review the documents are usually
non-disclosure agreements background
checks done by third party vendors
cliffs aggregation of roles user access
administration and user access reviews
the second factor in assessing the CSP
security is the security guard personnel
the security staff guards and
supervisors are posted at the facility
24 bar 7 for monitoring purposes the
site infrastructure should have the
facilities to check the employees
contractual staff and visitor
credentials and to use a sign-in log
additionally issuing the visitor badges
curbing tailgating by employees handling
the visitors within the facility
handling phone calls for security
installing fire alarm systems patrolling
inside the facility executing emergency
response procedures accepting and
dispatching mail and such other
practices must be followed the third
factor in assessing the CSP security is
the environmental security
the facility should protect its
personnel and the environment from
environmental hazards the facility
should Mendut orally provide necessary
safety equipment to handle any
unforeseen events these equipment needs
to be placed in the proper location with
the right temperature and humidity
further clear methods and procedures to
destroy and discard the data should be
in place apart from this maintenance of
the equipment should be carried out
regularly as per the supply recommended
intervals right measures should be taken
during the transportation of equipment
on and off campus and all the equipment
related data including repairs to be
done needs to be maintained
maintaining and monitoring these
documents shows the maturity of the
provider organization physical security
is as important as information security
as the data can coexist with other
clients not associated to any individual
data can coexist with other clients due
to sharing of resources and
infrastructure in the next slide we will
discuss the business continuity concept
in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
