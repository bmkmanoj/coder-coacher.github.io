CEO of simpler than mr. Krishna Kumar to
deliver p welcome note and introduce our
speakers
good morning everyone and thanks
pressure pressure on for giving me this
opportunity so good morning everyone and
a warm welcome to project management +
conference on building high-performance
team it's my firm belief that same set
of team members can produce widely
different results and under two
different project managers so today we
are going to learn how and why that
happens it's also widely said that if a
project succeeds it's because of the
project because of the team and if it is
if it fails it's because of the project
manager so for a project manager it's
very important to understand how to how
to in how to involve how to engage how
to inspire your team members to produce
wonderful results so without taking much
of your time I'll straight away go to
the topics and introduce you to the
eminent speakers of today's conference
now this also we form at simple and we
formally from firmly believe in this
that the P in p.m. is not only about
project management it is also about
people management and that is why the
topic for today's conference is how to
build high-performance team so the first
topic for today is great idea or a great
team so what do you believe in is a
great idea or a great team or a balanced
mix of both so today we have dr. pearl
of sahar report at apollo bunder podria
sorry there to talk to give us some kind
of insight on this particular topic dr.
paula has 24 years of industry
experience and currently hits the HR
function at citrix for both their R&amp;amp;D as
well as the services team dr. below is a
doctorate in human resource development
from xlri jamshedpur so i will come dr.
paolo the next topic is going to be like
building cohesive team now many a times
we hear that project failed because
there was not proper coordination
between the team and it becomes more
evident when there are when there are
crisis people start blaming each other
so how do we go ahead and build a team
that really sticks together when there
are crisis and we have mr. Vera 30 who
is a director with yahoo india to speak
about this topic
bharath has more than a decade of
experience in managing team across
geographies and building teams teams
from ground sir I will come mr. Baruth
and thank you for being part of this
conference post that we are going to
look at easier team azle daily stand-up
meetings now gone are the days where
project used to produce releases every
couple of months today businesses are
very agile everyone wants results every
day and thats where is oil project
management has become the thing and one
of the popular is I'll technique is
daily stand-up meetings wherein we try
to understand what kind of work is going
to happen on that particular day what
kind of dependency we have from each of
this work and what are the best
practices of doing that so we have mr.
Cheryl jhulka to speak about this topic
sheriff has more than a decade of
experience in managing and coaching
agile teams so welcome sheriff and thank
you for being part of this conference
next we are going to look at me the
topic is meaningful metrics asain team
so you all know that if you cannot
measure you cannot manage so what kind
of measurements you can do about your
team performance or there is something
that is very unique and I I found it
very unique because so far I was only
aware about being measurements related
to the work but not related to team
performance so today we have mr. motions
Roz associate vice president with
collabera to speak about this topic he
is he he hits the quality practice at
culebra and he is the key person behind
the high maturity initiative at
collabera and currently is also working
on a very innovative stuff which is like
building some alternate measurement
framework for collabera in terms of
managing the softer performance so I
welcome mr. Moussa Zara's for this event
and thank you for being part of this
even the next topic is again it's not
very common it's like a little off the
bit see many times we heard team members
saying that my project is very boring I
wanted some I want some kind of
challenging stuff now imagine a scenario
you you are a project manager wherein
you need to motivate your team for
getting result and in the process of
doing so the life of your team member
itself is in danger in those kind of
scenario how
do you still go ahead and motivate your
team to achieve the desired result so we
have mr. conducts for me to speak about
this topic a brief introduction about
mr. kandaswamy he's a government officer
from Tamil Nadu Karen and he was the
project director for tsunami relief
project that was initiated by thermal
ado government couple of years back when
the tsunami hit tamil nadu and he has
come to be a part of this event on our
invitation and I think he's already here
so I will come mr. under Swami for this
even and thank you for being part of
this event on is speaking on this topic
the next is the next topic is again
related to Israel and in this topic we
are going to talk about how team should
organize on their own now now the
popular belief is that there is a
project manager and there is a team the
project manager is supposed to organize
team members based on how the project is
going on at based on how the activities
are divided among team members but in
case of an agile project environment
team members are supposed to get
organized on their own there they are
not supposed to to look for for
directions from project managers all the
time they're supposed to get self
organized now how that happens and and
what is important for that to happen we
have mr. Gregory Smith to speak about
the topic mr. Smith is a CST which is
like a certified scrum tray trainer from
scar imbalance for your information
there are only 140 csts in the world and
only two from Indian origin mr. Smith is
on invitation from simply learn to
conduct some training on our behalf and
he's going to speak about this topic I
welcome mr. Smith and thank you for
being part of this even the next topic
is again not really related to the
technical stuff it's it's about like
understanding your team see while as a
project manager we constantly look at
achieving result sometimes we forget
that the people who are working in the
team are actually human being they have
their own priorities they have their own
aspirations they have their own personal
goal so how do you go about aligning
their personal aspirations their
personal galoot project goal and that's
where we have mr. Chetan Bhagat to speak
about the topic
chethan doesn't need any introduction
he's a famous writer and the reason why
we we thought of getting chethan to
speak about this topic because he
connects very well with people in
general through his writings and we
thought he is the best suited to speak
about how to understand your team
aspirations and then look at aligning
that to the project goal so I will come
chattin and thank you for being part of
this even the next topic is coaching
team for excellence right and as a
project manager all of first coach our
team for excellence or at least we try
to do that so is there a structured way
of doing that and that's where we have a
professor biology to speak about this
topic he is the EVP at Symphony
university at symphony simply services
private limited professor policy has 20
years of teaching experience and plus 10
years of experience in software industry
and he has he has developed multiple
courses and for symphony and I will come
in for this particular confidence thank
you for being part of the conference
professor biology then the last session
for the day is going to be a panel
discussion on troubleshooting your team
the DA is going to be troubleshooting
your team and we have Mr Shearer either
publicity to speak about this to
moderate this session mrs. publicity is
the chief operating officer at centre of
public policy at iron bangalore and he
is a regular speaker at various national
and international conferences and I
thank you mr. machete a publicity to be
to be part of this conference with that
i will let dr. paula start our first
session which is like a great idea or a
great team thank you and I welcome you
again for being part of this conference
thank you
good morning
it's always advantageous to speak at the
beginning and then speaking assignment
is little different than you know team
assignments what we do in organizations
because before even you speak you get a
bouquet so you know it's just like but
then it also means it sets expectation
right so I'm sure many of you have lot
of experience in terms of leading
project teams so when you get inside the
organization and you are given a very
very challenging project that's also is
built in so I have exactly 45 minutes to
talk about a topic which you can I guess
even 45 days we can continue to talk
about this whether you require a great
idea or great team so within this 45
minutes i'll try to build in and my way
of understanding when my asked me to
actually speak on this topic I kind of
started realizing and mostly I use my
own experience and my understanding
about my two decades of experience and
and also as I said I met one of my
colleague show v2 is attending the
program and I was telling and this
apology to all those who don't come from
IT industry but as I have about 24 years
experience in human resource development
and out of that about 17 years in ID so
i am very biased so my apology whatever
i am going to talk not to take from IT i
have just a little bit from na nighty
but that's more of in a sense of how do
we talk about manage teams manage or
build great tips so let me start sort of
I think we must first set the context we
are talking about being successful in
knowledge economic right and for that
you need great team or great ideas right
so let me start my proposition from
defining what I thought knowledge
economy is doing because my entire
presentation is based on that assumption
and I started looking when I as i was
telling i was i was just thinking what
is knowledge economy doing which has an
impact generally on both teams how do
you form teams and how do you form ideas
and when i talk about that in knowledge
economy so i thought let me just start
with that thoughts i think a couple of
things is happening and i will talk
about the three trends which is my own
observation you may or disagree but let
me just put my proposition I thought
what knowledge economy is doing the
shifting of value from access to
understanding and perspective before
knowledge economy all that you had is
how do you get an access and when I
saying and somebody might say oh there
is a typical management jargon and
therefore as you can see the example I
will give about Samsung many of you
would know but this has been a very
famous case study how Samsung build
their TV the flat screen LED LCD TVs
right and of course the thing is LEDs up
the thing earlier is started with LCD
then led right TVs what is that made
Samsung have this breakthrough because
when Samsung was kind of looking at the
revolution of TV and all over the world
everybody is trying to get right Sony
and everybody was concentrating on you
know how bright is the picture how many
features you can add very very common to
IT product development right so I am
offering this feature this is what is
happening sharper thing sharper picture
right you can do so many things where
the people too
long story short what did the Samsung
guys did they were absorbing in United
States the people when the shift the
house or they renovate their house they
realize the TV is no more a source of
entertainment the decision for buying TV
even in United States is with the
housewives and the house why see those
TVs as a part of the whole design of
your drawing room or bedroom and they
were the first to understand and that's
what i call it understanding and
perspective where everybody else was
talking about the feature the talking
about they talked about the flat screen
and all this the design purely from
perspective of using pv as like a sofa
set or a tea boy or a dressing table or
something which is next to your bed and
then rest is history you started having
TV which is hung on the wall is the
interior designer who started talking
and if you go to antara designer right I
have been talking up into a new flat and
I'm talking and the first thing he said
where you are going to keep the TV right
it's a part of interior design now many
years back the Samsung folks understood
this is it not a breakthrough thinking a
break to idea yes or no okay many many
stories many many case studies enough
has been written but i'll just talk
about what i have seen as a team and I
thought what knowledge economy is doing
they are transforming information to
wisdom lot of people know the the the
people who started Google they started
realizing because both of them came from
a research family
and those of you have done research you
know one of the things is to take
references and when you do references
when my time and I did my doctorate
program I didn't have google tried to go
to the library to right now very painful
process right and they started giving
information to people because that's
where the business idea came that search
is a big business and it's given to you
free of cost and rest is history right
with the company none of us pay for the
search but they are billions of dollars
because they knew they can capture
people's mind and that's the best way of
providing information I was talking to
one my cousin I don't know how many of
you remember when he was a student in
IIT Kharagpur eyes to leave in Calcutta
used to come to my home and he was
telling me a couple of days back i went
to calculate to speak in one of the
forums of times of india so I met him
after long time and he was telling do
you remember eyes to come to your home
and wish to go and walk past a Hazara
road there is a place called haja road
junction where people will cook noodles
to feed you free of cost because nobody
indian housewife ever never thought
about noodles and noodles then created a
history right convenience so similarly I
think it is no more information the
value is shifting purely from
information that's what google did but
that's what they don't get their dollars
from they give you information they
capture your mind and that's how they
have believed building one of the most
profitable billion-dollar ventures the
third trend again often repeated tons of
books have written and as you can make
out I am a great fan of apple so I am a
great fan of Steve Jobs leadership and
I'm sure many of you there are tons of
books at
I i have read at least seven books
recently which has come up including his
biography what does it say to me I say
it in simple Tom steel job is a guy if
you see from his early days you go to
blogs you go to youtube right and you
just type Steve job and then things will
come including some of his photographs
where he had his long hairs when he was
looking young and he was thinking about
the Macintosh and the design and if you
go there you will realize one thing is
very consistent he is a tech creator
whatever you might say Samsung has I
mean I don't want to get into that
something is a great company is doing
great but have they created anything
there's so many technologies this guy
went on creating so I call it tech
creators and critical thinkers he has
always challenged I have a friend in us
who's walks with my team my colleague in
santa clara i used to work for nokia
long time and he told me the story i
don't know how many of you know that
initially when they were developing the
phone Apple went into a collaboration
with Nokia and as it happens with many
of us that's a problem with us and
individual an organization when you
think you have known everything that's
where your false starts because after
six months nokia started telling you
want to teach us phone give me a break
and they broke and colleague of mine
actually work for nokia in santa clara
so he seen it the relationship breaking
away and steve and he called the people
and told the developers I want
everything to be done in one click and
as usual the developers I said it's not
possible he said I don't care but that's
what my customer care can you created
one touch
so I think knowledge economy has again
shifted value from technologies to take
creators and critical thinkers so you
need to think of these three trend I
thought there could be many but that's
what I looked at it and therefore I
built my proposition and the proposition
is very simple if you look at all this
what does it say God has given us both
right what a God has given and most of
your good project managers you should
have both in in very very good quantity
to be successful left brain and right
bed and Daniel pink who is one of my
favorite authors has written this book
it is almost four years back he said
20th century is only going to be the
left brain people 21st century is going
to be for the right brain people the
book is called right brain will prevail
and he talks about case studies where
people from Yale Medical College were
trained in art appreciation scores and
afterwards they have found their
efficiency has increased by twenty-five
percent those of you are interested to
read the book fabulous book Daniel pink
the right brain will people travel so my
point is if you see this trend and
that's what i am trying to tell it's not
only the great idea I believe great
ideas can come only from a holistic
perspective 21st century is no more left
brain I am sorry to say that 21st
century is going to be left and right
brain put together and as I always say
God has the biggest wisdom and that's
why he gets given as both the only
problem is we have not been using it
I've been working with product companies
for long including my initial strain
doesn't you know are we working with the
start of us a skill and lot of people
ask me why in India product companies
don't come I mean fact halfway through
one of my art
says why Facebook is not born out of the
back lanes of basavangudi and hopefully
it will get published so my thought is
we have not been able to integrate the
left and right brain that's the simple
reason and that's what 21st century
requires and that's what you require to
succeed in knowledge economy so this is
my favorite slide please use both it's
no more the question of and as I often
say this if the right knee has left me
then can my left knee be right I repeat
if the right we write me has left me
then can my left be be right it is not
either-or proposition so great ideas as
i have shown in case of samsung as i
have shown in case of you know google in
the case of Steve Jobs leadership and
I'm very careful i have said google led
by steve jobs we have to see how the
organization performs after step jobs
obviously it will either prove or
disapprove lot of things about
leadership in 21st century so let's
watch right so i don't want to say but
only thing i can say therefore the ideas
which should come and take both so
therefore my second proposition is great
ideas can come only from a holistic
perspective what does it mean you need a
diverse thinking recent 2020 has proved
that gone are the days of superstar
tony's is a lowly rated west indian team
known more for their dances than cricket
we lost only one game and we are out of
20 20 right so it has to come from
diverse thinking and how do you get i
was thinking you have a great team and
therefore when i go i have my third
proposition all that i am talking about
indian context and for last few years
though I
for an American multinational most of my
life work for American companies with do
apologies I think we need to look around
