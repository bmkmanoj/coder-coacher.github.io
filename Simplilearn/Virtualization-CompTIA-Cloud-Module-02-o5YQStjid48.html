keeps costing low enhances flexibility
and simplifies management if the IT
staff spends all of their time in
managing IT they won't be able to
introduce innovation however we need our
infrastructure to help us in the
marketplace to help us innovate to help
us to be more competitive to help us
succeed today success demands agility we
need to adjust to the changes in our
business to the changes from our
customers and to the changes in the
world this is where virtualization comes
into the picture virtualization is a
technology which offers agility to a
business it is a technique that creates
virtual version of our physical hardware
aka instances which provides more
efficient way to perform multi-tenancy
and resource utilization this has been
shown in figure 2 these instances can be
created using a hypervisor traditionally
software was categorized as system
software and application software but
now in the era of virtualization it is
categorized as system software
application software and hypervisor
examples for system software are like
Windows Linux etc examples of
application software are MS Office
Firefox etc
a hypervisor is a type of software which
is implemented in a machine to create
and manage instances thus it is also
called as virtual machine monitor or B
mm
examples of hypervisor are VMware ESX as
shown in figure 2 Citrix etc as we can
observe in the diagram the hypervisor in
this case is installed above the
hardware layer this hypervisor will make
sure that the hardware will be optimally
utilized and it will generate business
if applied with a proper strategy due to
the concept of virtualization the
multi-tenancy is achieved completely as
observed in figure 2 upper layer since
there exists isolation of hardware and
software any harm done by a tenant in
his instance will neither affect the
physical hardware nor other instances
due to isolated environment maintained
by the hypervisor thus we can say
virtualization forms a loosely coupled
architecture within a server array due
to such amazing feature the motto of
optimum resource utilization is totally
achieved by this technology which
results in a rise in profit in the next
slide we will discuss some
virtualization terminologies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
