financial risk manager frm par one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use bond prices discount
factors and arbitrage welcome to the
42nd lecture in your preparation for the
frm exam in the previous sessions we
have already learned about bonds and
their pricing in this session we will
again revisit bond pricing and extend
our learning concepts from bond pricing
have regularly been tested in the frm
examination you are therefore advised to
have a thorough understanding of the
concepts of bond cash flows discounting
yield measures spot rates and forward
rates let us begin our session
a gender the main agenda of our
discussion will be learning to calculate
bond prices using discount factors and
check for any opportunity for arbitrage
we will learn how to take advantage of
the arbitrage opportunity by
constructing a replicating portfolio
using different bonds the weights of
these bonds are taken in such a way that
the cash flows from the original bond
are exactly replicated you also learn to
construct the strict bonds using
treasury strips such as principal strips
called p strips and coupon strips called
C strips discount factors discount
factors are used to find the present
value of a future cash flow we have
already seen that the worth of a sum of
money in the future is less than that at
the present from the time value of money
concept we therefore apply a discount
factor to the cash flow in each period
in the future to arrive at the total
present value let us learn to find the
discount factor through an example
consider a zero-coupon six-month bond
trading at a current price of ninety
five dollars this bond will have a cash
flow of one hundred dollars after six
months if we multiply it with the
discount factor it should be the present
value or the current trading price of
ninety five dollars on calculation we
find the discount factor to be 0.95
suppose we want to find the discount
factor for more periods then we can take
another bond maturing in one year and
discount the cash flows using the
six-month discount rate and the one year
discount rate in this case the present
value is equated to the current price of
