of simply learns elearning course on six
sigma green belt training please move on
to the next slides to continue with this
course in this sixth lesson of this
e-learning course we will learn about
analyze phase of a Six Sigma project as
you might remember analyze phase is a
third phase of the DMACC process till
now we have completed the defined phase
and the measure phase in the defined
phase we selected the problem and then
formed the team in measure phase we
established a proper measurement system
so that data can be collected now we
move into analyzed phase analyze phase
largely deals with data analysis and
hypothesis testing let's look at the
agenda for this session we will start
the session with understanding the
reasons for variation in X we have
already discussed some reasons why X
varies and in this section we will
explore the topic more we will also try
and understand the basic cause mapping
tools which you need to know after
finishing these basics we will move to
exploratory data analysis which deals
with the multivariable studies in short
multivariable studies is also known as
multi very studies in multi very studies
we will first look at difference between
positional cyclicals and temporal
variation and then we will learn how to
apply sampling plans to investigate the
largest source of variation then we will
talk about the simple linear correlation
and regression we will also learn in
detail about correlation coefficient and
p-value finally we will talk about
difference between correlation and
causation and then interpret the linear
regression equation and its p value in
this session we will talk about why x
ares in the measure phase we have
already measured why and by the end of
measure phase we have also given some
kind of validation and correlation of an
X with Y that gave us to think that if X
varies y varies thus to control the
variations in why we need to control the
variations in X now to control
variations in eggs we must first know
what kind of causes result in X to vary
what you should know is this Six Sigma
approach doesn't mandate elimination of
variation it only says that variation
should be controlled to such an extent
that defects don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
