credit rating agencies we will also

external credit rating agencies and
provide access to its business books
including balance sheets cash flow
statements and projections the rating

matrix shows the frequency of default
over a given time horizon for bonds with
a given rating the example that is
highlighted in the slide shows the
transition of a firm from a rating of a
from a default rating which is 0% from a
rating of B to a default which is 5% and
