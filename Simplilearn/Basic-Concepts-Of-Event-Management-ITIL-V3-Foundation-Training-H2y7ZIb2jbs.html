event management principles and basic
concepts what are the types of events
that help us to analyze the trends /
problems there are many different types
of events and they are informational
warning and exception one events that
signify regular operation like
notification that a scheduled workload
has completed a user has logged in to
use an application and an email has
reached its intended recipient are
considered to be informational events -
exception event is an event which
signifies that something has failed
examples such as a user attempts to log
on to an application with the incorrect
password an unusual situation has
occurred in the business process that
may indicate an exception requiring
further business investigation for
example a web page alert indicates that
a payment authorization site is
unavailable impacting financial approval
of business transactions a device's CPU
is above the acceptable utilization rate
a PC scan reveals the installation of
unauthorized software events that
signify unusual but not exceptional are
considered to be warning these
situations may require closer monitoring
in some cases the condition will resolve
itself for example in the case of an
unusual combination of workloads as they
are completed normal operation is
restored in other cases operator
intervention may be required if the
situation is repeated or if it continues
for too long these rules or policies are
defined in the monitoring and control
objectives for that device or service
for example a servers memory utilization
reaches within 5% of its highest
acceptable performance level or the
completion time of a transaction is 10%
longer than normal next we will learn
about the key
of event management event management key
concepts in this slide we will
understand the flow of the event
management process first being the
occurrence of an event events occur
continuously but not all of them are
detected or registered it is therefore
important that everybody involved in
designing developing managing and
supporting IT services and the IT
infrastructure that they run on
understands what type of events need to
be detected most CIS are designed to
communicate certain information about
themselves in one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
