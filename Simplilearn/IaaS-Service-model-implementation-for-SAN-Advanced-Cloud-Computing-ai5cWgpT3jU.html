na s in module 2 of advanced cloud
computing course however let us now
discuss some new terminologies which
will help us to understand SI n and na s
from a practical viewpoint the first
terminology is block level storage block
level storage is a type of storage
allocation where a specified amount of
space is being allotted in raw format
the term rule format refers to the space
without a file system we have already
discussed the file system like NTFS f80
EXT etc
in module 2 of advanced cloud computing
course thus in terms of s am blog level
storage is considered to be an
allocation of hard disk drive to a
client system the difference is that the
hard drive is located in the network
computer typically in an essay mbox
block level storage allocation is used
only in terms of FC SI n or I scusi SI n
the second terminology is file level
storage file level storage is normally
used in case of mas environment in terms
of mas file level storage is a
pre-formatted shared folder provided to
the client based on the need in file
level storage a pre-formatted space is
being allotted to the user based on the
requirement provided by the user the
main advantage is that there is no
requirement that is to be satisfied by
the user when it comes to mas no special
operating system driver or hardware is
required by the user system to access
the shared folder service now that we
have the basic knowledge of block level
and file level storage let's understand
the practical difference between SI n
and mas in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
