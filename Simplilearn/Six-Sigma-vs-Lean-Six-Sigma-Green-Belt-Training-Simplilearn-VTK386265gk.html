value to customers with fewer resources
it means reducing unwanted activities or
processes that do not add value to the
product or service for the customer
the lien philosophy is to provide
perfect value to the customer through a
perfect value creation process that has
zero waste while the ultimate goal is to
achieve zero waste you may not always
get that in the first couple of tries
however you will achieve minimum waste
and continue to move toward zero waste
eventually
hence lien is the path towards
perfection Leena's about optimizing the
process from beginning to end
eliminating non value-adding activities
in VA s and increasing flow to ensure
that parts and services are provided to
customers more quickly if quality is the
word to describe Six Sigma then speed is
the word to describe lean let's
understand the importance of lean
there are many benefits of lien and some
of them are reduce cost reduce cycle
time more throughput and increase
productivity despite all of these
benefits lien is not implemented by most
of the organizations because of the
misconception that it is only suited in
manufacturing areas the reason for this
misconception is the beginning of lien
it began and grew in popularity in the
manufacturing areas starting with Toyota
in recent years one can notice more
applications of lien in other areas such
as healthcare and the transactional
space however the truth is that lien
concepts can be applied in any business
and in any process on the next screen
let's discuss how lean and Six Sigma
combine lean and Six Sigma are two
different principles or methodologies
that combine to form and create one
powerful continuous improvement
methodology
they have various overlapping goals
toward the improvement with the aim of
creating the most efficient system
though the approaches are different the
methods complement each other
Lean Six Sigma takes the power and rigor
of Six Sigma methodology and combines it
with lean concepts leading to faster
results better quality and improved
customer satisfaction let's look at the
differences between lean and Six Sigma
lean focuses on efficiency by
identifying value from the customers
point of view removing unnecessary steps
in the process and improving process
speed or velocity on the other hand Six
Sigma focuses on effectiveness with the
help of breakthrough processes
identifying root causes and reduction in
variation therefore when Six Sigma is
combined with lean it is possible to
achieve business transformation so
remember lean is about speed with a
focus on efficiency Six Sigma is about
quality with a focus on effectiveness
and Lean Six Sigma brings the best of
both together field a better result
first implement lean to streamline the
process this helps to understand the
chronic problems and the ways to handle
them quickly once the problem is
identified use Six Sigma methodology to
analyze the issues and provide business
improvement transformation in other
words lean is used to reduce the waste
and Six Sigma is used to reduce the
variation
