covered in this course let's now move on
to refresh our knowledge on ITIL basics
in the next slide ITIL is the most
widely adopted approach for IT Service
Management in the world it provides a
practical no-nonsense framework for
identifying planning delivering and
supporting IT services to the business
adopting ITIL can offer users a huge
range of benefits that include improved
IT services reduced costs improved
customer satisfaction through a more
professional approach to service
delivery improved productivity improved
use of skills and experience and
improved delivery of third-party service
we will study more about ITIL under the
topic foundation basics at the end of
this lesson
let us now understand the ITIL
intermediate which is the next level in
ITIL simplification ITIL 2011
intermediate level is the next level
after ITIL foundation ITIL intermediate
level has a modular structure with each
module focusing on different aspects of
ITIL they are service lifecycle and
service capability the intermediate
modules focuses more on detail oriented
study than the foundation level and is
an industry-recognized qualification
well on completion of your ITIL
foundation and prior choosing this
course
I am sure the thought on how one can
become an ITIL expert must have crossed
your mind let's get the answer to this
in the next slide
let us have a brief look at the ITIL
certification path the diagram in the
slide is the graphical depiction of the
ITIL certification path ITIL
certification path is based on credit
point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage till expert ITIL foundation is a
first certification which gives you two
credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from the two streams one life cycle and
two capability the life cycle modules
have all the standard five life cycle
phases as exams which provide three
credits each capability modules are more
focused towards implementation content
and have four exams which provide four
credits each you can choose any one of
the modules from either streams or make
a combination on the basis of your
experience in industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 point +2 of
foundation that is 17 credit points
makes you eligible for the third level
that is ma LC which provides you 5
credit points once you are certified mal
see your final score credit becomes 22
to become an ITIL expert there is no
separate exam you need to accumulate 22
credits to get the ITIL expert
certificate I'm sure we are clear on the
certification path let us understand the
service life cycle and its modules in
the next line
the service lifecycle modules are for
candidates who aspire to handle a
management or team lead role which
requires a broad management focus on
ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas service capability modules are for
the candidates who aspire to specialise
in process level knowledge in one or
more processes which focuses more on
day-to-day execution the different
modules of the service capability are
one service offerings and agreements SOA
to release control and validation RC v3
operations support and analysis OSA for
planning protection and optimization PPO
as we have an understanding of both the
streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide here is the difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you will see that life cycle is mainly
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also life cycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn more about the
differences on this slide
once you're done move on to learn about
mal C managing across the life cycle is
a last step in achieving the ITIL expert
certification therefore it is mainly
focused on individuals who want to
become ITIL experts on completing mal C
an individual can apply the ITIL
knowledge and it provides skills that
can be used in the workplace in a
tangible way we have already discussed
on the credit system in a certification
path slide however just to mention the
mal C certification gives you five
credit points now let us proceed to look
at the accreditation Institute for ITIL
in the next slide
