principles in mind set of the pmi-acp
certification course offered by simply
learn this is the first part of this
domain after completing this lesson you
will be able to define agile discuss
agile best practices describe agile
manifestos list the 12 principles of
agile list agile core principles and
practices discuss the benefits of agile
agile emphasizes on flexibility and
adaptability which is made possible by
implementing some of the best practices
from the software industry some of the
best practices recommended by agile are
face-to-face communication shorter
development cycle business and developer
collaboration working software as the
primary demonstration of progress
affective engineering practices frequent
demonstrations of progress and early
return on investment inspect and adapt
to business changes retrospectives and
continuous improvement agile evolved in
the late 1990s in response to the burden
of heavy documentation and frequent
changes to requirements it started as a
collection of lightweight and quality
driven approach to software development
some of the prominent techniques are
tested driven development it is based on
writing tests before writing the
software which creates a rich collection
of tasks continuous integration it
involves merging all developer working
copies with a shared main line several
times a day
refactoring it is the process of
restructuring existing computer code
without changing its external behavior
user stories it involves a technique
that captures the end-user requirements
and what users need to do as part of
their job function in one or more
sentences and simple language there are
12 principles given in the agile
manifesto such as number one our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of
valuable software number two welcomed
changing requirements even late in
development agile processes harness
change with a customer's competitive
advantage number three deliver working
software frequently from every couple of
weeks to a couple of months with the
preference to the shorter timescale
number four
businesspeople and developers must work
together daily throughout the project
number five build projects around
motivated individuals give them the
environment and support they need and
trust them to get the job done number
six the most efficient and effective
method of conveying information to and
within a development team is
face-to-face conversation number seven
working software is the primary measure
of progress
number eight agile processes promote
sustainable development the sponsors
developers and users should be able to
maintain a constant pace indefinitely
number nine continuous attention to
technical excellence and the good design
enhances agility number 10 simplicity
the art of maximizing the amount of work
not done is essential number 11 the best
architectures requirements and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams number
12 add regular in us the team reflects
on how to become more effective then
Tunes and adjust its behavior
accordingly
over time lean and Six Sigma techniques
began to infuse into agile practices
these include the following continuous
improvement Japanese ideas like Kaizen
began to appear in the form of
retrospective the entire team regularly
discussed what worked and what did not
in an iteration focus on the value chain
extend agile techniques particularly
pull across each segment of the value
chain
business value emphasis understand the
business value of work and prioritize
effort around this work and incremental
delivery deliver measurable value early
in the project lifecycle
the pmi-acp recognizes a number of core
agile principles and practices some of
them are as follows early delivery of
value through iterations with demos the
project should be broken into a series
of time-boxed iterations that include
demos to show progress to the
stakeholders user stories reflect
business value and priority user stories
are managed in a backlog prioritized by
the business value releases are
determined by the development velocity
and accepted as a production release
continuous involvement of the customer
per the agile principle business people
and developers must work together daily
throughout the project customers are
involved continuously and their inputs
are considered during the product
development
acceptance tests for all requirements
everyone in the team owns quality
standards and test automation agile
emphasizes the key principles just test
early or test often automate tests and
enable continuous integration wherever
possible retrospectives weekly team
retrospective should be conducted to
improve the project delivery efforts
sustainable pace or velocity team
members are involved in estimates and
commit dates overtime and weekend work
are undesirable
communication daily scrums should be
organized amongst the team members to
understand the accomplished tasks
pending tasks and complications in the
completion of the project high
visibility and nation on project status
progress and issues or risks should be
maintained in real-time and also on web
accessible tools
agile does not involve a big design and
requirement gathering upfront
predictions on project completion and
death march projects where project teams
make up the difference for poor
estimates with unpaid overtime further
it does not involve the use of tools
that force behaviors such as task
management tools top-down management and
control and heavy documentation
particularly status reports software
architecture diagrams software
requirements specifications and test
plans
agile has rapidly become one of the most
popular and effective techniques to
manage projects it is important to
understand its benefits such as emphasis
on collaboration team empowerment and
frequent demonstrations of progress
lightweight relying on whiteboards index
cards and facilitation techniques
appealing to developers with its
development focus faster time-to-market
and high priority features driving the
development lifecycle focus on full
instead of push simple to understand and
a contemporary and meets the needs of
the customer
a custom software development and
outsource IT services company was
struggling with traditional methods of
software development the company
realized that agile provides better
outcomes than the traditional method
hence they decided to take up agile
transformation the graphic below shows
how the transformation benefited them as
they developed each portal and gained a
better understanding of agile principles
and practices let us summarize the
topics covered in this lesson angela
volved in the late 1990s in response to
the burdens of heavy documentation and
frequent requirements change the agile
manifesto was signed in 2001 by
seventeen software developers which
captured the values and principles of
the agile movement agile manifesto
highlights 12 principles
as a lightweight project management
approach agile avoids big design heavy
documentation and it's top down
management or control agile emphasizes
collaboration team empowerment and
frequent demonstrations of progress by
focusing on poll versus push
this concludes a jelincic's and mindset
part 1 the next part of the domain is
agile principles in mindset part 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
