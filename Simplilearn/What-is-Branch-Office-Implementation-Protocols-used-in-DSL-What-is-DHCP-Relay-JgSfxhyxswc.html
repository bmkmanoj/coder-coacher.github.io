and switching course offered by simply
learned in the previous lesson we
focused on ipv6 to and from ipv4 in this
lesson we will look into branch office
implementation let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain the basic
requirements for a network connectivity
in a branch office explained protocols
used in digital subscriber line
configure NAT Pat for branch office
connectivity including NAT exemption and
NAT traversal explained dynamic host
configuration protocol relay describe
and configure IP security protocol let
us begin with network connectivity of a
branch office branch offices need
connectivity to the enterprise network
as well as the internet most often this
is accomplished through a connection
that provides access to both
destinations the branch is normally
connected to an isp using DSL cable or
Wireless the device connected to the ISP
can be a router a firewall or a
combination device this device will be
called the border router for reference
dynamic or static IP addressing can be
used
static addressing means IP addresses are
manually configured dynamic addressing
involves dynamic host configuration
protocol DHCP a branch device can act as
the DHCP server alternatively this
function can be performed by an
enterprise headquarters device branches
use Virtual Private Networks VPNs for
secure communications and to accommodate
routing protocols in the next slide let
us discuss DSL as an option for Internet
connectivity DSL sends data traffic over
a telephone local loop the local loop is
the connection between a telephone and
the central office there are three major
layer
two protocols used for DSL bridging
point-to-point protocol over Ethernet
pppoe and point-to-point protocol over
ATM PPP Oh a pppoe is widely used to
carry data over DSL it encapsulates
point-to-point PPP traffic in Ethernet
frames there are distinct advantages of
pppoe since most pcs have a PPP stack
the client does not require separate
pppoe client software in addition
challenge handshake authentication
protocol CH ap can be used for
authentication since it is available
through PPP CH ap provides three-way
authentication consisting of
challenge/response
and then accept or reject reow thent
ocation occurs periodically during a
session using a variable challenge value
it is available on many platforms
including Microsoft servers another
protocol used for DSL is PPP oay where
PPP packets are encapsulated in ATM
cells let us see how a branch office
connects to headquarters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
