simple application of what we've already
looked at in this series and that is the
ability to display data from a database
and also allow us to insert records as
well so this functionality is going to
be all on one page you can already see
that we have the records that we have in
the database output here and we also
then have the ability to go in and add
more record so you can enter data here
obviously this doesn't look very nice
but you know it's a it's it's the
ability to to actually insert it that
we're interested in so I can go ahead
and insert new records here so by doing
this was sort of getting used to the
fact that we can tie everything in that
we've already looked and actually apply
it to an application so what we're going
to do here is start from scratch build
up the mark up here and give the ability
using what we've learnt to insert and
retrieve records from our database so
let's just go ahead a little peek at our
database here you can see that that
record has indeed been inserted and it's
a visible on the web page so let's go
ahead and start writing the code for
this so the first thing that we can
actually focus on is outputting this
data into a table on our page so we're
going to build some markup and fetch the
results as we normally would and then
output them in this table at the bottom
of our page in our markup now you've
probably noticed that we have an extra
require here and this is inside the
functions folder and we're requiring
this security PHP file basically what
I've created here is a function that
escapes a string ready for output so
this is to prevent or help prevent XSS
attacks by basically data that looks
like this so if someone was to insert a
record in the database that was an
opening and closing script tag and an
alert that would then the output to our
page and then it would run as a
JavaScript snippet of code so we would
actually see an allure and what we want
to do with HTML entities is convert the
characters that we've just seen into
their entity equivalent we've provided
end quotes which will escape sing
double quotes and we've provided
character encoding of utf-8 which is a
security consideration when using this
function so that's what we've done there
let's go ahead and build the mark-up for
our page just roughly build some markup
we're not going to include any style
sheets or anything like that because we
don't want it to look very nice so I'm
just building the HTML tags I'm going to
build a head tag here and a body tag so
inside the head I'm just going to add a
title and this is just going to say
people so inside body now we want a
header so i'll just use an h3 element
we'll just so people so here what we
want is our tables let's just construct
the overall markup of our table so no
PHP code yet you know we'll do that in a
moment so you have a tee head will open
and close that and we also have a tee
body and we'll open and close that if
you not work with markup too much before
don't worry this is basically just
constructing a table so you know give it
a go constructing this as best you can
and we then want table rows for the
header or one table road for the header
and we want table head elements inside
of here these are just going to be by
default most browsers will star these in
bold such as basically the header of the
of the table nice semantic markup so we
want a first name we want a last name we
want a bio and we want the date that the
record was created so in the T body now
let's go ahead and add this markup and
so it's a TD this time not a th so let's
go ahead and just add some dummy
information just so we can see how this
works so we'll say Alex Garrett develop
player and we'll just say date there we
don't really need to construct a date
for this example so that's how our table
will look doesn't look very nice you
know this is this is default markup
we're not styling it at all we're not
really worried about that with more
focus on the PHP side of things so we
have our table now that we can output
data from
go ahead and put an HR there now this
space down here is going to be reserved
for our input form but now what we want
to do is actually retrieve the results
from our database so we can output them
if we won what we're going to do is
we're going to work in a sort of logic
at the top view at the bottom kind of
style so we're going to create a called
records and that's going to be an empty
array and what this is going to do it's
going to store the records that we want
to output below we're going to loop
through we're going to retrieve these as
an object store them in this records
array and then down here we can check if
if this record has any content and we
can loop around this area to generate
the records so it's a concept that
basically you're just collecting data
and then outputting it at the bottom of
the page so what do we want to do well
we're going to create an if statement
and assign a result variable inside of
this so different from records this is
going to be the result of our database
query now we're not binding anything
from here all we literally want to do is
we want to select everything from the
people table that's all we're doing so
now what we want to do is check if we
actually have any rows returned or not
so the road count basically and remember
that we have a property called num
underscore rose available to us from
this results object here the MySQL I
results object so now we say if results
none underscore rose that's it so if
that's a positive number we can assume
that we have at least one row so now we
can loop through so we're going to say
while Rho equal so assigning this each
time so results fetch and remember we
said we want to fetch an object so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
say records remember that's this array
here and this is the notation to append
of a value to an array so append a row
or the value if you liked on the right
so we're going to append a row for each
one so now what we're going to do is
just free up the results that we've
we've grabbed we don't need that in
memory anymore so let's free that up and
we'll go ahead and refresh just make
sure we don't have any errors
and we don't we just got horizontal line
there that we create in the markup so
how do we know that records actually
contains data well let's go ahead and
just print this out just so we can sort
of see what we're dealing with it's
always a good idea to jump in and see
what kind of data we're dealing with so
we'll do a print our own records so
let's refresh and there we go we can see
that we've got three objects here the
example that we added this new record in
here and the two existing records so we
now got this that we can loop through an
access by object proper property
notation first name last name bio
created an ID if we need to so we don't
need to print our on this so let's get
rid of this what we do need to do
however is down here we need to figure
out which part of this markup you
actually want to loop through now the
part of the mark-up we want to loop
through is the TR so what we want is
some PHP tags around here with an if
statement so if something I'll just put
one in there for now then we want to end
the in that there let's just indent that
so we can read it a little bit better so
what do we want to check well we want to
check if there has been a count or
account returns a positive number on the
records array so count records so we're
counting this which we're potentially
storing data in we don't have to be if
there's no records available then we
won't have anything to show so we want
to say if count records in fact what we
could do is put this if statement at the
top of here I was probably would make a
bit more sense to be honest so let's go
ahead and do that in that way if there
are no records that markup for the table
isn't actually displayed at all so we'll
say if and then that if count records we
can even say if no count records
otherwise so if no count records echo no
records otherwise and we'll just end our
if statement down here
lovely and will indent our table so if
there are records we're going to
generate this markup and then we want to
loop through this pit here so now we can
actually create our loop down here it's
our for each loop so for each records as
and I'm just going to call it are just
so it saves typing go ahead and end that
loop there and will indent this now for
each of the records that we stored here
we now have access to down here so we
can just replace this basically so I'm
just going to replace this with echo our
first name and I'm going to do the same
for each one but more importantly
remember our security function our
escape function takes a string and
converts HTML entities or characters and
tight entity in quibbling with single
and double quote protection and utf-8
encoding we need to use this in here
just in case any data has any potential
XSS xss well content that could cause an
exorcist attack so last name copy and
paste this again vaio copy and paste
this again created so let's take a look
at what actually happened here ok we
have a syntax error so that's on line 56
and ah there we are so we forgot that
curly brace there no problem at all so
when we refresh now we see that we get
all of these records output in the table
nicely brilliant we've done what we've
set out to do in the case of outputting
data now what we need to do is build the
form down here that's going to allow us
to actually insert a record and we're
going to be doing some binding here as
well now we're not going to be doing any
any validation is this you know named
bigger than X amount of characters all
going to do doing is making sure this
data is set making
sure is not empty the validation that
we're going to be doing here is probably
not recommended for large sets of data
because it will get quite messy it's
better to use some kind of validation
class or build your own validation class
or something like that but for now this
small amount of datum the fact that
we're focusing on MySQL doesn t matter
so the method is going to be post and
the action is going to be empty we're
going to submit back to this page what
we're now going to do is create three
diff sand we have these as a class of
field I'm just imagining that these
would be styled in a certain way but for
now we will just use these to sort break
things up so we have a label for and
this is going to be for first name and
this will be first name and then we have
an input field here so an input type of
text we have a name of first name that's
how we're going to reference it in PHP
when it's available in our post array
and then we have an ID so you can match
this up to the label that just means if
you click the label it will
automatically highlight the field for
you so when I click this label this is
highlighted it's just a usability thing
and that's it really that's all we need
to do will also step auto complete off
ok so let's duplicate this three twice
and so this is going to be last name
this is going to say last name this will
be last name this will of course as well
be last name and then just one more
which is the bio and this water see say
I oh this isn't going to be a input
field it's going to be a text area so
nothing changes in pH people and
rereading this way this is going to be
named bio ID bio and that's it so now
that we've got all of our data together
we want to or our fields together we
want to create a button or a submit
button that's going to allow us to
actually submit this so we'll say submit
value insert so that's all we're going
to do and that's basically our form
there we can click insert
submit and we have access to the data in
PHP let's go all the way up and just up
here we're going to perform a couple of
checks just to see if this data is
available so the first one is if not
empty dollar underscore post so does
post have some data in it well if it
does that means we can then check your
first name last name and bio are set
using the is set construct so we can say
is set post first name you'll notice a
lot of repetition here and that's why I
mentioned about using a validator class
or alternative way of validating if you
were to end up with say twenty fields
here you wouldn't want to do it this way
just a little word of warning it's a
post last name and dollar underscore
post by oats we're checking if our three
fields set if they are set we want to
create a variable for each one of them
again you can see how this would be
tedious if we had a lot of input data so
that's going to be first name and we
also want to trim that as well just trim
the left white space on the left and
right again we're not escaping anything
at this point there's no need because
we're going to be binding these values
this is going to be x 0 let's just line
these ups it's easier to read so last
name and bio wonderful so now what we
want to do is go ahead and check if
they're empty so promise you the one
last check so not empty first name and
if a user was to type a load of spaces
and it this is why we use trim a load of
spaces are not empty because it does
have content if we trim a load of spaces
that then will be empty because we trim
from the left and right hand side which
will eventually meet and cause it to be
an empty string so if not empty last
name and last of all not empty by oh
great now we can get down to actually
working with working with our database
and binding these values very
straightforward we're just going to
prepare a statement buying three
parameters all of string type also going
to include the created value so that'll
be a MySQL function will execute the
statement if this statement has been
executed successfully we're going to
redirect back to this page and then
we'll see the the record that's been
inserted so we'll create a variable
called insert so this will be DB prepare
remember we're preparing a statement
here now actually query the database at
the moment so we're going to insert into
people and we need to insert the first
name the last name the bio and the
created a date remember we don't need to
include the ID that's auto increment so
the values on this are going to be ? ? ?
and now so this ? refers to first name
this to last name this to bio and now to
create it so we need to now bind three
values we don't need to mine for values
because we've supplied at the now
function return value for created field
we just need to find three values
because we have three question marks
here so all we do is we say insert bind
her RAM and in here we want to define
that we have three strings and then we
want a comma separated list of all of
the values that we want to bind here so
first name last name and bio if for
example by overs an integer we would
change this to I because this represents
the first variable this the second and
this the third but they are in fact all
strings now we want a quick check just
to check if the statement was X while
we're executing and checking it was okay
at the same time so this will execute
the prepared statement with the bound
parameters and it will then determine in
this if statement whether it's
successful or not it was successful we
want to use the header fun
chin to point to a particular location
that will be index PHP and then we just
want to kill the script we can exit the
script in the matter so we're actually
now done what we can now do is go and
preview our page what's going to happen
on our pages the first thing that's
going to do is obviously everything gets
included we're checking whether there
have been results or something submitted
will explain that I explained over this
in just a moment but it's important that
this falls below this because will then
do is it'll grab the results after this
has been inserted so we're inserting
first then grabbing results which will
show the newest result it doesn't really
matter in this case because we're
refreshing the page so this could be in
fact above this but yeah we're just
we're just redirecting so user can't
keep hitting f5 and inserting data again
and again and again so that what we're
then doing is running the mark-up
checking the count of the records if
there are no records where outputting no
records otherwise we are creating a
table here with them looping through the
records that we retrieved up here that
we stored in this records away and then
we're just outputting the escaped data
from our database so I think the first
thing that we should do is go ahead and
truncate our database so if we go to
operations tab we can truncate the table
which basically means remove all data
from the table we hit enter and it says
hit no record so as expected we've got
that message back there I'm now going to
go ahead and just add a record so what's
going to happen here is when we click
insert let's just pop back to the code
to explain this again we this is true
because we have data in our post array
remember we defined that we wanted to
submit this data as a method of post
what we then do is check if each of
these are set so are they available in
this post array if they are let's assign
the values of these to these variables
trimming the white space from the left
and the right hand side within checking
if they're empty or not so has a value
being actually entered physically into
that field if it has we prepare a
statement with
three parameters that we need to bind
and then we insert sorry weeb right bind
the parameters on this insert variable
we created we have three strings first
name last name and bio we then execute
it while checking that the execution
happened and worked correctly then we
redirect to index PHP and if whatever
reason that fails we kill the page we
don't we don't have continued running it
so let's go ahead and click insert and
there we are we have our data inserted
so in this sir in this example we've
looked at retrieving data and inserting
data all on the same page to actually
create something that is that could be
classed as a useable application and
we've done that all using binding
selecting using objects because we're
working an object-oriented fashion with
MySQL I and without putting escape data
so let's just take a quick peek at the
fact that we have escaped data and will
understand what that means so I'm going
to right Billy Garrett in here and i'm
going to write some some javascript
within script tags so let's say alert
we'll just say one for now so if i
insert this nothing happens we just see
this code here in the database it looks
like this so it's very much an escaped
in the database in terms of the the tags
and the markup but what HTML entities
function does is it converts that to it
this entity equivalent so if actually if
I put that back a moment and I go into
my source code you can see that this is
actually being converted into entities
and therefore it can't be interpreted by
the browser's javascript and therefore
we predict protect against an XSS attack
what happens if I don't escape the data
well you probably guessed when we go
ahead and refresh here we get this page
localhost says one the script at this
point stops executing when we hit ok and
we run the rest and we have an empty
space here where that JavaScript code is
so it's important to escape data it's
important to bind or not necessarily
bind values but escape data
to prevent against SQL injection on the
way into your database as well and but
we've encapsulated this in one usable
page so hopefully all of this code
however complicating it might look is
actually quite simple hopefully it makes
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
