topic 1 physical and environmental
security introduction hello and welcome
to lesson number 4 of CISSP
certification course by simply learn
this lesson is about physical and
environmental security physical and
environmental security is one of the 10
domains of the common body of knowledge
cbk for the CISSP certification exam the
physical environmental security domain
examines how elements of the surrounding
physical environment and supporting
infrastructure affect the
confidentiality integrity and
availability CIA of information systems
we are not talking about logical
controls here but you will notice that
some of the physical controls we
described are duplicated in some of the
other domains such as biometrics in the
operations and access control domain
natural disasters are an example of
physical threats to security perimeter
and facility access controls to prevent
unauthorized entry or theft are elements
of physical security the area known as
industrial security contains many of
these concepts such as closed-circuit
television CCTV guards fencing lighting
and so forth the CISSP exam considers
human safety as the most critical
concern of this domain trumping all
other concerns a security practitioner
needs to be aware of the elements that
threaten the physical security of an
enterprise and how controls can mitigate
the risk incurred from those elements in
this chapter we will examine threats to
physical security and controls for
physical security physical security
addresses the physical protection of the
resources of an organization which
include people data facilities equipment
and information systems
objectives according to the ISC to
candidate information bulletin a CISSP
candidate is expected to know the
elements involved in choosing a secure
site is designed in configuration and
the methods of securing the facility
against unauthorized access theft of
equipment and information and the
environmental and safety measures needed
to protect agenda the agenda for this
lesson is as follows we start with
understanding the need for physical and
environmental security this will set the
basis for our further discussion on this
security domain once we have understood
the need we will discuss the design
criteria for site and the facility next
on our agenda is understanding the
concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
