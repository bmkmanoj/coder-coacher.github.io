previous slides now let's get into more
depth of what they are with some example
business activities drive demand for
services customer assets such as people
processes and applications generate
patterns of business activity that is to
say PBA PBA defined dynamics of a
business and include interactions with
customers suppliers partners and other
stakeholders services often directly
support BBA this profile of business
activity can change over time with
changes and improvements in business
process people organization applications
and infrastructure PBA are placed under
change control user profiles that is to
say you P are based upon roles and
responsibilities within organizations
for people and functions and operations
for processes and applications many
processes are not actively executed or
controlled by staff or personnel process
automation allows for processes to
consume services on their own processes
and applications can have use of
profiles let us take the example of a
mobile service provider providing a
cheap download rate for users in the age
group of 16 to 20 years during nine so
this group of 16 to 20 years is one user
profile that is to say you P and the
pattern which has been analyzed leading
to understanding of the need of
downloading content during night hours
is a PPA so as we see in the above
example pattern matching using PBA and
noopy ensure a systematic approach to
understanding and managing demand from
customers
they also require customers to better
understand their
home business activities and view them
as consumers of services and producers
of demand when they are used to
communicate demand service providers
have the information necessary to sort
and serve the demand with appropriately
matched services service levels and
service assets this leads to improved
value for both customers and service
providers by eliminating waste and poor
performance use a profile communicates
information on the roles
responsibilities interactions schedules
work environments and social context of
related users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
