recommendations that are to be
considered to start with let us
understand security assurance
recommendations functional regulatory
and privacy of data should be clearly
understood they should be prioritized
depending on the impact it can have on
application identify and analyze the
potential vulnerabilities in the system
or application and build mitigation
strategies next let us look into risk
analysis recommendations thorough
analysis of risks involved is done and
threat models are built potential risks
related to development deployment
security and privacy of data should all
be taken into consideration and clearly
documented the third recommendation is
architecture recommendations
architecture frameworks should be
developed architecture patterns which
can mitigate risks should be used to
avoid any threat likewise depending on
the security architecture framework used
data architectures had to be chosen to
monitor database servers hosting of
database etc whatever encryption is used
must be clearly defined to avoid
confusion all responsibilities such as
privileges provided to third party
personnel in charge for monitoring
application data collected etc should be
clearly demarcated the final
recommendation is penetration testing
application on cloud the open web
application security project or a wasp
tests should be done periodically on web
applications to identify threats manual
tests should also be conducted to
identify if there are any misuse of
privileges for example due to
multitenancy one user might have access
to another user's data applications in
pass and is should be assessed for
security controls such as virtual
security in order to safeguard the
application environments we will look
into the summary in the next slide
now that we have come to the end of this
module let us do a brief recap we began
with a brief introduction to application
security discussed in detail about
secure sdlc followed by application
security architecture and cloud which
includes verification and validation
construction and quantitative
improvements we then moved on to
understand authentication authorization
and compliance next we discussed
extensively about idea which includes
five major phases such as authentication
authorization administration audit and
compliance and policy we also learnt
about penetration testing in cloud and
how to monitor application in cloud
lastly we looked at few recommendations
on different aspects such as security
risk analysis architecture and
penetration testing it's quiz time again
please go through the quiz and check
your understanding of this domain we
will be discussing encryption and key
management in the next domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
