proceed further in understanding how we
can create data extract all right so as
I mentioned the extract of the you
create a subset of your data source you
can extract a particular data you can
save it as a subset which will help you
in performing and improving your query
so instead of the life you can simply
click on the extract which will create
or tab you extract for you all right so
let me just show you let me take you to
the repository and in that you will be
able to identify in my tableau
repository data sources you can see that
we have a tableau extract your food
world indicators what is done is it has
created a subset of the word indicator
data source and it's created it's
disconnected it's an offline mode which
can allow us to improve the performance
it can be accessed offline as well when
you obey when you're probably traveling
and we can then create an extract where
we can keep refreshing it with the
original data and we can then replace it
with the content and we can provide a
complete incremental refresh release all
right now extract can also be created
from within our datasets as well once
you perform the let's play let me go
back to our view yad and let's have a
activity in our columns let's have
quantity on our road now even though you
have the option of going under the data
menu where you can or click on the
extract data so whatever you selected
any kind of performances and any kind of
the aggregations that you perform now
this is your data that you perform in
instead of even though it's the live
connection you can still go to the data
menu here and you can click on create
and extract your data which will create
a subset all right we just need a subset
for you where you can create this data
and you can
the different scenes wherein you can
select what you want to filter whether
you want to add a specific width filter
to your field whether you want to
specify the aggregation data for be
visible dimension this is where you can
select the option for the measures to be
dyed or aggregated the default instead
of using the default or what is the kind
of aggregation that you want to use show
this can allow you to minimize the size
of your finest weather increase your
performance you can click on aggregation
and you want to roll up the date to your
to water or two months you can select on
the aggregation the number of rows that
you want to allow in terms of the
incremental section or you want to
provide the incremental sectional all
roads or just the top particular
selected road so you can select on that
particular option once you've specified
all these readings you can then click on
extract and that's going to save the
substituent or file in the location that
you have faced in terms of the extract
and it'll save of an extract for you all
right so when you click on extract it
will ask you for a substitute location
of where you want to save it there is a
custom query that we have used and let's
say if we save it on the desktop itself
you can see the save type which is a dot
tbe
which is a tableau data extract and the
next time you can start working using
these data extracts and you can start
performing where you do not need to then
have your custom sequel's written in or
any other details you can simply use the
extract and start working on it all
right you can actually restrict the size
and improve the performance and you can
perform data extraction residuals
all right and then again in the data
menu option yo you have the option to me
place your particular data source so
let's say you have your option where you
want to perform a or incremental search
then you can replace the data or you can
upgrade it all for that matter you can
go to this particular table you can
refresh your data
with the connection where you have the
additional already fresh heater you can
view your data you can duplicate it
rename it
we are just discussed how we can create
the extract data options as well so that
is how you can perform and see and and
have an extract of your data so that was
using your data extract
now you can also write custom people so
we've discussed that let me take you
back to the presentation slide and have
a recap so you're this is the window
that we saw in terms of the extract
where you can add in the qualifications
where you can narrow down your data even
more for though you can select an
incremental search whether you want it
for all the rows or limit the number of
rows to be included in that particular
extract then we also saw that how we
could write a custom sequel we could
open it in a legacy connection that are
helped us to open up a custom sequel
window where we can write down these
people with the extract data that we
want to analyze this can again yourself
and improving these query performances
where we can write down and provide an
optimized query against our data that we
want to use all right in terms of the
supported data sources or large all had
questions what kind of data sources are
supported now tableau desktop is or
supporting the it determines or the
support depending on the kind of license
that you have for change
all right so only when you have the
required license it will support the
different data source type and you have
a personal Edition which provides you
and allows you to use these support for
a lot of databases or but it is the
professional Edition that provides you
official database options that you can
connect to so data such as text file
access files Excel sheet and so on these
can be connected through these possible
additions while it sounds super
professional edition the professional
license this is where you can connect
other than D is other than the person
editions you can connect to the personal
or additional databases like your Oracle
sequel and you can connect to something
more additional connection sure which is
supported for T plus theta connections
which is supported in the professional
Edition right so that's how you can
connect to these different connections
now also along with that once you have
your table or that comes into picture
what are they so what does is it reminds
you of Kerberos authentication which is
a supported trusted authentication or
data uses in terms of your single
sign-on all right so what it does is in
this case is that as you can see it is a
protocol that is provided to cross the
authentication between your machine and
that's how it uses a third party network
service called as the KDC the key
distribution center which provides the
stick to your connection between your
desktop and the slower machine and this
is supported based on the Kerberos
authentication all right and that's
where you can it handles in it uses only
one user authentication the permissions
and the access control or in such cases
like the workbooks are is going to be
now these the workbooks and extracts
will not be handled by squadron but the
permissions and access control those are
we think those are be detailing that for
gosh would be handling in terms of your
data condition right so basically if
you're attacking server has a whole
block enabled on your machine with a
balanced Active Directory credentials
then what tableau does is it connects to
your server and it completely skips the
steps of authenticating so in case let
me take you to the environment you're in
the environment you can see the server
option and in this you have the publish
workbook now let's see when you want to
you've created your workbook and you
want to publish it on to your solo now
this is very asks you to connect to the
server your it ask you to provide the
credentials and then based on that is
then asked you once you've connected to
let's say you connect it to your server
it is then going to ask you a sign on
for that particular configuration now
you have a for growth environment which
is activated then it's going to skip
these basic steps on and it will
directly allow you to connect and give
the
that comes in in between so that is what
is Kerberos authentication all right so
it's a single sign-on network and once
you have that enabled then you can make
use of these you can you need to point
figure your tableau server with these
Cobras configurations all right so it's
a freebie or tenth acacia spoon of oil
now how this works is of mechanism of or
mutual authentication between the client
and the server is provided with the
Kerberos authentication so when the
usual user logs into the directory it
directly asks for the credentials which
are authenticated by full rot and once
this is authenticated or ticket is
generated and sent to the users computer
and then when the user tries to connect
to the tableau server from the desktop
or the web browser the server or the
tableau server authenticate the user and
it directly allows us to perform now
this mechanism is provided before the
network connection is opened up between
the client and the server
right so how does it work in terms of a
single sign-on how does it support it is
it supports a single sign-on option
we're in now you have the server
configuration and in this you have a
four browse tab where you can define
enabling the single sign-on option in
terms of the environment where you can
connect individual you can connect with
a single sign-on to connect to the
server from your desktop or the web
browser
all right in terms of trying to
optimizing your query now how can you
optimize your query tab you adopt
various query optimization techniques to
improve the very performance all right
so what it does is it provides category
query where it improves the performance
speed of the dashboard by performing and
providing the capability of executing of
parallel ways since this case what
happens is it executes most where these
are just
time it is independent or ready to start
at the same time and hence you're faster
and improve the performance so this is
what Apple does it provides the parallel
query next in it has the query fusion in
this what it does is tableau has the
ability to reduce any kind of conflict
for large number of queries into fewer
simple ones so that's how it again
optimizes your performance right and
then it also has external query caching
in this it quickens up the process of
optimizing your data by processing it
into a cache alright so that it does not
need to go and hit in the warehouse
every night that you require a
particular data so this is possible with
the external very crashing so tableau
absorbs these various measures it also
has our data engine vectorization
wherein it has an in-memory analytics
column and it's a faster query which
helps in reducing the extract size and
creation time or so based on these
that's how it can improve the
performance and that's how it optimizes
these techniques that have new handles
this takes care of each of these which
performs the pattern is vary by phone it
uses a particular query function which
is short it does not or it shortens up
all the query is the external very
caching that it uses and also provides
or data engine vectorization where it
makes this even more quicker and faster
now in order to quit in the process of
your loading of data what tableau does
is it creates a stage or shadow extract
file on its own all right what it does
it in the repository for you to load
your data faster other than to create a
can extract it takes up the content of
foreshadow extract in your repository
file and it stays lit up as a shadow
while you're working on the workbook
okay and that's where then when you're
creating and working or based on the
legacy non-fantasy
excels or text file for statistical side
it creates the shadow extract file
automatically wherever you have your
repository so in case when you're
working on something what it does this
in your repository folder all right
there you have your repository which is
in my document in the data sources you
can you will be able to see that it
provides you a particular extract that
is a shadow extract has been created and
you can see that it creates a shadow
extract right there where then you can
make use of all right or in the
background so this is done automatically
by tableau to freakin of the process
this is something that you do not need
to handle or by default is this the
folder there is a folder that gets
created or when you have a proper
licensed version then you will see that
in the repository folder you will have a
shadow extract folder and based on that
data sort or you will see that at least
the source side at least the topside
shadow extract will be safe with a
thought maybe pdb e extension and that's
how it uses and replaces it she places
the oldest one so when you have a nice
print version in that case then that's
when you will be able to see this
extract folder and this is when it
quickens up the entire process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
