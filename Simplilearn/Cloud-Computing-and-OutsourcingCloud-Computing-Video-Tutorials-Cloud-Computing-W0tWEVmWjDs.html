earlier module we know that cloud
computing is nothing but a set of IT
capabilities that are offered over a
network in terms of a business value
cloud computing is quite similar to
outsourcing since they share similar
attributes so what is outsourcing in
simple words it is sourcing a set of
capabilities from an external vendor
instead of using the company's own
personnel and assets but outsourcing is
not restricted to IT only it could be
used even the catering services or any
other the major reason what companies
are outsourcing is because it is a more
lucrative option to the company when
companies have to work outside their
capabilities it is better to outsource
the work instead of building
capabilities in house also in situations
where it is a one time requirement
companies prefer to outsource we will
look into a few of the major reasons why
companies prefer outsourcing in the next
slide
most of the IT organizations outsource
their work for several reasons
organizations adopt cloud computing for
the same set of reasons cloud computing
is a lucrative option as providers might
have lower cost per server that is
companies do not have to incur a capital
expense by investing in servers this can
lead to capacity over build in other
words where there is no demand the
server's remain unutilized on the other
hand cloud allows us to deploy servers
as and when we need them additionally in
cloud we pay only for what we use
companies might not have all
capabilities in house for example
managing an email system might not be
considered a core competence but
provisioning an external provider whose
core capability is managing email system
create higher or better availability
delay in server procurement consumes a
huge amount of time and effort which in
turn leads to a delay in time to market
on the other hand while using cloud
servers and infrastructure can be
provisioned on-demand thus saving time
and effort
this allows the organization to focus on
the issue in hand say application
development testing etc as a result the
time taken for the product or
application to reach market is faster
external service providers may provide
access to highly innovative software
solutions and platforms lastly not
owning a large data center full of
servers reduces capital expenditure
substantially now that we are aware of
the major reasons which companies prefer
to outsource we will take a look at the
commonalities between cloud computing
and outsourcing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
