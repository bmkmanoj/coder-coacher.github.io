box if you can go ahead and I see some
people who have already been in there
chatting just go ahead and chat hello
let both of our honored guests know that
you're here and you're excited to see
them and this also does a real quick
sound check I know I did one earlier but
we'll do one again just go ahead and
type hello how great thank you great to
have you in the Lynn there we go
op nish Anurag hopefully in getting the
names correctly excited to have
everybody here you didn't come here to

our first guest speaker avnish online
and set him up with ass oh hold on I
need to get my um I need to go in to
have the people in the back cuz this is
set up across three different computers
and for those people who don't have an
Indian dialing number we'll have to take
a look at that in just a moment if
you're having trouble connecting so go
ahead and sit back a few evening where
you're at maybe a glass of wine or if
it's early morning like I am a cup of
coffee or tea and give us just a moment

sound set up correctly so we can get our
first guest speaker up and running there
we go all right thanks Ivan ich here we
go I'll let you take it away and let's
jump right in there a little late but
we're going alright so thanks everybody
for joining this is avnish and
for whatever happened I also have no
idea of what was going on but hopefully
we can still remain in time I will try
and go through my piece pretty quickly
and then hand over to dr. shom and
hopefully after that we have a few
minutes for Q&amp;amp;A as well so let's go to
the next slide this is the agenda of
well been to that Sina can we go to the
next slide please
yeah let's look into the digital
disruption so I wanted to start here in
terms of where we are and northing
you've all heard about the fourth
revolution and the second Machine Age
so the first Industrial Revolution which
happened used water and steam power to
mechanized production the second use
electric power to create mass production
the third used electronics and
information technology to automate
production and what we now see is a
fourth Industrial Revolution which is
building up on the third one and the
digital revolution that has been
occurring since actually the middle of
the last century it is characterized by
a fusion of technology that is blurring
the line between physical digital and
biological sales right and there are
three reasons like today transformation
represents not merely a extension of the
third Industrial Revolution but rather
what I call the arrival of the fourth
and distinct one and b3r
velocity its scope and systems in fact
just to explain what I mean
the speed of current breakthroughs has
no historical precedent what we are
seeing now when compared with the
previous sprint of failed evolutions the
fourth is evolving at an exponential
rather than a linear pace and this is a
big difference between the other three
and what is happening no more it is
disrupting almost every industry in
every country and the breadth and depth
of these changes basically held the
transformation of entire systems of
production management and governance so
this is what the fourth revolution is
for fourth Industrial Revolution a lot
of it is being characterized by what you
see on the top left in the 34.0 in the
34.0 over industrial internet or a IOT
whatever you may call it is a big part
of what is defining the industrial
fourth Industrial Revolution then we go
to the next slide
yeah so what you see here is that you
know you see all the distraint s-curved
in terms of the technology which have
disrupted the other other society invoke
rights from the mainframe to
client-server then you know web when you
had that smack set of technologies what
is different at this point of time is
that you know all these possibilities
will be multiplied by an emerging
technology breakthroughs in fields such
as artificial intelligence robotics
Internet of Things autonomous vehicles
3d printing nanotechnology biotechnology
all these rights and the most
interesting part here is that while we
tend to talk a lot about these
technologies independently and what is
the impact of these technology so more
important thing is how they are
combining together so deep computo real
effect in terms of how they combine
together and the exponential value
creation which happens and also the
exponential disruption which happens is
because of this particular thing that
you know these technologies are
combining together rather than acting
independently and go to the next
slightly yeah so this is just another
elaborate you know depiction of what I
was talking about earlier if you look at
some of these technologies like deep
learning life it could that could be
both 35 Amazon's in 20 years and that's
saying a lot too we all understand what
Amazon is now you look at the box and
automation it is expected to liberate I
find that words very interesting because
that is the biggest fear which people
have and I think it's very intrinsic to
the discussion which we have included
that if robotics and automation is going
to liberate 13 trillion by 2035 what it
basically says is a lot of jobs will get
liberated and and that's something which
we will discuss as we go ahead and then
you see similar things in terms of
global 3d printing expected to be a huge
market mobile transactions autonomous
taxis to overtake automakers I think
also automotive industry that a cup of
huge disruption the three big things
happening there's electric vehicles
autonomous vehicles and mobility as a
service
and then obviously blockchain and crypto
asset which is still a question mark in
my view people are still trying to
figure out what it is and you know when
you look into cryptocurrency and you
look at bitcoins and tedium you know
they have spectacular diverse and and an
Rises and that is that is exciting a lot
of people but I think you know the final
or the real value of blockchain will
come in not in the Bitcoin bit of
financial services where we tend to
associate them with it won't come in
associated thing for example how
blockchain is going to increase the
trust factor in the internet in the
block in the Internet of Things IOT how
you know blockchain is going to be used
in supply chain how it's going to be
used in logistics those things will be
in those use cases will be much more
powerful as we go ahead ok let's go to
the next slide and when you look into
that you know all these things are
happening and what is the impact so if
you people think that well you know what
is the evidence so this shows you the
evidence you know in terms of the
basically this study fails the 50% of
the S&amp;amp;P 500 will be replaced by 2025 and
that's a significant number and average
life span on FNP 500 index has
significantly reduced and it going to be
reducing further almost going to about
14 year by 2026
so a lifespan of a company which earlier
used to be for hundreds of years is now
just going to be 14 years and on the
right hand side you see real examples of
the big companies which have entered the
SNP list and which have existed so no
surprises in terms of web who have
entered a Amazon Google next Lake fail
book and you can see all of them that
one key characteristic which which
defines all of them and these are all
platform companies like and what you see
on the right hand side are all what I
call the value chain companies and this
is a key key insight from this session
for all of you that when a platform
company competes
so whenever the platform compete con
company competes with a value chain
company so the platform company always
been
and that is what is happening and that
is why even the legacy organizations are
trying to become platform organization
than their own base but the physical
example of the campaign which I've got
replaced and which have entered this
list and more and more we will see
platform companies dominating this list
then go to the next slide
okay put aside a little bit of humor as
well in terms of sort of in when all
this is happening so where is the
disruption going to come from and if you
look at the organizations in a big
organization whether it's Accenture or
Microsoft or IBM or even kind of scale
organizations like Honeywell or GE they
are very very understanding that you
know the competition the face of
competition is significantly changing if
you had asked us in terms of what our
competition was and you know the answer
which we gave you is very very different
to what it is now and the reason for
that would be explained in the in the
next slide if we can go to that when we
talk about disruptive innovation right
disruptive innovation is never going to
come from legacy incumbent so for
example if it's Honeywell an email is
not gonna get disrupted by GE or seamen
in the bush it is gonna get disrupted by
companies like for example nest which
was bought by Google in the home
automation phase and similarly if you
look at all the businesses of
Honeywell's
they are all getting disrupted by very
small agile digital disruptive startups
which initially operate under the radar
and they are not really attacking your
most profitable customer segments but
slowly slowly they encroach onto that
and by the time you realize it's
generally too late and the bullet is
already out of the gun so the key
message here is that when we talk about
disruption which we were looking into a
previous slide it's not gonna happen
from big organizations incumbents and
legacy organizations it's gonna come
from digital circuits okay
what will digital enterprises do in
terms of how do you how do they survive
the disruption so one Li you need to for
example you know when we talk to our
clients in terms of their own digital
transformation strategy the first is
that you need to make sure that they are
defending their death pin so you have to
defend and then you need to become a
disruptor on your own right and you can
do that to some of these things which
you look into hell you know coming in to
digital business models a lot of
organizations are using digital
technologies not just to improve
operational efficiency or to improve
customer experience but the big
organizations which are include digital
are looking into how do they come up
with a complete new business models and
and that's probably the most interesting
thing you look at some of the other ones
as well like digital opening models and
digital matrix these are important but
what we are talking about today is the
digital talent and skills so talent was
always important but now it has become
critically important in the digital era
and the only difference is that you know
success will be very unevenly
distributed in terms of people who get
you know jobs and who don't get jobs I
think that's the fundamental thing and
that also requires that you know we need
to be constantly know that we go ahead
and I'll talk about that in a minute so
can we just go to the next slide yeah so
that's the digital disruption and now in
terms of what Accenture zone experiences
from the workforce of the future I'll
quickly touch upon that you can see here
a plenty of negative press have been
going around whether it is in India or
outside in terms of what you know what
the technology especially artificial
intelligence and automation is going to
do in terms of jobs so you can you can
see some of these headlines and they
have been you can be reports and other
reports as well we say that almost you
know 60 to 70 percent of the current
jobs in India for example will get
disrupted or will not exist the way they
do and that definitely has implications
in terms of what kind of skills our
education Institute's are imparting and
you know this is going to be very
relevant when I hand over to my
colleague dr. shom she
talk about that more so I will not talk
about it now in great depth the key
thing is that if you want to you know
let's just survive or thrive in this
particular age one you need to be a
lifelong learner and secondly you know
our education institutions need to
change as well in terms of what kind of
skills they are teaching because I think
we are all aware that it takes hell of a
lot of time for these education
institutes to change these are
monolithic organization which have been
teaching the same curricula for you know
four years but if they don't change very
fast now I think that's going to be a
big disservice to our workers and to our
employees because I can feel that a lot
of people for example who are doing
forswear engineering and you know just
very gently coding when they come out
after three four years from the college
at one point of time wavers spoiled for
choice
many organizations would go then that's
not going to happen now
so unless you are able to complement
that with some additional skills which
are very unique this will be a very
tough thing going forward okay now again
justly want to go do some you know sense
check in terms of all this so while all
this you know Guzman room is going to be
or is being predicted what actually is
happening and this is a global
employment outlook for the ICT industry
we look into ITT and professional
services which I look into the next
slide but what you said in the things
are not that bad right so if you look at
it in terms of you know the top families
on the left-hand side there's of
significant growth happening you know
it's it's growing their sales and
related things are going so things are
generally okay and OC if you look at on
the top right-hand side you will see
from above for disruption perspective
it's generally stable so the employment
outlook is stable at this point of
things and it is also saying that 65
percent of the skills which are
currently in demand in the ICT industry
are going to be alright so 35 percent
are going to be different but 65 percent
are going to be stable and then you have
some other matrix there as well
so what this particular slide showed is
that yes while there is up there is a
big concern things are not going
overnight things that will take time and
but it is showed its are showing a
gradual process of change so if you go
to the next slide which talks about
professional services again you will see
that things are are similar there as
well so here also from about force
disruption perspective generally the
outlook astable skills are again 67% in
terms loss the stability and what is
being used here and you can see that
some of the things which are growing
significantly are things around on the
on the left hand side data analysis 5.3
percent and and software and application
developers as well so that's the one
that's the job or the segment B seems to
be more settings but from a global
perspective and this is by the way the
last slide and this slide both are
global it seems to be at the moment okay
and the other point which I like to
mention here is that the impact of these
disruptive technologies is going to be
different at different points of time in
different countries so not all countries
will get impacted immediately and that's
a very critical thing to understand as
well but now if you go to the next slide
that gives you a little more familiarity
or or insight into what is happening in
India can you go to the next slide
please
yeah and here I think the point comes
through so if you look at India and this
app UK and US there as well because
these probably three of the the big big
countries from our interest perspective
there was a lot of you will end up
working in India or you know like to go
to UK and US which are the biggest you
know importers of our skills but if you
look at India for example ICT technology
is coming down and that's the point I
was trying to make earlier that in terms
of the kind of jobs which have been
happening in India which have been
moving away those are shown Lee and
slowly coming down and this is going to
be a trend which is not going to get
reversed there will be a reduction in
number of people which are getting
employed as well as people
that you know redundant for example they
may not come back to the same level of
job and the same scale which they were
so I think that's very important to
understand that when we are talking
about traditional IT skills which is
what India has been known for you know
basically we had thousands and millions
of lakhs of employees coming out of
these colleges and then they were
deployed as an army in the client
location that bit is not going to happen
anymore so that's going to come down
significantly as we go ahead on the
other hand the professional services are
still showing the good the increase in
India can we go to the next slide okay
so what star workforce of the future
from an extension perspective Accenture
as you know as has rotated to the new
much faster than any of our competition
if you have been following in terms of
what has been the the performance of
Accenture of a system of the Indian IT
companies most of them are struggling
the reason why Accenture has been able
to maintain itself both mine share and
market share in digital is because we
have rotated to the new much faster than
them and when we talk about rotating to
the new in almost for example 50 percent
of xn chills almost thirty five billion
dollar revenue today comes from digital
services and a key component of that has
been how we have been able to rescale
and you know acquired new digital
capabilities and skills as we have gone
ahead if you look at the left hand side
the chart it talks about on the vertical
access you see tasks place working on
the on the horizontal P or open market
places so we we started all the fixed
role code team kind of a thing and now
we are into what we call high commitment
liquid workforce which means that you
know critical skills which are existing
today in Accenture can be deployed in a
very easy manner in any account or in
any area where they are where they are
required so it's a very liquid work for
that so name which Accenture gives as we
go ahead you will look into new modules
coming up for example internal on the
amount and pull
external talent net
book you know you will have a lot of
people who will be the contractor or
just working with Accenture may not be
permanent employees and then finally you
have a full public crowd freelance
worker kind of a marketplace so what
district tree shows you is that what we
used to have earlier where we had most
forms you know most of all permanent
employees and they were working for you
is going to change through different
models and Accenture is already taking
its journey through these different
steps which I just described to you okay
and finally I think that's probably my
last slide and I think this gives good
the good leeway to watch that official
home is going to be talking about but
this is a interesting slide which you
should google in terms of that you look
at 160 jobs of the future Thomas Lane
you will get it and what the team has
done here is to actually filter some of
those out which are going to be very
important for the audience on this call
and we thought will be nice to tell you
what what some of the big skills are as
we go ahead in terms of demand so you
can see a lot of them in terms of the
the IOT and sensor which we talked about
earlier as well that that's going to be
a critical component of the fourth
Industrial Revolution attached to that
in big data so you know you can't really
do any analytics if you don't have a
good understanding of how you want to
manage data and how do you want to use
that data to turn that into insight so
Internet of Things and industry 4.0 what
we talked about a lot of things that go
happen in 3d printing commercial growing
in the sleeves and and then what we call
extreme innovations again this is a
global perspective so if you were to ask
me in terms of what that means in India
I think from an India perspective things
specially around anything which is
relating to big data and Internet of
Things is going to be significantly big
along with artificial intelligence so if
you had to ask me and say okay if you
want to take a punch what are the two
top skills which you think will be the
ones which are going to be riding the
wave in India the slide shows the global
one I will I will put my money on
Internet of Things big data and
artificial intelligence
okay Tina is there any other slide I got
not all right so with that
to give you a perspective of one why
digital disruption is important and
second how the future of work is going
to be different and what kind of skills
will be critical as we need to succeed
in the digital digital world but what
you really need to do is what's going to
be talked about now so I'm going to now
hand over to my colleague dr. Sean that
I would also the co-chair of napkin
product console and I'll the question to
take you from here oh good you're on
here right now yes can you hear me
I can doctor in it's doctor how do you
say your first name is Sam Duta so I'm
due to sing now it's pronounced as shown
yes I'm not going to make your life
harder it's really just got shown just
for anybody you know most people even in
India don't get a drive okay I'm glad to
have you and I have you loud and clear
dr. shom sing and let me go ahead and
hand it over to you since we're running
about five minutes late which is fine a
little time if we need it and welcome
aboard thank you very much Richard
thank you of leash for sending a setting
such a strong context I think one of the
things I like I would like to take over
before I do a deeper into my slide in
the fact that most people have been
worrying or rather worrying to death
about saying that it is automation has
got a kill job I don't think so well we
really need to understand is the purpose
of this the purpose of Industrial
Revolution for mankind has always been
to find ways to get rid of what is
mundane which means automate what is
mundane so that you have more time to
create and deliver or new things what
digital really means is a binary of zero
and one and what that binary means is an
input ratio which is predominantly
robust enough to deliver a better output
so that you have more time to deliberate
and create new things if these things
were not possible or rather if
automation was not taking it neat we
would have still be stuck in the days of
- and not been working on technologies
like
and Ruby on Rails or talking about
Internet of Things and talking about
machine being able to learn and adopt so
we need to really be aware that the fine
line between these talented and being
relevant is skills and while our
education systems specifically in India
is crafting or rather working towards
you know creating new curriculum
enabling new uniforms of Education it is
institutions like Sydney learn who are
also bringing sports to you the
opportunity to adapt yourself to new
learning techniques so I don't think it
should be an either-or like say hey that
is the mandate of an educational
institution or a mandate of corporate to
equip me with skills that are relevant
or make me relevant but it should be
about leveraging the tools and
technologies that are available to you
are brilliance of so you're relevant so
that's exactly what digital means
digital means that ability to adopt into
technology which was any of you to
better communicate externally with your
customers with government with friends
with families all of that together right
it's a cumulative method so we should
not ever look at it in isolation that is
one the second thing is often we confuse
digital and try to feel or rather try to
conceptualize and say hey it's anonymous
only web for social it's not currently
it's a summation of web social and
mobile which means any tool that is
available to you today to further your
communication to your endpoint that can
start with something as basic as your
website that can go into your website
link to your social channel that can be
channeled beyond just Facebook in Linden
and Twitter but still over to you know
still over to tools like kora like
Instagram like hashtag like using Auto
crit for content and so on and it can
mean the mobile because of course with
the penetration of the smartphone usage
specifically in India and we need to
keep the mind guide I'm gonna talk from
an India context and I'm gonna tell you
why because this country is the biggest
serviceable country right now even
though
penetration has been growing 25 to 30
percent year-on-year today smartphones
are getting consumed or rather
smartphones are deliberately getting
consumed mostly by the urban population
so the penetration in the rural segment
is still picking up most of the people
in the rural segment use their
smartphones only to consume video
content or for the purpose of messaging
alone so they're still not penetrated
into using it for knowledge for
education for transaction as it starts
building in think about the opportunity
that lies in front of us which is
humongous so mobility is going to change
the way conversations have been
communication happens transaction
happens and that's the next big thing
and even why government is heavily
investing in it so when we talk about
this connection point what does it
really mean so there are different
players here right the point is to only
talk about business-to-business and
business-to-consumer but now it's
government to water right well goblets
is leveraging tools and technologies to
reach out to voters and consumers for
better better interaction we talked
about you know voters to the government
but they are providing input for running
the girl but only the country in a
better format or even talking about how
they can engage and provide tools in
technology as you as most of you know
Dean came out of a young you know was
the product of a young mind who was a
part of the awesome Innovation Lab and
it was not really a big company that
went into creating it but even the
smallest opportunities can have a very
big place if done right at the right
seventh and then you have consumers to
government and you have the business to
government connection point so you can
pretty much leverage the tools that is
available to you from read social mobile
to make any of these point connections
possible and that is very very important
so well some of you asked me what G to
be B to genies and trust me it's not a
silly question and I think it's drama
you ask me I think it's a very very
strong question because as we are
evolving in the digital era our
communication point has changed beyond
just business to consumer and and
consumer together and business to
business or business consumer so now
it's government to voters both to the
government government to consumers and
many more can I move on to the next
slide
well guys I'm continuously watching at
the chat sandbox if you have any
questions keep coming them in I'm gonna
try and address them as I go through my
slides because that's how the
interaction is gonna kind of build in
now let's talk about the skill gap you
wouldn't see my skill gap and you know
unleash with correctly articulating that
our education system at large has not
really equipped our pupils with the
tools and technology that makes them
relevant for a job for a longer period
of time now the tools and techniques is
not just theoretical in nature it's also
practical so today's able to go into
engineering syllabus if they're talking
about bison and cobalt and basic C++
well we moved away from that and we are
talking about even things like cranium
so we but I really know that you know in
a somatic fast fashion when an education
system of a country has to get overhaul
it's not going to be an overnight thing
so keep your ears and eyes open for
courses that are available on online
platforms like simply learn like ours
where you can actually kind of pick up
the skills that is necessary constantly
keep yourself abreast of the new tools
and technologies that is coming in and
let me tell you the other solution of
digital in evolution which means it's
changing every six months to one year
that's how rapid it is so you need to
keep yourself up with it so the
currently in an Indian mandate is 90% of
the market your black digital teacher
and what I mean by that is to the people
who are wearing the hat of a marketeer
or a digital marketer an organization
may not even be certified and why is it
so important to be certified
certification doesn't just mean
acquisition of a set of yellow skills
and techniques but it means being
relevant and being aware of the
methodologies that are getting
introduced which can ensure that you
have better delivery model within your
organization so you bring in that open
to your organization with any both you
to show better k-ras and that will grow
so you identify channels to reach
consumers and businesses at the lowest
possible cost and as the fastest
possible time and that's where the skill
gap is today so most of the people don't
know how to use it
600 million Internet users in India are
being reached to digital communication
but they are not serviceable yet
so there are many programs that the
government is introducing that the
consul's are introducing to make that
channel possible with what I would talk
about if those people were listening
today is that if you really have to
disrupt it by new ways of reaching them
you have to do it by adapting new
technologies and learning about them
expiry what is your best possible
communication route to your customer in
some cases it may mean you're spending
more money on mobile and not necessarily
investing so much on our web to research
your customers because they they make
description based on your you know based
on communication to receive on mobile
examples units a ecommerce sure now just
the digital marketing job so we'll talk
about skills and when we talk about
automation you also need to understand
with every new technology that has been
introduced in the last ten years it has
created new jobs automation is only of
that that existed before but new
introduction of technologies need need
new people with the skills so jobs are
not going to get lost it just means we
just can't have new jobs on you job
title big data was not known about 15
years back and now you have 10 different
job cycles just under Big Data
cybersecurity was just upon antivirus
now cybersecurity domain has hundred and
sixty different subdomain it just need
there is more nuances to the existing
old skills but it does not mean
replacement of all so digital marketing
alone will have about 1.5 lakh jobs that
it will create in 2017 so just go on and
look into your language don't just spend
connection request try and leverage
building and see what the drop status
looks like you will be surprised
pleasantly surprised to see that the
number of jobs that are increasing
digital is growing at a 30 to 20 percent
month on month so it's not just six
months to a year it's just month on
month and with the new tech in VR and AI
it's just making the possibility of
connection seamless and that's a great
deal it that's a great area where most
of the companies are gonna invest in
which means they're gonna hire new
people to work on this area because
machine will not create algorithms
humans move so that stays constant so go
ahead and kind of equip yourself into
let me move to the next slide
let's look at the skills if we talk
about how do we go ahead and formulate
ourselves one of the big two or rather
one of the disruption that I see
possible in India which is going to
change the game is we do not just
educate and make people literate on
digital using English as a medium of
language it has to become beyond that we
have to understand there are almost 11
official languages we have in India and
if we really have to penetrate into the
rural segment but still people are
graduating from government schools and
colleges learning the basics in marathi
hindi tamil telugu kannada reena to
ensure that we are creating programs
that are catering in these languages and
why it's essential is because local
language marketing is the next big thing
think of China think of Spain think of
Japan it is the local language but
ultimately goes into penetrating into
the larger audience so it's extremely
important to create curriculum and
programs and equip ourselves on
campaigns that are more language focus
and that will also enhance our ability
to penetrate deeper into the audience
that we're looking to harness and
harness a skill so even those who are
learning in English I'm gonna suggest we
learn how to be local language marketing
because that's the next big thing and
Google is going to be investing heavily
in it so with Facebook so it's going to
be good to kind of equip yourself in
those things and even today people when
they are building algorithms in the area
of even artificial intelligence they're
using local language as one of the
parameters
it's very very important to learn and
know about it next I see
you know I'm not gonna spend too much
time and I believe that you know it's
Institute like simply learning us who do
things which is which is in parallel but
it's more complimentary in nature is
that we work at a university level where
we believe that the only way to make
India self sustainable or rather an
economy that is growing as an eight
percent year-on-year is not by looking
for new jobs is by becoming more
self-reliant and that doesn't
necessarily mean that you have to start
your own business it means you need to
create create more trainers so we have
been constantly working with the you
know the government institutions the
universities in training more people who
intern at the comfort of their home so
for example somebody's getting trained
in rifle in Oregon in in in Kolkata or
even if they lose even in you know
charcoal are becoming trainers who are
then going ahead to training people on
digital technology some of them are
doing this training using local language
and why it's so important is that either
you get a job if you do not get a job
you're going to use your hours by
training your people and through black
box like simply learn where thousands of
students are constantly looking and
evaluating courses it's very important
to find the right styling to teach them
so we want to bridge that gap we want to
make people more self-reliant and that's
where our goal comes in and they say hey
you know what digital literacy is not
going to be about just introducing
digital technology it's going to be
about training people to train more
people on this technology so that the
market for the consumption of whether
it's detail whether it's real estate
whether it's whether it's other consumer
products just increases multi-hole and
customers are going to do that by using
mobile using web using social as
channels which is not possible today
even now the most of the user base where
ecommerce companies or real estate see
transactions online if only the urban
population if that has to change we're
trying to bridge that gap by training
more and more people in the rural
segment to do that and it's like please
now top skills required today when I
talk about the top skills required today
side you need to you need to keep in
mind that either I veneers open to look
up off for platforms that offer you this
curriculum I often get called on the
different sure to talk about hey it's
the Indian layoffs in drill are people
really losing jobs what's going to
happen to people who've been in the
company for 20 years the company's
responsibility alone to training if you
are remember something not said it's not
just a company laying people off people
have transitioning from jobs they're
leaving jobs to because they want a
better opportunity
some people are leaving to start up
their own company and some are doing to
become more self aligning so if you if
you look at where you need where you're
landed comes in like you pick ups pick
up a book to read because you want to
acquire knowledge go to us go to an
online platform sign up workforce and
get yourself equipped with it and look
back home today has phenomenal
curriculum that they've developed on
areas like analytics and big data SEO
and digital content digital design and
what digital design is it's very very
important that you know you to
understand that UX UI and user interface
content plays a very very important role
in customer engagement ad set as you
mostly know you know ads whether you're
running on social on mobile or on web
attempt the technologies are constantly
evolving Google releases a new
technology network every six months if
you are not abreast with it it becomes
very difficult for you to stay relevant
social media marketing well there are
new channels coming up every day what is
largely social is understood in India if
you are a company that is servicing
users outside of India let's say in an
Australia or in a UK or in a u.s. it's
not gonna be it's not gonna be a
Facebook it's gonna be mostly a printer
or some other tools that is going to get
you the right kind of mind chefs you
have to keep keep yourself aware of
those rules and technology and app
development that is gonna say relevant
no matter what kind of truthful
technologies come into play app
development will become a very very
important part what is the app
development it is one of the critical
point of communication which not only
simplifies user engagement but also
helps in managing user data
and improvising improvisers machine
learning to very a large extent even
it's going to be the mother of all is
innovation so it's very very important
to know that now um when you when we
talk about skill some some things we
need to understand is that it's already
certified let's say up enough certified
professional or let's say you know big
data certified professionals you need to
keep in mind that there are a lot of new
technologies that are coming in big data
such or in in app development as such
you need to go and keep yourself free
skills teachers that we certify because
that's one of that's not only about the
company's senior potential that's also
about you being able to realize what
what you want to do in future and I see
more and more people in India
going back to our olden days by the way
India used to be a very business Pacific
country until you know thousands of
years of innovation I think they're
going back there right it can be
individual businesses it can start up it
can be atthenes it can be enterprises
and I know there are a lot of people who
are building technologies which are just
getting adopted by the enterprise's
straightaway so that's very critical for
us to understand so automation is not
going to eat up job automation is just
going to make things that are mundane
more automated so that you have more
time to actually learn and leverage new
things but remember something digital
the world of digital is constantly
evolving and changing and like of Mitch
said it's not now restricted to in one
form of platform its physical and
biological which is very very important
for us to understand so you know keep
yourself open keep yourself abreast with
what's coming new and keep learning and
thank you so much I will be happy to
take any questions if you have but then
ultimately thank you well that was
wonderful boy I guess keeping up with
you with some a challenge for me thank
you very much
we have a lot of the from right can you
can you hear me mm-hmm
yes okay yeah little nation thank you
dr. shom for this great you know
presentation I think is very very
relevant I just want to summarize this
for all of you by saying a few things
which you can take from this session as
a key insight and a key takeaway one is
the disruption digital disruption is
happening and it is real right and there
is no doubt about that you have seen
that and you know industry governments
countries everybody is being disrupted
the second thing is that you know you
need to basically the key skill which
you need to take is that yes you will
have many degrees and all but what you
can what you can teach yourself is how
to be a lifelong learner that is a core
skill which you need to take and what
the dr. shom was saying and you know
what ways you know platforms like simply
learn become very important is that
going ahead when you are a lifelong
learner that doesn't mean you want to
have long degrees and long courses it
will be just in time just enough kind of
education and these kind of platforms
are what you see instantly learn are
going to be very very critical to get
that just in time just enough learning
last point because that should not be
missed is that as as machines take a lot
of these jobs and especially from an
analytical perspective one thing which
will be critical and you need to be
building all this because I I find it
even in Accenture that you know when I
find some of the technical people I work
with they seem to be lacking it is soft
skills so the ability to for example
able to empathize collaborate work in
teams set goals and lead people these
things can never be ought to make it so
a lot of soft skills a lot of things
which require human such creativity
please make sure that you are saying
enough emphasis to be soft skills as
well as be constantly abrade on your
hard skills so a combination of that
would be something which will make you
successful going forward so the dis I
stop and if there are questions for
either dr. shom of me happy to take them
well how about we start I have a
question for both of you that's come up
a lot and we see this pretty much
worldwide is security that's a big catch
issue right now is we automate
everything we definitely know
want people to go in and hack them can
you speak as far as very specific to
cybersecurity and what kind of jobs are
right now where do you see that going so
dr. Shaw you want to take that because
you were referring to cybersecurity who
would you like to take that on because I
think you know security at large has
always been something to all the
Industrial Revolution people have
focused on so you know weather is being
big heavy machine industry where it's
gonna be you know typically the physical
part of the people getting affected
where people have to take precaution
today at cybersecurity because
information at large is available on the
net and that makes everybody extremely
vulnerable so what I what I want to
emphasize is that while all the other
technologies whether it's big data
whether it's IOT whether it's machine
learning ARB are is going to be do on a
part of Advent it is not gonna be in
isolation with you know I in isolation
to cybersecurity with information
information security will become the
most predominant active aspect
what would it include it would include
big data which means therefore the
constant churning of looking at data and
intelligence and understanding user
behavior which will be then coupled with
predictive analytics which means it will
start determining what is vulnerable and
what may be vulnerable because you know
there is no concept of nothing is you
know something is not vulnerable so what
may be vulnerable now to what may become
vulnerable in future and therefore
technologies are going to be adopted and
implemented as layer 1 layer 2 depending
on the level of vulnerability the third
important aspect which is going to which
is gonna be very important for
information security is that it will
start adopting the Machine would start
adopting and understanding based on
predictive analytics what can you may
end up doing and therefore start
deploying the levels of security at that
that stage itself and finally to commit
all there is gonna be you know like a V
set you can never take away the human
interface because at the end of the day
there is no replacement for the human
intellect
that's why it's called an artificial
intelligence so the real intelligence is
gonna be it's gonna be playing a very
very critical role in looking at
you know deep learning a technology that
is gonna actually show up information to
quickly submit and act on it more on
overlay approach so information security
is it was both at an operating system
level to improve air levels whereas out
level which is affirmation of Big Data
predictive analytics machine learning
and deployment of finally security
method algorithms so that's pretty much
where it lies so I would say that it's
one of the biggest areas where people
are investing in and really a mission I
were in Israel which is all about you
know cybersecurity and efficient so more
light but I would just say this it was a
problem before it stated the problem
with solution is equipping ourselves
with the tools and technology that will
help us you know play an important role
in better vertical yeah and just to add
to what the official said so if you look
at cybersecurity other profession you
know that would need for example
specialization leader in web application
security network security malware
understanding or even other various
issues like for example I feel so guilty
now if it is not secure it is useless
that is the motto which i think is very
clear that if it is not secure it is
useless applied very very critically in
Internet of Things which is the core
component of fourth in the field
evolution but you can see the direct
correlation that if Internet of Things
has to boost or turbocharged the
Industrial Revolution it has to be
secured because it's if people think
that you know these sensors and
different actuators are going to get
hacked then nobody is going to be
scanning internet of things going
forward so
Spada systems for example all these will
be very critical and in terms of some of
the key skills you can talk about you
know secure coding cyber forensics all
these will be critical very critical and
dr. shom talked about because for all
these technologies to succeed it is
important that people have confidence
that the data will be secure and one of
the big things which we are talking
about today is read only the protection
of your identity as well which is
directly related to data and so I will
security so that is what what we would
like to talk about it some very very
significant
opportunity for professionals and it's
going to just increase as you can see
with all the older issues which are
going around the guilty and management
of identity excellent yeah what a world
we live in this is exciting we have a
lot of questions coming in from people
and I'm gonna try to summarize like
about a dozen different questions in one
and just for everybody's information if
you both are willing since we started
late we can go an extra five to 10
minutes if that's okay yeah we can do it
in the five minutes okay excellent
other questions a lot of people ask is
Rhys killing I know that comes up a lot
where somebody's either just starting
into the workforce and they go out and
get their first certificate or they've
been in cells for eight years and now
they're want to get going to digital the
digital marketing what would be your
suggestion to someone who's trying to
figure out which direction to go in
first and where to go and get the
experience and the job I mean you know
that's what it's about menÃ­s Lee a job
but earned some income at it what would
be your suggestion to people like that
who are trying to switch their careers
or just starting out is a very very
broad area like I like I talked about
now especially when you are in functions
like sales and marketing I think what
really is your tra or what really
mandates in doing an organization is how
quickly you can acquire more customers
and how you can basically reduce the
cost of that acquisition these are two
critical metrics based on which they are
evaluated now when you're looking at
that then what really matters is to is
to quickly address yourself or to look
on technology that helps you get there
now the first thing that comes to my
mind
or rather always is something that I
always you know tell that students to go
for is get a Google fundamental
certification it's very very important
and why I say that is that's like Google
has 90% of the web I'm not going to talk
about how China and everything else is
but that's that that's your pet that's
your mother of all week so you have to
understand how the tools and
technologies that are there it literally
works and that can mean that you
understand how ads would you start with
understanding how SEO work I'm going to
add so you know that whether you want to
use you know cost per click a cost per
conversion or a cost per impression kind
of a metric to reach out to your
customer depending on the industry that
you're in then it comes to the fact
where you are understanding the analysis
because see without the knowledge or
without being able to correlate the
input and output that I talked about
which is the a current parameters of
digital it's very difficult for you to
devise campaigns gone are the days when
people would do you know people with
experimental campaigns where they'll
just go put something try and see now
they want to do logical interest-based
demographic base target based campaigns
and that's possible only when you know
the two especially when you know
analytics and I see the beauty with
today's all these curriculum is that
even it was not a technology expert even
if you are not an engineer by profession
you can pick up these things very very
easily because there's over streamline
and there's so many deep you know deep
learning education formats that are
available today becomes very easy so I
think that's the first way to go the
second way would be Facebook has just
launched a certification program again a
very very deep learning program but I
think it's going to be huge for most of
the people who are learning because stop
using Facebook just to like post and
share stock using it to make business
and that's what I believe individuals
and leveraging it so companies should
grab it division as well
I know bloggers who aren't any bells
anywhere between a lakh to about two
lakhs a month by just using leveraging
Facebook as a digital give a campaign
platform so very important to rest
yourself with those tools and technology
beyond that there are many more there
are many more which are regional focus
which means depends on the chakra P
there there are a lot of other tools but
the certifications these two are very
very important but there are today a lot
of the Institute's who are from creating
their own curriculum as providing so you
can go ahead and take them again that I
think Ashley was asking this question
online I was just about to revert to her
is it worth it of course it's worth it
and see also the function of marketing
if you can't
find customers if you don't know what
that interests are if they don't if you
don't know how they react you can't
create campaign so it's very much what
if I give a shot I'll just add one more
thing here in terms of the skills so
digital marketing and you know customer
activations obviously very critical but
if you do the transformation which
organizations are going through and all
the skill which comes in like Accenture
looking at so there are two parts of it
one is the internal part which we call
the little enterprise and this is where
you use digital technologies like
artificial intelligence or IOT to
improve the productivity of an
organization right so many many such
technologies including robotics and
cognitive are being used to improve the
internal processes and productivity of
organization so don't become very
critical and as dr. Shawn was saying on
the other hand is what we call digital
customer that means improving the
customer experience
I think customer experience divine it's
probably one of the critical skills
which is emerging on the front of the
digital transformation so anything in
terms of how do you define the persona
you define the journey of of a customer
and how do you basically delight the
customer and improve the customer
experience all those skills which some
of them which we shown was talking about
are going to be very critical so these
two one on the backend side in terms of
using hard technology by deep learning
artificial intelligence robotics
cognitive you know these will be very
important on the pattern side and as you
go ahead on front and side it is all
about digital marketing content
marketing performance marketing you know
customer experience design those will be
critical and another question I think
which is which is coming up is that well
we have our certifications but we don't
have experience so is there hope for
people like us as well
absolutely there is so you know in terms
of today's world and there for example
the way out the approach Accenture takes
is not looking at you know there you
have many years of experience because
when we are talking about technology
like blockchain or artificial
intelligence or robotics these
technologies are pretty new so I can't
be asking you that these come with five
years of experience and blockchain
technology
that doesn't make me look foolish right
so that's not more happen if you have
certified and if you have skills which
you can demonstrate so you know again
when Accenture hiding now we're not
looking for your your CV you know we
will for example do and hackathon right
and in the hackathon we will test out
exactly what kinds of skills you have
and it doesn't really matter if you have
any experience or zero experience
doesn't matter if you can demonstrate
that you have mastered or you have a
pretty good idea about this particular
technology you will be hired Accenture
is not a fool to think that we need
years of experience in these
technologies that's just not going to
happen and we will not ask you to do
that you have to demonstrate those
skills on the ground in a place like a
Texan for example hmm and just a quick
follow-up on the Accenture you guys are
mainly based out of India but are you
also international then to in question
I've never been asked that so we are in
now we are in 150 odd countries India is
yes our biggest geographies we have
about more than 150 thousand two hundred
and seventy thousand people just in
India and the reason for that is that we
have big global delivery capabilities
both from a technology and BPO
perspective so we hired significant
amount of people in India and almost 50
thousand people every year and if you
look at again you know in terms of what
have been happening from our hiring
perspective Accenture is probably the
only company whether it is from an MNC
perspective or Indian pure plains
Accenture the only company which has not
talked about you know retrenchment or
firing or anything like that we are
constantly looking into hire new people
but gets definitely in skills which are
aligned to Accenture the agenda so yes
extension completely international
company we are so international that we
don't even have a headquarter our
chairman CEO is a French our chief
operating officer is a Belgian or you
know the head of technology is an Indian
so you never know what kind of company
Accenture is but it is certainly an
international company
excellent I really think that one of our
biggest changes we've seen is how most
companies are now International which I
love I love seeing the innovation across
the world and the think tanks and the
incubators and startups we do have a for
those who if we don't get to your
questions they will be going through
we'll have somebody going through and
sending out emails and answering what
questions we can you can also go to our
website and request a copy of the
recording if you just go into any of the
support tab simply learn will then send
you to your email link then you can
download the copy of the recording and
view it for later we'll go ahead and go
ahead and close it up do if you guys
have anything else you would like to add
before we close this session for both
dr. assume Singh and yourself go ahead
we can go ahead and do that and then
we'll go and close the session for today
so I think though you know I have from
my side talk about it and you know again
just to summarize if you look at a chess
board we are in the second half of the
chessboard what it means is that every
eighteen months the change is going to
double right and what that means is that
because of that change happening so fast
and a combination of technologies
leading to that there will be many jobs
which existed in the future which won't
exist as we go ahead but there will be
many new jobs which did not exist in the
in the past which will start existing
right so that's what it is and the whole
concept of being a lifelong learner is
combining hard skills and pop skills and
just in time just enough is what's going
to make you succeed Bashan well thank
you Alicia
firstly I want to thank the entire since
you don't see me Tina uniformed making
this session possible I think we had
tremendously active participants you
know who had some really great questions
come in I couldn't answer I try my best
onto most of them couldn't answer all of
them but happy to take them offline I
also want to say that you've come today
to share this session to basically try
and understand what you can learn and
take away and what should your next step
so here is here
my you know three things that you should
be doing after this one identify an area
that you're really passionate about and
you're looking to learn for a while and
haven't found time go research on it and
quickly enroll yourself and I say that
because knowledge can be acquired
through three mediums one you read a
book - you hear people who experience it
three get experience it yourself so go
ahead and do that because you can keep
listening to people understand until you
experience the knowledge yourself you'll
really not know the impact it's gonna
have on your life the second thing that
I'm gonna talk about if you're not happy
doing what you're doing go ahead and
take a look at the new things that are
available and see if you already have
the skills mapping to it and try and go
and give it a shot because I think the
only way we're going to keep evolving is
by a distributed learning and job
mechanism that's very very important
third thing if you've had enough of job
not looking to generate necessarily
startup but remember something teaching
is a profession that is very very
committed and if you can learn the tools
and technologies yourself you can impart
more and more people to become more
self-reliant to get not affected by this
entire storm of automation and hardware
new challenge and create a better
ecosystem in this country and abroad so
I believe one of the things that have
always said that next the net you know
if you say that need is the mother of
invention focus on something leads to
better initiation so go ahead try
something new get yourself equipped and
empower more people thank you very much
I really enjoyed the session and hope to
talk to you guys thank you and what a
wonderful session I just I actually love
my job being in the background and
listening to these I very much
appreciate your time with us today and
we look forward to hopefully having you
on again at some point a wonderful
session and webinar again everybody if
you want a copy of recording or if you
have additional questions you can come
to simply learn they will try to answer
the questions that were missed in the
chat because they do go through that and
send out notes but you're also welcome
to come and check in with the support if
you go under support
send them a note they'll send you out a
copy of this recording so you can go
back and review it and there's also
people you can chat with there if you
have more questions on the different
