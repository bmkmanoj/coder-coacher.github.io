slide as well and we'll also see what
state transition testing is behavior is
the sequence of messages or events that
an object accepts object is something
which is in a particular state and has
behavior state transition testing is a
blackbox test design technique in which
test cases are designed to execute valid
and invalid state transitions here is
the state transition table for the
switch example we have seen in the
previous slide we consider current state
and give an input and see what output
and finish state will be for three
different steps in step one current
state is off an input is switched on
output in this case is light on and
finish state is on as well in step two
current state is on an input is switch
off output in this case is light off and
finish state is off to in step three
current state is off an input is switch
on output in this case is light on and
finish state is on as well let us
consider online banking information
access scenario and come up with state
transition table as an exercise consider
login and logout as two different states
and valid and invalid username and
password combinations as input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
