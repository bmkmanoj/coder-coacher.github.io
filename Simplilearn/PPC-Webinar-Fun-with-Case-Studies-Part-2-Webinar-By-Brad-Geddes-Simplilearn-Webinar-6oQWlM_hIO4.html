Brad's got to lay down for us today Brad
good morning it's all yours my friend
Thank You chip thank you so last last
month we went through a lot of case
studies more related to bidding whether
it was doing things by time of day day
of the week call center actually
connecting bid in a call center so forth
today we're gonna we're gonna kind of
look at the other stuff that doesn't
include bidding audiences are something
that if you do a lot of Facebook you're
familiar with but a lot of people
running adwords and in bing campaigns
don't use a lot of audience data
appropriately so we're going to touch on
some audience stuff we're gonna look at
some other tests done on landing pages
through ad copy testing or to a previous
workshop we did and it's all the ways we
use our testing data so what I want to
start off first though it is kind of
talking through remarketing lists for
search ads it's such a highly highly
underused feature and
allows for just an amazing amount of
targeting so we look at where all essays
are they're essentially a way of using
remarketing but instead of using it for
display using it across search so you
can make a list that says hey if someone
checked out on my site then put him in
this list or someone went to my site
they looked around for three minutes but
they didn't thought my leaves form I put
him on a list and and Google shared
quite a bit of confidential data and I
saw one in the finance sector where
always says make up six to eight percent
of clicks but eighteen to twenty percent
of conversions that shows you how
powerful they are however it's all it's
all based on someone's behavior on your
site first so with them you can either
change your bids up or down you could
make different you can use different
keywords for users in a list so a common
example of this is I've got a our local
Twitter dealership but I do some work
with on occasion and they're a local
dealership and they can't afford to buy
words like cars and new cars all the
time it's it's too broad for them but if
someone came to their site previously in
a term like hybrid car well then they
could show an ad for a Prius if you
search for a new car later on because I
know you're interested in this in with
them if you're using manual CPC bidding
then essentially they can be bid
modifiers if you're using CPA bidding or
one of Google's automated systems then
it's just another signal to use now
often we hear things like audience
targeting in this stuff people start
thinking well that's a big site thing
and it's not necessarily a large site to
take advantage of this for our essays or
even custom at you only need a thousand
cookies in six months so if you get a
hundred fifty visitors a month to your
site which I'm guessing most you get
more than that you can use them and so
this is a small ecommerce company
they're using CPA bidding and they just
made seven lists that says they made an
all visitor list they made a list for
each product line and Add to Cart
that's it this is under an hour of work
they took these lists they too supplied
them to their current account they saw a
10% bump in conversions from an hour of
work in this 10% bump is sustainable
month over month over month because
they're using CPA bidding so it's just
another bid signal to use now they have
to do bid adjustments for their shopping
campaigns because you can't use
automated bidding for shopping campaigns
but that's it and so even small
companies can really benefit from our o
essays now some some people look at them
like I don't know how this is gonna work
it's an easy way to get started if
you're doing CPC bidding go make a few
lists just make an all visitor list this
will take you all of like two minutes to
make add it to your account without a
bid adjustment this is essentially
called reporting mode you'll get stats
on your audience without spending any
more money then you can take a look at
it we look at this particular account
they're remarketing lists for search ads
conversion rates is 9.8 3% their overall
is four point eight nine percent so
we're doubling their conversion rates
from that user list people come to your
site the show a signal they know your
brand now and so it's secondary actions
often a really really powerful
now remarketing is also great and again
a lot of people are still not using
remarketing which I find just amazing
marketing it basically says how you came
to my site you didn't finish in action
so as you go across the web across the
Display Network I want to show you an ad
right this could be dynamic which means
show the actual products back to a user
if someone came to your your OTA your
online travel agency and they looked at
a hotel and a flight you canonical
create the ad to include the hotel and
the flight if someone came to your site
they started filling out a lead form
didn't finish it that's a great prospect
so this same company they took the
remarketing list they already made so
the our work was already done and in
Google's ad gallery they have a quick
way of scanning your website to make ads
for you these are amazing
don't want to sit call them amazing
they're great starting places and
they're good ways to easily test out
messages that if you want something more
professional-looking you can then take
your top messages and hand it to a
designer or go to like an 99designs
and have them make a nicer looking at
for you
so same company they added Arles A's
they spent 20 minutes using Google's
image maker to make the ads that was it
those are the 10% bump in conversions
and while these numbers aren't huge it's
a small company right the fact that
they're getting great conversions from
an hour of work month over month over
month is a wonderful thing and I don't
think enough small sites take advantage
of this now small sites are one thing
right they don't have a lot of lists to
manage when you get into larger sites
you really really need to think about
what are your marketing goals what is
your budget to try things out and who's
your audience and how much do you want
to segment your audience so this is a
very large b2b SAS company when I say
very large they're they spend well over
four to five million dollars a month
with just Google not including other
places so for them they kind of look and
say okay we've got a lot of different
audiences that we want to target in
various ways so for instance they've a
blog so they want to target blog readers
for when they want to launch new types
of content
now blog shares are different as someone
shared a blog post via Twitter Facebook
whatnot they want to make sure those
same users because I'm more likely to
share again actually see anything else
they make so that they get a better
social bump from this now when they look
at their all site visitors they segment
everything into SMB versus Enterprise
because they want to show a different
add different pricing different ways of
contacting them based on it for an SMB
or enterprise company so an enterprise
they really want to get you on the phone
right they they want they're willing to
do personal contact on
demos in-person demos of a half-two and
asks them be the margins are much lower
so they really want to push the SMB into
their automated sign-up form - to sign
up for the SAS products now what they
have white paper downloads like most b2b
companies do so again these are
segmented and SME versus enterprise now
theoretically they're white papers are
segmented by their ten products SMB an
enterprise so that white paper is
actually 20 lists people in a free trial
so they offer their SAS company they
offer a free trial now when you look at
and b2b the problem with free trials is
people start a trial and they look at it
for 30 seconds to maybe two minutes and
they never log in again and so often
their free trial here their reason they
segment this is they want people to log
in and actually use the free trial now
again in SAS companies what happens is
someone might use a free trial but
you've got about sixty days about two
months so we either get them hooked on
the product or they're gonna cancel and
so for the next 60 days and they want to
say all right you're a new you're new
customer we want to make sure you
understand our help files that will give
you demo will help you through the
product and they really want to push
that engagement for the first 60 days
now someone's been a customer for more
than 60 days then they want to
cross-sell you
well you're signed up for this product
had this product integrates really
really nicely right so they don't want
to give up on people paying them they
want to engage them differently i'm
employees are a list what they were
finding is that employees would
constantly go and click on their ads to
find help files so while they've
excluded their IP address when employees
travel they are on different IP
addresses so they have one that's
employees to actually stop employees
from clicking on their ads on TV
commercial with so when they run TV
commercials they will create lists based
on the flight times and locations of the
TV commercials so they can want the same
kind of ads that match the television
commercials and keep these things going
and they have a whole lot
this is kind of a way to start thinking
through do you have different products
how you want to re-engage users blog
posts can be very useful but not if you
focus purely on CPA and Legion write
blog posts are useful from a social
standpoint and awareness standpoint a
sentiment standpoint but necessarily
conversion standpoint so that that goes
into more the brand based budget we look
at their goals
rafe wallies lists or current please-
lists I'll click in our ads their blog
readers so they use a really great way
of also using our essays which is
combining it with dynamic search ads so
with dynamic search ads you don't pick
keywords you tell Google hey this is
part of my site I want you to call it
could be your blog could be all of your
site these things are really really
powerful and so they're saying here's
our blog and here's our white papers so
when we push out something we want
Google to crawl it and when a query
matches something on our page we want
you to show you an ad so DSA's
automatically generate ads you write
only a description life for them so they
run Arliss a boss DSA is to make sure
their blog content is viewed so based on
visitor types then right they use their
site visitor types
Eston being a price so forth for bid
modifier so raising bids up or down and
that's an easy way then my product type
to manage the target CPAs now visitor
type just means you you saw part of our
content and you did something so then if
someone actually downloaded a white
paper right they they went they filled
out a form and downloaded a white paper
step one of their conversion process
well then they they want those users to
always see their ads again they want to
use competitor keywords broader keywords
that they normally wouldn't buy because
that users shown a signal to do
something with them and the ads are
focused on the next step which is a free
trial someone's in a free trial right
they want to get them in the trial and
then a really high bid modifier on
competitor terms so what they don't want
to do is for you to start a free trial
with them and then the next day search
for the competitor and start
while there so while they might not buy
compared homes all the time they buy
really very aggressive on bidding on
competitors for people who have started
free trial or for current customers all
right customers under 60 days they
showcase help files lesser known
features um sometimes some products are
pretty complicated to use and they you
they actually use different extensions
at extensions so their site links call
out their help files call out demos call
out support well they're not going to
call that out for someone who's
searching for the that type of product
they offer because it's someone hasn't
really needed the help file yet they may
be sold first and then customers more
than 60 days they do use the word brand
plus login as a negative keyword because
what they're finding is that people
would search for their brand click on
the ad just to login so the word login
is a negative keyword if you're a
customer but then the brain itself is
for for customers who are not searching
the word login our positive list
modifiers to cross on other products so
you can get really complicated with it
but that's a lot of thinking right
there's a lot to really think about how
you manage that the SMB vs. Enterprise
course where someone isn't the funnel
but to show you the power of this much
segmentation if you have the traffic
here's what their monthly Arliss a stats
look like they have well over 11,000
conversions a month for RSA and if
someone is search for their brand term
after downloading a white paper their
CPA is two dollars and forty four cents
with an almost eighty percent conversion
rate that's a huge huge number and so
that that's where you need to think
through not just do we have what can we
do right it's how are we gonna execute
on these kind of ideas now we looked at
I'd be the be one of the biggest
problems we see in b2b is mobile devices
mobile devices
lonna b2b company and sit there and say
well mobile if someone's on a mobile
phone they don't care they're not going
to convert not going to
while on a mobile device in in many
cases that is true right then like
download our whitepaper mobile device
they could easily share a blog post but
if you have some size part that requires
a complex login they're not gonna gonna
convert some b2b companies do really
well on mobile if they were to really
think through the user base so this is
data for a materials testing laboratory
so if you are creating a new product and
it's a physical product like a kid's toy
before you can put it on store shelves
you have to have it examined for mercury
levels and lead levels and and how is it
you know is there any problems with
regulations in accidents and store
shelves and so when they looked at their
leads right it was all desktop based say
they got a few leads on tablets for a
little on mobile their converter it's
more terrible but it not necessarily
always it's the traffic problem
sometimes it's the website problem so we
think of mobile mobile design right
you've got mobile you have a desktop
websites shown on mobile devices so
these don't get reformatted well they're
incredibly hard to pick out if any of
you can read that content you gotta be
under 25 with great eyesight because I'm
sitting 6 inches from the screen and I
can't even read the content of that it's
not designed for mobile device now you
can read this content this is responsive
design responsive good for every device
not great for any one device wonderful
for publishers IT loves it because they
only have one website to support and
then we have mobile only sites and it's
very hard to find it be to be a mobile
only website because they don't usually
believe in this enough and so this was a
different company again a pretty large
spender who has an a locked-down
IT department and in other words to get
a single word changed on a page means
three to six months of tickets to get a
word changed you want to change a link
you could be talking six months to a
year to get a link chain
or you know CSS change there's two or
three years of wait time usually and so
they had a desktop site in we were just
trying to convince them hey just it's
least try respond to design try
something because we don't think it's
necessarily your traffic that's the
problem and so after I don't know three
months four months of time they we
finally convinced the IT department to
let us use a subdomain cname redirection
to a different server so if something
went bad another server it couldn't
affect the rest of their company and
just installed WordPress used one
responsive theme and one mobile theme
that was it so now we have three
websites we have a responsive a mobile
dedicated in a desktop so we said
alright let's let's use their current
traffic in AdWords we're gonna make
three identical ads in every ad group
wanna send want each ad to a different
page and see what happens so after a few
months turned out that their mobile
specific website had a 6x higher
conversion their desktop for mobile
devices of course not for desktop
devices in fact it was double responsive
design for them and they looked at this
and looked at this woman would not
believe it right we think our sites
grade no one's born will device of
course if the material says I was
calling them or that wasn't people
buying stuff it was calling it to
schedule things and so they finally put
some design around it and kept it due to
ite on it on a third-party server and
after a few months there are mobile
conversions Eclipse desktop now this is
one of those sometimes harder
conversations because it's IT its
website there's a lot of marketers who
can change traffic very quickly but
can't change websites very fast now I do
what it says in our case when we look at
why people search on mobile devices it's
arts and entertainment its news its
shopping is really taking off
it's food it's not a lot of b2b so not
every b2b company is gonna find great
mobile success but it is definitely
worth looking at to see at least have a
good mobile presence and have offered
things like white papers newsletter
subscriptions some of your ability for a
user and b2b to convert even though it
may not be assigning it for an actual
demo giving a credit card let them get
the content necessary especially send
content up the line to to their boss to
get approval on mobile devices now
another issue that that we see a lot in
b2b is that data set mobile at minus 100
percent
now if mobile doesn't convert you just
don't want to be a mobile I get where
that happens on occasion at least by
your brand terms on mobile device even
if you use something like a 50 percent
negative bid adjustment with Google
showing you often three and four ads
above organic results users searching
for your brand on mobile devices aren't
seeing your organic results and you're
losing a lot of traffic to competitors
buying your brand on mobile devices so
even if your b2b and and anyone if
you're have a really did well design
ecommerce system but it only works on
desktop for mobile at least by brain you
know it's a really large bid modifier
this company buys errs finally and they
actually get a decent CP it's not a huge
number right it's for their 15,000
conversions but at least now they
control their brand on mobile devices
now Quality Score is tough and b2b
because with Quality Score you really
want a great click-through rate which is
tough to get on a case I'm going to show
an example in a minute you want a great
landing page you can do that you want
good ad relevance you can kind of do
that and sometimes in b2c claudus core
is a very very important number
sometimes in b2b it's not and to show an
example here right if sometimes in b2b
if quality scores are eights and nines
for non branded terms and for terms that
aren't be to be specific they're not
purchase agent terms they're they're
consumer and
business based terms sometimes that we
see eights and nines we actually think
that they can do better conversion rate
wise by lowering quality score
it sounds very counterintuitive but this
is a chart of one b2b companies non
brand non purchase agent terms by
Quality Score as quality score their
conversion rates go down and and the
term here is the term safety gates now
the term safety gates is primarily
searched for from a consumers looking to
buy a twenty thirty dog gate for their
pets or their kids so they don't fall
down the stairs I keep mine of a room
there's a subset a small subset of
searchers who search for safety gates
who spend ten thousand a hundred
thousand dollars on gates for factories
and plants so on this search result the
the purplish blue color is b2b ads the
yellow is b2c ads so all these if you
look at the b2b ones closely they're all
industrial they use the words OSHA they
use things like call us for a quote now
what happens here is not only how great
quality scores they could get a great
quality score if they took off all these
pre-qualifying terms of call us for a
quote and OSHA and so forth their Clause
scores would jump up their CPAs would
skyrocket as they'd get all these people
who were looking for a cheap pet gate
clicking on their ads and so that
pre-qualification the ads is really
important be to be however it will lower
click-through rates which will lower
quality scores so next month our webinar
is actually going to focus on clause
with a lot of really cool new analysis
we can do with an API changes a couple
months ago now here's actually the
biggest problem in b2b is landing pages
because a lot of b2b companies don't ask
for the conversion these are the two top
pages for the same term safety gates
competitor one if you can find the way
to convert on that page you're you've
got great
eyesight's because the very bottom in
standard text is call us at this number
and a lot of companies kind of think
well someone really wants to do if I
stuff the font of how to do it in and I
see this even a B to C on like high-end
design firms and architecture firms all
the time now here's the competitor big
download the specs here's our big phone
number
get it quotes so it's the same product
really different experience from a user
standpoint of how easy it is to deal
with these two companies if you don't
ask the conversion you can't get the
conversion all right you gotta ask for
it now
we've often talked a lot about ad
testing for insights and and also video
later that we did on that you can refer
back to within Mark emotive but one
thing that that we often look at or how
do we get insights from ad testing and
then how do we apply that other places
so if your I've been a lot of webinars
with us you've probably seen this
example for I'm gonna go beyond at this
han so so one is using customer data
this is a ecommerce company who sells
promotional products now they have two
types of buyers they have
business-to-business buyers who want to
buy 10,000 cups with their logo on it
for an event they're hosting they have
consumer buyers who want to put their
kids picture on a cup and buy 20 of them
for a birthday party so they prefer b2b
but but they'll sell a b2c as well not
gonna turn down the money but it's not
their primary market and so you know
looking through their their reviews
every time someone gave them a five star
review they use the word rush shipping
now this is e-commerce so of course like
most ecommerce companies they have
something that says free shipping in
their ads because free means free right
well businesses often don't care about
free they want something today or
tomorrow they want it quickly and rush
it is a very specific type of shipping
so well let's go test the ads right
let's do fast and free shipping which
was the current ad versus rushed
shipping
and ran the test and said I don't
believe this information I didn't
believe the test result it was it was
done properly and that's because I
didn't think this word would make a 5x
difference in average order value
I felt like we missed something really
big looking at this data and we did we
we missed the fact that certain products
are mostly sent to homes and certain
products are mostly sent to business
addresses so when to their products
intact them and said these get shipped
to business addresses these primarily
get shipped to residential addresses so
it's redo the same task just changing
description line to across you know a
few hundred groups but do it but and
then look at the data based upon it
where it's getting ships to in reran
it's okay if it's a b2b meaning of the
businesses where it was shipped to
Russia ping was what people really
latched on to consumers don't they know
Russian things expensive they don't want
to pay for it they want free shipping
and so just by changing a single word
here I mean fast and free to rush that's
the only difference in these ads they
have a big difference in their
conversion rates the revenue per
impression metrics because they're
talking the language of the consumer
whether it's actual consumer or a
business now this is great insights you
can get with multi group testing but
there's no reason to stop here right
there you got an insight and insight
should filter through to the website as
well to other marketing materials I said
well let's take this data and put on the
website right let's put this right on
the landing page and see what happens so
one was you know free shipping takes two
to three days for deliver the other one
was rushed shipping get it tomorrow for
ores under a thousand items and this was
a point of contention because the the
owner of this business said what they
want you know twenty thousand I can't do
it tomorrow but was pretty certain this
to be okay so what do the conversion
rate lift a nice lift but its e-commerce
no one cares about conversion rates you
care about revenue so one looked at the
revenue that didn't work too well
negative eight percent
rather than from their top customer base
b2b companies and and said well this is
significant change it's right 11% lift -
8% order that's significant
so we're onto something we just don't
have the messaging correct yet so went
through a lot of button narrations
usually buttons are over talked about
and testing colors and so forth usually
they're over talked about but in this
case it really did make a difference and
after getting the correct messaging free
shipping orders over 150 that's a it's a
really big deal in e-commerce he is
putting a limit on your free shipping
you know Amazon was probably one who
rolled this out really first like 10 12
years ago they took their marketing
budget and turn it into free shipping
and they put a free shipping at I
believe it was $25 I might've been 35
but what they saw is their average order
value actually increased because
consumers they say oh if I spend $10
more I'll get it free so I'll spend $10
more to get a dollar-fifty off of
shipping rate this is a very common
thing in the marketing world to see and
then for the b2b companies it click for
details popped it up here's your average
order size how many you want this how
fast we can do it in and that makes
that's great no again not done yet with
the ad dad all right that is powerful so
we looked at the various lines they were
using for D ones for description line
ones see that the two highest
click-through by far the two highest
click-through rate right view of
finished product and customize the font
with colors in your logo or by far the
worst conversion rates but again it's
outlier data that's always important
when you say okay our best converting
rate is 6% CTR but our best CTR is
actually double that rate so how do we
increase volume of clicks without
affecting our conversion rates
well that's using your same data in
other places in their account so in
their case they put it as extensions
they made it site links and hence and
you can't truly
do scientific tests for site links for
site links you have to do sort of before
and after tests so when they added it
they saw an increase in total clicks
without a decrease in conversion so
that's what you're really looking for
now going back to audience lists then
again we're not even done yet right this
is the same company who had her
allah''says and saw a 10% lift said okay
well you know what we can even go
further here so we now know that
businesses are have a better repeat rate
for the company and they know that the
business of higher value so now what
happens is when a user checks out if the
user it checks out an amount over 500
hours or of the shipping address was to
a business address they put them into a
b2b shoppers lift shoppers list so that
if they search again they have super
high bid modifiers because they know
that is a great user to get back now if
the user checked out but it was a under
500 hours or it was shipped to home
address they still put them in a list to
remarket back to converters but they
have a very low bid modifier because
they're willing to sell to consumers but
it's not their primary business and if
you're looking to see how to get these
great multi ad tests arm data for
yourself we did a whole workshop on how
to really lay out exactly how to do ma
testing to get global insights because
these are insights and aren't from an ad
group they're from an entire segment of
an account such as all your brand terms
all your product terms were just ate all
your SNB product terms now lastly
websites are great places to use you
know some of this data some things I
just want to give you some inspiration
of things to think about our testing
data is so powerful title tags have the
same length
especially when Google rolls out the new
title tags in probably October we're
gonna see 60 character long title tags
that's the same as organic we see really
savvy companies sit down with the SEO
team and say okay
in ad right then ad is just anything
written down or any kind of a visual way
of getting of motivating a user to do an
action rate an organic listing is an ad
and PPC ad is of course an ad right as
designed to motivate and influence
someone's decision so we see smart
companies sit down with the SEO team and
say hey we know you've got to have
certain keywords in your ads but the
rest of your title tag is really just a
navigate user to click through so
they'll run PPC tests to see how they
should structure their organic title
tags because you can't AV test organic
title tags that's a good way to do it
email subject lines their ads - right so
other great places to use this is just
in your emails another great place if
you're doing like button testing most
emails and with a call to action right
here's a button here's something they'll
click on it's a great place to do it
when you look at websites most people
are really afraid to a/b test their
homepage or key pages code I understand
that right if you say ah we're just
going to change our homepage today
that's kind of a scary proposition great
way to do this look at the new homepage
you want to design right launch it but
not on your main page launch it
somewhere else in your site and then run
your branded traffic to that new page
now you can't ask with branded based
traffic your new homepage but actually
rolling it out and effect your organic
or just the overall brand perception
first if you're doing a lot of SEO right
remarketing and in your Google Display
placement information are great link
targets right link building is still
alive and well and if you're gonna say
where do we get great converting traffic
from you have a list it's in your
account already right great places to
think about how you get some traffic
from those pages that are already
sending you converting traffic
remarketing we love our marketing or
marketing is great for influencing any
other channel remarketing just says hey
summited action X on our website and we
want to reinforce B
year of action acts and make them do
action why you can make remarketing list
off of TV flights off of social
campaigns so they came from Facebook
we're gonna put them in our Facebook
list and show different ads to Facebook
users versus Twitter users if you want
to write the great for email when you
want CMOS are surveyed right what is
their one of their biggest hurdles
overalls to deal with them what do they
really want to get done in the next five
years it's better integration of marking
apartments and this has been on the list
for I don't know 10 years now right it's
better integration marking apartments so
of what CMOS want except companies are
really starting to do it now and have
much better integration through marking
apartments a great place to start how
companies work together is via
remarketing so you can say alright well
let's let's say here's the emails we're
gonna send let's put those email users
in specific lists so if their email user
saw this creative and clicked we know
what appeals to them but then they
didn't convert okay so we know this
email could appeal to them but they
didn't convert so therefore we can now
build an ad that uses that structure
from the initial email but got them to
click but we'll change the offer to
something else might get them to convert
and that's a very important
consideration now the larger company the
heart of this is my favorite stories on
this is we're working a company big big
fortune I don't know if they're 100
they're at least 500 minimum and and the
email team had been to one of the SMX
shows and learned about remarketing and
said this is great we can reinforce her
emails because we know it takes users to
point three clicks to convert when I
click on an email but if they're only
clicking on the 1.5 emails each so we
need one more touch point from somewhere
I thought well let's let's use
remarketing for this and so they sat
down and this was a really good email
team they sat down and said okay here's
the email we're gonna send here's a
landing page we're gonna use so if this
doesn't make them convert here's the
offer we should try next so they sat
down and made another landing page made
ads and walked the paid search team and
said hey can you run this for us we want
to send up this email
and if someone doesn't convert wants you
to put on a marketing list and we want
you to show these asset let's say can
you do that and the paid search seems to
soar that's pretty easy what's your
budget and will the email team said well
we don't have marketing budget we have
technology budget or email and and the
pay paid search team said well we have
to have a budget for this we can't just
use it the mill team asked well what
happens if someone comes to the site and
you don't have this in place the paid
search team said well they'll be placed
on our nine converse list in that case
and they'll see these ads Cemal team
said so regardless of us giving you this
that we've made you're gonna spend budge
on these users and they're gonna see ads
and then the page four scheme said yeah
that's how it works
so we don't understand and the problem
was the corporate structure this is
often a problem to companies the each
team reported up to a a director level
and directors were given budgets the
size of your budget determined how
important you were within the company
and so for the paid search team to
essentially give some budget to the
email team to run this their director
would lose faith or lose importance in
the company right just made up in
internal statistics and so it was based
on that one issue that after six months
they still hadn't launched this
coordination between these two teams and
so that's where GMOs want this but often
it's being blocked by something else but
great way is to start departments
worrying the other is via remarketing
also you've got customer match you can
upload your email list your CRM data so
even if you go to a trade show you
collect cards at a trade show you can
scan the assuming you have permission to
market to them you can scan those cards
in upload that email list to AdWords and
use your CRM data to serve ads as well
which is a great way of integrating
offline to online so marketing touch
points since to kind of wrap up here so
we have some time for questions right
we're marketing it's great Arlis a is
for search remarketing is for display
it's good
for small and enterprise companies but
the larger your account the more traffic
you have the more you can do but the
cleaner you're thinking needs to be of
how these lists all work together and
not just compete with each other but in
reality and fall your conversions where
you call the score landing pages ads and
and as you follow this data when you
find these insights
they've got where else you can use this
kind of information across your
marketing not just in paid search demand
their other channels as well all right
so I'm going to turn it back over to
chip here for a second to see if we've
got some good questions and discussion
from this fantastic I just got to point
out by the way for everybody for my own
sake that's an old market motive page
you've been shown in there our site
looks really different what actually
well made screenshots of the new site
but it's also a great example of the
process that we've gone through over the
past few years I mean I think that you
know in my tenure at market motive which
is going on something like seven years
now we've built one two three probably
five different sites from the ground up
over time and all based on a lot of the
kind of conversion and data crunching
that you're talking I'm sorry testing
and data crunching that you're talking
about there so you know yeah I know a
little embarrassed this is an old page
that you're showing but it was part of
the process that brought us to where we
are now we do have some good questions
in the system here before we do that
though I'm going to ask everybody to
indulge me really quick I'm going to
take over the screen and I'm going to
launch a little poll here I'm going to
take about 60 seconds or so to just give
you a little more information about
market motive this is a public facing
webinar by the way right so this isn't
just for members only we make these
webinars available to the community to
give back and to give folks the
resources they need to improve their
marketing across all kinds of skill sets
and specialties and I like how it cut
off the title there thank you very
webinar that's interesting but anyway I
just want we've got some folks on here
then who are already customers of market
who have them are either in there
themselves doing some training or have
their teams their marketing teams in
there doing some training in some cases
we've got folks in there who have their
sales teams in to help them understand
marketing better so that they can sell
advertising space on publish publisher
type sites content sites and so forth
and it's important for you to know
though if you are not familiar with
market motors that a webinar series like
this is just a small part of what we do
we do seven or eight of these every
month in a variety of disciplines so we
do things like you see here with PPC we
also do content marketing analytics
mobile social media and so on covering
timely topics both on the strategic and
tactical level but the core service of
what market motive does is greater than
just the webinars we are a training
publisher what we do is we build
web-based digital marketing training
curricula that are used not only by
agencies and fortune companies and
individual marketers but also by higher
education institutions like let's say
Boothe University to roll out into their
education programs they're licensed by
agencies professional organizations and
house enterprise teams these are
structured courses with streaming videos
downloadable workbooks quizzes test
exercises the members get access to
moderated forums where you can interact
directly with our faculty folks like
Brad here Avinash Kaushik and kario and
of course you can also interact with
other students you can make some new
allies and some new colleagues there you
can ask questions about the materials
you can ask how what you might apply the
lesson to your real-world marketing
challenges for agencies and enterprise
and folks that have marketing teams it's
a great way to get everybody up to the
same level and speaking the same
vocabulary to get folks cross-trained
maybe somebody needs to be really expert
in as Brad was talking about an email
team but they need to understand a
little more about PPC they can take a
foundation level course in PPC and get
to know enough about it so that they can
speak intelligently with the paid team
when they're building their email
campaigns and thinking about things like
remarketing so it's a tremendous
resource it's an end-to-end resource
we're happy to talk with you about how
it might benefit you as an individual
marketer or as a group if you're
interested in reselling we can talk to
you about that too so take a moment and
pick the appropriate box we'll have
somebody get back in touch with you
there's no obligation but you can get a
tour of the system see what the learning
management system looks like with the
what the environment feels like get a
look at some of the courses and some of
the lessons and we'll figure out what
the best course of action is for you so
I'm going to go ahead and close the poll
here about four seconds three two one
those are fast sections second I'm
closing the poll we're back and seeing
your screen again Brad just so you know
thank you for indulging me with that
everybody one common question we get
this is something that the angel is
asking is is this webinar recorded and
archived in the market motive site for
members only yes that is a true
statement we do record all the webinars
we generally go ahead and get them
produced and put into the archive on the
market Motor site where members can get
access to them we are overtime rolling
out a YouTube collection as well that'll
be available public facing for those
folks who are not currently members
we're sort of experimenting with that a
little bit that's being managed by a
different team over with our parent
company certainly learn and so I can't
tell you exactly when that's happening
and exactly which webinars that might
include but you'll certainly see it in
the archives inside the market motive
platform pardon me sorry got something
stuck in my throat there Brad bread is
asking where can I learn how to make
audiences based off of TV ads and I
think what we're talking about there is
if you're running a television media
campaign how do you bring the activity
of viewership that might be valuable
down into some sort of a list that you
can use in your paid efforts where might
they learn more about that um good
question I mean in Rio I don't have a
good resource I mean in reality you're
just using your your your Google
Analytics remarketing list so
you can either create a specific URL and
don't do like slash offer 23 because no
one types in offer 23 you use a a UI
branded URL that's not your main site
for that offer and if summit there add
them to the list or you can make a list
that only applies to a geography um and
then you can timestamp one of you gets
added to a list so usually what you see
is one commercial errors 90 percent of
your traffic is within 15 minutes and
like 98% within 30 minutes so if you say
ok if someone came from Detroit between
837 and 902 add them to a list and now
be a way of coordinating it there's not
another great way of doing it except
using your GA list building to do it
that way and so usually a brand new URLs
the best way to actually just do it and
just put GA across both sites link it by
Adwords and that's the easy way to get
started it's an excellent answer I want
to put a finer point on what you said
there you mentioned that using a
subdomain like slash offer 25 so doesn't
work so great so that's practice that we
understand now based on the metrics that
you really need some sort of justice
specific a comma or what have you but no
sub directories no trailing flashes
things like that yeah I mean if if you
do something like use offer 23 to get
your free trial you can get some that
way but the problem with that is you
just forget what the offer number is
they're trying to make up numbers to get
in there so you do like you know market
motive tv.com raid or or Macha motive
offers.com and that way you could just
use that URL it still has your brand in
it but that way you put that one on the
TV ad or billboards and whatever you
want right and that's that's what the
best way to do it and you think there's
having a branded URL like that it's
better than let's say let's think about
customer intent right let's say that I'm
looking for a particular kind of sass
I'm looking for
at CRN pool you know top crm obviously
you're not gonna be able to buy this but
finding a URL that's specific to the
product or the offer or the customer
intent or better to brand the URL for
these usually better to brand because
when you type and when you do something
like Topsy rom-com you'll see people
search for domain right you are is so so
no search for tops here on the comm
which just means you're now doing a huge
you know marketing you they're gonna see
whatever adds organic listings come up
from there right which is not gonna be
just your brand if you do a brand one
though and they do a search even if you
don't capture them on your your your
your special TV URL you're at least
gonna catch them off your brand URL
being there and so that's kind of
problem is switching the term and
someone's head so usually brand is
better than theirs total sense because
if you go with the the intent or the
product line then you're basically just
inviting all your competitors into the
search results so yeah yeah totally okay
great perfect
what's also asking are there any Google
extensions or tools that you use outside
of Adwords and analytics that you would
suggest well I have to suggest the one
because I'm a co-owner of the company
but I'd alysus ad a ly SS is a huge ad
testing automated at testing and so
forth arm that's my favorites I'll use
depending on what people use if they're
using you know a quiz EO Moran can shoe
then I'll use them and they're very like
Marin is great if you need to integrate
your CRM system and robust data directly
into something for bid purposes or like
we're in for that so there are but
they're usually specific to the task
needs to be accomplished but and of
course Excel the AdWords editor very
very important I think the most
underutilized PPC tool is a calendar and
project management we actually have a
video in markup archives on project
management for paid search it's knowing
what to do is more important than the
tool because you don't know what to do a
tool is useless
and I think it all starts with product
management calendars and shared assets
and then it moves to more specific page
source tools gotcha
just so you know I went ahead and shared
the analysis URL in the chat module
folks so you can find a link to it there
along with you missions were in software
as being one of the tops I think that's
who you meant when you said Moran it is
so I went I went ahead and I shared that
in there too so you folks can take a
look at those links one other link I'm
going to show a little quick because you
talked about 99designs when you're
talking about a reliable and affordable
way to get some design work done I'm
gonna share that in there too for
everybody to see if you're not familiar
with 99designs
take a look at that and let's see and
Brett says thank you very much and no
problem on the plug more than welcome to
take a look at the product I'm excited
for analysis I know it's been what more
than a year now since you guys rolled
out right I think - I mean we just
launched engrams really yeah we have
Engram analysis for search queries which
I don't think anyone the world has that
they don't even know what engrams are
let alone how to use them so it's it's
actually really cool looking at Terman
since that and how you really find
patterns among queries for negative
keywords our new new ways of looking at
positive things to go forward within
your accounts looking forward to hearing
more about that let's see here we've got
another comment here you mentioned
something about the people are going to
spend on average 30 seconds to two
minutes on their free trial in the
industry and it's kind of a true average
among all product types
it's not a hard stat right but the
amount and it depends on the on what it
is but like I used to do a lot of work
with one of the big task manager tools
so think Trello asana you know whatnot
and that kind of thing and the average
free trial user I believe was two
minutes and 37 seconds that was the
average because it was like they made it
they looked at the UI they tried it and
then they never came back and when
added remarketing to it it really made a
huge difference in their returns because
people would go in in my content
management you can try out 50 things in
like all of two hours raid so you really
have to find a way to reach back up to
use as well which is email programs
really important to there yes--that's
products free trials especially no
credit card required free trials couple
minutes is is often what you have to get
someone to either decide they love your
product or they're never coming back
again kind of stunning actually you know
I we I know that you know all the the
course of the years we've done we a
particularly for you to be customers
here at market motive we do free trials
and I will say there's no truth to that
how how little people really spend in
there trying to product out to follow up
on that a little bit just if we just
spend another second on it are the best
practices in remarketing to people who
are currently in a free trial or you
know even those who are already current
customers the kinds of messaging that
works best to get them to say oh yeah
I'm gonna go back in and I'm gonna try
my access and maybe I'll try a new thing
without getting creepy and saying hey
Steve why haven't you used your free
trial yet or something okay yeah that's
that's too much right so what we do is
we say what are our primary three or
four or five benefits right and then
that way we can make an ad to each of
those benefits so that if a user isn't
care a benefit one but they see the
second one like I didn't know you did
that as well right all of a sudden
you've reengaged them again so I find
with remarketing especially display
remarketing not not so a search that's a
little different intent that making
three or four ads with completely
different messaging even if one or two
but you know performed below the average
that the whole is actually better than
the one it's not one plus one equals
three mentality which saw people don't
you know sometimes tough to grasp on you
know how this wives taking some beating
over that knife but it really does work
on remarketing
I hope the geico effect right if you
watch TV for three hours you'll see five
Geico ads and you none of them are the
same right you've got the lizard you got
the cavemen you've got the talking sack
of money you've got all the difference
Chris I'm so old right I mean I'm
referring the Geico ads that probably
are on the TV anymore but yeah yeah they
had an effect exactly now one more
question I think we have time for one
more here the three site study was great
where you were showing that they were
dedicated to their desktop site and you
had them test a responsive they're
mobile only WordPress implementation the
question is did they keep the content on
those two WordPress sites a little
simpler and kind of squeeze page
oriented and same kind of the deeper
high maintenance content for the desktop
version or did they really try to
reproduce all of the content is the same
the content was the same because the
desktop RT had squeeze pages right the
desktop had squeeze pages they were just
formatted in in tables which do not go
to mobile devices well and so they
reformatted the same content into CSS
design so that way only responsive CSS
or the mobile only say okay the
responsive site exact same content the
mobile site was not because the mobile
site was broken down in a very small
bite-size chunks easy to navigate click
to jump through points so the mobile
site was is completely own design with a
little bit the same content but broken
down in a much more granular focus the
responsive design was same as desktop
tables in the last 48 hours I came
across one site that was still built in
front page and that was a hundred
percent flash Wow time to learn those
nuts crazy folks a long time to learn
those lessons yeah I know squeeze in one
more Winnie Winnie just came in under
the wire here
another question and I want to make sure
we get it what and and you will be as
concise as we can in the answer because
we're at the end of the hour what should
a brand new AdWords campaign focus on
display search video Mobile where's
where's the low-hanging fruit I don't
know how well we can answer that
question without knowing more about her
audience you know what for 98% of people
it is Search Search is an intent to find
something and get a question answered
there's some exceptions in that
statement but they're few and far
between if the exception kind of could
be summed up if you do really well on as
seen on TV offers at 3 a.m. display is
great if you're like why would we do
that
then Search Search has an intent driven
to it that no other channel can touch
perfect 98% I think that pretty much
answers the question yeah fantastic
all right thank you Winnie I hope that
helps okay I'm going to put one more
last link into the chat box here folks
take a look at that that's a link to the
upcoming webinars page at Marcus August
I just want you with that oh where is oh
yeah you've got the the calendar view up
there fantastic you'll find a list of
all the webinars there at that URL so
you'll see is then later in June

head as far as actually using PPC tools
which I don't do but also really
accessible to me in the context of voice
of customer and conversion calls to
action testing which is all stuff that I
really love so it's just a great
cross-section of things to think about
