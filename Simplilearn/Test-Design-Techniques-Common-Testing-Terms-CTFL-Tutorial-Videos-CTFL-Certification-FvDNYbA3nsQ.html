hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on i des tu b
foundation preparation this is the
fourth session that one needs to go
through to complete the istqb training
at the end of this training you will be
able to understand test development
process categories of test design
techniques we will also learn about
different techniques in each category
and how to choose test techniques like
in earlier sessions we have quiz
questions at the end of this session and
you are strongly advised to answer these
before you move on to the following
sessions
let us look at the agenda for this
session the whole session is divided
into six parts the test development
process categories of test design
techniques specification based or black
box testing techniques structure based
or white box techniques experience based
techniques choosing test techniques
let us first understand some common
testing terms before moving ahead to
understand more details on the topics an
item or an event that could be verified
by one or more test cases is termed as
test condition test condition
essentially describes what needs to be
tested or what to test an example of
test condition will be test new user is
able to register successfully test cases
are defined to test certain test
objectives or test conditions test cases
consist of a set of input values
execution preconditions expected results
and execution post conditions you will
see examples of test cases on the
following slides test cases essentially
define how to conduct the test
collection of test cases arranged
sequentially in order to execute a test
is termed as test procedure test data is
nothing but the inputs required for
executing a test case expected results
are produced as a consequence of the
test execution which can be outputs
changes to data and states except</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
