model one might wonder what benefits the
consumers enjoy by using cloud cloud
comes with its own set of advantages and
it can be attributed to its
characteristics they provide on-demand
self-service broad network access
resource pooling rapid elasticity and
measured service
it would be best for us to look at the
characteristics using an example that's
familiar to all of us
every one of us would have had the
experience of booking a tickets on the
travel portal now let's see how this
example can help us understand the
characteristics of cloud computing
better
the passenger has the flexibility to
book a ticket by himself or herself
using a web portal and a login ID the
process is highly simplified and does
not require any human interaction right
from choosing your train to preference
of birth it is all an automated process
this is the on-demand self-service that
cloud offers where the consumer can
automatically set up computing
capabilities such as storage and server
time as and when the need arises
likewise the passenger is able to book
their tickets via internet through any
mobile devices such as tablets phone or
laptop that has access to a network this
broader network access is a quality that
consumers enjoy because of cloud
services resource pooling lets us
understand this characteristic through
the example we know the trains have the
capacity to occupy hundreds of
passengers for a single trip several
passengers traveling to the same
destination board a single train and are
assigned separate berths according to
their needs this is similar to what
cloud does where multiple consumers are
able to access virtual resources that
are assigned to them
there is a sense of location
independence where the consumer is
generally unaware of specific details of
the location
however he is aware of it in a much
higher level such as country state etc
resources pooled can be storage network
bandwidth memory etc rapid elasticity is
one more characteristic of cloud
computing
it refers to scaling up or scaling down
of resources according to demand
considering our previous example when
the total numbers of passengers do not
occupy all the coaches the coaches can
be disengaged and joined with another
train that has more number of passengers
similarly in cloud resource utilization
can be increased or decreased according
to the consumer needs measured service
is the last one in the list when the
passenger travels by train he or she
only pays for the amount of distance
traveled by the individual and not for
the entirety of the journey
likewise resource usage is monitored by
the provider and charged only for what
has been utilized by the consumer this
is the typical paper use or charge per
use method that is used in the next
slide we will discuss the different
service models of cloud computing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
