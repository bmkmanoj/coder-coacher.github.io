unique nature of cloud computing has an
impact on IR processes
on demand self service offered by cloud
might decrease the interaction between
the cloud service provider CSP and the
consumer during a crisis also the IR
function varies widely depending on the
type of cloud service and deployment
model security incident detection
analysis and recovery process is offered
have to be clearly discussed between CSP
and consumer thus the incident response
time may be hugely affected making I are
more difficult rapid elasticity of cloud
infrastructure offered by cloud may
widely impact incident response time
more specifically forensics about which
we will be discussing later in this
domain cloud does not operate in a
highly transparent cloud environment and
forensics demands a dynamic environment
challenging the way data is preserved
stabilized and recovered
this lack of transparency affects the
incident analysis increasing the
complexity of our process
resource pooling in cloud means the
sharing of resources by multiple tenants
this can lead to serious privacy
concerns among users during an incident
analysis for instance the collection of
data might not have clear processes
which might lead to the exposure of data
of other tenants
the service providers need to provide
the necessary support in order to
overcome such circumstances
next the data stored in cloud might not
have any restriction to geographical
boundaries or jurisdictions and the
consumer might not even be aware of it
there might be legal and regulatory
implications causing issues which in
turn could affect the incident analysis
organization should include a legal team
which will offer advice on the
limitations and how to handle them
across the different phases as well
in spite of the above-mentioned problems
cloud also offers benefits to users in
terms of incident response cloud
computing provides a continuous
monitoring service which in turn reduces
the response time during a crisis
additionally virtualization and
elasticity offers enhanced efficiency
with less interruption of services let
us look into the cloud architecture
security model as a reference in the
next slide
now that we have come to the end of this
module let's do a recap we learnt about
incident response and the impact of
cloud on IR as in how it changes with
migration to cloud we also discuss the
different phases involved in incident
response lifecycle such as preparation
detection and analysis forensics and
containment eradication and recovery
lastly we understood the recommendations
for consumers and also requirements for
effective incident response it is quiz
time attempt the quiz and check your
understanding of this domain we will be
dealing with application security in the
next domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
