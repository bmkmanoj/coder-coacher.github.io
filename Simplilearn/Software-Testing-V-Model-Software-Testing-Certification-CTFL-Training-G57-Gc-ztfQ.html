development is the V model this model
follows a sequential path of execution
of phases like the waterfall model each
phase must be completed before the next
phase begins again just like in the
waterfall model we have just seen
however this model is best suited for
test activities as these activities
start in parallel along with each phase
of requirements design and coding the
testing procedures are developed early
in the life cycle before any coding is
done giving testers enough room to
understand requirements and raise
questions and issues against the
requirements for themselves the first
phase in this life cycle model is
requirements gathering as requirements
of finalized testing team gets involved
to review the requirement and build test
plans for system testing as design gets
finalized testing team gets involved in
review of the design and development of
the integration test plan the low-level
design phase is where the actual
software components are designed and
unit tests are created in this phase as
well the team test also starts
developing systems and integration test
cases and test procedures in this phase
coding is the phase where all coding
takes place once coding is complete the
path of execution continues up to the
right side of the V where the test plans
developed earlier an output to use we
have component unit testing or the unit
testing integration testing system
testing and acceptance testing as for
key levels of testing in this model we
will look at each of these in more
detail going ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
