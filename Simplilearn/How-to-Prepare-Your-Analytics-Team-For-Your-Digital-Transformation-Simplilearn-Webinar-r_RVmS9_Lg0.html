that's about Ron I'll let me go ahead
and unmute Ron and welcome him here on
can you ring hear us yes a bit thanks a
lot
I appreciate you having me here today
and thank you for the kind introduction
a bit I want to thank all of our
listeners for joining me today on this
webinar event as well today there's more
data and more changing behavior than
ever before and what we see is the
progression of data don't really show
stocks
any sign of stopping and this has led to
the need for businesses to revolutionize
the way they manage the data and
analytics and with more channels more
devices and more data to manage the
customer journey holds an incredible
amount of impact and significant
significance for your business and
modern customers want individualized and
highly relevant experience that cater to
their particular needs the particular
interest and their preferences so it
becomes of the utmost importance for
company
to make the mission to cater for the
individual customer and the share amount
of data that businesses must harness in
order to provide positive experience to
the customer is really overwhelming in
the last two years over 90% of the
world's data has been created
90% it's incredible everything generates
data from social media mobile devices
website interactions retail store
purchases everything every action that
occurs on a mobile device on a tablet
cellular phone car game devices
healthcare equipment etc everything
produces data and provides very valuable
information about individuals
interacting with those devices and if
utilized properly this customer
information can be analyzed and applied
towards creating an even greater more
individualized customer experience so
what we see if we look into the near
future by 2020 80 percent of the buying
process will occur without any human
interaction that's your hero right 80%
of the buying process will occur without
any human interaction so organizations
must increase their effectiveness in
influencing customer journey towards a
positive one evolution of data and
evolution from customer control as
altered the way organizations manage
their customer experience and if you
look like companies like Apple Amazon
and Google they are data-driven
organizations who set the bar for
personalized positive customer
experiences every other company should
tend to emulate this standard for their
customer experience that are exceptional
in all ways across all brands such
points and it's about elevating the
experience for the individual customers
and making their personal customer
journey the focal point of your business
objectives I spoke with the chief
commercial officer from a leading
data-driven airline recently about how
their patrons utilized Wi-Fi while
flying and this amazing capability to be
flying all over the world at 555 miles
an hour 35,000 feet in the air and yet
person just get angry and frustrated
when the YouTube movie is disrupted by
spotty Wi-Fi but this is the norm now
because people have to come to expect a
seamless uninterrupted customer
experience users become accustomed to a
new experience in just 10 minutes and
after that time period they are used to
it and absolutely expected to work
there's a sense of entitlement that it's
connected to an individual interaction
with a business and with the products
and services and businesses need to work
harder to provide a fantastic customer
experience become a customer centric and
ensuring that the individual customer is
prime concern and it should be at the
forefront of any organizations list of
priorities so companies have to
determine how to create an extraordinary
customer experience when the customer is
in control but what's the driver behind
all this change indeed data analytics
data and analytics drives the customer
experience data and analytics is
changing the customer experience and
it's providing new enhanced way of
business to interact with the customers
and improve their overall journey and
data analytics are capable of going far
beyond the typical insights and reports
that you may be used to and can have
marvelous compelling applications in
relation to customer experience in ways
that maybe almost feel futuristic but I
think though they're currently just a
reality already
if you look
Facebook Facebook uses facial
recognition software to automatically
tag images from photos that are uploaded
onto a social media site and here data
analytics is utilized to identify
Facebook users and suggest the names of
friends or families that it has
identified from the photos this is also
data analytics people use the state
analytics through machine learning
algorithms to detect in a mere split
second
trustworthy customers from those who
pose a potential threat and essentially
it's a decision-making tool that
separates the good from the bad and
PayPal is able to combat fraud with this
technique and applying it towards other
areas of risk management as well yeah
who collects a massive amount of data
you you everybody knows and they analyze
it to detect where cyber attacks is
originating from and it responds to this
automatically it's a form of system
security that protects the entire
organization and identified where and
how hackers are targeting their system
also this is data analytics and snapchat
uses data analytics as a marketing tool
to improve their engagement with the
targeted audience and they were meant to
predict who will swipe an advertisement
so this also helps snapchat to draw in
advertisers and marketers with an
optimized automatic bidding system
through this tool they have seen a 40%
increase in efficiency in their cost per
swipe Microsoft Microsoft Kinect you
probably know it from from the gaming
put gaming into the hands of its users
and this I think you can see it even
literally by enabling a gamer to use
their hands and the body as the
controller so basically they are the
joystick and data analytics provides
information that's used to define the
body position and connected to the
gaming experience and really in a
revolutionary weight and gamers are able
to interact with their video games in a
manner that feels more immersive than
traditional handheld gaming
and this is well it's data and analytics
through data analytic the healthcare
industry is able to identify stages of
cancer in patients through genome
mapping and use the Intel to guide
therapy treatments machine learning
techniques patterns and relationships
with data are discovered and applied
towards predicting future outcomes of
this specific cancer and this improved
patient care and treatment techniques
and ensure that doctors and other
healthcare personnel are better able to
provide the right therapy solution
self-driven cars utilize data analytics
in very exciting ways to innovating how
machine Muin can respond to experience
in the same manner
basically as human drivers they
mimicking the actions and learning
experience from human drivers and
self-driving cars are able to recognize
objects and perceive its environment and
then define the actions for the car
which improves automotive say to the
safety to an extensive degree and last
example is child fatality and the
customer care industry they use data
analysis to provide improved measures
for call support through natural
language recognition yes natural
language recognition is State and
analytics which is an example of
cognitive analytics it's the newest most
advanced trend in analytics world it
allows a better experience for your
customers and builds loyalty by
simulating an intelligent human
conversation with those who call for
existence in any number of areas and
with all these compelling and innovative
uses of data analytics across the
industries organizations should not be
limited by the information at their
disposal data and legs can be applied to
what improving customer experience in
ways restricted only by the imagination
so innovation can basically shoot starts
today at your organization as well if
you look to
the number of touch points the number of
customer touch points will only grow to
continue about 50% and today about 50%
of the customer journey goes over
multiple channels so one channel for
example call center to the rep this is
multiple channel and 50% of the gern is
applicable to this and companies need to
be ready to be able to respond to this
growth via all kinds of modern big data
and analytics tools and technologies and
this is particularly important because
the amount of customer touch points will
increase substantially this coming years
there's even more touch points and
ecosystem that are growing where you
need to measure the whole customer
journey and this change is only constant
and all of these constantly changing
customer behaviors progression of data
in the world around us and the boom of
ammount of data generated in the last
few years alone poses one important
questions how do businesses organize to
prepare for this change prior to
detailing in real depth I want to
briefly outline the topics to be
discussed today and offer an overview of
how businesses can begin organizing and
preparing for this change organizations
need to focus on the following first
multidisciplinary teams second modern
technology third trusted analytic
solutions and fourth maybe the most
important is the people capabilities and
education your organization and
processes includes includes creating an
a gel multidisciplinary team that
stresses the role of each team member
and whether it's a data scientist an
engineer designer and it should be able
to splitting data collection and
application and I will go in much more
depth later on in the webinar and this
will spark unity across all these
departments instead of the silos and
encouraging collaboration and sharing
data and the insights from the data
the technology should target first at
analytics for dependability and
consistency of this data inside as well
for credibility and integrity of your
data this is supported by modern open
source technologies and you can think
about technologies like Hadoop particle
physics like spark business have to be
able to have a complete confidence in
the data output this should be trust and
a modern technology is the medium by
which they obtain data and analytics
dressed first is really really crucial
in in becoming a data-driven company and
managing your digital transformation
your people and capabilities is fighting
towards organizing for your digital
information because data and analytics
is a discipline that's relevant because
all all organization and whether you
talk about finance when you talk about
marketing sales operation and any other
department they are directly influenced
and affected by data and analytics and
you must have the right people and the
right capabilities in place to
efficiently and effectively manage it
education is interconnected to this as
its getting trained and obtaining
knowledge in this field regardless of
what your role you occupy within your
organization it can be an enormous
impact to your career and how you relate
to it and work with it and this data
those who handle it and all the people
around it
that handle data even the type II
personnel as well and plus giving how
rapidly technology evolves people have
to be able to keep the pace with the
changes if they want to stay relevant
and knowledgeable about the latest
trends latest tools and latest
technologies it's amazing how fast this
development goes organizations also need
to move a maturity level from let's say
compliant analytics which is a first
phase to cognitive analytics which I
gave you the example with natural
language recognition and this natural
progression that's better described as
the old adage you need to learn to crawl
before you can work and this is how
businesses that fails to become truly
data-driven not simply data conscious
business strategies and endures become
realized when a company reaches its full
analytics potential and lastly companies
need to become use case driven to
develop more effective strategies and
achieve their business goals and these
topics we will go in much more depth
with in this webinar and constantly
changing customer behaviors and the
progression of data encourages business
to ask three important questions and
this is also the topic for the webinar
today so how do you prepare your data
and analytics team for digital
transformation this year not next year
and how to derive value from your data
and before that how to become
data-driven of course so what is the
role of the customer journey and how to
structure your organization as I stated
earlier 50 percent of the customer
journey are milks Channel but they are
also multi event across time journeys so
it becomes imperative for organizations
to support cross channel events to
promote positive customer journey
regarding the use of silos versus
multidisciplinary teams it's imperative
to understand the difference between the
two and I will go in more depth in the
next slide and it's important to
understand why they impact businesses
next level of
start with setting up data management
from multiple sources that reinforce
reporting over all these two touch
points companies need to make a positive
impression on the customers at the
moment of the customer interaction and
they experience your brand so if they're
in contact with your brand any touch
points and businesses and need to move
towards this step in the whole process
towards a purchase but even after the
purchase because with IOT Internet of
Things you can also have insight in how
people use your products because humans
form strong emotional based opinions
about companies based upon these touch
points so every interaction every touch
point they have with your company it's
important so it's crucial that it's a
positive experience or you risk losing
your customers to your competitors
ensuring that the touch points are
positive throughout every channel it's
key which is why organizations must have
an HR multidisciplinary team and silos
only represent a single point of a
customer journey they do not support
customer journeys or experiences data is
not shared across channels and
priorities don't align with other
departments within your organization
it's difficult to build or support a
positive customer experience from this
from the structure when there's no
internal unification across departments
and across this channel this insular
approach to data and analytics makes it
very difficult to obtain a complete
picture of your business data and a
complete picture of the customer journey
so therefore multidisciplinary teams
support cross-functional events to
create a positive customer journey from
mobile shopping to email campaigns to
mobile marketing to sales billing life
support the customer journey occurs
throughout a variety of channels that
all must lead to a positive experience
will disciplinary teams encourage
collaboration across the teams and and
many
to promote a more unified focus on
common goals not departmental goals
emphasizing teamwork and helping to
ensure that everyone is striving towards
the same outcome to create the better
customer experience silo-based are
organizations are not viable now leader
in the future departmental silos are
inefficient inaccessible show-up sighted
and self-centered they hinder
productivity and limit data
accessibility across teams the reduce
efficiency and they prevent the adaption
and growth of data-driven culture so how
do you support a client in its customer
journey if you work with silos you can
begin by focusing on a single important
customer journey and improve parts of it
by supporting the journey with just a
few data sources very easy to start very
effective
however businesses need to focus on a
consistent path to purchase and path the
relationship steer clear of the silo
mentality and move away from traditional
customer service approach preparing your
team for this transformation means
encouraging sharing information across
departments working together towards
shared goals and building an information
ecosystem supported by data and
analytics and Netflix I think is a
perfect example of a company who's
utilizing a multi-channel approach to
redefine the customer experience in the
media industry and improve
personalization of web content the
customer has so many options today
access to wide range of stream of
content at Netflix but Netflix is able
to deliver a very very personalized
content to the customers based upon the
information provided by data and
analytics they're able to determine if a
movie is watched to completion if a user
rewind to certain points in the movie
where they navigate to after finishing
the television show how long they're in
the Netflix app and what they are
searching for
while they're engaging with the menu and
Netflix is accessing customer sentiment
in real time because there's
sophisticated application of modern data
analytics techniques and ensuring that
they can suggest content to the users
that appeals to them on an emotional
basis which is fantastic an Amazon is
another sector company who takes an
innovative multi-channel approach to
drive and customer experience to a whole
other level of customization and
innovation they've introduced a small
smart speaker called echo which is the
voice control and it offers an
interactive experience for the customers
echo learns about the person's needs and
about his preferences because responds
by delivering a seamless experience as
well as personalized purchasing
suggestions on the Amazon as it gets to
know the customer how to use it the MOR
a customer interacts with echo the more
responsive the device can be to a
person's need so now to expand upon
multidisciplinary teams
multidisciplinary teams are comprised of
data analysts data scientists designers
and project managers all of which help
businesses to respond fast to market
change and enable versatile knowledge of
tools and technologies that you can
apply it to make improve decisions for
example a customer who submits a
mortgage application requires support
from an entire team is not dealing with
a single person over the course of his
entire application the customer submits
its mortgage application and speaks to
marketing representative about
pre-qualification requirements then the
application goes through a various
processing in multiple departments until
it's finally approved and moves into
closing and this occurs over multiple
departments and is handled at different
teams who have to share data about the
individual customer in order to process
this application swiftly and bring it to
an accurate conclusion
this example demonstrates the
effectiveness and importance of
multidisciplinary teams working together
towards a positive outcome of the for
the customer a multidisciplinary teams
are the best way to promote integration
and collaboration of data insights
ensuring that a positive customer
experience is the responsibility of the
entire interpreting departmental team so
not only from one department a gel
multidisciplinary teams are also
important for supporting data management
and data government it's about
capability resources and processes there
needs to be rules for data engineers or
data scientists data analysts and a
project manager within HR customer
centric team so what roles need to be
filled for a data science team you will
need to have a data scientist who can
work on large data sets and we
understand the theory behind the science
it should be able and capable of
developing predictive models and data
engineers and data software developers
are important too they need to
understand the architecture the
infrastructure and the distributed
program the exact team configuration is
of course dependent upon your situation
and whether you're in as well in the
application where we go in-depth later
on in the application part or you're in
the part of data management big data
management and forms analytics some of
the roles to fill in a data scientist
include data solution architect take a
platform administrator full state
developers and designers and if you have
a team that has a lot of skill that is
low in real-world experience you may
also want to have a project manager on
the team and they can help keep up the
team to the right track and encourage
productivity and with the support and
capability of a multidisciplinary team
to foster a data-driven culture in your
organization your ability to execute a
positive customer experience is not only
possible
but if you organize like this it's even
expected next to the organizational
structure technology is key in your
digital transformation regarding
infrastructures and technologies
business needs the power and the
capability fast accurate data
infrastructure provided by modern
technology and analytic solutions a
traditional tool based approach for
departments features update a landscaper
by debt collection and preparation is
part of the processing and storage so
it's the whole chain from data
management that managed by this let's
say departmental tools organization that
to continue with this silo driven
approach will struggle with empowering
the business users are unable to share
data visualization across the
departments across your whole business
and they have no data possibility so
they cannot share your data to all the
different sources and they rely on
consolidated enterprise text data is
simply isolated and businesses are
forced to be limited by the means to
utilize and apply data to its full
potential multiple tools can contain the
complete process of data creation
collection processing storage and
utilization and work together to improve
the operation analyzing the data
high performance data analytics tools
provide businesses with proactive means
to attain insights from the information
and make it easier for organizations to
manage large volumes of data a fully
integrated point solution and neighbor
companies controlled tool agnostic and
robust technologies that are hundred
percent GDP are compliant and this is I
think mainly for the European audience
today there's a new law in 2018 where
you need to be compliant it's a new law
on privacy and you are allowed
to ask for approval for everything how
you use today
how to use the data and probably it's
less relevant for the US and for the
Indian botanist today organizations
utilize a modern approach to data and
analytics have full control over the
data and they are able to accommodate
diverse datasets and can combine large
amounts of data from various departments
and systems and additionally data is
better governed and managed without
requiring specialized support from my
team so the main points over here is the
data collection and the creation should
be centralized currently no company is
doing this but it's important to become
data-driven
and to create the data-driven culture
and then if you have to select
technology business may be wondering
which data analytics tool to use when
there's a peer thorough of tools which
you choose from you see an overview over
here which is only a selection close
source versus open source options and
the depending of course on the specific
needs that you have on your organization
and as well on the technical resources
you have and the people you have in the
organization however open source is
starting to become more popular trend as
it becomes more and more mature and more
more business want to have end-to-end
solution and entrance access to data and
emphasize trust and collaboration and
open source tools and sticks become
better and better for this as well so
twisting the data that you use is vital
which is why businesses need to
emphasize the importance of trusted
analytics credibility of an analytic
output supported by process that's able
to build trust on the insights promotes
a modern data and analytic environment
you have to build your stack with the
right people processes and collaboration
for the best data management and it's
important to use a data and analytics
stack from tools that were
well together and cover four important
disciplines you have to cover the
security the software framework the data
science toolkit and a collaboration
these four disciplines model covers
analytics tools but to not cover the
application part so the application
where users in the department normally
use it for example organizations should
integrate an open-source data management
stick that's a combination of various
tools that provide a complete solution
so stick and it's scalable modular and
again promotes collaboration and
thriving a data-driven culture an
example for this is cave it's kept in
KPMG framework and it's example of a big
data platform that's well designed and
adaptive to the situation for all
different kinds of sizes it embraces
annalistic approach to data science
inclusive security software framework
the data science toolkit and
collaborative tools and Dave generates a
flexible data environment that evolves
with an organization and can grow with
it open source technologies as we've
discussed are ideal to create an
intelligence sharing and cooperation
corruptive organization that promotes
transparency of data and an open
exchange of your information the ease of
scalability is also an appealing factor
for businesses who predict expansion or
migration at some point in future open
source technology benefits everyone not
just the programmers which have
specialized knowledge in this this
businesses users can can have power over
their own data in real time and there's
business solutions accordingly currently
tools a solution like Hadoop and spark
are two of the most popular Big Data
frameworks spark is becoming
increasingly desirable and is supported
by large companies like IBM as well
which gives an enormous boost
and its simplicity and high-quality
performance capability and flexibility
are extremely valuable assets for a
variety of business models however its
its speed is a highly coveted quality
among many organization as its real-time
processing which can be used in a
variety of big data applications a dupe
is also popular choice for companies
that have massive complex datasets that
require an effective solution in a
reasonable quick time frame for
processing large data set it's an
excellent option a group also has its
own distributed file system which is
fundamental to many modern with data
projects spark and a dupe are compatible
and can be used together to generate big
data solutions and some businesses
install spark on top of Hadoop which
park at forest analytics application
then utilize data stored within the
Hadoop distributed file system and other
popular tools analytics tools includes
even excel but also sauce our Titan and
bi tools like the blow and there's only
one simple reason why they use this type
of tools is to increase
cost-effectiveness usability
customization and scalability to your
end-user we discussed organizational
structure and technology next we will be
we will discuss the most important
assets you have in your organization and
that's your people
data and analytics are critical to your
business and they're relevant to all
other disciplines in your organization
whether it's finance whether it's
marketing whether sales operation
technology all interconnected
departments that are supported by data
and analytics and this is empowered by
the expertise and skills of your people
and their individual and collective
roles within your organization
companies have to organize analytics
which is to
what aspect of your infrastructure per
department and customer journey and
centrally to create a visualization for
this concept picture it as a
representative of the heart of your
organization supporting all other
functions data analytics data governance
data management visualization and data
science are enabling and supporting
durational excellence and the positive
customer journey continuing with the
visualization of a business as a
functional organic life-form imagine
your company company's data analytics
personnel as the brains of your
organization they support knowledge and
skills and fulfill specialized roles
that enable the successful operation and
fulfillment of your company's strategies
and goals and the outcomes deciding
whether it's best to outsource or rely
on in-house personnel or utilize a
combination of the two options in order
to speed up the process is a very
important consideration businesses need
to avail themselves of whatever
resources are going to be best silted a
fast-paced modern data and analytics
environment and there's a need for 1
million data scientist by 2018 and we're
witnessing a widening data scientists
kept that's a barrier to business growth
even companies have to utilize and
deliver inside to keep achieving in
innovation and to achieving their
business value but how do we solve this
dilemma of a shortage of data scientist
education and training of your team is
absolutely crucial and continuous
education is just as important as hiring
and recruiting externally is an
expensive alternative to internal
education because efficiency would
suggest that business leaders took look
to internal solutions for education not
only loop outside data science
is a highly sought-after and lucrative
career option as well with available
positions across a diverse range of
industries and education will help
motivate a professional to get the foot
in the door those people who are already
data scientist can still benefit from
education to further hone and refine
their skills and stay relevant within a
rapidly evolving technology based
industry education is also important so
that everyone in the organization speaks
the same language and can communicate
effectively and efficiently with one
another and technology changes extremely
fast and people need to stay up-to-date
to derive the most value out of the data
knowledge of data give business users
the power to predict the future outcomes
and gain insight as to risk and to
business opportunities companies need
and want professionals who are certified
in data science in data analytics and
other relevant specializations and who
possess knowledge of data trends and
modern tools and technologies in getting
certified in a relevant field camp is
basically your career growth so how do
businesses manage these challenges
no organization maturity phase indicates
the effectiveness of your ability to
accurately utilize data to drive
business decisions and promote and exit
excellent customer experience a mature
organization can offer valuable data and
analytic services that are aligned to
and progress with business priorities
and with business strategies they're
also able to provide government access
to data wherever they exist within an
organization and can give meaning and
context to it they're more innovative in
their data application and can predict
future outcomes organizations have to be
use case and customer journey driven to
improve the customer experience we've
discussed it before and remember
the crawl before you walk analogy that I
mentioned earlier starting the data
inside a business has to move from data
awareness step-by-step to predictive
analytics start at the beginning the
maturity phases start with descriptive
analytics whereby data is used to
comprehend the past and the present this
is the initial stage of an organization
development a stage in which a business
is looking back at historical data and
producing standard reports data is
utilized to answer questions about what
happened in the past with its historical
data can only reveal a limited amount of
information this phase is detrimental to
generating business value and
determining where the future customer
will come from and discovering insight
about future issues that will affect
your organization from there it
progresses to predictive analytics the
developing stage of business and Linux
maturity the maturity phase in this
maturity phase companies are able to X
mine data and apply it towards
predicting the future trends and
predicting the activities that your
customer will apply it enables
organizations to answer questions such
as what would happen if I change this
specific friable techniques utilized in
this stage include predictive modeling
forecasting and statistical analysis
predictive analytics enables risk and
opportunity assessments to its best
advantage for example airlines use
predictive analytics to forecast
mechanical failures so that they can
minimize flight cancellations and delays
data is applied in real time to predict
the type of mechanical issue that will
cause a delay or cancellation within the
next 24 hours
enabling airlines to take preventative
measures its results in an improved
customer experience because people
aren't aggravated and forced to change
the travel plans last minutes
next prescriptive analytics is where
they are capable of predicting future
outcomes and prescribing the ideal
course of action as they learn from the
data insights and according to sources
such as Gartner 10% of organizations use
some form of prescriptive analytics only
10% but this will grow to 35% at 2020
and then cognitive analytics is the
final stage driving innovation and
technology transformation into the
future a cognitive system offers
real-time solutions and on the
mountainsides and learning from
interactions and existing information so
lots of things are going on but you're
on a business and how to start tomorrow
tomorrow in your own business how to
start simply how to start to crawl how
do you start your digit transformation
tomorrow first focus on education and
certification you won't be able to
advance in your chosen career or
communicate with members of your team
where there's a skill barriers standing
in the way you need to possess the
knowledge and the language to stay
abreast of current technologies tools
and industry trends and give the pace of
growth and innovation for data analytics
it's wise to stay educated so you can
continue to be relevant in this in this
field also start by partitioning writer
prioritizing your customer journey you
can begin by improving one important
journey for your business and just
connect one two three data sources
starting small and building upwards
working towards creating favorable
customer experience should be the main
goal to keep aiming for but starting
small and realistically with one
customer journey as a
good place to begin start simple but
start tomorrow business transformation
cannot occur without concentrating on
applying internal efforts towards using
data and obtain better more trustworthy
insights so start by splitting your data
collection I showed in the example from
the infrastructure and your application
and enable all departments and
disciplines within an organization to
work together more predictively and will
full control over your data twisted
insights will help you to generate value
from your data and leverage it to enrich
your opportunities and your business
potential you should start also
implementing your customer centric
multidisciplinary team including the
data analyst the data scientist data
engineers and project managers you want
to build cooperation and sharing across
your organization and improve
capabilities resources and processes
that will help you develop better
business solutions we have a
multidisciplinary team supporting
functions and providing diverse skills
and knowledge you can work towards
creating a high quality personalized
customer experience because steps in the
end the aim your choosing for I start
with data insights to move a step by
step is a move to work step by step
going to predictive that this can be a
long road so you can eventually develop
it into an advanced maturity phase but
take your time building analytics trusts
along this path is crucial enable your
business users to perform their own
analytics without the need of IT very
important self-service enable them and
benefit from improved decisions making
based on accuracy and deeper insights
derived from more complex information
mature use of analytics not only shapes
the customer experience for better but
it also elders your entire
infrastructure to make data-driven
analytics more you because through
at your company being data-driven is
what will inform your decisions for
customization your business
bring this webinar to a close I want to
reiterate the importance of receiving a
solid education and acquiring the
knowledge and skills that are necessary
to ensure your career growth and keeping
the gap is 60% depth data scientists in
minds remember that education and
certification will best position you to
respond to this need those who are
looking to get certified and data signed
and move into the professional landscape
can also of course look at the course
from simply learn and get started your
journey to becoming a participant in
this rapidly accelerating industry it's
fascinating
professionals already in this field
consider getting continued training and
certification courses that will enable
you to involve with the technology and
tools your trade with so then don't let
yourself behind ensure that you can keep
up with transforming your digital worlds
created yourself I would like to extend
an invitation add up to all the
listeners and open up the webinar for
any type of question thank you so much
for that run and before we go ahead and
do a quick question and answer session I
would like to launch the poll and
request each one of you to just select
and take up the poll for a minute it
still takes less than 30 seconds to just
give your poll so do not skip that and
we are open for the questions now rod we
we have a question coming in from Rowan
who Said's any challenges faced by the
new world companies introducing IOT
example the industry or worship for
typical manufacturing or industry on
this so you if you could provide some
insights on this question please
okay so IOT Internet of Things so
basically every device whether it's a
car
but it's your mobile computer garage
door every device is basically their
sensor edits to these devices so every
device generates data and if you look to
the whole data chain you start
collecting data from the customer
journey and the customer journey starts
when there's a first contact with your
clients and it can be via banner can be
a line can be in a retail store that can
be from a call center there's a first
contact and this whole journey from
first contact going to a tablet going to
a mobile going to a retail store
ordering something and start using the
product where the products starts let's
say sending data it's this whole journey
and IOT is just an extension of the data
journey so IOT gives companies the
ability and the possibility to improve
even better the customer experience
because they can understand better their
their clients but this also brings some
additional challenges so challenges if
you start collecting data from devices
one important challenges security so how
to solve your security for your device
that the device is not hecht another
challenge is data governance who owns
the doubt data and how to get consent
approval how to use this data the third
item is let's say that the volume and
variety and the veracity so there's
tremendous amount of data that is
generated from all the sensors so how to
handle this how can all system handle
this and there you see the requirements
for real-time processing and
technologies like spark that should be
applied to manage this in your let's say
coal architecture so there are technical
challenges on one hand and on the other
hand of course there's people and
processes so how to manage all that your
process internally to collect this day
to process it and to derive value and
insights from it this means that you're
not you cannot work as a department as a
product department for example and
you're responsible for the product now
you should work from a team a
multidisciplinary team which is
responsible for the whole customer
journey from first contact maybe it's a
product application and within this team
you can split it up in small teams and
you can improve important parts from
your product for example and there you
can split up your the smaller team but
there will be people involved from sales
from marketing from customer service
from your product development and also
also data analysts and data scientists
so IOT brings a whole range of
opportunities but also a whole range of
challenges that needs to be managed
ah thanks for that and run the next
question is what should be the ideal
data signs our theme for the market
place starting up using our consumer
insights for watch spending pattern so
you have any analysis on this yeah so
ideal its accessory on conversion I'm
sorry so ideal team really depends on
the situation I think important if you
start defining a team its defining from
which touch points you have in your
customer journey so and which
departments are involved in this
customer journey so it's the people for
marketing focus that people from sales
involved customer service so which touch
point are you improving so this is I
think the the foundation if you talk
about teams if you don't start talking
about what let's say data analytics
people should be involved if you look
from the application side there should
be an analyst involved in the team if
you as mentioned already if the team is
a little bit less mature you should
involve
check manager if you look to the part
where you need to have a data scientist
so if you need to have your data let's
say collection your you're processing
providing insights defining models if
you are this level from predictive
analytics you need to have a data
scientist for collecting the data you
need to have a data engineer somebody
who can collect the data take care for
the data quality and take care basically
that the data the data governance is
managed as well so there's not a fixed
team that generates the ideal team but
there's a number of different of roles
that should be basically part of this
team and you really define this you
define this depending on the customer
journey and the purpose that that you
want to achieve if you're more let's say
in the data management part so then you
have to have people that understand the
architecture understand the
infrastructure in understand to
distribute programming and so then you
need much more data that the technology
side from from the data if you're more
in the application side you need more
the people that are into analysis so the
the business analyst analyst and the
data analyst analyst okay things and
there is a question on certification as
well and this goes on our to
organization with that is embarking on
being better at the data and data driven
marketing place or client what will your
recommendation on on on the startups and
so if I understand the question well
what do I recommend startups from
certification perspective this is all
settled for us which are which are being
data driven from from star for startups
all right
yet and I think if you look let's say
whether you are started or whether you a
mid-sized company or whether you very
large corporate you see the way that
companies start organizing to be
data-driven is from a customer's journey
perspective and it's from a
multidisciplinary team perspective so
what you see is anyhow you start with
working with small multidisciplinary
teams and if you were started of course
you don't have less legacy so which is
much easier prepared to the large
corporation that in fact the cool and
the cool way of working this agile way
of working is the same so also from the
perspective of education and
certification the certification is
crucial to stay up to date with the fast
changing technology it's crucial to
speak the same language and it's crucial
to let's say stay up-to-date with all
the knowledge that you need from
programming perspective and analytics
perspective so it doesn't differ that
much whether you were startup or whether
you're large corporate because you need
to think from small teams and define the
education that you need from small teams
that you let's say have all required
capabilities within the team for the
face you're in and whether you're in the
descriptive face and just look back you
need other capabilities then you are
working with predictive models or even
working on cognitive analytics so
there's also a huge difference from this
maturity perspective so I would say it's
not the company size that defines how to
define your education it's more the type
of customer journey and the maturity
phase you're in that defines what type
of education and what kind of
certification you need at that moment
but I think it's good
for the the person who asked this
question to go more in depth what the
situation is and discuss a situation and
see how we can help them with a nice
let's say path how to develop the
capabilities within their teams great
and in terms of technology the last one
for you on on this run and how would
your cloud benefit this data-driven
journey and what how can any any
barriers can be overcome so in case URLs
if you have any any barriers on cloud or
the updation so how can we overcome okay
I think the choice for clouds really
depends on your industry as well and so
if you look to the financial industry
governmental and they have a lot of
regulations so the choice for clouds or
on-premises or a hybrid solution is
depending on rules and governance on
security issues that you have so there's
not let's say a black-and-white answer
for this so depending on the industry
you see different type of choices either
clouds either on-premise or either a
hybrid solution and if you look to the
maturity and the possibilities clouds of
course is easier and faster often in
your deployment but the core in the end
is there should be analytics trust and
if you cannot govern your data that that
fits with your process for you within
your organization it will not work so
cloud is not the routes
it's the route depends really on your
business and depends on on your
requirements but I think from technology
perspective and it doesn't matter too
much whether it
cloud hybrid or whether it's on-premise
solutions all solutions exist and all
solutions work well and all solutions
have its own challenges of course so
it's more a matter of the correct
execution then of the one over the other
choice
all right things and and the last one
again on on certification what will be
the basic certification in which the one
should choose to take up so yep
as well and back to the to the answer I
provided to ready before certification
really depends in the face where you are
so whether are you starting with data
you're more in the descriptive maturity
phase are you already looking ahead with
data and start predicting i building
predictive models are you in the area of
cognitive analytics this really depends
on what type of certification and you
need and where you are and it's really
let's a mix of blended different type of
roles and different types of
certifications you need to have the
ideal team so for every question if
you're not looking to a person but more
to a team within your organization i
rather start at the cushion okay what's
your maturity what's your type of
customer journey in which let's say
which industry you're in and based upon
this we can define and the best route
for a1 and certification and education
and developing your capabilities from
your team along with your process that
you going through the maturity phases
instead of saying okay this is the best
certification for you it really depends
on the situation so so it's there's no
concrete answer but if it was this this
easy
then I think data analytics was a that's
a much more mature Department already in
the last 50 years but it's it's not that
easy it's it's a tough job but it's
something that is mature now and can be
evolved very quickly a great r-run thank
you and that was the last question from
my end and again thank you so much for
all your expertise on the knowledge post
guys again you've done at the right
choice standing to simply learn website
