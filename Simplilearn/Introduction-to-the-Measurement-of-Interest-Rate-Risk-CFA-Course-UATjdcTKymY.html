introduction to the measurement of
interest rate risk vol 5 study session
16 reading 58 fixed income
review welcome to reading 58 of the
simply learn cfa level 1 tutorial in the
last tutorial we learned about the
sources of return from a bond investment
had a look at the traditional yield
measures for fixed-rate bonds compared
semiannual and annual pay bonds learned
about theoretical spot rates and the
theoretical spot rate curve learned
about yield spread measures relative to
the spot rate curve and were introduced
to forward rates this session is on
reading 58 as prescribed by the cfa
institute learning outcome statement or
LOL the topic of discussion is
introduction to measurement of interest
rate risks this is the last lesson of
the fixed income module
agenda the agenda of the session is to
cover reading 58 as prescribed by the
cfa level 1 curriculum you can go
through this reading from volume 5 of
the cfa level 1 curriculum made
available to you by the cfa institute in
this lesson we will start by learning
about the measurement of interest rate
risk then we will understand the price
of volatility characteristics of bonds
then we will learn about duration
portfolio duration and convexity
adjustment in the end we will take up
another measure of interest rate risk
that is price value of a basis point as
per the learning outcome statement after
completion of this lesson the candidate
should be able to distinguish between
the full valuation approach and the
duration convexity approach for
measuring interest rate risk describe
the price of volatility characteristics
for option free callable pre payable and
portable bonds when interest rate
changes describe positive convexity
negative convexity and their relation to
bond price and yield calculate and
interpret the effective duration of a
bond given information about how the
bonds price will increase and decrease
forgiven changes in interest rates
calculate the approximate percentage
price change for a bond given the bonds
effective duration and specified change
in yield distinguish among the alternate
definitions of duration and explain why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
