start to the Lean Six Sigma Greenbelt
demonstration class now over the next
hour we'll cover what Lean Six Sigma is
and provide a better understanding of
the methodology is what was the value
that can provide not only to you
personally but of course to the
organizations you're part of as well and
then certainly if you've got questions
throughout you know please feel free
just put it in the chat session and we
should have you know some time at the
end of the session as well for you to
ask some questions I'm just a little bit
about myself I've been working well
quite a few years and I've worked in you
know both the public and private sector
working with our organizations from
small to multinational and environments
that range from transactional to
manufacturing and certainly you know
different industries and across
different businesses and so I point that
out for two reasons firstly you know
through the training it helps to be able
to describe and explain the methodology
and the tools involved in Lean Six Sigma
using examples that are relevant to the
participants or the class members and so
you know that's helpful so I put it up
for that reason the second is just to
demonstrate the breadth to the ability
of the methodology or the ability of
Lean Six Sigma to be applied across
industries across businesses across lots
of different circumstances and so on
that note it really is Anu and Industry
neutral methodologies that's very
effective regardless of what type of
business organization you're part of now
if you go to some social media sites and
you went to LinkedIn for example you'd
find that about 40% of managers and top
companies or lean certified
you'll see that certified Lean Six Sigma
professionals earn forty percent more
than their non certified peers and you
know the majority of quality managers
hold multiple certifications now it
stands to reason that because the
methodology is all about solving
critical issues for an organization that
when you empower somebody through the
ability to make changes to their
organization
when they've got leadership support
and they've got a skill set the
capability to take on those challenges
and lead people as part of a team
through a project that addresses and
permanently resolves a critical issue
for that business that that individual
is going to be recognized not only have
they driven value through the
organization as you can see you know
from Motorola to Ford and so on
but they've proven themselves as
somebody that can really get things done
and so you know one of the best things
that I've personally found through my
involvement Lean Six Sigma over the
years is that you're really able to
tackle those critical those big issues
and key opportunities that an
organization periodically faces and and
get things done and that's exciting it's
fun to come to work each day knowing
you're going to make a change and the
positive impact not only on the
organization but on the people around
you as well and so you certainly will be
recognized noticed in you know succeed
as a result of that now over the course
of the training we go through six
different learning units now the first
learning unit is around providing an
overview of lean and Six Sigma so a
little bit about the history how did
lean come about how did Six Sigma come
about you know what are the
methodologies and you know what are some
of the historical what's the historical
context of each so that you appreciate
that there's been an evolution of sorts
from you know using the methodology and
incorporating the tools that we use
within Lean Six Sigma to where we are
today where it's a mainstay as a
continuous improvement approach for you
know so many different businesses we
move in to define the measure analyze
improve and control phases of a project
because it is a project based
methodology we tackle issues or
challenges in an organization and we we
put projects together to address those
issues
and so you might have heard the phrase
or the acronym Damac
and Damai ik is really just the acronym
for define measure analyze improve and
control it's easier to say I suppose
then you know five separate words
through any improvement initiative or
any work that we do in an organization
we start out by defining what it is that
we want to achieve you know it's not a
lone wolf activity you put together a
project team you put subject matter
experts around you to work on that issue
you're leading that team so you're
demonstrating in gaining leadership
competence but you're also putting - a
team of people around so that helps
ensure that you've got the right
knowledge process knowledge you've got
the right set of people that to help
it's not all one person having to do
everything you can delegate and so on
and maybe most importantly you get
buy-in from the subject matter experts
because they're part of the solution
they're part of the team of people that
are going to be figuring this out and so
in the define phase you you know you
select your team members you put a
project charter together that says you
know here's the objective of what we're
going to be working on if we're
successful this is what we'll achieve
these are maybe some of the resources we
anticipate needing for this project
here's the timeline that were you know
thinking that this will take and so on
so those parameters create the
foundation for your project and it also
ensures that everybody is aligned and on
the same page and knows that what
they're working on as you move into the
measure phase here's where we talk about
the tools or the strategies we can
employ to measure and understand our
current state where are we today as we
start this it takes the blinders off
there's no fooling ourselves thinking
things or maybe better than they really
are or worse than they really are it's
about taking stock of what the reality
is for our current situation and so we
use a variety of tools or strategies to
accomplish that we make sure whatever
information or data that we're using can
be relied upon you know just because we
run a report and or a computer generates
a report for us to look at it doesn't
mean that the information is correct if
they validate it make sure that whatever
critical information we're using and
making decisions upon can be trusted as
we move through the measure phase using
the tools or strategies to create that
State understanding we move into the
analyze phase because the reality is
this that we only have limited resources
we only have so much time so much money
so much energy so much whatever is
important to us it's limited we want to
make sure that we invest it in the right
ways in the right places at the right
time and so on and so because of that we
go through the analyze phase to identify
those critical elements of our process
that we're trying to improve whether
trying to improve a financial part of
the business whether we're trying to
improve a customer related part of the
business and employee related and so on
and so it's important for us to be able
to understand those critical elements so
that we can invest our resources wisely
because not every element or every
component or every piece of that you
know area of the business is going to be
equally important and so if we can
invest our resources on the right places
and the right way at the right time
we're going to get the best return on
that investment and so the analyze phase
is about using tests quite often we use
a lot of statistical tools in this area
and we teach them a course through the
tool through the training so they become
much more intuitive that you can make
that determination and as we've
identified those critical elements where
we're going to invest your resources we
move into the improved phase and the
improved phase this is about using tools
to identify to test to maybe experiment
to figure out what are the best ways to
go about improving those critical
elements we might pilot something we
might use brainstorming we might use
design of experiments we might use root
cause analysis and so on to be able to
figure out what's the best way to not
only identify those improvements but
also the most effective way to implement
them successfully as we've done that we
move into the control phase because we
want to make sure that whatever we've
done is sustainable you know it doesn't
help us if we make a a quick improvement
and then everybody celebrates and it
goes back to you know afterwards to the
old way of doing things that's not what
this is about this is about permanently
changing things for the better
and so it's important for us to be able
to use tools or strategies to make sure
that the improvements we've generated
are sustainable in the long term and so
we can use you know statistical process
control charts or SPC charts for short
we can use control plans and so on and
so through those five phases to define
the measure the analyze the improvement
control phases we build upon that
foundation or that understanding of what
lean and Six Sigma are all about that we
learned at the outset of the training
program to truly understand how we can
improve the business in the long term
across those areas that will deliver the
best return well let's talk a little bit
about Lean Six Sigma just from the short
discussion we've had so far it should
become somewhat evident that it's a
disciplined process you know it's not
about using intuition or best guesses
it's about using information or
sometimes what we can say data data is
information using data to make better
decisions it's a much more robust much
more disciplined way about going doing -
about doing things it's also about
continuous improvement each day we want
to get better than we were the day you
know that we were the day before and so
we don't necessarily have to make these
gigantic leaps you know every single day
but those incremental improvements over
time add up significantly and so every
day we get better and better and mean
Six Sigma can help accelerate the pace
of that improvement certainly when you
instill and provide you know seamless
training and resources to people you
would still that capability in your
people you empower them to make changes
across those areas of the business that
need it and will benefit the most that's
very powerful in order for that to be
successful of course you have to have
consistent top management support and so
when the leader of an organization says
look the way we're going to make
improvement across critical areas those
key issues and challenges that we face
is through a more standardized more
systematic mobile bust approach Lean Six
Sigma then that sends a message and so
you need to be able to empower your
employees you need to have that
the with the capability and you need to
have them supported now I want you to
think about for a moment a scenario from
two perspectives the first perspective
is this let's pretend that you own a
restaurant and you can imagine as the
owner of a restaurant you work long
hours you probably work six or even
seven days a week as the owner you
probably work long hours mornings you
might work nights as well you don't get
a lot of time for vacation now the good
news is that you happen to be a member
of a local trade association or Chamber
of Commerce or some type of group that
has a contest new in the contest and you
have a two-week vacation it's been a
long time since you've had a vacation
and so as you can imagine most employees
when they take their vacation they're
pretty happy but in the back of their
mind they're wondering about work and so
as the owner of this restaurant you're
going to phone the manager left in
charge and ask them for some information
because you'd like to know how the
restaurant is doing in your absence kind
of questions do you think you might ask
well I think that as an order of a
restaurant I would probably ask about
food sales I might ask about beverage
sales or liquor sales
I might ask about dessert sales
appetizer sales I might ask about any
employee issues or any equipment issues
just like any manager any owner any
business leader will want to know how
the business is doing across different
areas they probably have a series of
metrics maybe it's on a balanced
scorecard or some kind of a dashboard
but they're usually metrics or measures
that that manager that business leader
will want to know to gauge how well the
business is performing you know there's
often a financial or a series of
financial metrics maybe it's it maybe
it's profit net profit gross profit
maybe it's sales revenue maybe it's
something else
but there are usually some financial
metrics just like there might be
customer related metrics and employee
metrics and so on well the reality is
this that they're really outputs they're
effects in an equation we could say that
there are why they're the result of
other things they're a byproduct of the
activities being performed
the business and how well those
activities are being performed now let's
look at that restaurant from the
different scenario let's pretend instead
of being the manager the owner or a
customer you know as you can imagine a
customer probably has a choice of a
large variety of restaurants different
styles of food different price points
different types of ambiance customer
might be interested that speed of
service are they there for a long
leisurely dinner or they on a work lunch
what's the presentation the food like
what's the quality of the service like
lots of different things a customer
might be interested in and consider when
determining which restaurant to select
well those are the inputs they're the
causes
they're the things that drive the sales
the customer satisfaction the employee
productivity the employee engagement and
so on the results are the effects those
whys are really a function of those
inputs or those causes and the better we
understand and can identify and manage
those inputs those X's the better we can
determine what our y will be and so Lean
Six Sigma is about solving this equation
wherever we've got a metric or a measure
within our business that's really
struggling or isn't where it needs to be
or could be what we believe it should be
if we can understand what those drivers
are for the that metric those exits will
say the causes then we can focus our
efforts on improving those X's by being
more surgical in terms of our
improvement approach and our Y will take
care of itself
too often we throw things at that Y
without necessarily understanding what
those X's are and very often when we've
got a process or an area of our business
that's struggling or suffering we're not
performing as well as it needs to it's
because we don't really understand what
those X's are at all
well we misunderstand what they might be
and so when we solve this equation we
understand what the drivers are the
causes the inputs to our critical
processes and we focus on those most
critical X's then our Y becomes better
and we see better better results and
when we work on a project to
identify those exes we as I started the
presentation talking about typically
work through this dimeric or define
measure analyze improve control project
approach and they're really phases of a
project so you know we start by defining
the problem the statement will say we
might say we want to improve
productivity from where we believe we
are today to some improved level
tomorrow or at the end of the project
maybe it's improving customer
satisfaction from where we are today to
somewhere else maybe it's improving
something else so we define our terms we
determine who's going to be involved in
the project who makes sense to have on
the project team we think this will take
so much time and so on so we set the
foundation we align our goals we all
understand what we're working towards
and so on
we collect data as we move into the
measure phase to understand you know
what the current state really is we
create a process map to understand the
elements in this the steps the pieces of
our project we determined through the
analyze phase which are the most
critical ends of that process once we've
done that we can identify prioritize
test the improvements and we set up a
control plan towards the end to make
sure that going forward our improvements
will be sustained because the project
team that we're working with isn't a
permanent fixture it's probably a group
of four or five six eight people that
will work on this project until we've
achieved some goal and then it dispensed
and so it's important for this team to
leave behind this legacy saying here's a
more robust way here's a control plan
we'll say to make sure that the people
involved in this process know how to
manage it effectively so that the gains
that we've been able to achieve through
this project are sustained and perhaps
even continued to be improved upon now
it stands to reason of course that a
team members are often people that are
involved in that process in any event
and so they'll be involved going forward
just maybe not in a more formal sense
that you know we had a project before
and they were focused on this effort
and then you know you move on and you go
back to you know your regular roles but
the elements of that process control
plan stay in place and so the new normal
the new way of doing things is much more
clearly laid out for you as we go
through those those different phases
that define measure analyze improve
control phases and we talk about tools
or strategies this is this small sample
of some of those tools or strategies and
so as an example you know Sybok is just
an acronym stands for supplier input
process output in customer and it's a
way of visually mapping out the steps of
a process and when we map out those
steps of a process we look at each
element of the process you know what's
who's the supplier or what's the
supplier for that element what's the
input what's the process step what's the
output of the result and who's the
customer for that element it's a very
good visual that helps also scope the
project from its starting point to its
ending point because you want to make
sure that everybody understands the
things that are happening today and very
often what will happen is you'll have
multiple people on the team saying gosh
I didn't know that's what happened after
my involvement or I didn't know what
happened before my involvement when you
start having those conversations people
can often identify some quicken
improvements saying well gosh if I if I
had of known that then I could have done
this differently and so that's often
very valuable exercises you're starting
your project you know vo C voice of the
customer CTQ is critical to quality tree
quality function deployment and so on so
these are acronyms and as we go through
of course these will become much more
familiar for you as we talk about them
and teach you how to use them now you'll
notice that some of the tools are listed
in local places and it's because there's
no set rule that says you must use an
FMEA or failure modes and effects
analysis tool only in the define face
these tools were not designed for Lean
Six Sigma they were designed to solve
specific problems and very often they
were developed or designed or invented
within organizations and considered
proprietary they
trade secrets of sorts you know once
upon a time and so you know because they
were invented or designed to solve a
specific problem or answer a specific
question if that problem or question
happens in a different phase the project
and that's the right way to solve it
then you use the tool that's appropriate
now very often you'll use you know sigh
pop map very early on in the project
just like you know your voice the
customer it makes sense to use it very
early on so you understand what your
customers want as soon as possible you
know you're not going to do your vo C at
the end of the project when you might
find we'll gosh they wanted something
completely different you want to do it
on the front end to make sure you align
what you're doing with what your
customers are looking for stands to
reason now Lean Six Sigma is going to be
successful for the following reasons
when management supports Lean Six Sigma
as a business strategy it says this is
the way we're going to make important
decisions we'll no longer going to rely
on gut feel or intuition we're going to
use a more robust way to make important
decisions so if we rely on information
or data instead it uses that Damai ik
methodology for solving problems it's a
very logical very straightforward makes
a lot of sense you know let's define
what we're looking at let's measure
where we're at today let's analyze to
figure out what's important let's figure
out what we're going to do about it the
improvements and then let's make sure
that we can control it going forward
very straightforward very logical makes
a lot of sense and we of course
incorporate the tools or the strategies
within that framework or within that
demand methodology so that we can answer
the questions we need to move forward we
have well-defined projects that directly
impact the organization's bottom line
now I will expand on that by saying that
what's really important is we work on
those issues that are important to the
organization very often they have a
financial component certainly when you
can argue that this project will deliver
you know this what many dollars or this
this much money to the organization's
bottom line that becomes a compelling
argument for the project however there
are often times when an organization
will take on a project because of some
of
reason maybe they're trying to mitigate
some long-term risk maybe they're trying
I here's an example I I work with an
organization that really wanted to be a
good community citizen really good
corporate citizen and they partnered
with different charitable organizations
in their community and periodically do
projects for them didn't necessarily
help the business's bottom line but they
did it because they believed it was the
right thing to do
often Lean Six Sigma will help increase
customer satisfaction in fact I would
say that virtually every project you do
in some respect has an impact on your
customer and very often it also helps
use statistical methods so will require
or it will require the extensive use of
statistical methods so for example if we
look at our measure at the beginning of
the project we say here's how well we're
performing when we started at the end of
the project now here's how well we're
performing after we can run a test to
determine whether or not that difference
is likely to have happened by chance we
would we would you know most instances
find no it isn't by chance it's because
the improvements we put in place it's
not just us saying hey things seem
better people seem happier customers
seem better I think we're making more
money it's not a soft statement like
that that we're making we're able to
demonstrate through numbers saying that
yes we've made a meaningful change the
business you know some key terms that we
would want to look at and talk about as
we move forward now we keep saying the
word or the words Lean Six Sigma now you
might be wondering what is a Sigma
well Sigma is another way to say the
standard deviation of a process metric
or measure now you can imagine if we
have some type of a measure in our
business and maybe its profitability
maybe its customer satisfaction maybe
it's an employee productivity whatever
that measure is we don't simply take one
measure at one period of time and move
on with it you probably take it over a
period of time and there's probably some
variation not every customer gives you
exactly the same customer satisfaction
score not every transaction delivers
exactly the same amount of profitability
and so on so there's some variation well
Stan
deviation is the average amount of
variation about them about the mean or
the average means another way to say
average and so we can look at a process
in the variation across that process
over time and we can measure that and we
know in a normal bell shape you know
distribution that if we were to take a
look at that over let's say I'll make up
six months or a year could be any amount
of time that about 68% of all the
results will fall within one standard
deviation but ninety-five will follow
within two ninety-nine will fall within
three and so on all the way up to Six
Sigma well with six Sigma's of variation
six standard deviations of variation
it's going to capture about ninety-nine
point nine nine nine six six percent of
all expected values now when we can
ensure that a process is delivering
within customer expectations or customer
specifications at the Six Sigma level
what we're really saying is that if my
customer wants this product the service
this whatever and here are their
parameters and how they want it and we
can consistently deliver that
ninety-nine point nine nine nine six six
percent of the time Six Sigma then
that's where how good we are and so we
want to be able to deliver flawless
performance now when we look at an
opportunity it's really just either do
it right or you do it wrong relative
customer expectations and when you do it
wrong we call it a defect a defect
another way to say this is that when you
fall either on the lower side or the
episode of customer specifications it's
a defect now to put this in plain
language if I go in to my local
Starbucks and I order a cup of coffee I
like my coffee to be a certain
temperature and so the company might say
that I'm going to make up some numbers
here if that cup of coffee and it could
be tea it could be whatever is within
sixty to seventy degrees Celsius that
that's just the right temperature if
it's less than sixty is too cold if it's
more than 70 it's going to be too hot so
my spec limits might be within sixty to
seventy degrees Celsius
anything outside of that is a defect our
goal of course is to consistently make
that cup of coffee within spec it's up
to the customer to tell us what those
specs are if they can't tell us we need
to figure it out because that's what
will make them happy I might not be able
to say that I want to be able to get an
out in and out of a drive-through in
less than three minutes but the business
might be able to run a test and figure
out that hey our customers as long as
they get in and out of the drive-through
in under three minutes they give us
really high recommend scores well it
takes longer than three minutes the
scores go down dramatically and so
sometimes a business will have to go out
and figure out what their customers want
what is that voice of the customer and
then be able to figure out how to
deliver that consistently now very often
what happens is that an organization
will have you know a process in place
and each individual in that process will
think that they're performing pretty
well in fact I've got into groups where
I've asked people to prep their hand if
you think 90% is good you know most of
the time almost everybody puts up their
hand well you can imagine that if you've
got a three-step process which would be
pretty simple pretty straightforward
process three steps and you're done well
let's say at the very beginning the
process I'd give you a hundred units
first person does their thing and ninety
percent are good so ten are scrapped or
after you rework but ninety percent get
to move on and they're pretty happy
they're 90 percent good well the second
person now gets that 90 percent and
they're 90 percent good so 90 percent of
that 90 percent gets passed to the third
person that's 81 percent the starting
point for that third person is only 81
percent and they're doing 90 percent of
that it goes down even further when
you've got multiple people involved at
each step of the process you get more
and more waste involved and that becomes
very expensive not only does it cost a
lot in terms of scrap to rework product
or services customers don't get what
they want they have to pay more
presumably because the company is not as
efficient or as effective as they are
and they're either absorbing the costs
or passing them on through higher prices
customers may have to wait longer it's
got to be in trust it got to be
frustrating for the employees it's a bad
deal and so will throughput yield is one
way to look at that expressed as a
percentage it's a way to look at process
efficiencies expressed as a percentage
now I mentioned earlier on that you know
at the Six Sigma level were ninety nine
point nine nine nine six percent good
well another way to look at that is
defects per million opportunity at the
Six Sigma level we'd only produce about
three point four defects now that sounds
really good in fact if I said I was
ninety nine point three seven nine
percent good most people would be pretty
happy with that in fact I think most
people would be pretty excited putting
up banners at Hamm ninety nine point
three seven nine percent but for every
million opportunities for a defect they
produced sixty two hundred anybody want
to get on a plane that's at four Sigma I
don't think so
there are some processes there are some
things that organizations do that are so
critical that you simply can't afford to
be anything but flawless now if I'm
manufacturing you know something that
you know I'm serving popcorn or
something that's much less critical then
maybe I can afford to be a little more
cavalier with that but we have to look
at our organization say for those
critical process how good do we have to
be and this is the way we go about
getting to be that good and when you can
implement Lean Six Sigma and you can put
it into place some of the benefits you
know it they're so widespread you know
when you eliminate the root causes of
problems and defects in the process you
know you create robust products and
services you reduce process variation
you're going to you know achieve all
kinds of benefits for your organization
you help ensure customer satisfaction
you can reduce rework by getting it
right the first time you know imagine
what that does to employee engagement
morale you know when you set your
employees up for success and they go in
each day they have a better day and
because they have a better day you have
lower turnover
you've happier customers you have lower
costs it's a win-win-win for everybody
and you can see that the benefits aren't
necessarily strictly financial or
strictly customer driven or strictly
about employees they go hand in hand
when one benefits they all seem to
benefit they all seem to work in
conjunction that way you know I've never
talked to someone that said you know I
went home at the end of the day
yesterday because I had you know had
such a hard day I was just too
productive you just don't hear people
say that you'd hear them say instead
that I went home at the end of the day
and you know I said to my family that I
had a hard day and then they talked
about the problems or the obstacles that
got in their way
well when we can remove those obstacles
those problems we can enable people to
be productive they have better days you
have higher morale better engagement
they're happier and customers are
getting what they paid for as well and
the company's incurring lower waste and
expense because you have all those
benefits as well now the history of Lean
Six Sigma is interesting because I
mentioned earlier on that none of these
tools are strategies that we talked
about will developed or advantage for
Lean Six Sigma in fact the methodology
really came about back in the 1980s when
a reliability engineer by the name Bill
Smith working at mikkel Harry at
Motorola put together the program
because they wanted to get from where
they were where a lot of their products
were defective and they were having a
lot of challenges and issues their
competitors were simply getting better
than they were they developed this
methodology now coincidentally some of
the members on Smith's team happened to
be karate enthusiasts they recognized
the similarity between the discipline
that they were looking at employing
through the Six Sigma thing that they
were talking about with karate and so
they called themselves belts and you
know green belts and black belts that's
where it came from
now Motorola went on to win the Malcolm
Baldrige award in 1986 the inaugural
award Malcolm Baldrige was a Secretary
of Commerce at one time in the United
States and a big proponent of quality
and after his death they named this very
prestigious award in his own honor and
motor of Motorola was the inaugural
winner and because of that words
harder to get out and people started
saying hey what are you guys doing and
people started talking about this Six
Sigma Jeff well should GE got on board
sometime the 1990s allied signal got on
board you know today you know the vast
majority of Fortune 500 companies use
Lean Six Sigma you see a proliferation
across you know smaller and smaller
organizations as well happening so small
and medium enterprises are adopting it
I've certainly seen a number of cities
and municipalities and government
agencies adopt Lean Six Sigma it's a
very powerful industry neutral
methodology that enables an organization
to transform itself from the old way of
thinking you know let's rely on gut feel
or intuition or you know whoever is the
most authority gets to make the decision
to instead of relying upon data let's
use the information to guide us to make
our critical decisions and when you do
that it changes the nature of the way an
organization operates and functions and
thinks about solving its problems and as
some of these you know examples on the
slide that you can see the savings are
incredible you know you're seeing these
organizations saving millions and in
some cases billions of dollars because
they're driving waste and inefficiency
out of out of their system now there's
no one single model that says this is
the only way you can implement a Lean
Six Sigma team however this is a very
good overview of what most successful
organizations look like now whether they
call these rules by these names can vary
but essentially they function as as
outlined here so you know you'll have
top executives that will lead the change
in provide direction they ultimately own
the Lean Six Sigma initiatives because
if they're saying you know our goals for
the organization are you know here
appears around profitability here is
around you know customer satisfaction
want to be the first choice of customers
here's around you know employees and so
on then they know where they need to
focus their efforts and so they can say
we need to improve in these areas they
have that broad oversight
his ability to not only where they are
today but that longer-term vision so
they can align the two you'll have Six
Sigma champions
they'll help identify in scope projects
they may be you know they may not be
c-suite executives but they might be
vice presidents or or senior leaders
that will help identify as well the
projects that will be worked on they
have that visibility as well they're
connected that way you'll have Six Sigma
master black belts they're the
functional leaders of the organization
they'll and they'll train other
functional leaders as well they'll train
and coach black belts and green belts
they're the technical experts in Lean
Six Sigma they may also take on some
broadly scoped projects or strategic
projects in nature and then you'll have
both green belts and black belts now
black belts and green belts in some
organizations will be determined in
terms of the time they spend on projects
as well as the scope and complexity of
those projects so a black belt for
example like youth full time resources
that's what they do every day they work
on Lean Six Sigma and they can work on
Lean Six Sigma across the business it's
a very very good leadership development
approach as well when you take some of
your best employees you train them in
Lean Six Sigma and then you let them
work on projects across the business
that's extremely powerful as a
development strategy green belts tend to
work on projects that aren't necessarily
as as complex or broadly scope as black
belts they may or may not be full-time
resources so for example they may say
well gosh I work in HR or IT or
operations or finance or engineering or
wherever and I want to work on projects
within my area of the business and so
they'll work on it more on a part-time
basis so some percentage of their time
might be devoted to improvement work and
of course it varies from organization to
organization how they define you know
green belts and black belts and so on
but this is a very common framework now
let's talk about an example of one of
the lessons that we would talk about
this one comes from overview of the Lean
Six Sigma so at the outset of the Train
well you know the first day for example
we would talk about this topic number
three happens to be about design for Six
Sigma now design for Six Sigma or DFS
says for short and I guess DFS s is a
lot easier to say not quite the same
mouthful when we've got one of two
situations happening designed for Six
Sigma it's really the approach that we
take when we've got a process or a
product that is too badly broken to
merely fix he needs to be instead
redesign or a new one developed invented
of sorts then DFS s is a very good
approach alternatively if we are trying
to create to an existing product line or
service then we might use DFS s as well
one of the tools within the DFS s
framework is the failure modes and
effects analysis or the FMEA for short
now the FMEA is a very good pre-emptive
tool that helps identify potential ways
a process might fail now when we work
through the FMEA we're going to
calculate something called a risk
priority number and it's it's simply a
measure risk that we can assess that
would be associated with that desire
that process and the risk priority
number is the result of looking at a
potential failure and that potential
failures been looked at through three
different lenses the first is the
occurrence how frequently does it occur
severity how bad would it be if it did
occur and detectability
what is the strength of our detection
mechanism to stop that failure from
happening in the first place and so when
we look at each element of a process and
we say to ourselves or our team rather
you know how frequently do we think this
occurs how bad would it be
what's the detection we score those on
the scale of one to ten ten being the
worst you know the most severe or the
most frequently occurring and so on
multiply those scores by each other we
get that risk priority number now we can
use the FMEA on either a new process of
designing or an existing process for
that matter might look something like
this
well we'd say you know what's the
process step what's the key process
input in what ways does the key process
input go wrong what's the impact on the
output variable the customer
requirements how is the customer
impacted if this fails how severe would
that effect be on the customer what
causes the key input to go wrong how
often does it occur what are the
existing controls and procedures that
might prevent the cause or the failure
from happening and how well can you
detect or cause detect how well can you
detect or prevent that failure mode from
happening and then when you take the
severity on a scale of one to ten
occurrence and detection you multiply
you get that risk priority number now
there are scales that we can use and I
would suggest that you can certainly use
this exact scale in the language that's
used here or you could go through your
project team and calibrate them and say
well look with 10 being the worst on a
scale of one to ten for severity you
know how would we want a word that and
maybe it's catastrophic maybe it's you
know something else it's important to
make sure that everybody on the team
that's going to go through and use this
rating understands what the language
means and if has reduced without warning
makes perfect sense to you then that's
great use this language but again if it
doesn't then what would attend me in
your world what would a nine be in your
world and so on for a current similarly
we've got a scale here same thing in
terms of does this language do these
numbers make sense for you enter
detection score absolute uncertainty
there's nothing in place at all today
very remote you know there's a very
remote chance the design of the process
control would detect potential cause or
mechanism sub failure mode there's
really very little in place that would
prevent it
you know remote and so on and so here we
have an example let's pretend that we're
a big manager as a manager of that bank
we recognize that very often we compete
on our our rates and we're saying well
gosh that's a pretty tough way to do
business and so what we're going to do
is we're going to make sure that we
provide great customer service we want
to make sure that our customers can
depend on us and so let's look through
the customer satisfaction scores over
last period of time let's say six months
and looking at the different things that
customers have said about us so that we
can identify those areas of the business
we need to improve the most we've done
that and one of the top items happen to
be when people take up money or cash
withdrawal from the ATM the customers
accounts debited but cash is not paid in
other words you see the slip that your
balance has been were reduced by
whatever you tried to take out but
didn't dispense any cash for you so
you're going to be pretty unhappy
extremely unhappy even fact on a scale
of one to ten you might say gosh that's
a nine you might say as the project team
well what are potential ways this could
you know happen well maybe there's non
availability of cash in the ATM machine
ran out of cash maybe there was a
network issue it thinks he gave the cash
but it didn't how often does it occur
well the team believes based on you know
their their research or their experience
their training and on a scale of 1-10
the first ones the seven seconds of five
now just break at this point to mention
that we haven't gone out and validated
the the data yet this is a tool we tend
to use early on on a project because we
probably have you know a quite a large
number of customer complaints we want to
filter down to the ones that are most
critical for us before we go out and
start collecting hard data and measuring
and actually testing and so on if that
be very potentially it's time consuming
and so this is a pre-emptive tool in
that sense it gets is very close to
those issues that are most important and
so you know we're still using and
relying on the subject matter experts on
our project team at this point before we
actually start going out and measuring
and collecting data in any event going
back to the FMEA we've taken those the
severity occurrence and detection scores
we've multiplied them by each other and
we've gotten one twelve and four or five
respectively I will say that I see that
current design control has been given
you know none and they score that a nine
I personally gave it a ten because if
you've got nothing in place it doesn't
get any worse than that so you know it's
a judgment call but this team gave it a
nine now as a project team you probably
put together some recommended actions
which they've done
you might assign responsibilities and
target completion completion dates
they've left that a little bit vague now
we'll come back to this at the end of
the project we'll restore this because
the project was about identifying those
critical areas let's pretend that we
went out and we verify that yes in fact
this is happening a lot you know it's
not just that we hear about it because
those customers that this happens to or
the loudest these issues really do
happen a lot and they need to be
addressed and so we've addressed them we
put improvements in place and we have
come back to the FMA to rescore to test
to see how effective our improvements
are now the team has said well gosh if
this happens it's still a nine the
difference after the improvements have
been put in place at the end of the
project is that they're really not
happening very often at all we've gone
from occurrence of seven down to a four
and from the five down to a two it's
because our detection mechanisms are far
more buster much better in fact we've
gone from seven to one and a five to a
three and so our risk party numbers have
decreased tremendously as well from the
112 to a thirty-two and from the four or
five to a fifty-four
so we've revisited this and we've said
okay based on the approvement so we've
put in place they've been very effective
and we've been able to improve the
business as a result and customers are
much happier with us as a result of this
as well now this is just one small
example of a tool that we talked about
in Lean Six Sigma and we would certainly
go through it in more detail we've got
you know the template for you that we
would work through as well so you've
gained an even better understanding of
how to use this tool and in what
situations and circumstances you could
benefit you and we do that through you
know more than 57 hours of training in
music Sigma we talk through different
industry case studies and you know more
than 100 real-world examples you can
attend batches
you know weekends or weekdays or you
know whatever makes sense for your
schedule there's on-demand support we've
dedicate a team and simply learn
community so you can reach out and talk
to others there are guest lectures
there's training by industry experts
people that have done this and used the
methodology in the real world and can
talk about their experiences now here
are some of the upcoming bad
States as you can see they you know are
during the week and in evenings and
weekends as well so whatever makes sense
for your schedule there's availability
so you can select a batch that makes
sense for you on that note I see we have
a few minutes left that I'll open it up
for any questions that you might have I
think I can see your questions in the
chat box if you have anything you'd like
to ask alternatively you can also send
it out through to simply learn directly
or go to the simply learned community
and hurry they're about the RPN being
126 instead of 112 let me take a look
just like 9 times 5 times 9 should be 4
or 5 I haven't done the math manually
but thank you for pointing that out how
do we get 32 yeah let me just minimize
this so I can see yeah we've gone back
through this again so you know we will
use the FMEA two points in the project
we'll do it at the beginning or earlier
on in the project so that we get a sense
of you know we might have 25 or 30
elements of a process that we're looking
at some larger number well that's a lot
of stuff to go investigate and test and
so this FMEA is like a filtering tool
where we can go through this with the
subject matter experts they say you know
they'll come through and they'll
calculate these initial RPMs some of
them will be you know like 4 or 5 is
pretty high some will be much lower I
don't know if 112 would be particularly
high on most definitely aids but we'll
say it is this example well we're not
going to go investigate everything nor
are we going to address everything in
this project because there may just be
too much stuff there and so we'll we'll
prioritize it based on the air pians
those are pians the team believes are
critical enough that move forward with
we go and we collect data for we
validate what we thought was happening
we'd actually go measure this and test
this to see if this is really happening
and if so then we develop and implement
improvements we make sure to work and we
come back and we visit the after me at
the end to make sure that you know that
they've had the desired impact and so we
would rescore it at that point and so at
the end of the project after the
improvements in the put in place would
say well if it happens it's still just
bad because it you know it is the
difference is it's not happening anymore
it used to happen a lot now because of
the stuff we've done it just doesn't
happen very frequently and so you know
we've we've restored it and we get those
lower scores yep nine times seven times
two that would be correct okay so it
sounds like there might be there's some
math errors in there
impossible you just minimize this now
I'm going to very quickly go to the
first couple of slides some of the came
on
so as I'm talking about lean a little
bit I talked about myself of course lean
and Six Sigma lean came about with the
same goal that Six Sigma came about at
the end of the day organizations you
know
lean it was actually developed through
Toyota Toyota Production system they
wouldn't call it lean at Twitter they'd
call it TPS the right lean came about
sometime in the nineteen eighties early
nineties there were some books written
machine that changed the world and lean
thinking James Womack Daniel ruse and
some others that started talking about
this lean way of thinking about an
organization and so you know the Western
world will refer to lean but in Japan a
Twitter they just called it toda
Production system their goal is to
provide value for the customer they
won't recognize that a lot of the stuff
they were doing was not necessarily a
value-added the customer didn't ask for
it they didn't wanted didn't transform
the product or service in any way
customer didn't want to pay for it
non-value-added they wanted to reduce or
eliminate that as much as possible so
that they could provide data for the
customer so they developed a series of
strategies or tools around that now Six
Sigma they wanted to provide flawless
performance to their you know to their
customers Six Sigma
you know ninety-nine point nine nine
nine six percent of the time you provide
you know what the customers want and
what you said you would give to them so
have the same goal no the idea is to you
know and there's so much overlap because
you know one of the one of the wastes
within lean is defects customers don't
want to pay for defects and so a lot of
the lean work and a lot of the Six Sigma
work overlaps because it has the same
goal the same approach the same you know
outcomes being desired the difference is
just maybe they're different since some
different tools and so there was a
blending of lean and Six Sigma thinking
some you know maybe in the last ten
years or so so instead of having this
lean track or the Six Sigma track you
have more of a blended approach we've
got Lean Six Sigma and you use the tools
or strategies that make sense to solve
the issue your problem that you've got
in front of you so I don't know that I
would separate them and say they're
different things or they are looking
side slides here I shouldn't do that
they're just different approaches it I
would certainly recommend as well that
you know do some research on your own in
terms of lean and Six Sigma you know
maybe a little bit more detailed of a
conversation we can and have within a
couple of minutes here but you know
reach out to simply learn as well we can
address that offline you can get a copy
of this PowerPoint through simply learn
you know I have on the hour so our hour
is up so on that note I'm going to have
to say goodbye but thank you very much
for attending I hope you enjoyed the
session and we'll appreciate your
feedback on that note thank you again
