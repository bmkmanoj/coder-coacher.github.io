six sigma black belt professional with
nearly two decades of experience in
analyzing Lean Six Sigma data using
Minitab every industry is identified by
a niche tool for example to create or
edit pictures most graphic designers
prefer Photoshop and when it comes to
working with documents professionals
blindly trust MS Word similarly when
it's the question of efficiency
analyzing statistical data a majority of
Six Sigma experts rely on Minitab for us
Minitab is not just any other software
but the only way to analyze and improve
a business process now let's begin this
course by introducing you to Minitab the
following screen explains the objectives
covered in this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to comprehend the overview and
importance of Minitab review the
worksheet format and structure define
data window column conventions define
other data window conventions and
discuss the menu bar options
in this topic you'll learn about the
overview and importance of Minitab
as we all know Six Sigma is a set of
quality management techniques and tools
used for improving follow to business
processes but the important thing to
learn here is that these techniques rely
on statistics and actual data that is
gathered only after analyzing the
practiced processes so the next question
is what is the role of a professional
with a six sigma black belt in simple
words such a professional first
identifies the pain areas in the
followed process then uses different
tools and data formats to arrive at an
optimum solution implements the agreed
strategy and most importantly monitors
the changes this is the exact purpose of
this course we provide you with a
problem in the form of different case
studies use related tools to arrive at a
strategy and lastly see you implement
the changes
now let's come to Minitab this is a
software designed specifically for the
needs of Six Sigma practitioners it aids
in effectively simplifying the input of
statistical data manipulating that data
identifying trends and patterns and
extrapolating answers to the problem at
hand that's a rather simplistic way of
describing this vital and extremely
effective tool
moreover Minitab uses a series of
elements to help Six Sigma practitioners
work with data and statistics these
elements are box plots scatter plots and
histograms they collectively provide the
ability to calculate descriptive
statistics
Six Sigma and Minitab are often
mentioned in the same breath if six
sigma professionals are trained in the
use of hard data why do they need
software to accomplish their tasks
analyzing data is an important part of
Six Sigma but the truth is also that Six
Sigma is beyond analyzing data while Six
Sigma professionals are skilled at
interpreting data a software like
Minitab is vital in determining the real
underlying cause of problems within a
process which makes problem-solving a
much faster and easier process in simple
words
Minitab provides a quick and effective
solution for the level of analysis
required in most Six Sigma projects
you may be thinking can't we just use
Excel we'll say yes and no if you're
using Excel to solve business problems
and implement different Six Sigma tools
you would have to employ macros but we
all know only a handful of professionals
can effectively implement macros on the
other hand Minitab offers a highly
user-friendly interface and all it
expects from you is to enter correctly
structure to data
on your screen you can see the first
eight key features of the newest
addition of Minitab
which is Minitab 17 let's learn more
about each of them we begin with basic
statistics this covers descriptive
statistics statistical tests correlation
and covariance the next is graphics as a
professional you would use this feature
to create different types of graphs such
as scatter plots matrix plots box plots
and probability plots moreover this
feature enables you to make and export
custom graphs into different image
formats
while performing any statistical
analysis a key feature is to estimate
relationships between variables
industry experts term this feature as
regression Minitab enables you to
perform different regressions such as
linear and nonlinear binary nominal
ordinal and others next Minitab supports
testing differences between two or more
means this technique is referred as
analysis of variance the software
enables you to analyze this data using
key tools such as analysis of variance
or ANOVA multivariate analysis of
variance or manova and general linear
model now let's introduce you to the
feature of statistical process control
it enables you to create cause and
effect diagrams variables control charts
attribute control charts time-weighted
control charts multivariate control
charts acceptance sampling and measure
process capability the sixth feature on
this screen is of measurement system
analysis you would do this analysis to
determine how much of your process
variance arises from variation in your
measurement system this feature enables
you to provide type 1 gauge study
analysis and three types of gauge
repeatability and reproductive ility
analysis namely expanded crossed and
nested all these analysis recognize
deficiencies in your measurement system
next you'll learn about the feature of
design of experiments or do e anything
that deals with experiments is bound to
be interesting with this feature you can
identify the cause and effect
relationship in other words you can
create and manage different experiment
designs by entering a certain value and
recording its corresponding output this
process of designing different
experiments enables you to arrive at the
exact method to optimize your process
output finally on the screen we see the
feature of reliability or survival this
is used to select the best distribution
for modeling life data moreover and
provide you with tools for estimating a
variety of functions
that describe distribution
on your screen you can see the other
seven key features of Minitab 17 let's
learn more about each of them we begin
these set of features with power and
sample size the power of a test can be
determined as the probability of
correctly rejecting a null hypothesis
when it is false the power size is
directly proportional to the sample size
and this means as the sample size
increases the power also increases next
we'll learn about the feature of
multivariate analysis this consists of
different procedures used to analyze
data when multiple measurements are made
on items or subjects using this feature
you can perform different tests such as
factor analysis discriminant analysis
cluster k-means and others the third
feature on our list is time series and
forecasting procedures these are used to
analyze data that is collected over a
period of time and provide output such
as simple forecasting correlation
analysis aeromodelling and others next
on our list is nonparametric tests
Minitab supports different nonparametric
tests such as signed tests
kruskal-wallis mann-whitney tests and
others now we begin with the count down
the number 5 on our list is equivalence
tests these tests are used to determine
whether the mean values for any product
or process measurements can be
considered as equivalent number six is
simulations and distributions through
this feature you can randomly generate
number identify density and perform
different cumulative distribution
functions and random sampling finally we
have the feature of macros and
customization this feature enables you
to customize menus and toolbars and use
its macro capabilities moreover the
feature supports comm enabled automation
Minitab offers an assistant that
provides help on all topics moreover you
can use the built-in tutorials for
learning the use of any given feature
in this topic you'll learn about the
format and structure of worksheets
though Minitab 17 application requires
Windows 7 or higher to run on a computer
having a minimum of 512 megabytes ram
and 1 gigahertz processor and it
utilizes a minimum of 140 megabytes of
hard disk space you can download the
latest version of Minitab from its
official website if you use the default
options when installing Minitab its
shortcut icon' is created on the desktop
and the Start menu
when Minitab is clicked it opens three
windows that is session worksheet and
project manager the session window is
placed above the worksheet window where
as the project manager window is seen in
minimized mode on the bottom left of the
screen any work in Minitab is carried
out in projects and worksheets a project
has the dot mpj extension
project may have multiple worksheets a
worksheet in Minitab is saved with dot T
W extension the worksheet window is
similar to the worksheet in ms excel and
contains columns and rows the
intersection of each column and row is a
cell so the whole worksheet can be said
to be the intersection points of all the
columns beginning from the leftmost to
the right and all rows beginning from
top left and moving downwards by default
the columns are named as C 1 C 2 C 3
whereas rows are as 1 2 3 the row above
row number 1 is kept empty and is shaded
for column headings it may interest you
to know that a Minitab worksheet can
have up to 4,000 columns now if you wish
to keep all data graphs dialog box
settings and options together you must
save your work as a project file with
the dot mpj extension on the other hand
if you wish to store only the data then
you must save your work as the worksheet
file with the dot MTW extension but the
advantage of a worksheet file is that
you can use it across many projects
a project file enables you to store
graphs windows layout sessions window
output session command history dialog
box settings and options on the other
hand worksheets enable you to store
items that include worksheet
descriptions columns of data column
descriptions constants matrices and
design objects
just the way you need fuel to run a car
you need to enter data in a worksheet to
generate the required output using
Minitab you can enter data by adopting
any of the following ways first is a
cumbersome way of manually entering each
value next by copying data from other
applications or by importing data from
files such as ms excel text or CSV the
latter two are preferred by most
professionals
now let's learn about the key datatypes
a worksheet can support first on the
list is the numeric data type this could
be in the form of whole numbers such as
512 or 62,000 525 or numbers with
decimals such as 3.4 to 2 second is the
text data type which could be in the
form of numbers letters special
characters and spaces finally we have
the date and time and data type which
could be in the forms displayed on your
screen each of these data types are
interconvertible this means you convert
the text data into numeric and
vice-versa or numeric data to date and
time or date and time data to text
in this topic you'll learn about data
window conventions
we have already covered projects
worksheets data and types of supported
data in Minitab so what's next now let's
see how we define column types this
means if you want a column to store
values only in the text numeric or date
and time format you can do that with
Minitab how would you do this first
select a column for which you would like
to set the type and then simply right
click a column name next select the
format column option and then choose the
require to type isn't that easy did you
notice after we selected the type as
text for column c2 Minitab added a
suffix in - t this indicates that column
c2 would display values only in text
format similarly if you select the date
or time type Minitab adds in - D as the
suffix to the column but if you are
thinking for the numeric type the suffix
would be in - in you are mistaken there
is no special suffix for numeric type
as you noticed in the previous screen in
addition to the key data types the
format column dialog box enables you to
select other data types such as
automatic numeric fixed decimal
exponential currency percentage date
time elapsed time and text also remember
formatting of a column is dependent on
the data you enter in that column and
you cannot convert names or alphabets
into the date or time data type
so we have even covered formatting data
types and columns next you'll learn
about certain data conventions to be
followed while you enter data in a
worksheet do you notice an arrow
positioned on the top left corner of the
worksheet immediately before column c1
and it's pointing towards the row
numbers what does this mean this
indicates that you are expected to add
data in the first cell of the row and
column and then move downwards now if
you click the data entry arrow it
changes and starts pointing towards the
right this indicates that you are
expected to enter data in the first cell
of the row and column and then move from
left to right
in this topic you'll learn about the
menu bar
we have reached the final topic of this
lesson overview of the menu bar items
mini tab consists of 11 main menu items
and these are arranged on the menu bar
each item has a major role to play while
you analyze and process data now let's
look at each of them
first on the list is the file menu you
would use this menu to perform actions
such as open closed save print import
data or run the various file types that
can be used in Minitab
next is the Edit menu as the name
suggests this item provides options to
edit undo redo clear delete or clear
data from cells in a worksheet
third on the list is the data menu the
commands in this menu item allow you to
perform complex actions that would be
difficult or tedious to replicate in
other ways for example using the stack
columns option you can not only stack
contents of multiple columns on top of
each other but the command even allows
you to simultaneously create a column of
subscripts or identify our codes that
enable you to see source column for
values in the new column
our fourth menu item is the calc menu
and it enables you to calculate
mathematical expressions and
transformations individual row and
column statistics and Center and scale
columns of data
next on our list is the stat menu it
enables you to run different tests and
retrieve the corresponding statistical
information
five gone and six more to go so the next
menu item is the graph menu it provides
you with the flexible suite of graphs to
support a variety of analysis needs
vii menu item is the editor menu it
consists of dynamic commands that change
depending on the active window
number eight on our list is the Tools
menu in addition to enabling you to open
and use tools such as calculator or
notepad this menu item enables you to
set general settings and manage file
security
next what we have is the windows menu
this item enables you to manage
different windows used in the project
our penultimate menu item is the help
menu this item provides options to
display table of contents user manual
tutorial and a glossary
lastly we have the assistant menu this
provides aid for analytic options
available in Minitab
let's summarize the topics covered in
this lesson Minitab uses a series of
elements to help Six Sigma practitioners
work with data and statistics
Minitab offers a highly user-friendly
interface and its default view opens
three windows session worksheet and
project manager Minitab 17 requires
windows 7 or higher to run on a computer
having a minimum of 512 megabytes ram
and one gigahertz processor
a worksheet in Minitab is saved with mt
w extension with the project file you
can keep all data graphs dialog box
settings and options together a project
file in Minitab is saved with the dot
mpj extension
with this we conclude this lesson
introduction to Minitab in the next
lesson we'll see Minitab
interoperability hi I'm back with lesson
2 in this course on Minitab in the
previous lesson we introduced you to
this statistical software and in this
lesson of interoperability in Minitab we
go a step further to help you understand
how easy it is to transfer data from
Minitab to Word Excel and PowerPoint and
vice versa
the following screen explains the
objectives covered in this lesson after
completing this lesson you'll be able to
transfer data from ms excel to Minitab
export analysis data from Minitab to MS
Word and MS PowerPoint and export data
from session window to MS Word and MS
PowerPoint in this topic you'll learn
how to transfer data from ms excel to
Minitab
ms-excel can be easily argued as one of
the most used software applications by
professionals who work with data day in
and day out why do we say this because
Excel offers a variety of features such
as storing calculating compiling sorting
and formulating data running pivot
tables creating macro programming and
using tools to create different graphics
not only this but ms-excel even offers a
user-friendly bridge for any data
analysis as it stores all graphs and
formula results and reflects all data in
the active worksheet however when you
need to perform an in-depth exploration
industry experts say Minitab is a much
more proficient tool
so why do industry experts prefer
Minitab over other conventional tools
it's because of its standout features
such as conditional formatting project
manager prediction and others that allow
you to effectively structure and format
data and most importantly generate
relevant output for example the
conditional formatting feature allows
you to apply a different format to data
in every cell of a column with the
project manager window you can adjust
between multiple worksheets graphs and a
statistical output and with the
prediction feature Minitab predicts the
output based on the inert values in case
you have any data that has been worked
on in Excel and you need it for further
Six Sigma analysis simply copy the data
from your Excel worksheet to Minitab
now let's learn how we can transfer data
from ms excel to Minitab we begin this
demonstration by opening an excel file
with the required data then select the
cells that contain to the data to be
copied next right-click the cells and
select copy
then open a Minitab worksheet here
select the cells from where data should
appear in the worksheet right click the
cell and then select paste the data
appears in the Minitab worksheet
isn't this simple of course it is also
note that the first row in Minitab is
the header row under column c1 and c2 in
this demonstration the column c1 list
Hospital services and the column c2
tells us the frequency or count of the
number of times the complaint has been
made against the service
congratulations you've successfully
transferred data from ms excel to
Minitab
in this topic you'll learn how to export
data from Minitab to ms word and MS
PowerPoint
you might think why do we need to export
analysis data to ms word and MS
PowerPoint from Minitab many of us make
presentations for official purposes or
for teaching any course while presenting
data we make use of reports and graphs
these reports and graphs can be directly
exported from Minitab to ms word and MS
PowerPoint when you exercise this
feature all it takes is a few clicks to
analyze data and make presentations and
reports effortlessly now let's see the
steps to export analysis data from
Minitab to MS PowerPoint and MS Word
before we begin it's important for you
to learn that Minitab allows exporting
any output or analysis data to both MS
PowerPoint and MS Word let's begin with
exporting analysis data to MS PowerPoint
for this demonstration we're going to
use a generated Pareto chart the first
step is to select the analysis data next
right-click the chart and then select
send graph to Microsoft PowerPoint
Minitab copies the data to a new
PowerPoint file
in case you're working with multiple
presentations mate AB copies the graph
to the last worked file similarly now to
copy the graph to ms word right-click
the output data and then select send
graph to Microsoft Word
Minitab copies the data to a new Word
document
in case you're working with multiple
documents Minitab copies the graph to
the last open the file
congratulations you successfully
exported analysis data from Minitab to
MS PowerPoint and ms word in this topic
you'll learn how to export data from the
session window to MS Word and MS
PowerPoint this demonstration comprises
of two major steps first copying data
from worksheet to the session window in
Minitab and second exporting data from
session window to MS Word and MS
PowerPoint now let's see the steps to
copy data from a worksheet to the
session window the first step is to
select display data from the data menu
the display data dialog box is displayed
in this dialogue box double click both
hospital services and number of
complaints for displaying their data in
the session window
then click ok the data in both columns
is displayed in the session window
now it's the turn of our second major
step transferring data from the session
window to ms word and MS PowerPoint
first we'll export the data to ms word
to do this simply right-click in the
session window and select send section
to Microsoft Word
the data is copied to a new MS Word
document similarly to transfer the data
from the session window to MS PowerPoint
right-click in the session window and
then select since section to Microsoft
PowerPoint
the data is copied to a new MS
PowerPoint presentation did you know in
addition to transferring data of an
entire section you can even select some
data and transfer it to ms word or MS
PowerPoint that's right to do this let's
select a few lines from the data now
right-click and then select send
selected lines to Microsoft Word
the selected data is copied to the open
MS Word document congratulations you've
successfully learned how to copy data
from session window to ms word and MS
PowerPoint
let's summarize the topics covered in
this lesson you can export data from ms
excel to Minitab you can export graphs
and analysis data from Minitab to MS
Word and MS PowerPoint and Minitab
enables you to export session window
data to MS Word and MS PowerPoint
with this we conclude this lesson
minitab interoperability in the next
lesson we'll see the first case study on
using different Minitab tools as per the
syllabus of Six Sigma Greenbelt high
enough of bragging of the advantages of
Minitab it's time we do some real action
and see whether this tool can actually
generate data and as per the work you
perform in your office in other words
let's see if this tool has enough brains
to convert two columns of data into
different charts also if you are someone
pursuing the Six Sigma Greenbelt with
this lesson we take you a step closer
buying analyzing a real-world example in
generating different charts using
Minitab the following screen describes
the objectives covered in this lesson
after completing this lesson you'll be
able to generate bar chart use pie chart
compute Pareto chart define normality
test prepare run chart create histogram
generate box plot categorize measure
central tendency and spread examine
sample size determination and control
charts for continuous data
let's consider a case study to
understand how we generate different
charts in Minitab and interpret their
corresponding results a city hospital is
a well-established 4 storied hospital
located in one of the prime locations of
New York City at the time it was set up
it had become one of the best hospitals
in the city as it possessed the latest
healthcare equipment and many specialist
doctors the hospital was spread over a
large area with 250 beds in the casualty
ward 55 beds in ICU and 450 beds in the
general ward the hospital also included
a pathology lab and pharmacy services
operating around the clock and despite
being a pioneer in offering specialist
services the hospital was seeing its
revenue decline during the last two
years it was seen that other hospitals
were seeing more admission of patients
and generating higher revenue names of
nearby hospitals providing better
treatment was frequently being overheard
in the hospital corridors even the
outpatient department or OPD was seeing
less patients than a year back
what was causing this sudden decline in
patient preference and revenue this
thought forced the hospital management
to adopt a scientific approach to
identify causes before embarking on the
transformation exercise a separate
Department called Health Care excellence
department was created for this purpose
select management personnel were
identified and trained as Lean Six Sigma
green belt and black belt the new
department was communicated that they
would be provided with the required
resources for carrying out any studies
and interventions the new department
discussed and developed its own system
and procedures a process for conducting
daily surveys and entering findings in
the computer systems was developed
the Health Care excellence department
took their first step of defining and
identifying the pain areas they did this
by conducting surveys and interviews to
collect the data discussions were held
with patients the representatives
doctors nurses and other support staff
after a series of data collection and
carrying out the study for a week the
complaints and their frequency was
entered in Minitab
the data gathered was entered into a
Minitab worksheet and subject to
analysis according to the department the
first step is to classify the collected
data into nominal and ordinal categories
this can be done by generating bar
charts here nominal data is categorized
according to the scrip Tavor qualitative
information and this indicates the
relative importance of parameters under
consideration in this case the number of
complaints is the nominal data against
different parameters or the services
offered by the hospital in this topic
you'll learn how to generate a bar chart
in Minitab let's see the steps to
generate a bar chart in Minitab the
first step is to verify the inner data
next click the bar chart from the graph
menu to display the bar charts dialog
box
here select values from a table from the
bars represent drop-down lists
Minitab displays the corresponding bar
chart types
next select the simple bar chart type
okay to display the bar chart values
from a table one column of values simple
dialog box is displayed
next in the graph variables text area
enter the column name complained counts
then in the categorical variable text
box enter the column name Hospital
services
next click labels to provide a name for
the generated graph
enter the title for the graph and then
click OK
finally click ok to generate the bar
graph now let's interpret the graph
after generating the chart the
department analyzed that amongst all
hospital services few specialized
doctors with the count of 723 is the
highest complaint contributor next was
hi wait time followed by noisy
environment unfriendly staff limited
infrastructure and loud atmosphere lack
of Hygiene and overpriced were the
lowest complaint contributors in the
list congratulations you have
successfully generated the bar graph
in this topic you'll learn how to
generate and use a pie chart
after the data was inspected in a bar
chart the department further wanted to
examine the number of complaints in
percentage or proportional data that's
why they decided to probe the number of
complaints using a pie chart this chart
is a circular graph that resembles up
high so deriving its name as pie chart
it represents overall total of the data
in percentage the pie chart has been cut
into different sized slices called as
wedges that show the relative
contribution that different categories
contribute to total and usually the
percentage represented by each category
is provided next to the corresponding
slice of pie in this scenario each wedge
of the circle represents the hospital
services the pie chart is useful to get
the relative importance of the
parameters under study now let's see the
steps to generate a pie chart in Minitab
the first step is to verify the inner
data next from the graph menu select pie
chart to display the pie chart dialog
box
here first select the chart values from
a table option
next in the categorical variable text
box enter the column name Hospital
services
then in the summary variables field
enter the column name complaint counts
next click labels to provide a name for
the generated graph here enter the title
for the generated pie chart then click
the slices labels tab and then select
category name and percent for the
generated pie chart
click okay the return to the
charter dialog box finally click OK to
generate the pie chart now let's
interpret the generated pie chart out of
all complaints 42.8% of patients have
complained against few specialized
doctors followed by hi wait time at
36.9% congratulations you have
successfully generated the pie chart in
this topic you'll learn how to compute a
Pareto chart
the department is still under the
defining phase of their research
although they have already analyzed the
gathered data using bar chart and pie
chart they now want to conduct research
and analysis on a more concrete level so
they decided to analyze the data using a
Pareto chart Pareto analysis is used for
selection of problems and initiating the
improvement projects during the define
phase Pareto chart practices the 80/20
theory and according to this theory the
principle of vital few and trivial mini
is used when solving problems for
quality improvement for example 80% of
wealth is held by 20% of people 80
percent of effect is caused by 20% of
causes 80 percent of our time is taken
by 20% of the activities we perform 80
percent of our software issues are
caused in 20 percent of the modules 80
percent of sales is caused by 20 percent
of products etc now let's see the steps
to generate a Pareto chart the first
step is to verify if you have entered
the data correctly in Minitab in the
next step from the stat menu select
quality tools and then select Pareto
chart to display the Pareto chart dialog
box
in this dialogue box for the defects or
attribute data in field enter the column
name Hospital services then in the
frequencies in field enter the column
name complaint count the next step is to
click OK to generate the Pareto chart as
per the inner data now let's interpret
the generated chart as per our analysis
the cumulative value for complaints
against few specialized doctors and a
higher wait time is alarmingly high at
seventy nine point seven percent whereas
other complaints such as loud atmosphere
unfriendly staff infrastructure hygiene
and other complaints were seen as of low
importance in other words few
specialized doctors and hi wait time
constitute as vital few and other
complaints as trivial many
congratulations you have successfully
generated the Pareto chart
in this topic you'll learn to define
normality test
after the department had identified the
services causing the 80% of problems
they had the task to examine the raw
data to understand if the gathered data
is retrieved from a normal distribution
normal distribution is a statistical
distribution and have bell-shaped
density curves with the single peak all
normal distributions are symmetric we
also see the mean median and mode at a
symmetry around the center that is
whether 50% of the values are less than
the mean and the other 50% of values are
greater than the mean the purpose of
conducting a normality test is to check
if the data is derived from normal
distribution the test results will
confirm either you should reject or fail
the hypothesis as there are chances that
on non-normal data may produce
misleading results now let's see the
steps to conduct a normality test in
Minitab the first step is to enter
complaint details for any one service
for this demonstration we'll consider a
hi wait time we have entered the total
wait time provided by 689 patients next
from the stat menu point to basic
statistics and then normality test
here enter the column name hi wait time
in the variables field
you have the option to select the type
of normality for this demonstration we
will proceed with the default option
anderson darling finally click OK to
generate the normality test graph now
let's quickly interpret the generated
chart as per the analysis the p-value is
less than 0.05 this means that the data
is not retrieved from a normal
distribution
congratulations you have successfully
performed the steps to generate the
normality test graph
in this topic you'll learn how to
prepare the run chart
the department now understands that the
data they are using is coming from a non
normal distribution and they need to
understand the variance that exists in
their data so to do this they decide to
use the run chart option from Minitab a
run chart displays how your processed
data changes over time and can reveal
evidence of special cause variation that
creates recognizable patterns for
distinguishing the reasons of variation
in the hospital services run chart aids
in analyzing the variations
now let's see the steps to prepare the
run chart in Minitab similar to the
previous demonstration the first step is
to enter complaint details for any one
service for this demonstration we'll
consider the same data used for hi wait
time next from the stat menu point to
quality tools and then click run chart
the run chart dialog box is displayed
the dialog box displays the options of
data here we'll arrange the data from a
single column in subgroups
to do this first enter the column name
hi wait time in the single column field
then in the subgroup size field enter
the column name patient ID
next click options to enter the name of
the name chart and then click OK
you
finally click on okay to generate the
run chart now let's interpret the
generated chart as per the generated
chart the reference line is drawn at
eighty three minutes and all 689 data
points are plotted around it
additionally we notice a steep rise in
the wait time after the three hundredth
patient and then again fall in the wait
time after the five hundredths patient
so we conclude that there is a lot of
variance in the data for a wait time
before improvement congratulations you
have successfully generated the run
chart graph in this topic you'll learn
how to create a histogram
after working on the run chart the
department realized that there is a lot
of variance in the wait time service of
the hospital so now they want to assess
the data for its symmetry or skewness
which can be done by generating a
histogram a histogram is created with a
column of measurement data and the
corresponding column of frequency data
it's used for displaying data and
assessing its symmetry or skewness in a
histogram the horizontal axis is divided
into equal intervals the vertical bars
that is frequency at each interval
represents the number of values falling
in the interval now let's see the steps
to generate a histogram in Minitab the
first step is to verify that valid data
is entered in the worksheet next from
the graph menu click histogram the
histograms dialog box is displayed
here you can select and generate
different histograms for your data for
this demonstration we'll select simple
and then click OK the histograms simple
dialog box is displayed
in the graph variables text area enter
the column name hi wait time and then
click OK to generate the histogram for
the wait time data
now let's do a quick interpretation for
the generated graph as per the display
to graph maximum number of patients have
a wait time of 45 to 85 minutes and 100
to 120 minutes on the other hand only a
handful of patients experienced a wait
time of less than 10 minutes
congratulations you've successfully
performed the steps to create a
histogram
in this topic you'll learn how to create
a boxplot
next in order to study the distribution
of wait times
the department recorded the data on wait
time of each customer before being seen
by the doctor the data captured was
entered into a worksheet and a boxplot
was made in Minitab now let's see the
steps to generate a box plot in Minitab
the first step is to verify that valid
data is entered in the worksheet next
from the graph menu click box plot the
box plots dialog box is displayed
from the listed boxplots type select
simple and then click OK to display the
boxplot 1y simple drop-down list
in the graph variables text area into
the column name wait time
then click labels to display the labels
dialog box
now enter the title for the generated
boxplot
next click the data labels tab
here select outliers from the label
drop-down list the three label options
for outliers appear
for this demonstration we'll select the
default option use y value labels click
OK to return to the parent dialog box
now click data view to display the data
view dialog box
here ensure that the following options
are selected inner quartile range box
range box outlier symbols median
connectline
and mean connect line
you
then click ok to return to the parent
dialog box
again click okay to generate the boxplot
now let's quickly interpret the box plot
this plot is made for the wait time of
patients and shows the first quartile
third quartile and interquartile range
moreover it shows the whiskers a number
of outliers are seen towards the bottom
of the box these are actually the times
taken by the patient's coming in the
emergency department we may require to
make a separate box plot for the
patient's of the outpatients departments
or OPD as here it's mixed
congratulations you successfully
generated the box plot
in this topic you'll learn how to
calculate mean median and mode for the
given data team a successfully explored
the frequency of data its symmetry or
skewness and now they have a task on
hand to identify the values of mean
median mode standard deviation variation
range and variance in the values of age
and weight for patients who participated
in the survey so they decide to measure
central tendency and spread in measuring
central tendency and spread
you'll learn to measure the central
tendency or location by calculating the
mean median and mode
now let's see the steps to generate the
mean median mode standard deviation
variance coefficient of variation
minimum maximum and range for a given
data in Minitab the first step is to
enter the patient details in a worksheet
in Minitab next from the stat menu point
to basic statistics and then click
display descriptive statistics the
display descriptive statistics dialog
box is displayed
here in the variables text area enter
the column names age and weight
then click statistics to display the
statistics dialog box
here select the following options mean
median mode standard deviation variance
coefficient of variation minimum maximum
and range
then click ok to return to the display
descriptive statistics dialog box
again click okay to generate the
descriptive data for weight and age of
patients in the session window
congratulations you have successfully
completed the steps to calculate mean
median mode standard deviation variance
coefficient of variation minimum maximum
and range for a given data in Minitab
in this topic you'll learn how to
examine sample size determination
has evaluated the average age and weight
of the patients they now want to know
the approximate number of patients for
their investigation so they decided on
exercising the feature of sample size
determination in Minitab this feature is
generally used for praising a specific
margin of error for confidence intervals
or tolerance intervals
now let's see the steps to perform
sample size determination in Minitab the
first step is from the stat menu point
to power and sample size and then click
sample size for estimation the sample
size for estimation dialog box is
displayed
then from the parameter drop-down list
select the proportional or binominal
option
next in the proportion field of planning
value enter 0.5 this value must be
entered only assuming that the hospital
is conducting this survey for the first
time in an ideal scenario you must enter
the value for the previous survey
then in the margins of error for
confidence intervals enter the value as
0.05 this corresponds to 5%
now click options to display the options
dialog box
here enter the confidence level as
ninety-nine and we can use the default
value competence interval
then click ok to return to the sample
size for estimation dialog box
finally click ok to generate the sample
size for estimation in the session
window
now let's interpret the generated
results as displayed the department
would need to survey 680 patients to
measure satisfaction with 99 percent
confidence level and 5 percent margin of
error as margin of error reduces the
sample size would increase
congratulations you have successfully
performed the steps to create sample
size determination
in this topic you'll learn how to use
control charts for continuous data
the department was able to derive the
specific margin of error for confidence
intervals or tolerance intervals by
determining the sample size now they
want to analyze the distribution of wait
time and whether each patient goes
through the same weight as the patients
were arriving continuously throughout
the day and were subject to waiting
times before meeting with the doctors so
the team decided to generate a chart for
continuous data which comprises the
individual chart and moving range chart
let's see the steps to generate the
chart for continuous data the first step
is to enter and verify the collected
data in Minitab next from the stat menu
point to control charts then to variable
charts for individuals and then click am
are the individuals moving range chart
dialog box is displayed
in this dialogue box specify the column
wait time in the variables text area
then click labels to enter the title for
the chart to be generated
you
next click IMR options to display the
options dialog box
here click the tests tab in this tab
ensure that the default option of one
point greater than K is selected next
click the estimate tab here ensure that
the default value of 2 for length of
moving range is entered then click OK to
return to the individuals moving range
chart dialog box
now click ok to generate the chart for
continuous data
now let's interpret the chart for
continuous data as we see the chart
consists of individual value and moving
range chart in the former the patient
number 20 had to spend slightly more
time than prescribed in the control
limits the department has to identify
the reasons for the same separately
whereas in the latter patient number 20
and 21 are seen beyond the control limit
this means excess time taken by patient
20 seems to be affecting both individual
and moving range charts
congratulations you have successfully
created the chart for continuous data
let's summarize the topics covered in
this lesson bar chart classifies the
data into nominal and ordinal categories
a pie chart examines data in percentage
or proportional data a Pareto chart
practices the 8020 theory of vital few
and trivial mini principle normality
test is conducted to understand if the
data comes from normal distribution a
run chart analyzes the variations in
data
a histogram assesses the data for its
symmetry or skewness measuring central
tendency and spread describes
variability in data by calculating the
mean median and mode sample size
determination evaluates a specific
margin of error for confidence chart for
continuous data monitors the process
data
with this we conclude this lesson in the
next lesson we'll see another case study
covering 12 tools in Minitab for
greenbelt professionals
hi I'm back in this time might have a
fun question for you what's the
household chore that needs more analysis
as compared to other chores can't guess
according to me its laundry all that
sorting of clothes into different piles
separating the whites from the colored
clothing segregating fabrics in the
cotton silk satin or jute and
categorizing them according to type tops
and pants and delicate clothes the
process of doing the laundry begins with
checking all the pockets for important
scraps of paper or change before putting
the laundry away in the machine then
changing the water temperature for
different clothes sometimes using hand
washing techniques to remove tough
stains or using fabric softener after
detergent poof the list is never-ending
I'm so tired of talking about it and I'm
sure you are too and you must be
wondering what dirty laundry has to do
with learning many habit I'm doing so
because the concept of the next topic is
along the same lines as doing laundry it
includes a lot of data sorting applying
formulas and changing data types in
Minitab before we get into the details
let's see the following screen that
describes the objectives covered in this
lesson
after completing this lesson you'll be
able to describe sorting data use
applying formulas to columns define
changing data types prepare process
capability indices produce dot plot
operate individual value plot explain
interval plot demonstrate scatter plot
calculating Z value comprehend
identifying distribution describe
transforming data to a normal
distribution and interpret control
charts for discrete data
in this topic you'll learn about sorting
data
fibonacci technologies an IT company was
a successful company globally they
recently developed a banking software
with multiple modules from these modules
module X and module Y were found to be
critical for performance and sub
required special effort these modules x
and y were to be tested and debugged for
completing the testing and debugging
Fibonacci hired a third party called
caliper calipers team consisted of one
project manager and two consultants who
were to be built on an hourly basis the
team decided to use Lean Six Sigma as
they were skilled and trained in the
approach for making analysis and
improvements on a project
now let's see how team calliper uses
Lean Six Sigma for analysis and
improvements it was segregated into five
steps as mentioned below caliper starts
their task by defining the testing
process for the two modules the project
manager documented the testing process
in detail after getting the requirements
for the various functionalities and
their criticality the project manager
assigned modules x and y to both the
consultants individually as these
consultants were chosen based upon their
suitability to the work requirements
next the calliper team measured the data
for all the debugging activities
throughout the shift that was compiled
at the end of the day by the project
manager after taking the details from
each consultant the project manager
thereafter entered the data on a
worksheet as per the module name that is
module X or Y the calipers then analyzed
the data collected for three weeks this
analysis was completed using Minitab 17
we'll see that in the coming screen the
next step was improving the uneven
distribution of work between the two
consultants this was achieved by
relocating a part of the work containing
higher debugging time to the consultant
who had lower debugging time during the
day the last step was to control the
debugging time this was managed
diligently over the period the team was
able to finish the work ten days before
the estimated completion time
as mentioned in the previous screen the
data was analyzed in Minitab let's focus
on the analysis portion of Lean Six
Sigma the data provided in the worksheet
was collected on a daily basis for
modules x and y then the team from
calliper decided to sort them in module
wise categories for further analysis
Minitab enables you to sort data in one
or more columns in increasing or
decreasing order moreover you can store
the sorted data in original columns
other specified columns or in a new
worksheet it's important to note that
columns that are sorted together must be
of the same length if the selected
columns are not the same length
Minitab displays a message asking if you
want to add missing values to the bottom
of the shorter columns so that they can
be sorted together with the longer
columns
when Fibonacci technologies had decided
to employ their team including a project
manager and two consultants to carry out
the Lean Six Sigma consulting for
testing and debugging their modules they
assessed that the project duration would
be around 500 hours its breakup is
displayed on your screen
did you know Minitab even enables you to
prepare an estimate based on the inner
data yeah that's right
now let's see the steps to formulate the
estimation based on the inner data the
first step is to verify the data entered
in Minitab next in the calc menu click
calculator the calculator dialog box
opens
we want to calculate the total cost then
in the store results in variable text
box enter the total cost
next in the expression window enter the
formula as hours times cost per hour
then click ok the result of the
calculation appears in a new column
total cost congratulations you've
successfully calculated the total cost
in this topic we'll learn how to apply
formulas to columns
we have seen how to use calculator in
Minitab now let's see how to apply
formulas to columns using the same data
using the same data right click on empty
column the formula will be placed here
next click formula and then click assign
formula to columns the assigned formula
dialog box is displayed
now to assign a formula to a column in
the expression field engine hours times
cost per hour
and then click OK
you
the result of the calculation is
displayed in the selected column now
rename the column as total cost
congratulations you've successfully
learned how to apply formulas to a
column
in this topic you'll learn about
changing data types
the change data type feature enables you
to specify the data type to a column
before you enter the values or you can
change the data type of a column after
you enter the values now let's see the
steps to change data type for a column
after data was entered into the
worksheet it was seen that values under
serial number appeared as numeric to
avoid these from being used for any
calculation we have to convert them
let's convert these values to text from
the data menu click change data type and
then click numeric to text the numeric
to text dialog box is displayed
in the dialogue box you will see both
columns serial number and debug time and
at their data type is numeric next
double click serial number it appears in
the change numeric columns field so now
we are set to change the data type from
this column
next select the field store text columns
in and then double-click serial number
this means the changed values will be
stored in the same column
now click ok you'll see that column one
is renamed as c1t showing that data type
for all values in this column is txt
congratulations you have successfully
completed the steps to change data type
in this topic you'll learn about process
capability indices
callipers were assessing the efficiency
of the debugging process for this they
were analyzing counts of the work done
on a daily basis using process
capability indices now let's see the
steps to use process capability indices
the first step is to verify the entered
data then from the stat menu point to
quality tools followed by a capability
analysis and then click normal the
capability analysis normal distribution
dialog box is displayed
in the dialogue box you'll see all
column names date total debug time and
debug
now click the single column text box and
double-click debug
next in the subgroup sighs textbox type
one
enter 14 for lower spec and 22 for upper
spec fields these seconds can vary based
upon historical experiences
next click on options the capability
analysis or normal distribution options
dialog box opens
here select benchmark ZZZ
then click ok to return to the
capability analysis or normal
distribution options dialog box
finally click okay to generate the chart
now let's see the interpretation of the
generated chart CPK value with the data
is 0.5 4 since it's a low value it's
operating between 1 Sigma and the 2
Sigma the productivity of the
consultants may fall below 14 - bugs per
day which is below the LSL the data
needs to be collected for more than 30
days to get better interpretation of the
process capability every analysis needs
to have sufficient data points to get
clear understanding of its state an
initial study helps us in identifying
the trend we should also look at whether
some change in the method has taken
place and which could reset the
expectation for the amount of debugs per
day an improved process could raise both
the LSL and AUSL similarly unique work
needs to be open to wider gaps between
LSL and USL congratulations you have
successfully generated a process
capability
in this topic you'll learn how to
produce dot plot
callipers wanted to analyze the shape as
well as the spread of their data so they
generated a dot plot they had data for
both modules x and y for completing
their analysis let's see the steps to
generate the dot plot the first step is
to enter the required data in Minitab
from the graph menu click dot plot the
dot plot dialog box is displayed

in this topic you'll learn how to
operate individual value want
callipers graduated their investigation
from dotplot to individual values plots
individual values for the debug data
collected on various dates to see their
spread now let's see the steps for
creating an individual values plant the
first step is to verify if the data is
entered correctly from the graph menu
click individual value plot the
individual value plot dialog box is
displayed
since we are looking for a date and
values only from the dialog box select
the simple option from the 1y section
then click OK to display the individual

here the data is grouped into two
clusters which are four modules a and B
congratulations you have successfully
completed the steps to generate
individual value plot
in this topic you'll learn about
interval plot
callipers next action was to generate
interval plot to display the mean and
intervals for one or more groups here we
have two groups module X and module y an
interval plot is a graphical
presentation of the distribution of any
sample that shows the samples central
tendency and variability interval plots
are used for comparing groups now let's
see the steps for creating an interval
plot the first step is to verify if the
data is entered correctly then from the
graph menu click interval plot the
interval plot dialog box is displayed
in the dialogue box under the section 1y
select the with groups option
then click ok to display the individual

completed the steps to generate interval
plot
in this topic you'll learn about
scatterplot
callipers next action was to generate a
scatterplot as it examines the
relationship between two variables here
the calliper team wanted to see whether
the time to the bug is gradually
reducing now let's see the steps for
generating a scatter plot the first step
is to verify the inner data from the
graph menu click scatter plot the
scatter plot dialog box is displayed
in the dialog box select the wif groups

then click okay
again click okay to generate the
scatterplot chart let's see the
interpretation of the generated chart
there is some fall in the debug time
with date and this may be due to
learning effect congratulations you've
successfully learned how to generate
scatterplot
in this topic you'll learn how to
calculate Z value
the calipers team had taken more time to
complete a task than any experienced
banking employee so they knew that the
same amount of work could be done in
less time by experienced resources so
they hypothesized that more experienced
resources would take less time than the
hypothesized mean value of 60 hours now
let's see the steps to calculate the Z
value hypothesis the first step is to
verify the inner data in Minitab
from the stat menu point to basic
statistics then click - one sample Z the
one sample Z for the main dialog box
opens
in the dialog box select the option one
or more samples each and a column from
the drop-down list
now double-click total debug time from
the text area on the left
enter five in the known standard
deviation
then select the perform hypothesis test
checkbox
now enter 60 in the hypothesized mean
text box
next click options to display the
one-sample z options dialog box
then from the alternate hypothesis
drop-down list select main is less than
alternate hypothesis
and then click okay
now click graphs to open though one
sample Z graphs dialog box
here select the histogram checkbox
then click ok to return to the parent
dialog box
again click ok to display the one-sample
z debug time data in the session window
and generate a histogram
let's see the interpretation of the
generated chart with the current data we
can see that the p-value is zero point
zero zero zero which is less than 0.05
therefore we can reject the null
hypothesis also the presence of expert
resources does affect the resolution
time you should consider the fact that
the data is limited here for the purpose
of explanation only more than 30
observations need to be taken to get a
better understanding of the z-test and
distributions
congratulations you successfully
performed the steps to calculate Z value
in this topic you'll learn about
identifying distribution
in this topic you'll learn about control
charts for discrete data
callipers team were reaching the end of
their testing and now they were studying
and analyzing the defects and a number
of bugs in the lines of code so they
decided to generate control charts to do
this they prepared a worksheet with
total debug time and the bug here they
use C chart because each day would have
multiple defects
now let's see the steps to generate
control charts for discrete data the
first step is to verify the entered data
from the stat menu point to control
charts then point to attributes charts
then click see the see chart dialog box
is displayed
here double-click the bug - a sinus
value two variables
then click labels to enter the title for
the chart
you
next click see chart options to display
the see chart options dialog box
here click the test tab to ensure that
all options are selected
you
then click ok to return to the pair
Lockbox
finally click okay to generate the C
chart
let's see the interpretation of the
generated chart the process of debugging
is seen to be well within the UCL and
LCL and shows little variation thus the
process can be seen to be stable at the
moment
congratulations you've successfully
completed steps to generate control
charts for discrete data
let's summarize the topics covered in
this lesson sort data in one or more
columns according to values that are
associated in the selected columns data
can be sorted in increasing or
decreasing order applying formulas two
columns defines data in a column as a
function of data in other columns change
data types enables you to specify the
data type of a column before you enter
values process capability indices check
efficiency in the process
dotplot analyzes shape and spread of
their data individual values analyzes
spread of data an interval plot is a
graphical presentation of the
distribution of any sample that shows
the sample central tendency and
variability scatter plot examines the
relationship between two variables
calculating Z value that measures the
difference between two or more data
identifying distribution analyzes data
for different types of distributions
transforms a non-normal data into null
distribution control charts for discrete
data analyzes if the collected data is
continuous
with this we conclude this lesson case
