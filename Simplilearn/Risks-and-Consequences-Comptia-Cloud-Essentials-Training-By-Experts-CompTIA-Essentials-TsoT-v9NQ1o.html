risk as the proactive identification
analysis and control of those risks that
can threaten the assets or the earning
capacity of an enterprise in other words
it is identifying and mitigating the
risks that can have an effect on the
business value of an organization risks
can be due to multiple reasons such as
not complying with regulations of an
industry or a company security breaches
which eventually lead to data leakage
risks associated with vendor licensing
etc the factors that we take into
consideration when we address the issue
of risk are compliant security privacy
reputation legal and licensing we will
discuss the idea of compliance in the
next slide all organizations have to
adhere to or comply with a set of
regulations or legalities of their
respective industry this is very crucial
for larger organizations especially the
ones that are publicly listed inability
to adhere to these laws might result in
the infringement of law which can be
detrimental to the interest of the
company in order to mitigate risk due to
non-compliance organizations should
follow stringent measures having direct
control over the IT assets indicates
that we can have access rights to
several IT applications again yearly
audits revealed the identity management
process and how access control is
organized among the employees in the
organization
cloud however has the ability to
complicate this entire process in cloud
there is very less visibility and when
our applications are hosted on cloud
service providers can issue and manage
or use identities and write associated
with these applications in the next
slide we will discuss the relative
advantages and disadvantages of in-house
system management and cloud computing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
