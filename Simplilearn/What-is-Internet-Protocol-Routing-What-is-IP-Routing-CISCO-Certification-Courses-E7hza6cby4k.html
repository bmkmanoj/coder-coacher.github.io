and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
network architectures wireless and
troubleshooting this lesson introduces
you to routing concepts and
configuration let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain how a router
determines the best path configure
static routes floating static routes and
default routes describe general
characteristics of routing protocols
list the common administrative distances
explain the methods of packet forwarding
used in cisco devices
let us discuss routing in the next slide
look at the output of the show IP route
command this command displays the
routing table of the router - classful
networks can be seen in the routing
table the 25.000 slash 30 and the
10.0.0.0 slash 24 network the routing
table is organized by classful network
even if variable length subnet mask vlsm
is used there are three routes in the
routing table the first route 25 25 25 0
is directly connected to fast ethernet 1
0 because 25 dot 25.20 5.0 does not have
a different prefix length specified it
uses the prefix length of the classful
network so it's prefix length is slash
30 the sea to the left of the route
shows that it is a directly connected
network and is directly connected in the
entry the interface is the outgoing
interface to get to a destination that
is in the 25 25 25 dot 0 slash 30 subnet
in this case the outgoing interface is
FA 1 0 now we have two routes under the
10 network
these are 10 dot one dot 13.0 slash 24
which has an outgoing interface of FA 0
0 and 10 dot one dot 2 3.0
/ 24 which has an outgoing interface of
fa0 one note there is no route to the
network 10.1 dot 12.0 / 24 in the
routing table without static or dynamic
routing RTR 3 does not know how to get
to a destination in that network
let us discuss next hop a routing term
in the next slide each routing source is
assigned a number from 0 to 255 that
rates how trustworthy it is the table on
the slide shows the default
administrative distance for routing
protocols take some time to study it we
have discussed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
