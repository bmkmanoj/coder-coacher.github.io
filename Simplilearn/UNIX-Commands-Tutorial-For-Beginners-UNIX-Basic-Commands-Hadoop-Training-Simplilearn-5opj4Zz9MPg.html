of her duper training by simply learn
before we begin with this lesson let us
first recap what we have covered in the
previous two lessons in the first lesson
we were introduced to the concept of
Hadoop after which in lesson 2 we
understood the Hadoop architecture as
Hadoop runs only in UNIX or Linux
environment we're going to cover the
basic unix commands in this lesson we
are going to see the most useful unix
commands which we will come across
during this hadoop training before we
begin let us go through the agenda of
this lesson
in this lesson we will cover some basic
unix commands to see how to create and
delete a directory move or rename a file
or directory see the help on the command
and see the contents of a file we will
look into the basic unix commands next
all the unix commands should be executed
in a command shell commands are case
sensitive and all commands should be
terminated by carriage return character
or enter key or the unix commands given
here as examples are taken from the
samples executed in the Ubuntu running
with virtualbox UNIX running within
windows the first command we should try
is PWD which stands for print working
directory the PWD command outputs the
name of the directory which we are
currently located in for example typing
PWD in the desktop directory will show
/home forward slash user name forward
slash desktop in the highlighted section
we can see that /home /j dutta is the
current directory generated by PWD
command execution in the highlighted
section we can see a dollar symbol which
is populated before PWD command the
dollar symbol represents a prompt which
means that now we can type the UNIX
command it basically means that it is
waiting for an input from the user we
will continue our discussion of the
basic unix commands in the next slide
next important command we will discuss
is LS which stands for list the LS
command out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
