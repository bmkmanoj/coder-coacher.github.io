risk management
role of risk management let us begin a
discussion by first finding out the role
of risk management it is to be noted
that large losses cannot be avoided
every time the aim of risk management is
not to avoid such losses rather it is to
prepare for such losses and assess
beforehand the potential impact on the
firm substantial financial measures in
terms of allocating capital and proper
contingency plans must be in place
before such an event certain tasks that
are involved in risk management are
assessing risk from all directions and
properly communicating these risks to
the decision-makers proper checks and
measures must exist that monitor these
risks and generate alarms in the event
of any potential upcoming hazard
you
risk management failure let us look at
some of the reasons why risk management
can fail in an organization the first
reason is the failure to measure risk
correctly that is to say the company
might not be able to quantify the risk
properly another reason is that some
risks might not be recognized this can
happen mainly due to ignorance and
inexperience of the managers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
