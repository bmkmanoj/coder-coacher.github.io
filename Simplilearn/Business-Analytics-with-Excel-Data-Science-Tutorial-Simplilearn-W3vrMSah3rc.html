and welcome to the lesson formatting
conditional formatting and important
functions in this lesson we will learn
about custom formatting how to use
conditional formatting and formulas and
implement logical statistical and
mathematical functions let's say we need
to differentiate the sales value from
the given data set as above target below
target and met target
as a data set can be huge in complex
differentiating each value manually
would consume a lot of effort and time
here comes the Excel features such as
formatting and conditional formatting
which enables us to perform this task
easily formatting as the name suggests
helps us to format the data using
different techniques making the data
easy to read in the required format and
analyze them the right formatting
technique applied to the worksheets can
help the users present the data
efficiently conditional formatting a
type of formatting helps us visually
explore and analyze data detect critical
issues and identify patterns and trends
conditional formatting helps to add
patterns and trends to the raw
information using different colors icons
and formulae etc at times we also need
to perform mathematical operations and
calculations within our data set Excel
provides a large number of logical
statistical and mathematical functions
such as vlookup H lookup and if not
ranked quartile and many more that can
help the users to perform calculations
ranging from basic to complex operations
these inbuilt functions help us to
manage data and perform descriptive
statistical analysis Excel also offers a
wide range of important formulas that
help to perform many common tasks these
formula may be as simple as basic
addition or it could be a complex
combination of in Bill excel functions
before going into details let us start
this lesson by defining the objectives
of the lesson
the worksheets appear more polished and
easy to read if proper formatting
techniques are applied to it we can
format the cells in Microsoft Excel
manually by selecting fonts font color
font size background colors and borders
we can also use numerous predefined
table styles or quick styles to quickly
format a table automatically this is the
basic formatting in Excel if these
built-in functions do not meet our needs
or do not display the data in the format
that we require we can create our own
custom format in this topic will focus
on custom formatting in Excel let's say
we want to display one million five
hundred and thirty two thousand as 1.53
m or the first of January 2016 date with
a weekday as the first Friday January
2016 here we can use custom formatting
feature of Excel let's see how we can
accomplish this in Excel
in this lesson we shall consider the
following fields from our master table
dates order ID product salesman region
number of customers net sales and profit
and loss here in the given worksheet we
have a column named net sales suppose we
want to display the values of net sales
in terms of thousands for example seven
thousand one hundred and sixty-four
should be displayed a seven point one
six K select the entire column for net
sales
under the Home tab click the drop-down
present in the numbers panel select the
option more number formats a format
cells dialog box appears from the
category list select the type as custom
in the type text box enter number column
number number 0 decimal 0 0 comma open
double quote capital K close double
quote
here number is the digit holder with
thousand comma separation each comma
after decimal zero zero indicating the
two zeros after decimal point indicate
number of value after decimal places the
K component displays a literal K
character to denote thousands here we
can see the preview in sample box the
value shown is seven point one six K
finally click OK button
the values in column net sales are now
displayed in terms of thousands
now let us consider another example of
date formatting
in the column dates we have a date value
written as first Jan 2012 we want to
display it as first Sunday Jan 2012
first select the column containing dates
tab click the drop-down present in
numbers panel select the option more
number formats a format cell dialog box
appears from the category list select
the type as custom
in the type text box enter DD - DD DD -
mmm - why why here d stands for date M
stands for month and y stands for year
the first 2 D D is the date the next 4 D
D D D is for weekday say Thursday then
mmm is for the month in short form and
YY is for year here we can see in the
preview in the sample box the values
shown is one Sunday Jan 12 finally click
on OK button
you
thus the custom formatting helps us in
changing the appearance of the cell
value according to our needs a worksheet
may contain thousands of rows of data by
simply examining the raw information it
would be difficult to see patterns and
trends conditional formatting helps us
visualize data that make worksheets
easier to understand it quickly
highlights important information in a
spreadsheet by using colors icons and
data bars it changes the appearance of
one or more cells when the cell value
meets certain criteria to do this we
need to create a conditional formatting
rule for example a conditional
formatting rule can be if value is
greater than 5,000 color the cell yellow
by applying this rule we were able to
quickly see which cells contain values
that are greater than 5,000 let us
understand this with the help of
examples
consider the given sales table which
depicts the amount of sales done by each
salesman here we want to highlight the
duplicate order ID values first select
the order ID column
click Home tab under styles panel select
the option conditional formatting from
the drop down menu hover the mouse over
highlight cells rules and select
duplicate values a duplicate values
dialog box appears
select a formatting style from the
drop-down menu in our example we will
choose green fill with dark green text
click OK here we can see that the
conditional formatting is applied to the
column order ID Excel highlights all the
duplicate cells with green fill with
dark green text
we can also explore other options
available in conditional formatting like
greater than less than between equal to
text that contains a date occurring and
top / bottom rules all these rules work
in the similar format Excel provides
predefined styles to quickly apply
conditional formatting to our data they
are data bars data bars are horizontal
bars added to each column much like a
bar graph color scales color scales
change the color of each cell based on
its value each color scale uses a two or
three color gradient icon sets icon sets
add specific icon to each cell based on
its value
let us consider another example to
explain how icon set rules are used
consider the given sales table here on
the basis of the sales amount we want to
apply the icon set rule if sales amount
is greater than 8000 then a green arrow
should appear in the upward direction if
sales amount is between 5,000 and 8,000
then show a yellow arrow in the
horizontal direction and if sales amount
is less than 5,000 then show a red arrow
in the downward direction
to perform conditional formatting select
the desired cells
click on Home tab under styles panel
select the option conditional formatting
from the drop down menu hover the mouse
over icon set rules and select the first
rule
again click on conditional formatting
select the option manage rules from the
drop-down a conditional formatting rules
manager dialog box appears
- icon set rule and select three icon
set rule click on edit rule and an edit
rule formatting dialog box appears
by default for three icon set rule Excel
uses the 67th percentile and the 33%
I'll rule this means that it shows a
green arrow for values greater than 67%
yellow arrows for values between 67 and
33% and red arrow for values less than
33%
now let us customize this rule for our
criteria in the type drop-down select
the option as number
you
in the value reference box enter value
is 8,000 for green color arrow and 5,000
for yellow color arrow
Excel automatically picks the criteria
for the red color arrow click OK in the
conditional formatting rules manager
window click OK we can see that the
cells are highlighted as per our
criteria cells which have a value
greater than 8000 have a green arrow in
the upward direction
values between 5k and 8k are highlighted
with a yellow arrow and values less than
5k are highlighted with a red arrow
we can also apply conditional formatting
rule with the help of formulas consider
the given table which shows the profit
done by each salesman here we want to
highlight the rows in the table where
ever profit is greater than 4000
select the entire table along with
headings
click on conditional formatting select
the option new rule from the drop-down a
new formatting rule dialog box appears
under select rule type select the option
use a formula to determine which cells
to format under format values reference
box and to the formula as equals if Open
bracket dollar sign h2 greater than 4000
comma true comma bolts close bracket
this will apply formatting to a cell if
the profit is greater than 4000 click on
format button from the format cells
dialog box select the fill tab from the
color dialog box select the color as
green finally click OK
the conditional formatting is
successfully applied to the cells here
we can see that the cells with the
profit greater than 4000 are highlighted
with the green color
logical functions evaluate a cell or
cells for our criteria and returns a
boolean value true or false in this
topic we will cover various logical
functions like if and/or not true false
consider the given sales table here on
the basis of the sales amount we want to
determine the commission percentage of
each salesman following is the criteria
if net sales greater than or equal to
10,000 set commission as 5% if net sales
greater than or equal to 5,000 and less
than or equal to 10,000 set Commission
as 2.5% if net sales less than 5,000 set
Commission as 1.5% this is a common
condition where we're required to create
a between formula that picks all values
between the two given values in such
conditions we use if with the and
function let's write the formula in cell
I five like any other formula we will
start with the equal sign then type our
function e if and then type in open
parentheses the first parameter we need
to pass is a logical test here the
logical test is if sales cell G 5
greater than or equal to 10,000 a sign
value as 5% then we will pass the second
logical test here we will use an
function if open bracket and open
bracket sale that cell G 5 greater than
or equal to 5,000 comic at cell G 5 less
than or equal to 10,000 a comma a signed
value as 2.5% in the else parameter we
will type 1.5 percent this means that if
the first two cases become false then
the formula will assign the value 1.5
finally close the two braces for the two
ifs thus Excel returns the result as
2.5% for cell G 5 now drag the formula
with the help of the fill handle we can
see the results for the other cells as
well
the or function returns true if any of
the conditions are true and returns
false if all of the conditions are false
a given table we are required to assign
performance remarks for each salesman as
per the scaling table
in scaling table we have the criteria
that if net sales greater than 10,000 or
profit greater than 5,000 set remark as
good else set remark as needs
improvement
let's write the formula using if and or'
to check sales and maximum sales in cell
j5
so our formula becomes equals if open
bracket or open bracket g5 greater than
10,000 comma H 5 greater than or equal
to 5,000 comma double quote good double
quote comma double quote need
improvement double quote close bracket
let's drag this formula across the cells
with the help of the fill handle
this formula returned true if any of the
condition is true thus in the given
example the cell j9 returns good even if
profit is less than five thousand
our next function is true / false true /
false returns true and false
respectively if we write them in any
cell
the not function reverses the result of
the function if result is true it
returns false else true let's write
formula as equal not open bracket k5
closed bracket in cell l5 this returns
the result as false
let us now study about different lookup
and reference functions used in Excel
such as vlookup each lookup match index
and offset function the vlookup function
lets us search for specific information
in the current worksheet say we have a
list of students with marks we can
search for the marks of a specific
student if our table is in horizontal
format and we want to determine a
specific value then we use the H lookup
function consider the extract from our
master sales table the table depicts
sales information based on order ID
products sold salesman and net sales now
we want to determine the net sales
corresponding to order ID 1 1 2 1
let's understand how we can accomplish
this using the vlookup function
note that vlookup function is only used
for vertical tables let's use cell I to
to add the formula like any other
formula we will start with the equal
sign then type our function named
vlookup and then type and open
parenthesis now we will add the
arguments the first argument is lookup
value lookup value corresponds to the
value or item we are searching for so in
our example it will be order ID 1 1 2 1
cell H 2 the second argument is table
array table array is the cell range that
contains the data in this example our
data is in cell b2 to e 40
you
you
the third argument is called index num
column index number the column index
number is the column number in which we
are looking for information here in our
table array net sales is the fourth
column so our third argument will be for
the fourth argument is range lookup this
value corresponds if we are looking for
approximate matches or not and can have
value either true or false true denotes
the approximate match and false denotes
the exact match here we will pass false
finally close the parentheses so our
function has the form equal vlookup open
bracket h2 comma B 2 : e 4 t comma 4
comma false close bracket we can see
that the function returns the value as 2
- 7 7
note that the vlookup function works
from left to right that means the lookup
value should always be present in the
leftmost column of our table array
if our table is in horizontal format and
we want to determine a specific value
then we use the H lookup function
consider the given table let's write the
formula in cell I for we will start with
the equal sign then type our function
name each lookup and then type open
parentheses the first argument is the
lookup value so in our example it will
be order ID equals 1 1 - 1 cell 8 for
the second argument is table array in
this example our data is in cell G 8 2
is 11 the third argument is row index
number here our table array net sales is
the fourth row so our third argument
will be 4 the fourth argument is range
lookup here we will pass false finally
close the parentheses so our function
has the form equals H lookup open
bracket H 4 comma G 8 : a s 11 comma 4
comma false close bracket the function
returns the value - 2 7 7 note that H
lookup function works from left to right
that means lookup value should always be
in the topmost row of your table array
the match function searches for a
specified value in an item in a single
dimensional array and then returns the
relative position of that item in the
array let us understand its functioning
with the help of an example consider the
given sales table shown here we want to
determine the position of the
corresponding date in the original table
so let's write the formula in cell e5
type equal sign then type the function
name match and then type an open
parenthesis
the first argument is the lookup value
so in our example it will be date in
cell b5
the second argument is lookup array the
lookup array is a range of cells that
contains the value we are searching for
in this example we will select the cells
b-17 to be 1 3 4 2
you
you
the third argument is match type match
type can be either -1 0 or 1
should be one if we want to find the
largest value less than or equal to the
lookup value
the value should be zero if we want to
find the first value exactly equal to
lookup value
it should be minus one if we want to
find the smallest value greater than or
equal to lookup value here we'll pass a
match type as zero as we require an
exact match finally close the
parentheses so our function should look
like match Open bracket B five comma
dollar sign B dollar sign seventeen :
dollar sign B dollar sign 1 3 4 2 comma
zero close bracket
this returns the value as 3 now we can
drag the formula across cells with the
help of the fill handle similarly we can
use the match formula in cell III to
determine the position of the shown
field name cell c3 in range
b-17 to I 7 teen for example net sales
is at 7th position in the range b-17 to
i 17 let's write the function in cell
III write formula as equal sign match
and open parentheses in the first
argument select cell c3 for second
argument select cells b-17 to I 7 teen
past third argument is 0 finally close
the parentheses so our function looks
like equal match open bracket C 3 comma
dollar sign B dollar sign 17 : dollar
sign I dollar sign 17 comma 0 close
bracket so for profit loss field the
value returned is 8
net sale the value returned is seven
the index function returns value from a
specified position in a specific column
in a list suppose we want to determine
the value of the field mentioned in cell
c3 from the sales table on a specified
date the table should dynamically fetch
the value if the value of the cell c3
has changed and if we enter profit loss
formula should fetch the profit loss
value for the specified date if we write
net sales in cell c3 then formula should
fetch net sales value for specified date
so let's use the index function to
determine the value in this worksheet
select cells c5 write formula as equal
sign index and open parentheses the
first argument is the array for our
example enter b-17 colon i1 342
you
the second argument is the roan um this
corresponds to the row number that has
the value we want to return here we will
enter a five which denotes the required
date
the third column is call num this
corresponds to the column number that
has the value we want to return here we
will enter III which denotes the
position of the field name in cell c3 in
table
finally close the parentheses
thus our formula returns the value as
6500 and 28 based on the position at
cells c5 this is the net sales value on
the date the second of January now drag
the formula with the fill handle to the
other cells as well
the offset function returns a reference
to a range that is the offset number of
the rows and columns from another range
or cell now let's understand how to use
it select cell d5 right formula is equal
sign offset and open parenthesis the
first argument is the reference this
denotes the starting range from which
the offset will be applied for our
example we will select the reference
cell as b-17
the second argument is the rose this
denotes the number of rows to apply as
the offset to the reference this can be
a positive or a negative number so for
our example we will enter a 5 minus 1
here we are subtracting 1 to match
number of row which have the value and
the offset from the reference cell the
third argument is the calls this
corresponds to the column number that
has the value we want to return here we
will enter III which denotes the
position of the field name and subtract
by 1 to match with the offset
referencing finally close the
parentheses the function returns the
value based on the position of date from
cell b5 and field from cell c3 now drag
the formula across the cells with the
help of the fill handle if we enter
profit loss formula should fetch the
profit loss value for the specified date
a variety of statistical functions are
available in Excel to perform
calculations ranging from basic function
mean median and mode to more composite
distribution and test binomial or chai
square in this topic we will cover
various statistical functions like sum
if countifs percentile quartile standard
deviation and median
some ifs and countifs are the most
frequently used functions in Excel these
functions allow us to perform count and
some based on one or more criteria the
sum ifs function calculates the sum of
cells based on certain criteria let's
understand how to use the function with
the help of an example consider the
given sales table say we want to
determine the net sales done by salesman
Justin here we will use the sum ifs
function to calculate net sales
so let's write the formula in cell n4
type equal sign then type the function
name some ifs and then type in open
parenthesis the first argument is the
sum range this is the input range that
contains the required data so in our
example we will select cells h4 to H
1328 the second argument is the criteria
range this denotes the range that
contains the required criteria here will
pass the range that holds salesman's
name cells efore to e 1328 the third
argument is criteria this corresponds to
our required criteria we only require
net sales of the salesman Justin so we
will select cell m4
finally close the parentheses note that
we can pass multiple criteria in this
function the function returns the net
sales done by Justin countifs function
works in a similar manner like some ifs
it counts the number of cells in a given
range when certain criteria is met say
in the given sales table we want to
determine the total number of sales for
net sales greater than 8,000 to
determine the count we will use the
countifs function so let's write the
formula in cell n 5 type the equal sign
then type the function name countifs and
then type in open parentheses the first
argument is the criteria range one this
denotes the range that contains the
required criteria here we will pass the
cells containing net sales h4 to H 1328
the second argument is criteria one this
corresponds to our required criteria we
only require entries with net sales
greater than eight thousand so we will
enter greater than eight thousand
finally close the parentheses note that
the function allows you to enter
multiple criteria so n5 reflects the
total number of sales as four hundred
and forty five for net sales greater
than eight thousand in this topic we
will learn how to use the functions
percentile quartile standard deviation
and median in Excel
consider the given sales table let's see
how to use the percentile function on
net sales to find its 40th percentile
select the cell and 6 write the formula
as equal sign percentile open bracket
select the column net sales H for 2h
1328 as our first argument pass the
second argument as 0.4 in order to find
the fortieth percentile this returns the
result 5220 this means that 40% of the
net sales is less than or equal to 5220
the next function is quartile quartile
function depicts the results for the
first second third and fourth quartile
say we want to find the total number of
sales which are less than or equal to
25% let's use the quartile function to
calculate this selects ln7
to write the formula type equal sign
function name is quartile and open
braces select net sales column H for 2h
1328 as the first argument
type 1 as the second argument
the second argument must be a number
between 0 &amp;amp; 4 the function returns the
value as 3822
which means that 25% of the sale is less
than or equal to three thousand eight
hundred and twenty two note that here we
can use the percentile function to
perform the same task the function
percentile H for 2h 1328 comma 0.25
gives us the same result it's up to us
which function we would like to use for
the quartiles Excel has a function to
calculate sample standard deviations
stdev standard deviation determines how
dispersed the data is from the mean say
we want to calculate the standard
deviation for a number of customers
so write the formula in cell n8 as
equals the function name stdev open
braces select number of customers
columns as its argument
the function returns a result one point
for the median function returns the
value from the range for example we want
to find the mid value for net sales to
calculate median in sell and nine write
the formula as equal sign the function
named median then open braces select net
sales column as its argument
this calculates the mid value of net
sales as six thousand one hundred ninety
two rank function is used to compare a
number from the rest of the numbers in
list in any order
whether ascending or descending this
function returns the rank of the number
relative to the other values in the list
let's use rank function in cell j4 to
calculate rank on the basis of net sales
select cell j4 and write the formula as
equal sign then type the function name
rank and then type in open parentheses
the first argument is the number this is
the value whose rank we're required to
calculate here we will pass the argument
cell h4 the second argument is ref this
corresponds to the array or reference
list here we will select the column net
sales ie cells h4 to H 1328
you
the third number is order this specifies
how to rank the number zero means
descending order and one denotes
ascending order this argument is
optional if we don't pass any argument
Excel automatically takes the argument
zero here we will pass zero finally
close the parentheses here we can see
that Excel has determined the rank for
net sales seven thousand one hundred and
sixty-four as 553
finally we can drag the formula and can
see the rank for the other cells based
on net sales
