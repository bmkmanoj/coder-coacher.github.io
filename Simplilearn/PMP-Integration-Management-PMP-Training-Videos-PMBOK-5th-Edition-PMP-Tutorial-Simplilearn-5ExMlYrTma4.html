course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project
integration management there are 47
processes in project management
grouped into 10 knowledge areas and
mapped to five process groups in this
lesson we will look at the first
knowledge area that is project
integration management and its processes
in the next screen let us understand the
concept of project integration
management project integration
management involves unification
consolidation articulation and
integrative actions that are crucial for
successfully completing the project the
project integration management is
high-level work that project manager
does and it involves managing inter
dependencies among the other knowledge
areas the other nine knowledge areas
involve detailed work in a specific
direction for example project cost
management deals only with how to manage
cost in a project the project management
processes do not happen independently
for example a new resource added to the
project may require changes in cost or
schedule or both in dealing with such
situations the project manager
integrates the processes of project
management the need for integration
drives much of the communication and the
work of the project manager let us
discuss the key role of project manager
sponsor and team in the next screen
project manager team members and project
sponsors have different roles to play in
a project the project manager is
supposed to play multiple roles in the
project the key role is to perform
integration the project manager puts all
the pieces of the project together into
a cohesive whole in doing so the project
manager tries to ensure that the project
is done faster cheaper and utilizes
resources optimally while
meeting the project objectives as the
project progresses the team members work
on completing the project activities the
role of the project sponsor is to
protect project from any unnecessary
changes and to ensure that it has the
required resources for completion the
project sponsor is the champion for the
project within the performing
organization that is the organization in
which the work is being performed in the
next screen we will cover the project
selection methods an organization can
undertake a project under contract with
an external organization or take up a
project driven by internal business
needs there should be a formal process
of selecting project in all
organizations to ensure that it is
making the best possible use of limited
corporate resources for example if the
organization has an option to take up
any one out of the two projects both of
which use the same corporate resources
the organization would naturally select
the one which is more profitable there
are two broad ways to select a project
one way is the benefit measurement
method where one project is compared
with other competing projects another
approach is based on mathematical models
wherein you examine the most optimal
selection of projects by trying to
optimize a goal for example maximize
operating profits such methods may be
called constrained optimization methods
there are different methods under both
these categories and you should be
familiar with the names of these methods
broadly the benefit measurement methods
focus on ascertaining the costs and
benefits of undertaking the project the
methods under benefit measurement method
include murder board where a panel of
experts shoots down a new project idea
peer review scoring models economic
models and benefit compared to cost the
constrained optimization methods rely on
mathematical modeling techniques to
determine the best selection of projects
to achieve certain business of
objectives the methods of constrained
optimization method include linear
programming in reality you might not
have seen these methods to be followed
in project selection often personal
relationship with the sponsor may be
more important than anything else this
is quite normal and any organization
worldwide works this way however as a
certified project manager it is
important for you to be familiar with
more scientific methods of project
selection a typical question on the PMP
exam could be what type of project
selection technique is peer review and
the right answer is benefit measurement
method you need to understand the
characteristics of various project
selection methods to answer scenario
based questions in the next screen we
will focus on the project selection
methods there are five project
management processes which are part of
project integration management knowledge
area they are the developed project
charter done in the initiation process
group develop project management plan
undertaken in the planning process group
direct and manage work carried out in
the executing process group monitor and
control project and perform integrated
change control undertaken in the
monitoring and controlling process group
and close project or phase done in the
closing process group
