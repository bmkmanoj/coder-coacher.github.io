consultant I help people with the
various aspects of Salesforce
hi I'm Debbie a sales head our company
has decided to implement Salesforce to
manage inbound leads and follow-up
reporting we will be trained on
Salesforce shortly well that's good I
believe it will also help them in their
career growth however I'm struggling to
understand how Salesforce will help us
to manage inbound leads and other
aspects you know Debbie that's an
excellent question companies looking for
managing inbound leads and follow-up
reporting or slowly moving the
Salesforce for automating this process
most sales teams are challenged with
managing inbound leads including
assignment logging activities and follow
up the leads object in Salesforce allows
sales managers to assign inbound leads
from websites through lead assignment
rules the activities object allows for
the reporting of tasks such as outbound
calls and events such as in-person
meetings
lastly reports can be created to display
closing rates an average length of sales
cycles great I can't wait to get started
to get started the first thing we're
going to talk about here is the leads
homepage the leads homepage is used to
view lists of data import leads transfer
leads use the mass email leads tool as
well as mass add leads to campaign so if
you can see over here on the right hand
side this is a screen shot of the leads
homepage and now we're going to jump
into Salesforce and actually see the
real thing so I'm logged in here and you
can see I'm at the home page so to jump
to the leads tab I'm going to click on
leads and then as you can see here this
is the leads homepage so there's a
usually a lot of confusion about what
exactly the homepage is for specific
objects because you also have this home
tab up here each of these tabs across
the top that actually points to
different objects are actually have they
actually have their own home page so if
you could see here it says leads home
just to be very very clear this is the
leads homepage so just to sort of peruse
this you can see that we are looking at
reviewed leads you can also look at
recently created or unread leads that
maybe were assigned you can also see
different reports down here such as the
lead lifetime reported leads by source
and then down here you also have tools
such as import leads mass delete leads
etc so we're going to talk about the
tools first so if I click on this import
leads link it's actually going to take
me directly to the data import wizard
and so later on in this course we
actually talk about importing data but
for now you just need to know that if
you want to quickly import a list of
leads you can jump to this leads home
home tab here and click on that import
leads link you can also mass delete
leads so let's say you do an import of
leads that you actually want to end up
deleting again we're going to talk about
this later on in the course in our data
management but it does take you directly
to the mass delete function in
Salesforce the next link down here is
the transfer leads link so if I click on
transfer leads I can actually do just
that
I can transfer leads from one user to an
active user inside of Salesforce and the
filters for this are very similar to the
mass delete essentially you can you can
choose what leads you want transferred
based on the different criteria here
then you click find and you can actually
transfer those over it's not a commonly
used feature in Salesforce but it is
important to know that it exists the
next one here is mass email leads so
this is a pretty popular option so if I
click on that it'll actually take me to
the mass email tool in Salesforce again
this is something we'll talk about later
on but in short I can click on go here
and it's going to show me a list of all
the leads I have in the system and I can
click Next and I can you know step
through the different steps of sending a
mass email which we'll go into later on
but essentially that's what that's for
there and then down here last we have
the mass add leads to campaign so what
we can do is actually select a campaign
and and add those leads to it we'll talk
about this later on when we talk about
campaigns but you know from the leads
homepage here you have access to all
these tools
the next thing we're going to talk about
is creating contacts on those specific
accounts so the features of a contact
are quite simple this is really what you
know CRM systems were designed around
from the beginning they store
information on individuals you can log
interactions such as tasks and events
you can also sync them with Outlook or
Gmail you can also do that on leads but
it's primarily done on contacts because
you know the contacts that you have are
you know the actual individuals you
really want to be talking to so we're
gonna jump into Salesforce again here
and we're actually going to create a new
contact so we're at my truck parts Inc
account so now I'm going to click on the
new contact button so I'm going to click
new contact and I can actually type in
who I want that new contacts what I want
their name to be and click Save and it's
real simple it just simply creates a new
contact record then I can come over here
and actually fill in that individuals
title you know I can fill in any other
information relative to them but if I
want to jump back to an account I can
click on the account link and do so now
I only have one contact on here so if I
want to I can come over and you know add
another contact let's say Tom Cruise
here so it'll it'll save and reload this
Tom Cruise contact if I click on the
account name again it's going to bring
me back and show me that now I have two
contacts so the idea is is that you will
have a running list of contacts
associated with an account at any given
time
the next thing we're going to talk about
here is creating products products in
Salesforce are you know really records
for you to track you know the products
you're selling or the services that
you're selling as well so it's mint free
to creating you know really a catalogue
of all your products and services you
add them to opportunities and quotes for
in-depth reporting so what that means is
you know when you go to view a report
rather than just seeing a customer name
a date and a dollar amount you can
actually see what products or services
were quoted along with that you know
opportunity you can also create custom
fields for example for cost reporting so
you can actually have a field on product
for you know your cost so that way you
can go back and run reports later on and
say well you know my cost for products
you know $40 we sold it for $100 and
then you can get a quick report from
that and say well there's a $60 you know
spread or a margin on that specific
product you can also rename products and
call them services you know funny enough
80% of America you know service based
but you know every CRM on the planet
calls them products so you can actually
go in and rename products and actually
call them services and use them in the
exact same way and for example that
quantity field that can be for hours if
you're like a time of materials type
business then you can also you know have
a quantity there for the number of hours
and then you use the dollar amount to be
what that hourly rate would be so that's
sort of a neat workaround for those of
you that work in you know professional
services for example so now I'm actually
going to jump into Salesforce and
demonstrate creating a product here so
I'm gonna click on this products tab and
you know this page can be probably one
of the most confusing tab home pages
that there is you have the ability to
see price books buy lists you can see
product views you can also see asset
views and essentially what assets are is
if you've got a customer that makes a
purchase you can have the products that
they purchased added to their account as
assets so that's what that's about but
for the purpose of this specific lesson
we're gonna click on this new button so
you need to scroll down a little bit
it's not obvious
you need to scroll down and click on the
new button here and then you have the
ability to add a product so here we're
gonna put you know widget mm and you
know mm a let's say the model number we
also have some other fields where we can
choose you know product code so we're
gonna choose a product code here and
then we also need this to be active now
we have the ability to just save at this
point but you know what you should do is
click on save and add price that way you
can complete you know the the creation
process otherwise if you don't you're
not going to be able to add that product
to a specific you know opportunity so
for the standard price I'm going to put
5,000 and then click Save now what
happens is it takes you back to the
product page you can see your product
name you can see the product code and
that it's active well you might believe
that you're done but you're not now you
actually have to add it to a price book
so a lot of you might consider this to
be redundant step because why would you
need to add it to a price book if you've
got a standard price on there well
exactly for all the reasons that we
mentioned when going over price books
that you may have a product that you
sell for you know a different amount to
different individuals so for example
here what I'm gonna do is click on this
add to price book button and I'm going
to choose you know an active price book
where at which I can and click select
there and then this is where price books
differentiate between products so you
have this standard price of five
thousand dollars for this product now I
can just check this checkbox and it'll
just grab that standard price and add it
to the price book but in this specific
case maybe I want to change it to be you
know two thousand and then I want to
save so what I just did is whenever this
widget is added to an opportunity using
this price book instead of using that
five thousand dollar standard price it's
going to use the two thousand dollar
standard price so that gives you know
users and managers the ability to say I
want specific pricing based on you know
certain scenarios so again you can you
can add those price books to an
opportunity and then grab products you
know on a per price book basis so so
that's what that's for and now you're
done so we've created the product with
the product name you have a product code
and it's active make sure to check that
active checkbox you've added the
standard price and you've also got the
list price here on a price book basis
so the next thing we're going to talk
about here is creating opportunities in
Salesforce so opportunities in
Salesforce as I mentioned before allows
you to track your sales and potential
sales and also forecasts on them so what
I mean by that is you can run reports
and see what opportunities are scheduled
to close based on their close date and
dollar amount as well as any stage
information you can also view reports of
products and any discounts you have and
then report on win rates and see overall
sales effectiveness so what that means
is if you have you know 100
opportunities in ten of them get closed
then you can say well we've got a ten
percent you know win rate on those
opportunities so an opportunity in
Salesforce is really there for year your
salespeople to manage their pipeline if
you've got any open proposals or open
quotes those would all be opportunities
in Salesforce so now we're going to jump
into Salesforce and actually create an
opportunity so I'm logged in here and
back at the home home tab what I need to
do is start by clicking on an account so
on this account record I can actually
click this new opportunity button you
can also create an opportunity from the
opportunities tab so I can click on that
tab and click new here the trouble with
that is that you you do need to link it
to an account of some type most of the
time so I do recommend navigating to the
opportunity record from the account that
way it's automatically filled in what I
mean by that is I can click on new
opportunity and that account is already
filled in there you certainly don't have
to do it that way that's what I
recommend you can just create it
directly from the opportunities tab but
you know a lot of times there's
confusion over which account was used
and if there's accounts of similar names
or duplicate names you might actually
link the opportunity to the wrong
account if you use my method then you
know you're going through the account
and so it's linked and you know it's a
sure thing so at this point I've got a
couple of different required fields here
so I've got for example like primary
contact and you know referred by so I'm
just going to fill those in and click
Save so I can keep on moving through so
if you look
here this is exactly what I was
referring to by filling in those fields
you might have you know multiple records
associated when this happens you need to
click on this lookup field and then you
need to actually you know manually
select which particular contact you're
talking about and then click Save
so once you could click Save your
opportunity is going to be saved and so
what happens what happens there is you
know you're looking at this opportunity
from a viewing perspective rather than
edit over here on the right-hand side
you can then do things like you know
adjust the dollar amount you can also
adjust the stage of the close date so
for example here I want to change the
stage to proposal I want to change the
close date to let's say you know
December 31st and I want to save so here
what the what this means is that you've
got a couple of required field so if I
click Edit again you can see that you
know close dates required stages
required so what would happen if I then
remove that close date and tried to save
you would see that it's a required field
so the close date is another area in
Salesforce where you know a lot of
Salesforce customers are confused or
they're not exactly sure how to use it
really that close date should be the
actual closed date or the forecasted
closed date and you know if if it would
be great if there would be some way to
rename it to be you know forecasted
close date before the opportunity was
signed and then the name changes to
actual closed date once at his sign says
force doesn't do that though that's
essentially what it's for if the
opportunity hasn't been signed hasn't
been one then you need to choose a
closed date that best represents when
that will happen and for a lot of sales
teams you know it's sort of impossible
to pinpoint a actual and actual sales
date so you know best practice might be
to just make it for the last day of any
given month so if you think this will
probably close in February just make it
for the end of February and just choose
the last date of February or if you
think it's going to be you know today
you can make it today but you know a lot
of times sales teams will shoot will
choose and forecast based on the month
I'll say well I think
it'll close next month just make it for
the last day of that month and then when
sales managers and owners go to run
reports they can see a forecast based on
you know month that nobody's gonna look
at a forecast on a per day basis for
most industries so all that matters is
what month is it going to close it
really doesn't matter as much as far as
the specific date goes now when you go
to actually mark this as closed one for
example that's when it matters so when
you get you know a signature on the
dotted line you need to make sure that
the close date is reflective of when it
was actually signed so here for example
I'm gonna click Save and then you know
what it's going to do is it's gonna
allow me to save as you know closed one
as well as the close date here I'm being
prompted to choose a project value so
here I'm gonna choose five hundred and
then click Save so now you can see that
I've got a closed one opportunity for
five hundred dollars on today's date so
you know through its really simple as
far as creating you know an opportunity
record itself goes here now let's say on
my opportunity here that I actually want
to add products I can I can do that by
scrolling down and clicking on add
product I can then check you know
different checkboxes and click Save and
a select here and then I have the
ability to actually choose what quantity
I want to have these products listed on
the opportunity I can also adjust the
sales price that date and anything else
like the line description and then at
this point I can click Save and then
what will happen is those products are
then added to the opportunity now if you
look here I can no longer edit this
amount field even if I click on the edit
button it's going to be locked and so
what happens is when you add products to
an opportunity it locks that amount
field and so you can't change it unless
you have unless you you know remove
these products from the opportunity but
it's very easy to add those products and
then you can go back and run reports on
them and all of that so you know
essentially that's how you create an
opportunity as well as adding products
down below now when I clicked add
product before I didn't I wasn't
prompted to choose a price book now if
you have more than
an actor price book you will be prompted
but if you only have one price book you
won't be prompted so if you're in a
business where your pricing is sort of
streamlined then you know you'll never
be asked which price book to use but
again going back to that retail versus
wholesale wholesale scenario if you've
got more than one price book you'll be
prompted to choose one and then the
products and the pricing will be you
know made available to be added to this
opportunity likewise hi there if you
