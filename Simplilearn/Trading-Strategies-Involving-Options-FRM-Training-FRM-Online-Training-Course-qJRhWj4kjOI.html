preparation for frm part 1 exam in the
previous session we have learned the
properties of stock options their upper
and lower bounds and their values and
exploration options give us the
flexibility to have different kinds of
payoffs under different market scenarios
we can use options to trade
strategically and to devise our own
payoffs in this session we will learn
how to combine different options and
create some interesting payoffs these
strategies can be customized to suit
different market expectations let us
begin
this interesting session agenda the main
agenda of this session will be to learn
how to combine options with stocks or
how to combine 2 or 3 different options
to devise a trading strategy we will
learn some popular trading strategies
such as covered calls and protective
puts that combine options with stocks we
will then learn about spread strategies
in which we buy or sell options at
different strike prices or expiry prices
to create the desired payoff finally
we'll learn about some combination
strategies that combine two or more
strategies such as a straddle strangle
strips and straps
covered calls and protective puts let us
analyze the payoff from a cupboard
cooled strategy in this strategy we long
a stock and short a call at the same
time which reduces our initial outlay if
the price decreases the call expires as
worthless and some of the loss from the
stock is compensated by the gain from
the cool premium when the price rises
the increase in price of the stock is
equal to the loss from call and payoff
is constant in case of protective put we
purchase a put along with the stock when
the price of the stock decreases it is
compensated by the gain from the put and
loss is limited to a constant amount
when the price increases the put expires
as worthless and there is a gain from
the stock which becomes positive after
sufficient movement to cover up the
initial outlay in fine the put spreads
Bull Bear spread in a spread strategy we
purchase or</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
