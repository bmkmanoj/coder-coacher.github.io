financial risk manager frm par one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use the Greek letters
welcome to the 41st lecture in the
preparation for the first part of the
frm exam in the previous sessions we
have already learned the factors on
which the option prices depend these
factors include stock price volatility
strike price risk-free rate and time to
expiry factors such as risk free rate
volatility time to expire etc are also
termed as the Greeks in this session we
will learn about the properties of the
Greek letters that affect the option
price
agenda the agenda of the discussion will
be to learn about the properties of the
Greeks that affect option price we will
begin with the concept of Delta hedging
and why it is risky to have a naked
position the Delta of derivatives will
be discussed
we will then learn about the other
Greeks such as theta gamma Vega and roll
the properties of these factors will be
discussed and then we will see the
mathematical relationship between the
important Greek letters finally we will
end the session with a brief discussion
about practical approaches in hedging
and portfolio insurance naked and
covered positions
let us begin our session with the
concept of a naked position in an option
if a trader purchases or sells only the
option without having any position in
the underlying asset he is said to have
a naked position for example purchasing
a put option on a stock without owning
the stock naked positions are risky if
the movement of the underlying is an
unfavorable direction free sample in the
previous case when the trader buys a put
option and the price increases the put
will expire worthless and will result in
a loss similarly if a trader shorts a
call and the price rises significantly
there could be a huge loss to the trader
in order to reduce the risk we usually
need to cover our position by holding
the asset to balance the unfavorable
movement this is called covered position
for example if the trader held a stock
as well as the put option then some loss
from the put option would have recovered
due to the increase in the value of the
asset
