spark Java project with maven first you
need to create a directory structure as
SRC slash main slash Java to keep all
your Scala source code files let's then
keep some in Java source files in this
folder
to build a Java project we need to
create a build file pom.xml to provide
the dependency details we'll provide all
the dependent jar details in the
dependency section
you
here in this file we are mentioning the
pendent jar file as Hadoop hive HBase
Kafka and others
you
once we have the source code and pom dot
XML build file written we can build this
project from the command prompt by
executing the MV and package command
this demand will download all the
dependent jar files and compile the
source files to create a jar file that
can be used for running the application
you
after successfully compiling the code
our jar file is available in the target
directory
in this demo you'll learn how to write
and run a java application let's create
a file simple app Java in this folder
here we're going to write our first to
spark java application to read a local
file and to count the number of lines in
which characters a and b have occurred
as shown in the code we have imported
Java spark context spark config and the
rest of the classes from the same
package this class has the main method
in which we are reading the readme MD
file by using the text file method of
the Java spark context object after that
we're using the filter method to read
each line and check the occurrence of
characters a and B we're cashing this
count in the memory by using the cash
method in the filter method we have
overridden the call method to return a
boolean variable to run this application
we need to type the command as shown on
the screen
