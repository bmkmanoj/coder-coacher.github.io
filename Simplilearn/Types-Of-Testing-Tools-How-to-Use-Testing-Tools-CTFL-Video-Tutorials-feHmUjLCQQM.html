hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on IT sqb foundation
preparation this is the last session
that one needs to go through to complete
the is cubie training at the end of this
training you will be able to understand
different types of testing tools
benefits and risks of those tools we
will also learn about the process of
introducing a tool into an organization
like in earlier sessions we have quiz
questions at the end of this session and
you are strongly advised to answer these
before you move on to the following
sessions let us look at the agenda for
this session the whole session is
divided into three parts various types
of testing tools effective use of tools
potential benefits and risks introducing
at all into an organization in this
section we will try and understand
purpose of tools different test
activities that tools would support we
will also look at various tool types in
terms of their general functionality
rather than going into lots of detail
the reason for this is in general the
types of tools will be fairly stable
over a longer period even though there
will be new vendors in the market new
and improved tools and even new types of
tools in the coming years what is the
purpose of a tool in testing tool
support will improve the efficiency of
test activities as automated functions
have lesser probability of their manual
execution tools also help to automate
activities that require huge manual
resources thereby speeding up the whole
process automation of activities is also
important for some test kinds which are
impossible to test manually automation
also increases the reliability of
testing as it is possible to achieve
more coverage of tests through
automation given the above benefits it
is very important to consider the
possible opportunities for automation
within test projects however we must
also remember that automation is not a
silver bullet which will solve all ills
of poor testing automation in itself
needs to be carefully planned and
executed using the right tools we will
look into more detail about this in the
following slides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
