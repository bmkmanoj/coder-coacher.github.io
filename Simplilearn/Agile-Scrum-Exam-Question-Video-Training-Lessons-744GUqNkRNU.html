eight scrum estimation welcome to lesson
eight of simply learns agile scrum
training program in this lesson we
explore how estimation is done on scrum
projects there is a lot of at times
excessive importance attached to the
process of estimation which is often
over the top scrum establishes simple
techniques of coming up with quick but
reliable estimates with the added
advantage of being able to refine the
estimates from the actual experience of
working on sprints let us begin with the
agenda of this lesson in the next slide
agenda we will now look at the detailed
agenda for this lesson we start off by
setting up some first principles that
guide us through the process of
estimation on scrum projects we then
look at different types of estimates
that are done at various points on a
project the classification could be on
the basis of the method used to arrive
at the estimates or the confidence level
we have in the estimates next we will
look at the units of measuring size of
software typically on an agile project
we use either story points or ideal days
to express the size estimate then we
talk about the techniques of estimation
that are commonly used on scrum projects
here we focus on two techniques called
planning poker and affinity estimation
we will now start off by looking at the
principles behind scrum estimation
principles behind scrum estimation let
us establish some common ground before
diving into techniques or units of
estimation the first thing to understand
is that an estimate is after all an
estimate it is a forecast a guess based
on available information it is neither a
life-or-death matter nor a sentence to
live with for the rest of the project
accuracy and precision are terms that do
not go well with the term estimation
achieving precision in estimates is
neither possible nor necessary as long
as you are able to forecast with
reasonable certainty and come up with a
predictable plan you should be fine the
team which is actually doing the work
should have the last word in finalizing
estimates others are free to have an
opinion and they are allowed to ask
clarifying questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
