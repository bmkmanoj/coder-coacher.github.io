of 10 learning units apart from this
introductory lesson therefore it is
important that you go through this
lesson before accessing the remaining 10
learning units so what are we waiting
for let's begin with the introductory
lesson agenda
we will first begin with the objective
of this lesson followed by a few recap
topics that you might have covered
during your ITIL foundation level the
topics we will cover our ITIL basic
introduction ITIL intermediate and its
relevant topics this is followed by
information about the accreditation
Institute ESS course description and its
objectives we will then look at who can
attend this course next moving to the
exam section we will learn about the
exam prerequisites or say the
eligibility criteria for attending this
course exam format and the exam tips to
help you achieve this certification
lastly we'll look at the SS course
outline and the duration required for
each learning unit and details about the
quiz provided by simply learn at the end
of each learning unit so go ahead and
experience this course where the
objective of this introductory lesson is
to educate you on the courseware that
simply learn offers help you on how this
online course works ensure that you're
aware of all the topics and subtopics
covered in this course let's now move on
to recap on ITIL basics in the next
slide
ITIL is the most widely adopted approach
for IT Service Management in the world
it provides a practical no-nonsense
framework for identifying planning
delivering and supporting IT services to
the business adopting ITIL can offer
users a huge range of benefits that
include improved IT services reduced
costs improved customer satisfaction
through a more professional approach to
service delivery improved productivity
improved use of skills and experience
and improved delivery of third-party
service we will study more about ITIL
under the topic foundation basics at the
end of this lesson let us now understand
the iti o intermediate which is the next
level in ITIL simplification
ITIL 2011 intermediate-level
is the next level after ITIL foundation
ITIL intermediate-level has a modular
structure with each module focusing on
different aspects of ITIL they are
service lifecycle and service capability
the intermediate modules focuses more on
detail-oriented study than the
foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification well
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course I am sure
the thought on how one can become an
ITIL expert must have crossed your mind
let's get the answer to this in the next
slide let us have a brief look at the
ITIL certification path the diagram in
the slide is a graphical depiction of
the ITIL certification path ITIL
certification path is based on credit
point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage until expert ITIL foundation is
the first certification which gives you
two credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from the two streams one life cycle and
two capability the life cycle modules
have all the standard five life cycle
phases as exams which provides three
credits each capability modules are more
focused towards implementation content
and have four exams which provide four
credits each you can choose any one of
the modules from either streams or make
a combination on the basis of your
experience in the industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 point plus two
of foundation
that is 17 credit points makes you
eligible for third level that is ma LC
which provides you five credit points
once you are certified mal see your
final score credit becomes 22 to become
an ITIL expert there is no separate exam
you need to accumulate 22 credits to get
the ITIL expert certificate I'm sure we
are clear on the certification path let
us understand the service lifecycle and
its modules in the next slide
the service lifecycle modules are for
candidates who aspire to handle a
management or team lead role which
requires a broad management focus on
ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas the different modules and the
service lifecycle are one service
strategy SS to service design sd-3
service transition ST for service
operation so5 continual service
improvement CSI similarly let's
understand service capability in the
next slide service capability modules
are for the candidate who aspire to
specialize in process level knowledge in
one or more processes which focuses more
on day-to-day execution the different
modules and the service capability are
one service offerings and agreements SOA
to release control and validation RC v3
operations support and analysis OSA for
planning protection and optimization PPO
as we have an understanding of both the
streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide here is the difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you will see that life cycle is mainly
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also life cycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn more about the
differences on this slide once you're
done
move on to learn about mal C managing
across the lifecycle is the last step in
achieving the ITIL expert certification
therefore it is mainly focused on
individuals who want to become ITIL
experts on completing mal C an
individual can apply the ITIL knowledge
and it provides skills that can be used
in the workplace in a tangible way we
have already discussed on the credit
system in the certification path slide
however just to mention the mal C
certification gives you five credit
points now let us proceed to look at the
accreditation Institute for ITIL in the
next slide
the governing body for ITIL 2011
Foundation and intermediate is the
Cabinet Office UK simply learn is
accredited by APM G and tuv as an ITIL
foundation and intermediate training
provider also simply learn is an
accredited examination center AEC by APM
g tu V and X in to conduct these exams
so this has been our basic introduction
on ITIL let us now focus on the service
strategy course description and
objective in the coming slides the ITIL

be objective type with an explanation to
the right answer and each module will
consist of sample case studies and
sample test papers from a PMG apart from
these exercises a glossary for your
reference will be provided at the end of
this course please note to move from one
learning unit to another you need to
complete these quiz questions with the
right answers let us proceed to recap on
some of the definitions and terms used
in ITIL the next section is on
foundation basics well this section is
provided to help you refresh the
learnings from ITIL foundation here we
will discuss about service strategy
about service service management
functions and processes of service
strategy let us begin with what is ITIL
well to define in one line ITIL is a set
of publications for good practices in IT
Service Management
it provides a framework for the
governance of IT now this leads us to
ask the question why do we need ITIL as
ITIL focuses on descriptive guidance on
IT Service Management but easily adapted
and emphasizes quality management
approach standards as you have
understood by now the goal of ITIL is to
provide consistent comprehensive
hygienic set of best practice guidance
provide a platform for independent
discussion of processes in a common or
say easy language or in a standardized
vocabulary it focuses on the continual
measurement and improvement of the
quality of IT service delivered from
both a business and a customer
perspective ITIL acts as a flexible
framework which is adaptable to
different IT environments and also
complements other public frameworks let
us learn about the benefits of ITIL in
the next slide ITIL as a framework
benefits the organization in many ways
such as organization is benefited with
increased user and customer satisfaction
with IT services improved service
availability directly leading to
increased business profits and revenue
an organization can achieve better
financial savings from reduced rework
lost time improved resource management
and usage the organization has improved
time to market for new products and
services
and lastly improved decision-making and
optimized risk in the next slide we will
recap on ITIL Service lifecycle phases
in our last slide we understood the
benefits of ITIL this slide explains the
concepts of ITIL lifecycle ITIL has the
following components
the ITIL call best practice guidance
applicable to all types of organizations
who provide services to a business the
ITIL complementary guidance a
complementary set of publications with
guidance specific to industry sectors
organization types operating models and
technology architectures the ITIL call
consists of five publications as
depicted in the figure each publication
provides the guidance necessary for an
integrated approach as required by the
iso/iec 20000 standard specification
service strategy service design service
transition service operation continual
service improvement each publication
addresses capabilities having direct
impact on a service providers
performance the structure of the call is
in the form of a life cycle
it is ITER ative and multidimensional it
ensures organizations are set up to
leverage capabilities in one area for
learning and improvement in others the
ITIL core is expected to provide
structure stability and strength to
service management capabilities with
durable principles methods and tools
this serves to protect investments and
provide the necessary basis for
measurement learning and improvement the
guidance in ITIL can be adapted for use
in various business environment and
organizational strategies the ITIL
complementary guidance provides
flexibility to implement the call in a
diverse range of environment
in the previous slides we spoke about
ITIL as a framework for service
management thus to start with we need to
understand the basics of the concept of
service and value therefore let us
understand what is a service service is
defined as a means of delivering value
to customers by facilitating outcomes
customers want to achieve without the
ownership of specific costs and risks we
can refer to anything around us in this
universe as service let's take an
example of the room around you to take
anything in that room right from the
smallest item to the biggest now start
thinking about the item you choose and
see an item that you choose serves some
purpose to you and it has been provided
by a seller who manufactures this item
to fulfill the same purpose of yours
here the item you choose is your service
manufacturer is the service provider and
you who utilized the service is the
customer now what do we understand by
service management service management is
defined as a set of specialized
organizational capabilities for
providing value to customers in the form
of services in the next slide we will
understand the purpose of service
strategy in our last slide we understood
the concept of service and service
management this slide explains the
service strategy purpose the service
strategy volume provides guidance on how
to design develop and implement service
management not only as an organizational
capability but also as a strategic asset
guidance is provided on the principles
underpinning the practice of service
management that are useful the
developing service management policies
guidelines and processes across the ITIL
Service lifecycle service strategy
guidance is useful in the
of service design service transition
service operation and continual service
improvement organizations use the
guidance to set objectives and
expectations of performance towards
serving customers and market spaces and
to identify select and prioritize
opportunities survey strategy is about
ensuring that organizations are in a
position to handle the costs and risks
associated with their service portfolios
and are set up not just for operational
effectiveness but also for distinctive
performance decisions made with respect
to service strategy have far-reaching
consequences including those with
delayed effort service strategy sets out
guidance to all IT service providers and
their customers to help them operate and
thrive in the long term by building a
clear service strategy a fundamental
acknowledgement the customers do not buy
products they buy the satisfaction of
particular needs the services provided
must be perceived by the customer to
deliver sufficient value in the form of
outcomes that the customer wants to
achieve let us look at the key processes
of service strategy in the next slide
let us see what are the processes
covered under service strategy topics
covered in service strategy include the
development of markets internal and
external service assets service catalog
and implementation of strategy through
the service lifecycle strategy
management for IT services financial
management for IT services service
portfolio management demand management
and business relationship management are
among other major topics let us continue
to understand the basics of service
strategy in the next slide
organizations use the guidance to set
objectives and expectations of
performance towards serving customers
and market spaces and to identify select
and prioritize opportunities survey
strategy is about ensuring that
organizations are in a position to
handle the costs and risks associated
with their service portfolios and are
set up not just for operational
effectiveness but also for distinctive
performance decisions made with respect
to service strategy have far-reaching
consequences including those with
delayed effect we need to acquire a
precise understanding of what services
should be offered who the services
should be offered to how the internal
and external marketplaces for their
services should be developed how the
customers and stakeholders will perceive
and measure value and how this value
will be created how customers will make
service sourcing decisions with respect
to use of different types of service
providers how the allocation of
available resources will be tuned to
optimal effect across the portfolio of
services in the next slide we will look
at the four PS of service strategy what
are these please the four PS of strategy
our perspective position plan and
pattern let's look at each one
separately one perspective refers to the
distinctive vision and direction 2
position refers to the basis on which
the provider will compete 3 plan refers
to how the provider will achieve their
vision for pattern refers to the
fundamental way of doing things
distinctive patterns and decisions and
actions over time similarly
service value can be described in terms
of the combination of two components
service utility and service warranty in
the next slide we will learn about
competition and market space competition
and market space a market space is
defined by a set of business outcomes
which can be facilitated by a service
the opportunity to facilitate those
outcomes defines a market space the
following are examples of business
outcomes that can be the basis of one or
more market spaces sales teams are
productive with sales management system
on wireless computers ecommerce website
is linked to the warehouse management
system it is also important to
understand that every service provider
is subject to these forces all service
providers and customers operate in one
or more internal or external market
spaces essentials for service provider
dynamics of market spaces combination of
CSFs next let us learn about the
different types of service providers
service providers can be categorized as
internal/external or shared the critical
success factors CSFs of the strategy are
the identification measurement and
periodic review of CSFs to determine the
service assets required to successfully
implement the desired service strategy
and service management is taken as a
strategic asset we will be discussing
these service provider types in detail
in the later learning units now let us
proceed to understand service design
very briefly in the next few slides in
our last few slides we learnt the basics
of strategy this slide explains the
basics of service design let us start
with the purpose and objectives of
design the service design volume
provides guidance for the design and
development of services and service
management processes
it covers design principles and methods
for converting strategic objectives into
portfolios of services and service
assets the scope of service design is
not limited to new services it includes
the changes and improvements necessary
to increase or maintain value to
customers over the lifecycle of services
the continuity of services achievement
of service levels and conformance to
standards and regulations it guides
organizations on how to develop design
capabilities for service management
purpose of SD is that service design is
a stage within the overall service
lifecycle as an important element within
the business change process the service
design volume provides guidance for the
design and development of services and
service management processes
it covers design principles and methods
for converting strategic objectives into
portfolios of services
and service assets the primary
objectives of SD is to design services
to meet agreed business outcomes
identify and manage risks service design
also has to design secure and resilient
IT infrastructures environment
applications and data information
resources and capability design
measurement methods and metrics and
lastly SD is responsible to produce and
maintain plans processes policies
standards architectures frameworks and
documents to support the design of
quality IT solutions like SS has four PS
in its process service design also has
four PS let us discuss about them in the
next slide there are four PS of design
and they are one people this refers to
the people skills and competencies
involved in the provision of IT services
to products this refers to the
technology and the management systems
used in the delivery of IT services
three processes this refers to the
processes roles and activities involved
in the provision of IT services and for
partners which refers to the vendors
manufacturers and suppliers used to
assist and support IT service provision
this concept is explained in detail in
the design publication now it's time to
look at the key processes of SD
key processes involved in service design
our service catalog management service
level management capacity management
availability management IT SCM IT
service continuity management
information security management and
supplier management these processes are
described in detail in the design of
publication given here for the reference
let us proceed to look at the key
aspects of service design all these
principles are discussed in detail in
the design course here we are just
giving you a brief introduction of these
pointers the five individual aspects of
service design are new or changed
service solutions service management
systems and tools especially the service
portfolio technology architectures and
management systems processes roles and
capabilities measurement methods and
metrics the key principles involved in
service design are those which starts
with a set of business requirements and
ends with the development of a service
solution designed to meet documented
business requirements and to provide a
service design package SDP for handover
into service transition now let us
proceed to get introduced to service
transition in the next slide
in our last few slides we learned the
basics of service design this slide
explains the basics of service
transition ITIL service transition
provides guidance for development and
improvement of capabilities for
introducing new and changed services
into supporting environment it describes
how to transition an organization from
one state to another while controlling
risk and supporting organizational
knowledge for decision support it
ensures that the values identified in
the service strategy and encoded in
service design are effectively
transitioned so that they can be
realized in service operation the
purpose of service transition is to
deliver services that are required by
the business into operational use and
transition delivers by receiving the
service design package from the service
design stage and delivering into the
operational stage every necessary
element required for ongoing operation
and support of that service in the next
slide we'll discuss about the key
principles of service transition the key
principles of service transition is to
develop an understanding of all services
their utility and warranties service
transition is responsible for
establishing a formal policy and common
framework for implementation of all
required changes it also helps in
supporting knowledge transfer decision
support and reuse of processes systems
and other elements and anticipating and
managing course Corrections being
proactive and determining likely cause
correction requirements service
transition helps in assuring the
involvement of service transition and
service transition requirements
throughout the service lifecycle in the
next slide we look at the key processes
of ST
ITIL service transition describes best
practice in transition planning and
support change management service asset
and configuration management release and
deployment management service validation
and testing change evaluation and
knowledge management it provides
guidance on managing the complexity
related to changes to services and
service management processes preventing
undesired consequences while allowing
for innovation key processes of
transition are change management service
asset and configuration management
knowledge management and the processes
focused on service transition but not
exclusive to this stage our transition
planning and support release and
deployment management service validation
and testing evaluation moving on let us
look at the roles and responsibilities
of st in the next slide
key roles and responsibilities of
service transition are the staff
delivering service transition within an
organization must be organized for
effectiveness and efficiency though it
is not anticipated that a typical
organization will consider a separate
group of people for this role and also
there is a flow of experience and skills
meaning the same people may well be
involved in multiple lifecycle stages
service transition stage operational
activities involve managing
communications and commitment across IT
Service Management transition also
manages the organizational and
stakeholder change stakeholder
management organization of service
transition and key roles with this we
have covered details on service
transition from the next slide onwards
we will look at the details of service
operations let us learn about service
operations starting with the purpose
ITIL service operation describes best
practice for managing services in
supportive environments it includes
guidance on achieving effectiveness and
efficiency in the delivery and support
of services to ensure value for the
customer the users and the service
provider the purpose of service
operations is to deliver agreed levels
of service to users and customers and to
manage the applications technology and
infrastructure that support delivery of
the services let us move to the next
slide and learn about key functions and
processes of service operations the key
functions of s o involve the service
desk function technical management
function application management IT
operations management function other
topics and ITIL service operation
include event management
incident management request fulfillment
problem management and access management
processes as well as the Service Desk
technical management IT operations
management and application management
functions the key processes involved in
s o our event management process
incident management process request
fulfillment process problem management
process so far we discussed about the s
o purpose key functions and processes in
the next slide we will discuss about the
s o value to business service operations
is where the plans designs and
optimizations from other ITIL lifecycle
phases are executed and measured ideally
the service value is modeled in service
strategy the cost of service is designed
predicted and validated in service
design and service transition the
measures for optimization are identified
in continual service improvement phase
of the lifecycle and from a customer
viewpoint service operation is where the
actual value is seen now let us move to
learn about continual service
improvement CSI in the next slide
let us begin with the purpose of CSI
ITIL continual service improvement
provides guidance on creating and
maintaining value for customers through
better strategy design transition and
operation of services it combines
principles practices and methods from
quality management change management and
capability improvement purpose of CSI is
concerned with maintaining value for
customers it is also involved in
continual evaluation and improvement of
the quality of services and is
responsible for the overall maturity of
the ITSM service life cycle and
unprocessed like all other processes
discussed so far let's now discuss about
the key activities and roles and
responsibilities of CSI in the next
slide
ITIL continual service improvement
describes best practice for achieving
incremental and large-scale improvements
in service quality operational
efficiency and business continuity and
for ensuring that the service portfolio
continues to be aligned to business
needs guidance is provided for linking
improvement efforts and outcomes with
service strategy design transition and
operation the closed-loop feedback
system based on the plan do check act
pbca cycle is established feedback from
any stage of the service lifecycle can
be used to identify improvement
opportunities for any of the stage of
the lifecycle key processes and
