storage installed in a server or
external cabinet that is still connected
directly to the server das is the
storage that's essentially captive to a
particular server so the server doesn't
have to traverse a network to read and
write data das has been criticized as an
inefficient way to connect storage to a
server and as an obstacle to the data
protection process storage that is
locally attached can't be shared which
can lead to a situation where one server
runs out of this capacity while others
have plenty to spare without shared
storage there's no way to balance
capacity demands das complicates the
data protection process because each
server needs to be backed up
individually and the data must be copied
across the network alternatively each
server needs to have its own locally
attached tape device and backup
application which would add even more
complexity to the backup process
shared storage in the form of a storage
area network SI n or network attached
storage mas device was supposed to
address these issues and bus hasten the
extinction of das however das is still a
common method of attaching storage to a
server in fact it has become more
popular in recent years the AAS and acts
as storage within the server which means
it an acts as a hard disk within the
machine hence there is no need of
network search / read and write
operations the resurgence reached new
heights in the year 2013 when emc
corporation announced a pci express pcie
based solid-state storage product a
solid-state storage device is a data
storage device using integrated circuit
assemblies as memory to store data this
is designed to enable its networked
storage systems to store some data
locally on the server this server can be
set up on dedicated OS or on Windows OS
the type of setup is also used for EM
oakham mo cim refers to the media server
where media files like video audio or
image files are stored the setup can
only perform streaming and it is
incapable of performing and initiating
file downloads now let's move on to
discuss different access protocols in
the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
