financial risk manager frm part one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use applying CAPM to
performance measurement
welcome to the eighth lecture in the
preparation of frm part 1 exam until now
we have learned the various pricing
models to arrive at the security prices
at market equilibrium such as the
capital asset pricing model and the
arbitrage pricing Theory portfolio
managers use these theories to make
investment decisions it is important to
measure the performance of the manager
and her portfolio to check their
comparative performances width appears
in the industry
a gender we have several performance
measures for evaluating a portfolio
performance we will begin from measures
such as the Sharpe ratio and the trainer
ratio that normalize the portfolio risk
premium we will then learn about the
excess return measure or alpha and how
the managers controlled the variability
of this measure through another measure
called tracking error we will also study
about some risk based performance
measures like the morning star and var
based measures
channel measures the first performance
measure called the Train all measure is
used to normalize the risk premium or
the expected return over the risk-free
rate this is done by dividing the
premium with the beta of the portfolio
this implies that we now have the
premium that is independent of the
portfolio risk this means that we can
compare two portfolio's performances
even though they have different betas
this is important because some
portfolios may give higher excess return
but at the same time might have more
risk and higher beta therefore a train
or measure gives a better representation
of the performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
