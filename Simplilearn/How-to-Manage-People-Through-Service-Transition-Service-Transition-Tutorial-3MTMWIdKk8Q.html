people through service transition here
we will learn about managing
communications and commitment
stakeholder management and managing
organizational and stakeholder change
through service transition let us start
with the understanding of managing
people through service transitions
communication is central to any service
transition change process the greater
the change the greater the need for
clear communication about the reasons
and rationale behind it the benefits
expected the plans for its
implementation and its proposed effects
communications need to be targeted at
the right audience and clearly
communicate the messages and benefits
consistently if total honesty is not
possible admit this and explain why it
is not possible for example for security
reasons understanding people's
commitment is important before planning
the communications managing
communications and commitment one of the
major traditional weaknesses in service
transition has been the inability to
deliver sufficient prompt understanding
of the implications benefits and usage
of IT services organizational and
stakeholder change reflecting the
holistic nature of change that service
transition must be based on
organizations do not transform their IT
service by only changing the IT services
modern innovations means that the
organization itself will also inevitably
change to make use of the new and
changed services available stakeholder
management success of a change largely
depends on the involvement of
stakeholders it is necessary to identify
all stakeholders as some potentially
impacted are aware of proposed changes
unable to register the concerns and
wishes the support is lost if not
included let us now move on to the next
slide
in our last slide we understood the
concept of managing people through
service transition process this slide
talks about the managing communications
and commitment in service transition in
detail communications during service
transition typically many people are
affected by a service change and
consequently sufficient stakeholder
buy-in is required to carry the
transition forward successfully it is
important to establish an individual
stage within the emotional cycle to
understand the method of approach the
important activities are stakeholder
analysis staff managing ST understand
impact to others too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
