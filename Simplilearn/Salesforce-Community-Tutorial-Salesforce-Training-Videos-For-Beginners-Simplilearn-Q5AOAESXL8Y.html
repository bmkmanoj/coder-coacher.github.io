relationship manager of nutri Worldwide
Inc I came to you for a suggestion sure
how can I help we have a sector which is
dedicated to customer service
consequently maintaining a healthy
customer relation is crucial lately we
are finding it increasingly difficult to
keep the customers updated regularly
this is making customer collaboration
more and more difficult our IT marketing
and sales team have already implemented
Salesforce so I wonder if the time has
come for our team also to start using
Salesforce
I think implementing Salesforce and
training your team on it will be a
brilliant idea
collaborating with customers can be a
daunting task using social media sites
such as Twitter and Facebook can cause
public exposure problems which are best
kept confidential yes that is what I was
going to say next
using social media has proved to be
disastrous so that's one path I'm
reluctant to take in such cases you
should seriously consider Salesforce
communities it offers companies the
ability to collaborate in a controlled
and a secure environment the ability to
create groups can help organizations to
discuss problems post articles and share
information faster than ever the
community can be further branded and
customized using visualforce in the site
studio to match the look and feel of the
company's website communities also offer
flexible login packages such as named
user and pool logins which can help save
money over conventional portals built
using other platforms awesome let's
understand more about salesforce
communities creating a new community
remember the following points the first
step in creating a community is checking
to see if your organization has
communities licenses go to company
profile and click on company information
before you start setting up your
community it is best to make a plan
decide whether the target audience is
customers or partners and if the
community content will be
or private estimate the size of your
community to determine license
requirements
so now we're in Salesforce in the setup
area so I clicked on setup and then over
on the left hand side scroll down to
communities didn't clicked on all
communities then when I scroll up I can
click the new community button on this
page I'm going to be asked to choose a
template so there are different
templates for different use cases the
most basic template is this one here the
Salesforce tabs plus visualforce
there are others such as the KOA the
pili and Kokua templates for
demonstration purposes I'm just going to
choose a Salesforce tabs plus
visualforce so now I'm going to name it
I'm going to call this the customer
community and click on create community
once the community has been created
you'll see the success message here so
now you can click on the go to community
management button so now you're at the
customer community administration page
the next step will discuss is adding
members remember the following key
points when adding members members are
added to the community by using profiles
and permission sets you can remove or
grant access for groups of users all
users assigned to a profile or
permission set will become members
you can also grant access to a subset of
the profile you can also enforce a
membership policy click all communities
and manage to add members select the
user profiles you want to add to remove
a profile select it and click remove so
what these steps talk about is enabling
access to the community through the
different profiles in Salesforce
communities users are sort of a strange
area of Salesforce where there are
contact but they're also a user and they
have access to the community as part of
that very special process you need to
enable the different profiles that are
going to have access to the community so
let's go into Salesforce and see this
firsthand
so here I'm logged into Salesforce and
I'm looking at a contact record now
let's say that I want to give Jane Smith
access to my community
I've created a contact record for her so
now I click manage external user and
click on enable customer user once I've
done this I can start filling out the
the different fields for the specific
user for example email username and
nickname are all required fields just as
a new user would be for the internal use
of Salesforce over here on the
right-hand side you'll need to choose
the correct license type now I have a
lot of license types enabled in this
Salesforce org because it's for
demonstration purposes however yours
most likely will say customer community
so at this point you can click customer
community and then choose the customer
community user once you've done that you
can simply click Save and the user will
receive an email notifying them that a
new user has been created on their
behalf the next topic we'll discuss is
community preferences
keep in mind the following key points
when accessing emails preferences and
pages you can change the email sender
information chatter email and templates
can be customized for your community you
can perform customizations in the user
interface or the network object click
all communities click manage click
administration and emails enter custom
values for the email senders is name and
address to replace the default values
customize the display in the chatter
email footer select send a welcome email
to be sent to users when they are added
to the community and you can also
customize any default templates so let's
look at these preferences in Salesforce
now I'm over here in the community set
up and you can see I've clicked on
preferences now I have the ability to
enable nickname display I can also allow
login access to the community without a
username and password so allow access
without a login I can also enable
private messages so this gives users the
ability to send messages back and forth
I can also choose whether or not that I
want to use custom visual force error
pages and I can choose to see all
settings and community management
now down here we also have the option to
let users flag different content so if
there's a conversation that's
inappropriate for example members can
flag that for moderation we also have
the ability to turn on or turn off
reputation levels as well as enable
knowledgeable people on topics we also
have the ability here to limit the
maximum file size that's going to be
uploaded to the community we can also
restrict specific file types for example
perhaps we don't want pictures being
uploaded to the community but we do want
to allow PDFs so we can simply put in
the PDF extension there and Salesforce
will enforce that restriction hi there
