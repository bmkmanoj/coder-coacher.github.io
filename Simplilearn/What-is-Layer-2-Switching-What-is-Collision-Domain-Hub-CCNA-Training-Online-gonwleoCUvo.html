and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
managing Cisco devices this lesson
focuses on layer 2 switching let us
begin with the objectives of the lesson
in the next slide by the end of this
lesson you will be able to explain the
aspects of collision and broadcast
domains explain switch management
configure and verify port security let
us start with collision domains a
collision domain is a network segment
where devices share the bandwidth a hub
is a layer 1 device this means it does
not use any addressing logic a hub
broadcasts all frames it sends all
frames to all devices it is attached to
all the frames sent to a device attached
to a hub are received by all devices
attached to the hub the receiving device
checks of the frame is addressed to its
MAC address if it is not the device
discards it all the links attached to a
hub form one collision domain the
topology on the right circles the
collision domains you can see that the
hub and all the devices attached to it
are in one collision domain in contrast
the connection between the switch and
the router is in its own collision
domain in the next slide let us focus on
collision domain switch each router
interface is any different subnet this
is the same as a broadcast domain each
layer 3 multi-layer switch VLAN also
defines a broadcast domain any layer 3
entity bounds a broadcast domain note in
the topology how the router interfaces
divide the network into more broadcast
domains basically a broadcast domain is
a subnet as a result there is a
broadcast address in each subnet in the
following slide let us discuss the
considerations for collision and
broadcast domains a switch normally does
not have an on or off switch to turn it
on you need to connect the power cord to
an electrical socket
the power
self-tests post runs if it is successful
the system LED turns green and if not
the system LED turns amber once powered
up use the mode button normally located
on the left front of the switch to
successively look through the status of
the various ports when an interface is
physically connected to another device
the interface light turns on becomes
amber and if successful becomes green if
two switches are linked power up time is
fifty seconds the time it takes for STP
to converge a switch normally needs no
configuration to operate as a layer 2
device in the next slide
let us discuss switch management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
