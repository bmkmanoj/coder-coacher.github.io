and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
security this lesson focuses on network
address translation let us begin with
the objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain the concept of net
describe the types of NAT addresses
configure verify and troubleshoot NAT
why is address translation needed at all
let us understand this in the next slide
NAT requires more processing resources
per packet the device that performs NAT
must have additional processing power
and memory to minimize any delay that
could be caused by NAT NAT hides the IP
address of the device that originates
data this is an advantage when hiding an
address from someone outside the land it
provides better security however it also
is a disadvantage for a network
administrator the lack of traceability
makes it harder to troubleshoot some
applications rely on end-to-end
traceability to work properly
configuring tunneling for example in a
virtual private network VPN is more
complex with net let us discuss the
device is used for NAT processing cisco
offers a line of firewalls called
adaptive security appliances that can be
performed on these appliances cisco
routers can also perform NAT normally
the device that performs NAT is directly
connected to the Internet service
provider ISP in the next slide let us
understand different types of NAT
addresses there are 4 different types of
addresses in net inside local inside
global outside local and outside global
the terms local or global refer to the
current location of the packet the terms
inside or outside refer to the location
of the device an inside local address is
a private address referencing an inside
device it is the address of the inside
host as seen from inside
you'll and this is most likely a request
for comments RFC 1918 address an inside
global address is a public address
referencing an inside device it is the
address of the inside host as seen from
the internet for example this could be a
valid public internet routable address
that the inside host is given when it
exits the NAT router in the next slide
let us discuss NAT address types for
outside devices an outside local address
is a private address referencing an
outside device it is the address of the
outside host as seen from inside your
land an example is the internet routable
IP address assigned to a host that
resides on the internet an outside
global address is a public address
referencing an outside device it is the
address of the outside host as seen from
the internet in the next slide
let us discuss types of NAT addresses
