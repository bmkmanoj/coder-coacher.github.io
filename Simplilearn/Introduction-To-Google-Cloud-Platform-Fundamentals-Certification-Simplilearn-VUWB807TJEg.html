platform fundamentals course offered by
simply learn this is lesson 1
introducing Google cloud platform in
this lesson we're going to take a look
at the very underpinnings of the Google
cloud platform what is today about today
is an introduction to the Google cloud
platform and you may be coming from
another cloud platform or you may be
just curious about what is cloud and in
particular what is Google's offering of
the cloud and this that is what this
course is all about the the course will
cover a lot of material in terms of
breadth and we will not go into a lot of
detail on the particular items that's
reserved for some other courses so my
objective for you is to explain what the
terms are and what the abstractions are
and then we'll have some labs where you
can do some additional exploring and get
a feel for things so you're going to
hear about the different parts of the
cloud and you'll experiment with some of
them in some labs what I have discovered
and I've worked in various clouds is
that even the terminology is not settled
so one particular vendor may use a word
in a certain way and another vendor may
use it in a different way so one of the
things I hope that you will leave with
is an understanding of what Google means
when they say particular things for
example platform as a service or
infrastructure as a service now we're
going to take a brief look at the
overview of the Google cloud platform
this will include a brief tour of the
hardware underpinnings names that they
give to the various abstractions
including things like what does it mean
for a resource to be global what does it
mean for a resource to be regional and
what is zonal mean
these abstractions live on top of the
hardware level and it's important to
understand that there is a distinct
difference between the two
you
so why choose a cloud platform to begin
with well it's one of the things that
Google's have mentioned recently in a
presentation they said that if you look
at the cost of a computer if you look it
over it's for your life that the
majority of the cost is energy and
Google is very very focused on making
their data centers very energy efficient
and they've invested a lot in security
in extremely high speed networking and
I'm convinced that companies and
specially small companies just can't
match that investment so there is a
broad movement to the cloud people are
realizing that it's going to be better
to rent instead of buy computers and if
you look at the Google cloud platform
they've had years and years of
experience building out a cloud platform
for their search for their Gmail for
their very you know YouTube for their
various offerings and they decided a
while ago that they wanted to make this
available to all of us so they're
offering this so that we can build and
test and deploy applications on their
platform that scale just as the Google
application scale computing solution
there is no one ideal way of storing
information so Google offers a lot of
choices several choices in computing
their choices and storage their options
for big data one of the things that
Google is really leading on now is
machine learning so by opening this up
we can work on this highly scaled global
compute infrastructure and build our own
applications that run alongside of
googles apps and as you know Google is
in the business for a long time so
they've had all that time to perfect
their technology
so so there's a couple of words here
that I want to define so that we're all
clear a data center is a facility it's a
building or multiple buildings that have
their own power substations they have
high security there's perimeter fencing
there's all sorts of codes that you have
to use to get inside then very very few
people actually ever get inside a data
center it's highly secure and this is
where all the computers are this is
where the networking is this is where
you know the the low-level compute power
of the cloud is is residing they have
different data centers and they're
opening many more we'll talk about that
a little bit later another really
critical thing about the Google
infrastructure is they have an very well
designed very well-thought-out
networking underneath all of this they
have a global meshed redundant
fiber-optic network that spans the globe
and I don't know you may have noticed in
the in the news recently that they
announced a connection with Asia new one
that they've just put the fibre down so
they're actively building new
connections a point of presence is the
edge of Google and the rest of the
internet so if you're have a computer
and you need to have packets go to
Google
they'll transit from your computer
through the internet and they'll hit a
point of presence and that's where your
packets your connection will get on the
Google Fiber and find its way into the
data center and they have over 110 edge
points of presence now in 33 countries
just a little while ago it was I think
80 so they're expanding those quite
aggressively and if you look at
information flowing out from the data
centers to you or your clients there's
edge caching so these are also residing
right at the edge of the Google Fiber
and they will cache the your information
to make it faster interaction with your
customers and we'll talk about caching a
bit more when we look at some of the
particulars of the compute
infrastructure
this is actually one of the more
important slides of the whole session
this is the first one where we're going
above the physical so it when physical
we talked about actual computers data
centers the fiber cables the switches
the network cables and so on we're going
to leave those behind and now we're
going to raise our self in terms of
abstractions and the three terms that
are crucial are global regional and
zonal so these are essentially the
lowest level of idea that we're going to
be working with so let's start with zone
and a zone is roughly equivalent to a
data center and zones are where you have
your compute power you have your disks
and so on in terms of designing a system
F especially for a high availability
system you need to consider that a zone
could fail so it's best to have compute
power in multiple zones and balance the
request a caught across them and and
we'll talk about that particular detail
later the important thing to know is
that some resources in the cloud are
anchored in a zone for example a compute
engine instance is a zonal resource the
next abstraction is region and a region
is a geographic area and it may it will
contain multiple zones and an example of
a resource that's regional is a network
load balancer so you can set up a
network load balancer and then it will
send the request to different zones and
it will be aware of the health of all
the computers so if one does fail it
will stop sending requests there and
will send it to other computers in
different zones and the third concept is
global so there are some resources that
are global that span all the different
regions for example when you create a
network it is a global resource so your
compute engines in a zone will connect
to a network which is global and
essentially they can talk to any other
computer connect to that global network
so you can easily configure a system
where everything appears to be on a
local area network but in fact it's a
global network so and that points out
another thing that's kind of important
about moving to the cloud is some of the
things that you
based on your experience with a real
world you know I say the real world a
physical world of computers and so on
some of those ideas you're going to need
to leave behind because it's different
some things are quite different when you
get into the cloud and I'll be sure to
point those out as we as we work through
these these slides so again let's look
at cloud regions and zones and global
zonal resources operate in a single zone
an example again as a compute engine
instance and its associated disks a
regional resources are in a geographic
area for example US central or Asia or
Europe and a region will have multiple
zones and then global is spanning the
whole planet so you may want to have a
single IP address for your web
application that would be a global
resource and Google provides load
balancers across regions and you can
have regional load balancers that
balance things across zones Google is
really working hard to pioneer
efficiency and performance in their data
centers they as I said that they have
determined that the majority of the cost
of computing is energy so they are
focused very very diligently on reducing
the cost they've been carbon neutral
since 2007 they're investing heavily in
wind and solar and they have been
they're pioneering efficiency so there
are a really good engineering company
that's one of the things that you need
to keep in mind as you learn about the
various parts of the Google cloud
platform they're good engineers they're
very proud of their engineering and they
do incredible jobs with what they're
focused on recently they've applied
artificial intelligence to optimize each
data center for energy use so they will
measure ambient temperature and other
factors and adjust all the parameters
for a particular data center so it has
it consumes the least amount of energy
possible there's also a trend that we're
very very aware of and that is that the
price of computing is constantly going
down and Google is very focused also on
passing the savings along to us and
they've come up with several ways of
monetizing the say
one is sub our billing so the idea here
is that if you ask for a computer I'll
give you a specific example you can ask
for a 32 core 208 gigabyte computer and
run it for only 20 minutes you know they
don't round up to the next hour and the
cost for renting a computer of that size
for 20 minutes maybe you're checking out
some code maybe you've got a caching
algorithm or something like that you
want to test well that will cost you
about 50 cents so it's really really
economical to use for experimentation
and getting things set up and the soul
and so on on the other side once you get
your software stable and you're ready to
deploy it Google has what's called a
sustained use discount so as you use the
computing infrastructure throughout the
month they will give you an increasing
discount that basically it goes up to
about 25% so they're rewarding not just
a temporary use but they're also
rewarding sustained use there's another
feature they came out with which is
custom machine type so you can dial in
exactly the amount of CPU power and
memory that you need for your
application and we're hearing reports
that that will save customers about ten
or fifteen percent and the fourth
innovation they've come up with is
what's called preemptable instances so
these are this is like scavenging the
for free essentially an unused compute
power so if you build a system that
anticipates a computer going down and
your software can understand that and
reschedule it on another computer you
literally can save 50% the price is half
of the same machine in non preemptable
mode so again there's four ways that
they are currently providing they're
passing on the savings that they're
finding from declining prices of
computers google has made numerous
contributions to cloud computing in fact
they've been pioneers of cloud computing
since the very beginning all of their
major products including search
apps YouTube and other features like
that run on it our own cloud computing
infrastructure they've been running
containers for years and now they want
to provide that understanding that
intellectual property and the ability to
scale applications to Google scale to us
you
Google's well they're focused on
and what they have learned is that it's
it's to their benefit and it's to the
industry's benefit to make things open
and as they have designed innovative
technologies to support their own
infrastructure they have released
technical papers describing what they've
done so they've had names like Dremel
and Colossus and things like that and
once they've published these papers the
open-source community has noted them has
read them and frequently will implement
the ideas as an open-source product and
the Google has really taken note of that
and in fact they are releasing a lot of
their new innovations completely
open-source a notable example that we'll
look at later is something called
kubernetes so they've they've learned
how to run containers very efficiently
on their infrastructure and they decided
to rebuild all of that add some new
intellectual property and release that
as a open source project that we can all
join we can all use open source
licensing again that follows with not
just kubernetes but a lot of the
low-level libraries for connecting to
the Google cloud platform they release
those open source and again it helps
everyone it helps Google and moves the
industry forward the publication's I've
mentioned already for example you can
look on papers on how they've built
their their low-level data stores
what Dremel is about Dremel is about
high efficiency querying of data and
because of this interoperability and the
fact that they've released things
open-source we can now think about even
building things across multiple
platforms multiple cloud providers so
again kubernetes is the open source
container management software that
Google's released Google has a product
called container engine that uses
kubernetes and add some special Google
features
you can run kubernetes on your own
machine you could run it on Amazon you
can run it on OpenStack you could run it
on digitalocean you can run it anywhere
and so by doing that Google is opening
up the interest of the whole industry
about containers and Google's gamble I
mean it is a gamble they're releasing
their key intellectual property they
believe that they will be able to
provide the best platform the best
product for running containers and by
reducing the risk to all of us by having
kubernetes be open source
everybody wins and Google will be in a
good position Google is not standing
still and this slide is meant to show
you a bit of where their vision is going
so the first wave we've had is was
colocation and I literally on my desk
have a computer that I sent to a
colocation place a long time ago and
I've since requested it back so
colocation is where you either send your
equipment and it's located in a managed
environment or you rent computers that
are in a managed environment and you can
imagine your computer sitting in Iraq
and you can connect to it and the
advantages that you've got that vendors
security and you've got their power and
so on the next wave that happened is
virtualization so here we're getting
into virtual machines and we're starting
to get the virtualization of various
parts and this is essentially where we
are right now we're right at the end of
the second wave and we're moving into
the third and the third is a completely
global elastic cloud and once we move
here we'll will not worry about virtual
machines we'll just ask for a bit of
compute power and we'll get it you know
and we'll probably get it very very
quickly so we'll be able to scale up
we'll be able to scale down and we'll be
able to match the compute resources that
we consume to match the the needs of our
software as requests go up and the
requests go down the fact that you can
have a computing environment that tracks
with your usage is is actually it's it's
more significant than you might think
and from a technical
effective it has huge benefits from a
business perspective that just think
about how you have to in the old days
you'd have to invest in a large number
of servers if you had a startup company
and get your software ready get it all
hosted and you'd have to size your
servers to nth to the anticipated peak
load and if you don't get the peak load
then you're basically wasting your
investment but when you have an elastic
cloud and you use compute resources as
you need them
you're only going to pay for those so
from a business perspective you don't
have the initial investment the huge
upfront cost you can just have things
track with your usage and it turns out
to be a much much easier environment to
manage okay in terms of definitions this
is another one of those slides that's
significant in terms of decision and
kind of defining what is infrastructure
as a service and what is P platform as a
service these are both completely valid
things to be using and you can even use
them at the same time but they're
different philosophically so on the
infrastructure is a service side the
main offering from Google is called
compute engine and this is where you
have raw compute power storage
networking and so on and it's the
closest analog to what we're used to you
know in our physical world so if you
think about a machine a computer that
you've got and maybe you're building it
yourself or you're ordering the parts or
you order the complete computer in the
computer is the motherboard is the chip
is the RAM are the disks and so on and
so compute engine and infrastructure as
a service is the cloud equivalent of
that so you literally can go and say hey
I want a particular computer I want to
have this much memory in it and all
we're doing is going to a web page and
clicking options and we are building an
abstract computer this way and because
we're essentially taking things off the
shelf we're saying okay I want a
particular disk
the size nobody else can use it it's
ours we I want to CPU with so much power
it's our CPU and nobody else can use it
we're taking it off the shelf
essentially so the fair thing to do is
for Google to charge you for what you've
requested and so that's the pay for what
you allocate even if you don't
completely utilize it you can build a
computer and they'll charge you per hour
or actually per minute for all the
resources that you've requested
platform-as-a-service is a different
philosophy here you are supplying your
business logic and Google is taking care
of a lot more of the details they'll
give you runtimes it's a kind of a
sandbox environment and they will scale
things for you automatically so the fair
thing to do is to charge you for the
resources you use at that moment so if
you need a hundred app engines to
support your your request or if you need
just one Google will scale that up and
down and you'll only pay for the amount
of compute power and resources that
you're using minute by minute okay so
across the whole cloud platform these
are the major categories there's compute
power there's storage there's a bunch of
products focused on Big Data and the new
innovation area and where Google is
working very very hard as machine
learning and we'll learn about that near
the end of the course okay so talking
about compute here we've even got three
options so we've got App Engine we've
got container engine and we have compute
engine App Engine is the most
constrained environment you do not have
much flexibility in terms of what you
can do but the benefit is by
constraining your application to only
the business logic you really only write
the business logic Google takes the
responsibility for everything else
making sure the software is updated
patching scaling taking care of all the
infrastructure again on the far right
side this is the infrastructure as a
service you're going to be building your
computers you need to worry about how
big they need to be and do the scaling
and so on but Google still takes care of
a lot of things
they will actually move a virtual
machine to a different bit of hardware
as it's running in case they need to do
maintenance so there still is a huge
benefit even at this level of you know
defining computers to have it run in the
cloud container engine is kind of in the
middle it's a level above virtual
machines a container engine is all about
very lightweight docker containers
coming to life very quickly or scaling
up or scaling down so again there's no
one ideal choice and also in storage you
can see the same thing there's no one
ideal choice for storage we've got big
table we've got cloud storage that we're
going to look at in detail we're going
to look at cloud SQL a relational
database and cloud datastore a very
unique data mechanism that scales
alongside of App Engine on the Big Data
side and again these are all completely
managed services there's bigquery it's
extremely high performance fast SQL
language data processing system it's
great at reading log files and giving
you an idea of what's going on in your
application it's great at processing all
sorts of information and it will even
ingest information as it's occurring so
you can think of Internet of Things
devices sending information to bigquery
and you can be doing near real-time
analysis of all that data pub/sub is a
very simple idea it's about sending
messages to people who are interested in
what you're saying and it's Google scale
it'll take you know million or messages
per second and it's also a great
decoupling tool in terms of architecture
data flow is very innovative this is
essentially generation 2 of MapReduce
I'm told that people at Google don't
actually use MapReduce anymore they all
use data flow and data flow incorporates
the idea of MapReduce plus a lot of
other things and again we're going to
have some detailed slides on all of
these coming up data proc is essentially
Hadoop managed by Google the value add
by Google is a consent a cluster up in
90 seconds and it can resize it as your
work
load is going so it minimizes your cost
and it's designed to be compatible with
Hadoop processing outside of the cloud
or in other clouds so you can just bring
your Hadoop processing running on data
proc and you take advantage of the
Google platform data lab is a notebook
like presentation of big information so
you can have it execute queries you can
do graphics you can put it into a
notebook like format and then give it to
someone who wants to understand the
results of all this processing and the
machine learning side this is really I
think this is particularly exciting
we've made some major advances in
machine learning you probably know that
google has a machine learning system
that beat the world's expert in the
go-go game and what you do is you build
up a set of definitions in machine
learning and then train the system to do
a particular task so Google has done the
training already in some areas they have
a vision API that can recognize things
in a picture it can tell like if your
pet is a cat or a dog which is pretty
interesting there's general machine
learning so you can build your own
models they designed a speech model so
that it can recognize speech and there's
another model for translation between
languages so you can build your own
models or you can take some of these
existing ones and incorporate them in
your application
ok so now we're going to have a lab this
first lab is going to guide you through
the steps to set up a relationship with
Google Cloud you're going to set up an
account and you're going to create a
project projects are the container for
everything that you do in the cloud so
these will take you through the steps
you're going to need to have a credit
card and the credit card is not so that
you're going to be paying for things
it's for you so that Google knows your
identity it wants to know exactly who
you are and then once you do that you
will select an option for a free trial
and upgrade your account you're going to
get $300 of credit this good for 60 days
so the course that you're taking now
probably will use maybe two
I surprised if you more use more than
five dollars of that 300 so at the end
you're going to have a nice account
you'll have money left and you'll be
able to do a lot of experimentation in
the cloud so I'm going to bring up
another
window here
and I'm going to go to my console
okay go to this little icon in the upper
left hand corner with the three
horizontal lines if you click on that
that pops out a tray the different areas
of the cloud and what I suggest is you
go to billing and you should see that
you've got a billing account see here
billing management for CP 300 there's
it's linked to an account called
Randolph Cael your account your billing
account will be named something else
and you can then manage billing accounts
you can see that there's a billing
account the account ID that it's active
and here it says I've got nine projects
associated with that and I can say my
projects and see exactly what they're
connected to so again I'm already in a
relationship with Google so I had I
don't see exactly what you're seeing but
see if you can go through those areas
and see if it's if it's active and so on
is it necessary to write down the credit
card you need to enter the credit card
yes the credit card is required by
Google not so they can charge your
credit card but it's used for
identification and what you do is you
enter your credit card you set up like
you say yes please build me that means
create a billing account but then you
immediately say I will accept the free
trial you get three hundred dollars of
credit which is good for sixty days if
at the end of 60 days and or when you've
used up to three hundred dollars your
credit card will be charged so do
understand that so you may want to turn
things off we'll talk about that how you
can make sure that you're not going to
get charged the easiest way is simply to
delete your project you can just go in
and say I need this whole project
deleted and then there's nothing active
so you will not be charged okay
activating the cloud shell let's take a
look at that I'm going to go to my home
area on my screen and the cloud shell
there will bring here is this icon right
here so you notice in the upper right
hand corner there's a little picture of
me that identifies the account the
relationship with Google so that's me
with a particular account I actually
have about five accounts with Google so
I use this little photo to remind me
which one it is and if you go to the
left you'll see this little icon that's
the cloud shell so let me pick CP 100
class let me switch over to that and
then I'm going to click
oh that's interesting the cloud chill is
not working
okay they
made a major change the user interface
yesterday in fact this doubt down used
to be over on the right and I'm not sure
what is going on I'm going to go off
mute and see if I can figure it out
first let me explain what's going on the
cloud platform is comprised of many
different services each of which has an
API structure so that you can access it
in fact everything is communicated
through a REST API and they don't turn
on all of the api's when you create your
project and you first set up set up a
relationship because they they just want
to save the the compute power to set up
credentials and so on so I'm guessing
the thing that you need to do is to go
up here and click on this icon and bring
the tray out and then go down to compute
engine and click on that and what you
should see then is not what I have it
what you know I see create an instance
you will probably see please wait
we're setting up the compute engine API
and so once you do that they would
Google will set up the infrastructure
they'll set up the credentials they'll
set up a bunch of things like that so I
notice that once I did that notice my
cloud shell is now open that's what's
happened they've made a they've reset
some things so you need to go into the
compute engine area just by going into
that area should turn on the activation
of the API it should turn on the
creation of credentials and then it'll
give you the cloud shell that I'm now
running that you can see in the window
so they'll please try that and let me
know if that works
and I also want to add do not get
concerned about the amount of time we're
spending on this this is an absolutely
crucial lab this obviously gets everyone
set up to run all the other labs so we
will take as much time as required to
make sure that everybody's up and
running you have the accounts properly
set up and so on and we'll work through
the details with you
all right so the last thing you should
be doing is creating a project
we're just creating a project called CP
100 I'm showing you on the screen that's
the last step of this lab this lab is
overview and then introduction and then
register for the free trial which is 5
steps and then create a project which
ends with the third with step 3
on the final slide let me go bring up a
console and show you so you should be
here there should be a drop down right
here notice that first of all there's
the the icon that brings the tray out
and then I have some of these pinned I
can tell it to tell you about those
later but right here I've got a project
and if you click on that it says create
