virtualization technology offered by
VMware namely VMware ESXi 5 hypervisor
the other name for this hypervisor is
vmware vsphere hypervisor it is a
production-ready hypervisor that allows
the virtualization of servers helps in
saving time and money spent on managing
the IT infrastructure built on the
world's smallest and most robust
architecture VMware vSphere esxi the
vsphere hypervisor sets the industry
standard for reliability performance and
ecosystem support it helps in
consolidating the applications on to
fewer servers and as a result start
saving money through reduced hardware
power cooling and administration costs
running multiple virtual machines on a
single physical machine lowers the
capital expenditures by reducing the
hardware power and cooling costs vmware
esxi hypervisor is OS independent with a
thin architecture and has an install
footprint of only 144 mb offering
unparalleled security and reliability
most hypervisors on the market rely on
the general-purpose operating system to
perform core virtualization tasks this
means that their virtual machines are
only as reliable as the general-purpose
operating system vsphere hypervisor
installs directly on the physical server
and has no reliance on a general-purpose
operating system this bare metal
architecture allows avoiding of the
security hardening user access control
anti-virus tasks and patching associated
with a typical operating system what
does that mean
up to 10 times fewer patches a
ninety-five percent reduced disk
footprint and a significant reduction in
management overhead vmware esxi
hypervisor is supported by the vSphere
client a graphical user interface
included in the vsphere hypervisor
download which means the BMS can be
created and provisioned easily and
within minutes vmware esxi hypervisor
can overcommit memory resources and can
perform page sharing and compression to
optimize performance of memory resources
vmware esxi hypervisor supports the m FS
file system this file system is a
featureless one which is perfect by
handling a virtual machine in a local or
shared storage vmware esxi hypervisor
supports thin provisioning of BM disks
which means the storage resources can be
over allocated beyond the actual
capacity of the physical storage by
allowing the oversubscription of
capacity to the virtual machines thin
provisioning eliminates the need to
dedicate full capacity upfront let us
continue our discussion on vmware ESX
i-5 hypervisor in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
