about the concerns with regard to
hypervisor architecture this includes VM
guest hardening hypervisor security into
VM attacks and blindspots
performance concerns operational
complexities instant on gaps VM
encryption data commingling VM data
destruction VM image tempering and in
motion virtual machines then we will
discuss the recommendations that will
help enterprises for virtualization
related security issues
in the next slide we will discuss the
concerns related to hypervisor
architecture
the recommendations are as mentioned
below first customers should have a
clear understanding of the type of
virtualization offered by their
providers next both consumer and
provider should have clearly defined
responsibilities in the SLA then
implementers should have clear
separation of zones such as production
environment test or development
environments and highly sensitive data
environment care should be taken to keep
them separate also explore the
possibility of creating separate zones
depending on the usage
next recommendation is that
virtualization aware servers and
security tools should be implemented
also implementers should monitor
performance during implementation of VM
security tools and testing virtualized
operating system should have built-in
security this is another recommendation
third party security technology should
be added which will act as a layered
security control this reduces the
dependency on the platform provider
according to the next recommendation
dormant VM images should be encrypted
use automation tools to discover any
data traffic which might step into
unsecured environments implementers need
to ensure that the security controls
external to the VM are also in place to
protect the administrative interfaces
this final recommendation sums up the
recommendations for enterprises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
