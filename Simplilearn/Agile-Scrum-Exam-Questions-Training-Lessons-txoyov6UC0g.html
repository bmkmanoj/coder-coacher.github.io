fall scrum ceremonies
welcome to lesson fall or simply learns
agile scrum training program in this
lesson we shall talk about the various
ceremonies and rituals that are
associated with scrum proper
understanding of the reason behind the
ceremonies expected outcomes and ways to
conduct will help us get the most out of
the methodology let us first look into
the agenda in the next slide
agenda let us now look at the detailed
agenda for this lesson which we'll start
off by looking at the principle of time
boxing time boxing is a key theme in the
scrum guide scrum operates on the
principle of time boxing and preserving
the sanity of the time box is critical
to the success of scrum one of these
time boxes is the Sprint
in other words iteration we understand
what is meant by the Sprint what the
ideal duration of a sprint is and how
you work within the Sprint then we look
at the daily scrum or daily stand-up
meeting which is one of the most well
known rituals of scrum at the end of the
Sprint there are two rituals viz the
sprint review and the Sprint
retrospective both of these are very
important for the oddly closure of the
Sprint firstly we get introduced with
time boxing time boxing as the name
suggests time boxing involves limiting
the amount of time you devote to any
particular activity it could be a
meeting a fixed duration of doing
development or test activity or
practically anything
the thing about time boxing is that the
time available is limited and this limit
is sacré cent you can adjust the other
parameters how much you get done which
items you prioritize etc but the
deadline cannot move scrum relies
heavily on the principle of time boxing
or the projects iterations meetings and
ceremonies must be time boxed and the
time limits must be respected this is a
very important and non negotiable aspect
of scrum let's continue with time boxing
in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
