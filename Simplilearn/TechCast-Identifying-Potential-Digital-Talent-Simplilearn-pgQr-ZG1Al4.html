great to meet you today welcome aboard
and thank you for joining us okay you
know a nice
you know people joining it every minute
that is passing so but we start because
we have a time constraint so let me talk
about I need to lay the context folks I
mean it's important to understand in
what context we are updated while all of
you are reading every day in the
newspapers some of you are experiencing
it if you are walking and some of you
are listening if you are in colleges or
universities or at listen to people or
webinars in the past or on the
television media yet I think I want to
really give a context which is very very
important for us to understand because
to say what talent and digital EDA I
think it is
important to understand what's happening
around us and folks business is
transforming and top starts coming at a
staggering pace and exponential search
in change has been there you know in in
change in the last few years
you can call it the effect of Moore's
law when it comes to transformation and
those of you are not familiar with most
or I guess everybody would be please
look up into the Google and check out
what it is
she can lay the context we are into the
next what is called age right and this
is the information age this is a where
the raw material is information in the
previous ages for example in the Dutch
village it was our enough of the raw
material and in the agriculture a
Depot's languages
so this is a big piece
and what will happen to us the next 20
years
is what in 1919 we saw internet was and
the next 20 years what we will see it is
robotics here I picked that up and they
are going to impact and help create many
many companies across the globe
however the competitiveness of economies
across the globe or the organization's
etc we really depend on the attendant
readiness and we would talk about it so
what you see on the screen is just
I don't say a picture to depicts the
change that has taken place what walls
we are moving that looked like many
years ago
the automobile today which is all about
autonomous cars driverless cars and
that's what it shows and we I thought
wanted YouTube or as the bottom part of
the picture actually is a picture from
my company which is IBM on the left-hand
side you see the electronic wave machine
on the right hand side is a reflection
of the cognitive technologies that we
are leveraging and the cognitive era you
know in the information era you know and
we're reading that space so there's a
big shift who had automobiles earlier
you are going to have Auto means which
is different
you had electronic wave machines earlier
to start with but now it's a completely
different game when you're talking about
parking key technologies so what does
this mean what does this mean for all of
us what does it mean to us as talent
there was a study done by PwC last year
which found that about 40% of the jobs
could be automated with current
technology by 2030
what are those current technologies it's
all about cloud analytics security
mobile social and Internet of Things
we are changing how we create how we
collaborate how we engage how we really
analyze right all that is changing
friends the future is well upon us
technology
however it will have a huge dependence
on the capacity of absorption of that
technology
and the biggest bottleneck is
human-beings you and me the biggest
bottleneck would be the country and
their societies which is formed a who
would me it could well be the government
we don't create an ecosystem or a equal
structure to support such need of
deployment
and you can say that well it's fine if
you are learning no it's it's okay well
it's not okay it's not okay because
other economies will move much faster
the countries where you have greater
learning countries where the ecosystem
by the government and other societies
creates to hence is deployed so jobs
will go there so you and me have a
responsibility the responsibility of
retraining ourselves responsibility of
learning what will really work in this
new meter
the NASSCOM study last year indicated
that from 10% investment in digital
technologies by 2025 the companies will
invest in 60% into the digital
technologies a big shift is going to
happen so it's on your way
they also said but 216 million jobs will
be linked list or augmented by
technology and a massive rescaling will
be needed massively spilling of 405
million people currently employed
actually the latest figure I was reading
somewhere was maybe as big as nine nine
million
so what does this all mean what is
happening around us what's happening to
the company
the enterprise for the future is going
to be hungry for change
they will have to look at innovative
ways with wool of offering the horses it
built both beyond custom imagination
focuses almost anything that is
available that you want but there is
also the market that is to be created
and these companies will create those
markets these companies will become
globally integrated course technology
will enable that to happen
they will be distracted by nature not
with all their destructive in other
forms was they using technology in a
destructive way which will generate a
different kind of business and of course
there will be general not so generous so
on the right-hand side of this chart you
see the kind of things the kind of
investments that are going to happen in
a new business models that are likely to
come up anticipation institute of
business random studies at IBM Cox this
is a huge huge transformation that is
taking place and it is going to be all
about automation it is going to be a
more about it it is going to be about AI
is going to be bought in English in big
data
and by the way automation is nothing new
and we have seen better jobs airline
ticketing or travel agents are literally
going away but now with robotics is
going to impact many more roles and so
in the service sector so those of you
who are in service sector or planning to
be in service sector you need to know
a little bit about automation because
you know I'm gonna take you to what
skills are needed etcetera etcetera but
we really need to understand for
automation and this is not just about
reduction in labor costs
you know it could lead to more improved
reliability raise the quality better
safety many other games and if it is
based on machine learning
which techniques that is leads to deeper
learning and improvement in the process
of that platform that having so
compelling because it keeps learning and
allows you to sort of develop more you
know the nagas and keep developing more
data and more because continue to become
more intelligent
and then that big data is being used to
provide certain insights and those
insights are leading to new businesses
right so the new world is going to have
data being leveraged in this information
age
but folks don't get unduly worried
because you know industries will find a
way to use this talent right for example
The Associated Press where all the bots
were deployed for content writing and
for auditing editing etc they put their
people into looking at financial reports
right in fact all these technologies are
going to help the human performance
but yet there will be challenges that
one
you will have to leave kill yourself
Simmons for example that will employ
people on the floor they employ people
who monitor operations and programs of
the machining program the machine a
different skill set is needed
uber as an example you know in the world
before uber every 25 to 30 drivers would
have one manager
but now you know thousand uber drivers
need one manager so they will be impact
which is going to happen and the
driverless cars coming up I do not know
what's going to happen to the driver you
know in the next 5-10 years but folks
let me tell you rather that cartel I
mean only drivers booked taking only
driving jobs going away but I think it's
all about design thinking where should
the airbags be they should be passenger
be sitting right what should be the
seating configurations where what should
be the different controls that need to
be there and so on and so forth
Automation is going to lead to new
workflows new wave of engaging and this
will require something new from talent
right and if you look at this chart that
has come up this really talks about what
global exective see right traditional
any change that will get impacted nobody
vectors field boundaries between
industries are blurring right global
CEOs rate that ecosystem the importance
of ecosystem is very high so with
automation with AI you know what's going
to happen is the workflows will change
and what does that mean for all of us as
talent
organizations are going to look for
people
have a mindset
you learn a mindset which can adapt to
the changing culture in the organization
so let me now talk about some of the
routines right let me talk a little bit
about skin
you go to the next to see what it is
happening so in this world which is
transforming
the organizations I'm going to look for
folks will be focused on skill
we'll be leveraging cognitive
technologies which is the a is you can
call it will be focused on social
platforms we'll start looking at how to
leverage you know in an agile way in how
they recruit or bring talent in the HR
in those companies are going to really
look at in a very different way housing
but definitely look at analytics right
they're going to look at what kind of
people succeed with them from what
backgrounds people succeed right Evan
talked about how better the new
employees were able to leverage digital
learning right they're going to talk
they are also going to talk about a good
experience that they would like to get
but Feng
velocity of change is massive right and
we will have to keep pace with it
so
skill is going to become the new
currency
they will be abundant availability of
low and medium skill
the other is usual in in short supply
therefore it's important to understand
what industry is going to look forward
to and then put ourselves to that so let
me share with you now the new collar
skills for the new collar jobs that are
going to happen right there is going to
be a requirement for people to do
problem solving they will have to have a
mindset into the design mindset so if
you want to get cars which are driving
less then you need to see how the whole
car is to be redesigned
right because if a car you need 10,000
moving parts it may need very few now
you need to know have a aptitude and
skill to make sense out of information
and data that comes your way you will
have to use creative thinking you need
to be cognitive flexibility which means
ability to change learn new things you
have to have cross functional
competences and by the way this is an
information that has been provided in
but it was published in force and
identified in the World Economic Forum
this is what will be needed for future
do you have it that I think is a very
very important thing but a few things
that will remain constant always and
that is ethics and you are being able to
work within the legal frameworks it will
be your integrity the core values for
what you stand for whether they are in
things with the new organizations that
are underway
another important skill that is going to
be very important is networking
networking through social platforms
because much of the learning is going to
happen not only to platforms like simply
learn but also to large communities
right and you know communities are going
to teach each other and if you're not
networked socially you are going to have
challenge
what will be needed is the learning
aptitude
how much can you absorb what is your
velocity Atlanta these are the things in
the digital era that the organization's
will look for in the talent coming their
way and they will find ways and means of
assessing this using various tools that
are there and we'll talk a little bit
more about it you know as we move
forward but let me get you to another
chart and this is an outcome of a study
that IBM did and then it says there
already this skill gap
students are unprepared to succeed in
today's workforce why students I think
from experience people also need to
really upscale themselves
one thing was every little pain and that
is the 75% of the students actually has
no sufficient practical experience so
folks you know going forward in the
years to come
it is not deflection is not going to be
based on what you tell the reflection
would also be based on working show
right so therefore you will find at
least in the technology space hackathons
coming in a big way
and in many other ways on how you can
show your knowledge and your skills so
what are the charges
most important requirement for success
in the workforce is going to be ability
to analyze problem and draw possible
solutions so you will be provided
opportunities a problem statement and
you will be required to look at how you
analyze that problem and how do you
really come up with solutions because
this is really what is needed in the
workplace
if you move to the second bullet it
talks about ability to collaborate
effectively and welcome things
in this world of today it is not about
excellent it is about collective
intelligence
it is about ability to work with
different sets of people who come
together to solve a problem and perhaps
go back into their various functions and
the next time you're walking in the next
team right for example collaboration of
working with machines right and that's
the that's also something which is going
to be required in the next 10 years to
come
the tortise that comes up here is
ability to communicate effectively in
business context it is not just about
talking effectively in English
communication that is important but it
is talking in a way that it makes
business sense or communicating in a way
that makes business sense or messaging
in a way that makes business sense so
it's going to be communication in the
business context
and finally it is willingness to be
flexible agile and adaptable to change
remember the previous chart right the
previous chart talked about these
cross-cultural competency and cognitive
flexibility so the cognitive flexibility
is about willingness to be flexible a
joy and adaptable to change so this is
going to be another very very important
piece you know that will be looked at by
the new age companies when they're
cooking talent
so you know what does this mean
it means that the organization's are
going to war and industries the merger
as technologies and industries can merge
organizations are going to look at a
talent market in a very different way
they may not go in for just because you
have those hard skills but they will
look at people who have those skills the
learning aptitude the problem-solving
the business context the agility so
people will try to capture new fish
from newborns so it may not be the same
set of people coming in for employed
and once they are in they will have to
assimilate when a fish is taken from one
pond and put into another some fish
survive some fish die depends on the
quality of fish as well as the on
enabling environment which is there
cause the companies will always be
mindful of the fact that there are
people out to forge talent because new
skills are against small we need many
many more thousands and billions of
people acquiring new skills of skill
that I mentioned right there is another
part of the heart hills it's about data
scientists
it's about in the area of security
robbery
I see yes but who uses experience design
and we talked about domains which are
really going to grow it's going to be
payments within the information special
riichi business analysts healthcare
specialists when an economist write a
different set of people and they do talk
about the social area you will need
people with strong communication skills
people who are good in social learning
content developers content strategists
digital marketing community managers
collaboration all this will be very very
important that will be needed and as
this is happening completely new set of
industries this will also shape up in
the next few years to come and this is
going to be the industry in the area of
robotics advanced life sciences
codification of money cybersecurity top
border and big data right
folks remember with advances in data
analytics and machine learning
the robot arming program to do
intelligent work they will step into the
service industry in a big way the
venture capital funding in robotics is
on a steep increase and that really
tells you what is coming your way so let
me move more to the next chart and this
one I don't want to go through the whole
piece I want you to focus on largely on
the right hand side right which is about
you know the skinny it will become a new
currency and the organization design
will change how people get rewarded how
does it get fixed all is going to change
we talked about skills already this is
reference to focus on skill and we
talked about to be skills which are
going to be required so there will be
growth area skills there are declining
and the skills which will be on the
stable level right saver level skill
right which will sustain and scale your
compensations and everything are going
to be based on that
performance management systems are going
to put on different there's no one
breaking is going to strum how do you
really work in a team how do you
collaborate how do you learn how do you
change lot of other pieces are going to
be looked at when there is a performance
I know that's going to happen right and
there will be lot of interacting
workspaces which is where we're a
collective intelligence is coming into
full play
but while all this is happening right
you know the organization's will be also
really focused on improving the employee
experience improving the experience of a
candidate who's coming it you know and
and this and the organization's
themselves will have to have a growth
mindset the managers need to have a
growth mindset
so let me time it take you to another
piece and then I'll open it up for
question and answers right all I want to
tell you is that the organizations that
we move on are going to really bring in
the visual sciences
the processes right which is the which
is the sizes
chronology and the whole platform when
they're looking at people it's all got
going to be data behavioral sciences and
technology the three pieces will step in
to start selecting talents
when I say we have all sizes what kind
of people will succeed and he already
saw some of the future skills that we
are talking about when we talk about
data then the cognitive platforms on
which people will be assessed a lot of
information in this sock I just met the
other day you know a possum who's
working on a Watson platform and and and
he is planning to look at what students
are writing all over the place and make
out what their personality is going to
be and made that as an offering to the
organization so that's for leveraging
data on the student or for that matter
any professional so the hiring is going
to become extremely smart and the
workforce which will be required the
only smart workforce so with this I
think we are you know at half an hour
which is you know 8:30 p.m. in India
time 30 minutes after we started but you
know this is what I've done is you know
this is the chart that talks for all the
custom grazing we can do but you know
what technology comes in how that is
going to be leveraged what new business
model is going to be brought about what
skills that will be needed this may
still change but if you have the
velocity to absorb you know to learn you
then you will be successful so when this
I would like to stop and open it up for
questions so Richard are you the one
who's going to who's capturing the
questions and who will raise the
questions
yes I am apologized and had to go find
my unmute button no and and again thank
you for being here I'm excited to be
here too just for my own not just we're
doing the moderation in the back we have
a lot of questions coming in and I'm
going to group a number of them together
because they are very similar and they
deal with trying to understand where do
you how do you get the sufficient
practical knowledge for these very
unquantifiable ideals like flexibility
agile adaptable and we have it just
across just about every just about every
dimension of business we have somebody
we have persons' it's seeing who wants
to know about this as far as
cross-cultural skills we have the
thunderous on up I said that right who
comes from and you go down here celsa so
see relevant digital landscape required
to be relevant and self sustained
another gentleman from who's taking
classes in big data and science and our
which is my favorite I love the big data
and the science and the data analysis
across all these fields how do we go out
there and get these sufficient practical
knowledge and how do we grade ourselves
so I know that I am flexible and agile
and adaptable into the marketplace
without actually being in the
marketplace right now or in having where
do we get that from
at least I can talk about you know my
organization we have just you know
initiated what as follows you know
global remote mentoring Isis from
distance mentoring where we put projects
and people can go to that platform and
try to do the project sentiment in mint
and they had mentioned by an idml right
and I'm sure other organizations are
also trying to do that so go ahead
search for it and there is a great
opportunity that you will find some
projects to a variety of projects that's
that's an important piece and I think
when we talk about you know flexibility
try to get out of your comfort zone and
look at any particular and this is how
we'd work up your mind right which is
there look for more experiences of
different kinds right take a different
set of experiences right go ahead and if
you are an engineer why don't you take
up at an audit if that's what they call
it you know some special classes maybe
in finance and I think industry has to
really work with the academia to provide
these opportunities to students within
their universities and colleges where
they can sit through different sessions
right by paying additional small fee so
then they get various experiences I mean
that's the way I would say you have to
get it and the other is open your mind
read/write you can't be with a closed
mind and you know they can somebody come
and make me flexible you know make me
more agile no no you have to challenge
yourself to do two things right so it's
all about you your mindset and how you
want to go about it seem to create a map
in your mind how you want to get from
experiences so that's what I will say
and in the organizations we provide
those experiences to people like I've
found actually surprisingly there are
many people who you know or at least in
the past and says changing would not
move from one project to another because
they have to Leela so they will
comfortable in their one area right
although you don't want to move into a
different technology because no this is
what I did is what I was per ticket to
do and some of them would run into a
problem going forward so I think be open
be flexible to learn meet more order to
organize programs because if the
contingency folks let me give you an
example you know how to ask you a
question how much do you spend on your
eating
I don't think you will be able to warm
to that question how much in a day then
you spend on your eating because you
really don't keep back on that right ah
similarly learning is like that you have
to keep investing in yourself you need
to survive in the new world you have to
learn to survive right so I think that's
very important so that's my message you
want this one question are open too long
but that's that that's what I will
commit
Oh excellent that's wonderful and I know
for myself anything I read and keeping
up on all the new stuff you talked about
velocity earlier is always a challenge
especially in the data world
III say especially in the dating world
but I think it's true of just about any
of the of the businesses out there
there's quite a velocity of change going
on
could you we have a number of people who
come in as either the term newbies so
they're very new in the market they're
young and just starting their careers
out or we have people who've started
down one path they realize it's really
not what they want and they wanted to
get a quick turn and try something
completely different
what would you suggest to these people
who are new into the workforce I know we
have a number of people of s
specifically about digital marketing and
also about data analytics in the group
there's about four or five that I've
seen in there but just in general and
maybe even some specifics on those a
couple of those two careers big data in
specifically for people new or who are
taking a very drastic career change in
stopping what they're doing now you know
we a lot of people who might be like
they might be doing IT support or
general support and now they want to get
into something a little bit more
interesting or they're just completely
new to the workforce they have no idea
what they're gonna jump into I mean it's
pretty I know
dealing with my own kids they're pretty
well trying to figure out what they're
gonna do with their lives they wanted
but you know when you talk digital
marketing let me tell you that I am NOT
an expert in marketing this is also
about how you are leveraging
data right with the help of technologies
to provide insight to your let us call
it to your client right and also how you
reach out to the potential consumer by
understanding where does the consumer go
and how does the consumer absorb
information right so this will marketing
is not about just taken T so it is about
you know understanding how data flows
how people learn a way to spend their
time so I think be ready if you think is
just about putting your credit
definitely in every area needed but this
is what digital marketing requiring and
if you are a big data person I think you
are in a very very sweet spot because
you will be needed anyway you know going
forward in the in in future right
because that could you know leverage
that you know it can be used in many
areas like you know if it's 50 adopting
use for machine learning or big data
pink roll into insights which is then if
it's on a comminuted platform then you
have a completely different game plan so
I think you have enough and more
opportunities for these set of
professions but these are all growth
areas they don't have to worry and I'm
sure that you get a mentor wherever they
go otherwise they should look for a
mentor outside somebody's in this area
working in any company spend time with
them ask questions that's how they want
flint nice continuing on because you've
mentioned mentoring earlier and then
just now can you describe a little bit
like different mentoring programs and
how people can find those you know in
their community obviously it's going to
be very different from whatever
community you're in but there's you know
the company life we have mentoring and
then there's large organizations I
notice you're part of some of those
organizations and then there's like this
personal community could you speak a
little bit on the mentoring programs and
what those look like you know really you
know also for example where people can
get into the on to those platforms as
they can get
you know mended by a very hot spot
depending on where you are I think there
is one thing follows Kidz hub which is
there you know you can get on to this we
have the wealth per box where the get on
to it and again when they're student or
outsiders and they get on to use the IBM
technologies when they are enabled and
their mind tells it so I'm sure others
well you know I think when you start
looking for it they will flow your way I
mean I can just often remember these
which I am sharing but if you go online
find many communities and within those
communities they can be out of mention
that happens
you
mmm excellent and then and that's that
is really a wonderful perspective
finding the different mentoring programs
this go ahead and continue on with
education I have some people who are in
the educational industry wondering how
all this new technology impacts the
educational industry what is more
valuable going in for a traditional
college and getting your masters or your
your bachelor's or coming in and doing
more certifications or some combination
thereof maybe could it speak a little
bit on how education nowadays affects
the bottom line getting a job some of
these people are looking to improve
their work or get their first job into
the tech industry or into a new industry
right so very very clearly I think you
need to acquire skill and if subluxation
helps you hone your skills please go
ahead and do some initial education I
will also go to the extent of saying go
ahead and get certifications and get
some small experiences and you know and
get it one organization experience and
you can go for your education because
education prepares for a much you know I
would say for a much longer period as
the world is transforming those
problem-solving skills or whether it is
to do with business communications
already it is got to do with you know
flexibility design thinking approaches
so not only in phase can come down to
project them to being in the educational
institutions but on the other hand there
are certification which in prepare you
put in for a job which will help you
they have practical dimensions today to
prepare you with skills so both are
important but
if I look at the employability of our
engineering director a final shock from
a technology perspective I think that is
not so good almost only just 20 to 25
percent of the people are employed by
those who are coming out of the colleges
right so they will do better that if
they start taking some certification
courses along with it because we find
that colleges and some universities are
just not being able to keep pace with
the what's happening around well this
may change in five years seven years and
I think it should change and it will
make some change
then the meanwhile presentations will
play a role as long as they also have
you know enough I would say walk you
know where they do something rather than
just reading so there is there is an
application important so that is there
please go ahead and take certification
it will help you quite a bit
we call that an IBM open badges right so
we have open badges your certification
push them onto your LinkedIn profile put
them onto the social profiles you will
find people come in your way of
searching for it for you for their
organization
especially considering that some of the
tier 2 TSP apologies may not have the
best of tea kettle tea or are not having
the greatest content sometimes these
certifications can make a big difference
you know and they can add to what you
are learning I see they're definitely in
my own career because I my college
career was at 92 boys been that long
since I got out of college so we're
talking about a lot of people are here
looking for careers and employability
and you've talked we definitely covered
a huge amount of information just a
quick note from the simply learn side we
do record these sessions so that at the
end of the session if you didn't get
your question answered they will try to
answer them via email and also you can
request a copy or a link to the session
recordings you can go back and review it
later there's a lot of information we do
cover in these sessions maybe you can
access a little bit on the company level
in middle management we have a question
that came in what are the recommended
skills in digital landscape required to
be relevant and self sustained and then
there was a note of course - they added
an example of AI automation blockchain
cloud big data is there any like one of
those that stands out or is there how do
we navigate those to these new
technologies coming up you know the
career that we need to
so where is blockchain in use right
blockchain is we use and other financial
sector in various areas if you decide to
move into any of those area you know
then you need to look at those
something like the manager or something
what do you say oh that was very
specific to the individual I guess he's
in middle management or she I think it
was that he bear in the middle of
management so there's there's always
that fear of being downsized
I certainly have gone through that in my
career you know wind ruins the next
layoffs when are things gonna happen
when when are things gonna change how do
I keep myself up in the company so that
I keep my job I know you talked a little
bit about being entrenched and certainly
that's one of the dangers of this is
what I can do
that's all I can do I'm not gonna learn
something new but maybe a little bit
more expand on that how they can keep
themselves motivated to address the
massive change how do I keep myself
motivated right do I need a motivation
to eat right you know that's a pet thing
I picked up right you know maybe it's
hunger it comes from within you don't
need somebody to come and lt you need to
eat
if you throw somebody enough in an
antenna in in scene wizard he or she
tried to survive or will he or she says
forget it I'm in the scene or let me
just go down right
I think what I'm trying to permit
we will have to take actions and
activities we just can't say we're not
we daren't wait for somebody else to
come and motivate us right
it's about intrinsic motivation the
survival instinct and believe me and you
respect so I think some of the jobs will
be under threat now if they are good in
the track we need to find out where is
appropriate you need to talk to people
who say what is the cool thing
fine I don't want to be manager right
but I want to kill the digital marketing
or you know you want to be an economist
so in anyway you won't change your area
from your management path then your one
new skills
possibly in tomorrow so folks get out of
your comfort zone right I think that is
the key piece do not look for external
motivation right it has to be intrinsic
it is survival right those of you who
are you know read the book that iceberg
is melting
I mean that's exactly what it is you
have the penguin everybody that is
melting what they don't get
it's only neither start getting melting
and they don't get fish to do the
running around for it right I don't
remember eyes this book many many years
is over five six years or so or maybe
more than that so
don't need motivation it has to be
intrinsic you don't need to be in your
comfort zone you don't need to be a
manager you can acquire that's what I
would have to say or as a manager
acquire new skills so that is any
manager than you right here so that's
what you need
excellent excellent we have time for
just a couple more questions here and
I'm really enjoying these questions I've
tried not to I'm not trying not to take
over and ask my own questions I'm trying
to keep to their questions from a
company's perspective how can
organizations work on retaining existing
talent and provide training to enhance
the skills of the existing workforce so
if you're running a company or you're in
charge or the HR what can you do to keep
your talent in there and keep them
moving so that they're growing in the
direction the company needs them yeah I
think you know it's a long subject but
let me tell you I think the
organization's responsibility is to
provide an enabling environment right to
provide tools
you know in which people can English you
know which help them to continue to
upskill
into the new area the responsibility
will have to be that of the employee the
individual the person the company has to
own his or her career but an
organization has to so to give you an
example right we have a we have an
internal social platform called
connections it has over 18,000
communities working people are helping
each other we provided we made a bit of
of that platform right so that people
can learn from each other people can
contribute in meaningful activities for
example we have an instrument of
positive platform I won't say the
cognitive learning platform you know
learn where we have learning flowing it
from 30 different sources and some of
them will get created by our own you
know a learning specialist which from
the way and you know from being a
cognitive company right starts offering
you right you are alone and micro you
know learning literature you learn
through interaction on chat so my point
is that organizations need to create an
enabling environment and twice them
provide with two means at workplace
which help people learn and instead
learning it will remain relevant that's
important the other things I think the
organization needs to do is be trusted
and then watcing are needed in future
and what Locke like and get that message
across to people right so I think that's
an important so we for example recently
found for anyone's call you know a
campaign on courier conversations where
we are asking people to go to your
manager right let that not only the
managers responsibility to continue both
of your managers seek an employment and
have a career service
as to what's killing right there or
future what you eat whether the
organization way what when need to do so
I think those are the kinda stuff that
organizations need to do when this much
more I'm sure but just in a bleep day
this is what I will admit and this is
what we should be
mmm excellent um I have a question from
Preity she I hope I said that correctly
and I'm going to add a little bit to it
the question that they asked is we are
told that we need to get specific
country experience we have to start from
scratch why is that
I've noticed that you definitely you
know worked with Africa India Asia
you've been all over the place can you
talk a little bit about the experience
that transfers from one country to
another when you're doing your work and
as you know both from the your side and
from the employees I do have to migrate
from country to country and deal with
different cultures and different
communication and maybe even
specifically what is what do you have to
bring from scratch when you go to a new
country what can you carry over in your
knowledge is a challenging right now
right every country wants to control the
immigration right unless it really needs
those skills they would not prefer
anything than to comment so that's one
challenge that all of us have to go with
an open mind saying I need not
necessarily get an experience of being
physically present in a company and you
know delivering out there or working out
yes you may but you know the
opportunities are shrinking or are
becoming more challenging to take
there are many other ways in which you
get down to learn the culture so for
example we have a very strong platform
you know before a person is going to go
into different country he or she will
get triggered right to go through and
understand what that culture is how the
network right and then of course once
again you wish there and there are
communities which help you sort of
assimilate into it I think it's very
important to understand the cultures
cultures you also understand when you
visit the country right even if you're
not working there you visit for projects
and stuff like that
ah questions listen our problem is
sometimes we don't listen so there are
enough and more than phenyl available on
the I mean companies need to make them
available but they are also available on
various sites I do not know whether paid
or unpaid but there are there is more
information to understand the cultures
of you know various countries so that is
how you really acquire that's what I
would go I search for information full
step into the country no you know what
really works there what doesn't even
work there I have actually found people
who are not very sensitive to different
culture that don't get it
become unsuccessful in those countries
right I'll give you an example I think
we hear from India sometimes we become
extra argumentative on addition we don't
have listening skills we don't give a
deep listening and you know we don't say
no to anything out listening so many of
us fall into this trap of arming and
being because we come from a very very
competitive environment right we have
completed in school competed in with our
sibling more than many of them for
certain things we have competed in
college we have competed to get a job so
we are competing they are always in that
more to complete we need to get into
collaborative more and you see many
things changing so
learn about the country cultures read
about it there are models that are
available goes with look for friends who
have already been there
search for information about the country
before you register
mm-hmm excellent yeah argumentative
that's in listening listening skills
some of the best advice I was ever given
that does draw us towards the end of the
session we're not gonna really have any
time to answer any more questions today
we will be answering questions via email
we missed your question we'll try to get
to all those again you can request a
copy of the link for the session
recording I don't know if they
automatically send it out on this one
but I do know if you don't see it you
can go under our support simply learn
calm and just mention the name of the
webinar in the tech cast and let them
know that you want a copy of that so
that you can have that for your viewing
again special thanks dpsing for joining
us today I really enjoyed it and I wish
you a wonderful day as we close out I
don't know if you have any last-minute
closing words before we say goodbye to
our audience you know I wish I could
thank you this was a good set of
questions every question helps me
reflect and think back and see if I have
something new to be able to attend to
those questions that come my way so
thank you for that opportunity and I
really appreciate all right thank you
and happy learning everybody I look
forward to seeing people in our
classrooms who are in there and we will
see you in our next tech cast or webinar
