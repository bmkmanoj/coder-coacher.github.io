closure the Six Sigma approach can be
applied to all problems but do all
problems need Six Sigma approach one of
the first things you need to check
before deciding on a prospective Six
Sigma project is the prerequisites and
qualifications of a Six Sigma project
qualification criteria for a Six Sigma
project demag level 1 selection is there
a process existing is there a problem in
the process is the problem measurable
does the problem impact customer
satisfaction there's working on the
problem impact profits of the company
remember this is the level 1 check or
the first check you do to know if a
project qualifies for a Six Sigma
project
after checking prerequisites of a
project to be called a Six Sigma project
the team should check if it really
qualifies to be called a Six Sigma
project qualifications of a Six Sigma
project a gap between the desired
customer expectation and actual process
performance the root cause of the
problem must be unknown the solution to
the problem must not be visible or
apparent
note that for problems where solutions
can be found by logical reasoning 8 the
approach of problem solving needs to be
applied example of this if you wish to
fix a leakage in the water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
