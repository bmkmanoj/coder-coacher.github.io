joining us for this webinar with
Randolph Carl Google cloud
certifications and their relevance now
the Google platform have the Google
cloud platform has provided a full range
of scalable secure and cost-effective
services running out of Google's modern
data centers and connected by Google's
super high-speed worldwide network this
webinar is a brief introduction to the
Google cloud platform and the importance
of certifications in GCP products now if
you're not familiar with Randolph let's
take care of that right now he is a
partner at data bliss LLC he is an
authorized Google instructor who is
certified on many GCP products including
App Engine compute engine cloud storage
cloud sequel and bigquery he is also the
co-author of a number of the new Google
training courses here at simply learned
he was previously the director of
marketing at 1060 Research and has a
long career working with well-known
brands like Microsoft Hewlett Packard
and GTE Sylvania to name a few so here's
going to be laying down more than just a
little bit of wisdom here for you folks
and we're super happy to have him on
board before we start though I want to
make sure that everybody is familiar
with their dashboards and that you're
hearing us okay so take a look at your
dashboard you should see a questions
module that's a place for you to be able
to type questions for the rest of us
here on the admin side to see and
respond to so go ahead and test that
module if you will just type in there
and say hello to Randolph let him know
that you're excited that he's here and
that you're looking forward to learning
a few new things and that way I will
also know that you all are hearing me
just fine my microphone is working and
I'm not just speaking into the void here
so go ahead and type in hello for me if
you could let me know that you're all
onboard all right whew thank you for
joining us hello he says hello that's
great a few other folks on there saying
hi so good to know that you're able to
hear us okay here's how this
gonna work Randolph is gonna be giving
his presentation over the next 30
minutes or so and after that we'll move
into a Q&amp;amp;A so during the presentation if
you have any questions this question
module that you're using will be your
best friend go ahead and type your
questions in there and send them through
we don't take them real time Randolph
will finish his presentation and then
we'll loop back around and do a complete
Q&amp;amp;A at the end of the session and do our
best to get to as many of you as we
possibly can if you are interested in
sharing what you're learning if you hear
some nugget of wisdom you want to make
your friends jealous and make them wish
that they were here to you go ahead and
share it out on your social platforms
you can use the hashtag SL webinars if
you like I think that's all you need to
hear from me you know how to use your
dashboards you know why you're here you
in here to hear Randolph not me so
without further ado please return your
seats and your tray tables to a full and
upright position observe the no-smoking
sign and remember no flash photography
Randolph my friend I'm gonna turn things
over to you it's all yours great thank
you very much and hi to everyone
I'm pleased to be here to spend a little
bit of time with you and appreciate your
being here your attendance and your time
and your attention what I want to talk
about today is what's going on in terms
of the cloud in general and the Google
cloud platform I think one of the things
that's kind of interesting is that we're
in a point of transition and it's an
opportunity whenever there's change
there's a there's an opportunity for you
to take advantage of the changes and
align yourself with a change and and it
take advantage for your career and also
just if you're interested just your own
education about what's going on so the
cloud platform itself the thing that's
that's really interesting and I've seen
quite a few transitions I've been in the
industry for a while and at HP I was
pushing the relational database
technology and then at Microsoft I was
working on sequel server so that was a
wave of change when people are adopting
relational databases and in other waves
that have come as such as Java
you know there a lot of people that got
on board really early and they they took
advantage of it became experts and known
in the industry well there's a new one
coming which is cloud computing and the
thing that's interesting about this it's
really about economics it is about
technology but the reason that companies
are moving to cloud computing is
fundamentally economics and you know in
a you know I'd say in 10 years we'll
have a conversation and we'll say do you
remember when we used to buy computers
instead of rent them and it's it's a
broad-based change and it's happening
right now the the cost advantages of
renting are kind of interesting if
Google made a presentation recently and
they said that over the four-year life
of the computing equipment that's the
kind of the lifespan that they they
consider the major cost of computing is
energy not the RAM not the dis not the
CPU but its energy and they're very very
focused on energy efficient operations
of all their data centers they have
their new machine learning technology
optimizing each data center in each
geographic location so they're
monitoring ambient temperatures they're
monitoring all sorts of things to make
sure that each data center is optimized
for energy efficiency and if you think
about all the technology and all the
resources that are they're putting into
that it's almost impossible for a
corporation especially a small company
to match that so if they're focusing on
that kind of efficiency and cost savings
it's going to be impossible to buy
computers and have them run as
cost-effectively as Google and so you're
gonna get see that there's going to be
point when it's obvious that you're
going to be much much better off renting
or rather than buying and that's just
the beginning of it because there's also
the question of do you buy enough
capacity to make sure that the people
are coming to your application get the
response time they need and that usually
can be an over allocation of resources
you have to buy tons and tons of servers
and a better idea is to do spot
purchasing of compute power so you rent
exactly what you need when you need it
so companies are looking at this and
they're realizing you know
it's not the technology it's the
economics it's a very very compelling
economic argument and there have been
impediments about five years ago I was
working with a company and they were
very very resistant to moving the cloud
and the main reason to security and now
you can look at companies then they have
to consider ok hiring security people
they're in great demand obviously
because of all the threats that are out
there and Google has attracted the very
very top the brightest security minds
and they've got hundreds of them working
on the task of securing the cloud and so
once again the advantage goes to the
cloud vendor Google and providing not
just cost-effective computing but secure
computing one of the things you need to
also consider is that cloud computing is
a moment in our history of IT when we're
moving from physical computing to
virtual and abstract computing and
that's actually an opportunity because
if you are aligned with the new
abstractions if you understand them if
you understand them ahead of other
people then you're going to look to you
to guide them to give you know you're
going to be able to develop better
you're gonna you're not going to
understand exactly what the platform is
all about and what I've discovered is
that some of the abstraction such as
networking are actually very different
from physical networking I'll just give
you one simple example in I'll call it
the real world where we have computers
that we buy and network equipment that
we buy and cables that we connect if you
take two computers and connect them to a
network by default they can talk to each
other they can send packets back and
forth well in the cloud in the Google
cloud platform if you have two computers
and you connect them to a network by
default they cannot talk to each other
it's the exact opposite so that's kind
of a hundred and eighty degree different
way of looking at things and that has
really important implications when you
think about how do you design and deploy
a corporate network to include DM Z's we
would be the traditional view and other
kinds of isolations for your computers
and what happens is you have to throw a
lot of that out
you if you are then able to understand
what the abstractions are and what the
ramifications are you're going to be a
leader in the networking area and you'll
be able to help companies large and
small move to the cloud so there's a
huge area of room for you you can go in
and master and understand these
abstractions and then position yourself
at the leading edge of this new wave
that's going to be with us for the next
10 20 years and why Google well Google
is an engineering driven company
fundamentally they're very very
innovative they have published a large
volume of papers like MapReduce they
innovated on that they published the
paper the open source community saw that
and they developed a dupe and that's
just one example it's a technology after
technology Google is innovating and
they're not standing still you might
take a snapshot and say well there are
other companies that are kind of
catching up but Google is not standing
still they're working on some really
amazing stuff that they're going to be
revealing over the over the next few
years and they have built for their own
purposes a global platform that is
supporting their search their Gmail
their hosted business applications that
is absolutely state-of-the-art they have
fiber optic networking that's a mesh
network across the planet they have data
centers that are absolutely brilliantly
engineered all of this originally to
host their services then they made the
decision to open that up for us so
that's really the opportunities coming
available Google has opened up the cloud
for our use they're a leader in cost
efficiency they're innovating like crazy
their networking is absolutely
state-of-the-art and now we can come to
the cloud we can come to the Google
cloud and build applications that scale
just as google apps scale which is a
really exciting opportunity
they are seriously focused on the cloud
they have their leading their leading
card on the table is app engine they
decided that they wanted to share with
everyone the architecture that they
believe is the right architecture for
building highly scaled applications and
to be honest with you I found that some
developers really didn't understand it
they came to it and they saw a very
constrained and highly opinionated
architecture and some developers
understood it and embraced it and some
kind of bounced off and that they then
decided okay if that's if that's where
the state is if people really want
virtual machines instead let's release
virtual machines so they release compute
engine and then they opened up more and
more of their cloud and then they
realized that they needed to organize
themselves to really focus on the cloud
in terms of a an enterprise to
enterprise sale and they started hiring
people to help them build the cloud not
just as a bit a bunch of Technology
remember they're an engineering driven
company but also state of the art in
terms of being able to sell to companies
large and small so they've been hiring
some executives across the industry to
help them focus on bringing the cloud
not just technologically but also in
terms of products and services and
training and whenever there's a shift
there's an opportunity and whenever
there's a really disruptive change
there's huge opportunities and that's
what's happening and it's kind of a
subtle change because a lot of people
are saying well it's a cloud it's
virtual it's not really that different
but it really really is different some
jobs will disappear if you think about
the fact that Google will manage a lot
of the infrastructure and then companies
don't need to have those people around
one example is Khan Academy this is a
company that's innovated in the way that
they deliver training information they
happen to have selected App Engine as
their platform and they've focused on
encoding their business logic and app
engine and the bottom line is they don't
have anyone
staff that's a system administrator they
delegate all of that to Google so it's
not a question that they didn't lose any
jobs they just never hired any system
administrators so a lot of things that
are moving towards the cloud and the
cloud management and what Google has
expertise on those jobs will probably be
reduced but the new jobs will appear
you're going to need that companies are
going to need to have people that know
how to architect on the cloud they can
need come people that know how to deal
with the abstractions and code to the
new api's and paradigms and it's early
the shift is just happening now I was
working with a company about three or
four years ago and they decided to move
to the cloud but there was a lot of
resistance there was a lot of reluctance
they did make the change but at the same
time a lot of other companies I talked
to said no that's not for us you know
it's not ready we don't think that's the
right thing for us and here now in 2016
I'm seeing across the board a widespread
adoption of the cloud and as I said I've
seen many technology adoption cycles and
generally what happens is the companies
who have a lot of money who can benefit
from the new technology will invest in
it and then reap the benefits of it and
then there's a bunch of companies that
are the laggards the ones that are the
last to adopt and that's typical of any
cycle so for example maybe when new
technology comes out an investment bank
might invest in it because they can
trade stocks better or maybe they can
understand the market better what I'm
finding is that across the
it's different it's kind of it's kind of
an interesting change so there's an
opportunity for you to become a thought
leader there's an opportunity for you to
be a technology expert you can become a
mentor you can become a lean a leader
and you can also play the role of a
trainer and a consultant those are all
positions that are going to be needed as
companies move you know they make the
decision to go to the cloud and then
they need to figure out exactly how best
to utilize it I have literally been in
involved in training inside a company
who has elected to go with Google and
they've you know signed a deal they're
going to get on board and then I've gone
to Train large parts of the company to
explain exactly what they are what
they've bought they they know they want
to do it and then the leaders of the
company made the decision but lots of
people in the company really didn't
understand why they were making the
shifts so that's an opportunity for me
that opened up I've gone in and helped a
lot of groups understand why their
company's going to the cloud and of
course once they realize what the
advantages are they're very very
comfortable with it so what can you do
how can you take advantage of it well
it's all about education of course first
you can just learn about the general
cloud computing movement and that would
be reading articles making you know
seeing blogs and just kind of get a
sense of what's going on and then the
next step is specific training so
there's training opportunities that are
becoming available very very good
courses that will give you an
introduction to the cloud and then if
you want specific training in areas like
if you're a developer or if you're a
systems operations professional if
you're an architect or if you're
interest in your professional direction
aligns with big data then there's
training courses for you there also so
here are some roles these are some
example roles solution developers
developers that are going to be writing
applications for the Google cloud
platform and you might have Python
experience or Java experience Ruby PHP
something like that and your passion is
development well
look at the training that's available
for solution developers if you are an
architect and you want to understand
what the implications are of the cloud
what these new abstractions are and how
you might want to change the way you
think then pursue some training that are
it's targeted at solution architects if
your systems operation professional so
that would be a person who is focused on
making sure the computers are running
that the performance of the computers
are there the network operations are of
high performance and so on then you
might want to pursue some training that
is focused on system operation
professionals now here are some learning
paths so Google has actually made an
interesting shift when I first became
involved there was a course called CP
300 and it was a five day course that
was product focused and and if in those
days he would take the course it was
five days and there were five exams and
once you pass all five you got a
certificate that said you're now
certified for the whole platform Google
realized that wasn't really the way that
they wanted to go forward and they've
made it major change and they're now
pursuing role based training so they
really are focused on people who are
solution developers data analysts
solution architects and system operation
professionals and this is a sketch of
the current courses that are available
so the entry is CP 100 it's a one-day
class on the Google cloud platform
fundamentals it is a long day I've been
teaching a lot of these courses and it's
about 75% lecture explaining the
abstractions introducing you to exactly
what the clouds about why Google is a
fantastic place to be and then 25% is
lab exercises so you get hands-on
experience deploying code into the cloud
seeing it run and App Engine and compute
engine and container engine so it's a
really good way to get a solid grounding
on exactly what the clouds all about and
if your solution developer the next
thing to look at is CPD 200 this class
is a three day class that's focused on
developing solutions for the Google
cloud platform and you'll see how to
build App Engine applications you'll be
using go and you'll be using either Java
or Python and you'll build a real-world
application and deploy it and see how it
runs and when you leave the class you
have the source code the source code all
works and so if you want to take it and
extend it or experiment with it then
it's there for you if your systems
operation professionally the the entry
points still CP 100 again that one day
course and then CP o 200 is a four-day
class that is really in two phases and
the first phase you will learn how to
build a continuous integration
environment using Jenkins and it calls
on the use of multiple projects you'll
have Jenkins building things and a
cluster builder nodes and you'll learn
all about those details then you take
the output of that the compute in engine
image and the docker image and then in
the second two days you'll deploy that
in a high availability configuration so
you'll learn about global load balancers
you'll learn about managed instance
groups and how to build a system that's
going to scale so that's a four day
class and at the end you're going to be
very very familiar with a cloud platform
the class has an interesting design
point it is mostly lab work the learning
is in the doing and in fact on the
fourth day I've taught this class many
times now and on the fourth day I
probably talked to the students for
about 15 minutes and the rest of the day
it's guided lab exercises that take you
through paths that allow you to explore
different parts of the cloud and you
gain a high degree of competency and
comfort as a system operation
professional if you're a data analyst
after you take the CP 100 there's
another 100 level class that you would
want to look at it's called CP B 100 and
it's a big data only one
introduction so that's a great way to
see the whole spectrum of big data
products after that there's a CP b200
which focuses on Google's bigquery
product which is an amazingly fast
sequel language based processing engine
and then there's CP b201 which looks at
the rest of the big data on the Google
cloud platform the if you're a solution
architect the entry point still CP 100
again and then there's a CP a 200 course
that focuses on platform solutions for
architects and why simply learn sorry I
missed here simply learn is really
focused on providing training in a way
that you are going to be comfortable
participating with and practicing with
so you you there have instructor-led
training and they also have elearning
content and we'll get into some of those
details after it probably when we switch
to Q&amp;amp;A we want to probably give you a
chance to hear a little bit more about
exactly what simply learned can do to
help you get on board and up to speed so
in conclusion I'm seeing the movement of
the cloud is now as I said a couple
years ago I'd say maybe it's starting
but now it really is accelerating I'm
seeing more and more companies coming on
board so the movement is now and it's I
believe it's gonna play out as most
technology adoption curves do is gonna
play out over 10 years so if you jump on
board now if you invest in yourself
invest in your career you master the
different technologies and the
abstractions you're gonna see a good
career path for at least 10 years and
maybe longer so it's new as I said the
ideas that are powering the cloud really
are different they look like they're the
same as that what I would call the real
world of physical hardware and that's
what's kind of seductive about it it's
it's the same but then you can become
the master of what's different and then
really really provide
value-add two companies that you're
consulting with or enhance your own
career as you're moving forward so it's
driven by economics as I was saying it's
and that makes it another interesting to
mention this whole shift it's not the
question of oh okay there's a new
technology we need to think about
adopting it and maybe the benefit is
incremental I think that this economic
driven movement of the cloud is
absolutely fundamental it's a major
shift from buying to renting and it even
has an impact for corporations and how
they do their accounting I mean if you
buy stuff you have to find the money you
have to justify the purchase then you
buy the equipment and then you have to
justify the fact that you bought the
equipment and that's a will have a huge
headache and now instead companies are
going to be able to say I need just this
amount of computing to solve this
problem and I'm going to get this
benefit and it's going to be much much
easier for companies to justify because
it's going to be a smaller initial
amount of money it's going to track very
directly with their return and as far as
corporate decision makers that's a much
easier decision to make so we're gonna
see and because of the economics we're
gonna see an acceleration of what of
adoption of new technology and there's
amazing stuff on the horizon like
machine learning that Google is coming
up with so I'm pretty convinced it it's
the time to switch I've made the switch
I've spent a lot of time mastering this
and I'm really happy to share the my
observations with you and I want to
thank you for your attendance and now if
you have questions chip do you want to
chime in absolutely thank you so much
fascinating stuff that's really for
those of us that have been around in the
in the interweb industry in any fashion
for the last 10 years or so it's been
really incredible watching this this
evolution so the opportunities are huge
Before we jump into the Q&amp;amp;A though I'm
gonna ask everyone here to indulge me
for about 60 seconds or so I am going to
launch a little poll here on the screen
that means that
it's going to take over the screen for a
moment we're gonna lose that slide back
there we go this is a public facing
webinar which means that some of you who
are joining us may already be training
with simply learn and some of you may
may not yet be you might be here because
you saw something online about this free
webinar maybe a friend shared a link
with you and you're here for this
information from Randolph and that's
fantastic we're happy to have you here
it's a great way for us to give back to
the community make sure that we're
making our our faculty and our subject
matter experts available to folks to
help bring them up to speed on current
issues but webinars is just a piece of
what we do so I wanted to make sure that
you understood and Randolph mentioned
this a little bit already there are lots
of training resources inside of simply
learn as a learning platform that you
might be interested in because after all
our core service is more than just these
webinars we are in fact a business and
technology training provider we have
over 400 web-based training courses
across a wide spectrum of professional
skill sets and those those training
courses are accredited most of them by
over 40 third-party certifying bodies
like prince2 and PMI osep the Open Group
and so on all the training is
specifically designed to prepare you for
those third-party certifications in
exams wherever possible and always based
on the very latest bok-bok the body of
knowledge that is prescribed by those
certifying organizations and all of
these courses of course are designed and
presented by people who really know
their stuff by a faculty of experienced
professional trainers and working
professionals in those various areas of
expertise so when you join these
training programs you get structured
courses with all the information and
resources on practical experience you're
really going to need to successfully
pass the related certification tests in
a lot of cases you're going to get lab
exercises you'll get simulation exams
you might get access to it any
additional platforms or software to run
experiments and practice projects you'll
also get access to active moderated
forums where you can interact directly
with our faculty and with others
students and our staff to ask questions
about the materials that you're learning
and maybe to even ask questions about
how to apply what you're learning to
your own real-world challenges so if
you'd like to learn more go ahead and
take the appropriate box we'll have
someone get back in touch with you and
give you a tour maybe help you find the
right training based on what your goals
are for your next steps in your career
and if you've got a team of course you
can talk to us about that too there's no
better way to bring everybody on your
in-house team up to the same level of
expertise and get them all speaking the
same language to have them all share
training resources and and make
themselves more valuable to your team
into your business and to your customers
clients so with that said I'm going to
go ahead and close this poll we'll get
it out of the way and it'll it should
revert back to two Randolph's screen
sure enough we're seeing the thank you
screen so thank you everyone for
indulging me really quickly and we're
gonna jump on a few questions here
thanks again Randolph for all the great
information welcome the first most
common question we get it all field this
one is always will the webinar recording
be available or can we get the slide
deck and the short answer to that
question is most of our webinars are
recorded and are processed and edited
down to their most salient points and
then hosted somewhere for you to see the
best place for you to keep up is
probably going to be if you're not a
simply learn member already is to go to
youtube and find our channels there and
subscribe and very often we are posting
these recordings there for public
consumption and you will be notified if
you subscribe to the channel but they
may also you may also find them posted
to the internal learning platform as
well so if you're already a member keep
an eye out there and if you're having
any challenges finding recordings that
by all means let us know Mahendran has a
question and i hope i this is specific
enough for you Randolph is it mandatory
to be expert in all the aspects of
the Google cloud platform or is it is it
good enough to just specifically focus
on VF how valuable is it to cross train
across all the various aspects that's a
great question and I think that the
reality is the because the cloud is
moving so quickly and if you look at
Google specifically they started out
with App Engine and that was really
their the first offering that they had
and then they came out with maybe five
offerings in the last year I've seen an
incredible number of offerings come out
and if you ask me that question two
years ago I'd say you could probably
comfortably master it now I think you
really need to make a decision and
figure out what your passion is is your
passion big data and then I would
suggest you focus on that is it building
highly scaled applications for you know
websites maybe you want to focus on App
Engine are you interested in this
incredible movement towards docker and
containerization then look at container
engine so the answer really is it's it's
not mandatory that you master the whole
cloud at all I will say the fundamental
class that CP 100 is a good class to
take because what you need to understand
are the terms the terminology and the
abstractions and they're not hard
they're not that many abstractions to
know you know there's some ideas and
networking you need to get comfortable
with and you need to understand for
example in compute engine when you ask
for a disk you're not getting a disk
you're getting a rated allocation of a
network attached storage device that's
different so there's probably twenty you
know twelve one dozen to two dozen kind
of ideas and if you get those you're
good and then make a decision where you
want to focus on the cloud and don't
worry if there's parts of the cloud that
you know don't interest you it's not
going to be a handicap at all service so
there's there is absolutely room and
probably or two being hyper
oh yes oh yeah given that let's say that
your your your patch pardon me your
passion is Big Data
how expert should someone be in their
particular area of interest I mean
should they really know and maybe have
been certified somehow in Big Data
before they move into the Google
training so that they can apply that
other expertise to the Google cloud or
would someone possibly walk into Google
Cloud training with really very little
or no background expertise in another
one of these specialties a good question
and I'm going to answer it possibly in
an unexpected way I'm going to ground
the answer in the fact that Google is an
engineering company they're passionate
about their engineering they do
brilliant engineering and when they say
something is an introductory class it
pretty much is but for example if you
then go into the CPD 200 I'm going to
switch the focus over from a big data
over to CPD for just a second if you
don't mind but if you go to CPD 200
they're gonna expect that you actually
really really know Java or Python or go
or PHP so what they're gonna train you
on is given that you know how to program
here is how you're gonna program in the
cloud now for big data you need I would
say you need to have studied a little
bit about what the ideas are big data
but there will be a bit of an
introduction so I would say say you
probably want to spend some time getting
some of the fundamental ideas and then
going the classes or the CPB 100 class
for big data take that and then
calibrate what you know against what
Google is talking about and gain a
degree of comfort maybe you're ready to
go or maybe you need to do a little bit
more studying how's that for an answer
I think that's great that's perfect to
expand on that just a little bit when
we're talking about job search and
making yourself stand out in a crowded
job market obviously pardon me having
and certification on the Google platform
is a to be a value-add for you but are
there other kinds of training and
certifications there aren't specifically
programming or or GPC but things like
tableau or project management at the
general level and things like that that
would also possibly help you stand head
and shoulders above other applicants
that are challenging you in the job
space and that certainly wouldn't hurt
and well I I want to jump back just a
sec to Google specifically they have
made an interesting decision to come out
with what they're calling digital
certifications I'm not sure if they're
out just yet but what they want to do is
give you essentially a digitally signed
certificate that you can put on your
LinkedIn page that absolutely verifies
that you have this certification so
originally they would send you a nice
PDF and say yes you're certified but
they're getting really serious about you
know acknowledging the accomplishment
that you have and give you a digital
search that you can put on your page so
that's what Google's doing and
absolutely it doesn't hurt to also have
other areas of expertise so it really
comes down to what you want to do with
the cloud knowledge if you want to help
a company become great developers so
then yes some development management
expertise or an understanding of how to
be agile would certainly help fantastic
oK we've got another question here is
this a career path that is appropriate
for private contractors and given your
experience it sounds like certainly
working for you or are most of the
opportunities are we going to find them
to be on in-house teams and in at the
enterprise level interesting question
and the honest answer is I don't know I
think it's too early to really tell I
think he let me just give you a kind of
an example in a counterexample yes the
idea of a cloud is going to be very
appealing to a large company and they're
going to be interested in having their
developers trained but let's take a look
at app engine I mean I I'll make a
statement that it's kind of I'll make a
categorical statement and then I'm going
to qualify it app engine is free Google
provides
a free tier of use for App Engine and so
if you have if you're an individual
developer and you think you you know
you've got a really interesting idea and
you want a toy around the with the idea
of a startup company you can develop a
an application deploy it to App Engine
remember App Engine is focused on being
a highly scaled web system and you can
run it for free up to a certain limit
there's you don't have to go out and get
angel funding and buy a bunch of servers
so at you as an individual can
experiment with an idea run it for free
and if it takes off then you can go to
Google and say okay it's a successful
I'm gonna go and have a billing account
and I'll be happy to pay for the
processing for the thousands and
hundreds of thousands of users that are
using my application and the other thing
that's really cool about that and I
can't tell you how many groups I've
talked to that have come up with an
interesting idea and they built it maybe
on well no I don't mean to pick on a
particular framework but maybe like Ruby
on Rails or something like that that
lets you get your ideas going really
fast but they do have scalability limits
well if you pick App Engine again it's
free to start and it'll scale at Google
scale it'll scale as high as you can
imagine so
yeah that it's available there pathways
available for individual developers as
well as corporate developers boy am i I
wish I'd have known more about this when
my son was launching his startup two
years ago it's that's exactly the sort
of thing that that he could have
benefited from they built their own yeah
they built their site from the ground up
and they rented a server and you know
they were paying out while they were
still just trying to make things work
right and when you're strapped for cash
Wow what it makes a huge difference oh
yeah that's amazing maybe it's not too
late I should talk to them about maybe
the change now it's not yeah exactly
another question here for you can can
you compare the Google cloud platform to
AWS why would somebody choose to
specialize in one or the other
are they complementary or are they
really two completely different kinds of
services they're not completely
different kinds of products I don't I I
did actually work with a company my
first exposure to the cloud was in
Amazon I would help the company move the
rede channel of their website to the
Amazon Cloud and I spent about three
years there I I could have a long
conversation about it but I think I've
come to a kind of a succinct description
of why I have moved over to Google
Google has done a brilliant job of
designing the abstractions if you look
at what they present to you it's very
easy to understand it the ideas are very
simple they couple that with very
sensible defaults so you can go to
Google and say I would like three
computers and I want them connected to a
network and I want network traffic to
work in such in such a way and it
literally will take me about five
minutes to get that going and I've used
digitalocean I've used rim you hosting
I'm use Linode I've use a you know a
bunch of different clouds and I find
Google very very easy to approach but it
doesn't stop there you can reach around
back and they give you all the knobs to
let you do the tuning so that to me is
is a big big difference the other thing
that I've been discovering is that
Google's networking is absolutely
brilliant it's insanely fast it's very
easy to use and it's very well
engineered so I find that and the other
thing and if this is going to change
minute by minute day by day month by
month because it is a competitive
environment and it's about pricing
Google is very very focused on being
competitive on pricing so for example
you can have after 10 minutes of use
your compute engine instances build by
the minute and so you literally can I
just priced this out today I was talking
to somebody and I said look at this you
can rent a 32 core machine with 208
gigabytes of memory for 20 minutes maybe
you're going to test an algorithm a
caching algorithm you can rent it for
that amount of time for $0.50 and that
that's pretty cool
cloud vendors if they if you want to use
a computer they'll say ok hour-by-hour
here's the charge and then if you go
into production you can reap a sustained
use discount so over the month as you
use it more and more you'll get a 20% of
25% discount on the time on the charges
for your computer so you don't have to
say to Google I want to use this
computer for three years and now I get
my discount it's month by month and they
also have something called a preemptable
instance which means that if you're
willing to build an architecture that is
tolerant of machines going away like
SETI the search for in test route the
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
was one of the first ones I encountered
that's a system where they're trying to
do signal processing and they use your
screensaver
well it's designed so you can turn your
computer off and yet they could still
get their work done so your computer
could go away and so you can have
something like that on the Google cloud
platform you can build a system and as
long as you're tolerant of machines
going away the price is 1/2 so you can
save a lot of money there so yeah there
are differences I mean Amazon has their
own strengths Google has their own
strengths asher has its own strengths
and it's going to be really really
interesting to see how this plays out
over the next 10 and 20 years it is a
competitive environment and it's a horse
race that pricing model is incredible
though that's that's just astonishing to
me that you can jump in there for the 20
minutes that you need to test and not
feel obligated to bundle your testing
times together to take advantage of a
whole hour or something like that you
could be very agile under those
circumstances exactly that's that's
tremendous I gotta say just on a side
note that I nerd it out when you started
talking about SETI so yes I buddy an old
colleague of mine I haven't talked to
him directly in a long time Seth Shostak
is one of the lead folks there at SETI
and super super nice guys if they're
ever talking about study on TV or on
that the Discovery Channel or something
he's generally the guy that's on there
that's a super cool program and
fascinating to know that you know that
they might be taking advantage of
something like the Google cloud who knew
all right I have only one last question
here so we may be able to wrap up a
little earlier than expected but the
question is about you know we talked
here about getting the training and the
certifications and setting ourselves
apart through that and that's fantastic
but of course a part of it too and our
success in any industry is investing in
the community and getting to know other
professionals and building colleague
relationships and so forth what industry
events conferences do you recommend that
are can't-miss and the same might go for
things like any particular LinkedIn
groups that are highly trafficked and
interactive for folks that are involved
in the cloud computing industry and I
think following up on that too I might
ask if there are specific blogs or
publications that you personally like to
keep track of well in terms of keeping
track of Google the the velocity of
innovation is amazing and they're really
focus on Google first so they're really
three choices you can get a monthly
update and I kind of go well that's not
fast enough they have a Twitter feed and
it's like no that's too much data and
the one I actually use is their blog
they have a blog for the cloud platform
they put out on average it's about one a
day sometimes there's two maybe three
posts and then maybe there's they don't
post for a couple days but the
information on the Google cloud platform
blog is there good sized articles they
talk about significant issues they might
talk about a particular architecture
deployment on the cloud and it might be
one page it might be a dozen pages but
so it's a significant bit of information
and that is actually one of the tabs
that I open up every morning I have a
bunch of tabs I check the other thing
yes I think that we're still early
enough
that I I don't know of any specific
large-scale events that I'd say I
specifically recommend the Google
obviously has there's there's Google
Next and and so on what I would suggest
instead is you look local I've had
incredible good fortune by checking on
like and maybe meet up or something like
that and check in your local city or
maybe neighboring cities and find out
what's going on I am I live in Fort
Collins Colorado and there are there are
some people that get together there and
sometimes I go down to Denver or down to
Boulder and I found in the Denver area
I'll just you know there's there's an
amazing amount of energy around
kubernetes and docker and the container
engine there are literally companies
there that are putting their intellect
back into that open source project and
they're sponsoring meetups and even it
might be surprising I'm tracking a
language called Kotlin which i think is
pretty interesting and I've gone to some
meetups there and the conversation goes
to the cloud so even if there's a
meet-up that's not cloud specific you
might find that there's conversations
about it but I think the key thing is is
find people who have the same interest
that you do local community and get to
know them and have conversations because
it is early there you know there are
people who are thinking very very
carefully about the cloud and what it
means and what the technological
implications are but I think there's a
massive amount of opportunity for all of
us to get together and talk about it in
various groups and discover together
what the opportunities are perfect yep I
I don't think I could agree more that's
you know making the effort particularly
locally with meetups and whatnot where
you can get face to face with people and
really build relationships with your
colleagues certainly the way to go I've
been posting some links into the chat
module for you folks by the way a couple
of I hope I found the right Google Cloud
blog and I posted that in there for
folks and also a link to
the cloud services on Google so you can
take a look at that the last thing I'm
going to do here is share a few articles
from simply learned regarding cloud
computing in general in Google cloud in
particular so take a look again in your
in your chat module for those links and
the very last thing I'll do is share
some links to the simply learn courses
relevant to this this will get you
started go ahead and search around
inside the simply learn platform there
and you'll find more courses perhaps
that are relevant to you but this this
will get you going now I got to get it
to there we go
sorry about that there's a few links to
some courses there inside of simply
learn so you can take a look at those if
you need more guidance like I said feel
free to hit the chat button on the site
and let one of our staff give you some
guidance on figuring out which courses
and training might be best for your
aspirations but Randolph I think we've
actually we're gonna wrap up just a few
minutes early I don't have any further
questions queued up hear from our
attendees and I've you've answered my
personal questions as well so I
appreciate that but with that said thank
you so much for sharing all your
expertise with us Oh glad to do so and
we look forward to the next webinar with
you and that's the last link I will
share here by the way let me just scroll
down to the bottom of my notes here and
post one last link in here for you folks
in the chat module and that's a link to
the upcoming webinars here at simply
learned so take a look there that takes
you into our career edge section of our
website you can scroll through by
segments you can look at resources on
digital marketing project management
cloud computing and you'll see not only
the articles that are relevant to that
that area of interest but also any of
the upcoming webinars as well so look
around in there you're welcome to join
us for any future webinars we're happy
to have you on board
always a pleasure again to share our
SMEs with with the community and with
that set folks
Randolf again thank you so much we'll
talk to you next time
welcome and to everybody else so
everybody else have a great rest of your
morning or your afternoon or your
evening if it's the middle of the night
you're in Asia somewhere and you've
joined us at midnight thank you so much
for taking a little time out of your
night and that's time to go to bed all
right thanks everybody we'll talk to you
