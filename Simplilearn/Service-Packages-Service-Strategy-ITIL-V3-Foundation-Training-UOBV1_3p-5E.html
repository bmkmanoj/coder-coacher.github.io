create value to business let's try to
understand how do we provide these
services to our customers no two
customers have the same needs think from
a mobile services customers point of
view no two people will have the same
exact needs from a mobile service
provider
similarly in IT services there is no one
size that fits all any IT service
provider will have multiple customers
with different needs and requirements so
how do the IT service providers satisfy
the needs of its customers and committed
quality without complicating is focus or
operations ITIL provides the guidance
for such a situation through the concept
of service packages to discuss service
packages service level packages and how
they are used to offer choice and value
to customers let's take the example of
the packages made available by typical
mobile or telephony service providers as
customers we have a wide range of choice
when looking from mobile or telephone
connection so as a result telephony or
mobile service providers do need to work
hard to attract customers by
communicating the value they provide
through their offerings they also need
to offer a wide range of choices for
example tall plans payment options
phones and subsidized prices with post
paid plans and so on for customers who
have varying requirements and needs for
communication a service package provides
a detailed description of package of
bundled services available to be
delivered to customers the content of a
service package includes the core
services provided any supporting
services provided or enabling service
packages any enhancing service packages
which are often the excitement factor
used
differentiators and service level
packages while service providers must
focus on the effective delivery of value
from core services they should also
devote enough attention to the
supporting services satisfaction surveys
show how user dissatisfaction is often
with supporting services such as a
service desk or technical support
services even where the core service is
being effectively delivered for example
suppose you are a customer of a mobile
service provider now if you call the
service desk of the mobile company to
enable your roaming service and they are
not available to take up your call that
would result in you getting dissatisfied
even if your core services of being able
to make a call is working perfectly fine
so you are dissatisfied with their
enabling service of handling your
support queries service level packages
are effective in developing service
commitments in terms of utility and
warranty appropriate to the customer's
needs in a cost-effective way
let's take the example of a service
level package for email service this
service may be offered as two different
service level packages suiting the
business needs of two different
customers viz 1 is a small organization
with less than 5 people and the other is
a corporate customer for the small
organization even where by email is used
for the office hours only the service
level package might be for online
support during 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
that is to say only during business
hours but for a corporate they would
like to have a more exhaustive service
level package as they would have more
users using it all the 24 hours in a day
and hence they would require 24/7
support for their email service
so you can see that requirements of a
small organization and corporate
customers are different the service
level package offered has to suit the
business needs of a particular customer
further the corporate customer will have
needs for a different response and
resolution time - this also will differ
from the service level package being
offered to a particular customer many
outsource
IT organizations have service level
packages named as basic silver and gold
which indicates rising levels of service
level package that they offer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
