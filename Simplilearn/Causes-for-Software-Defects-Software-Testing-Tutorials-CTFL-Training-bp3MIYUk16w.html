complex architecture or code lack of
domain knowledge and technical
limitations like programming language
constraints do our mistakes matter let's
think about the consequences of mistakes
we agree that any human being
programmers and testers included can
make an error these errors may produce
defects in the software code or system
or in a document if a defect in code is
executed the system may experience a
failure so the mistakes we make matter
partly because they have consequences
for the systems for which we are
responsible mistakes are also important
because software systems and projects
are complex many interim and final
products are built during a project and
people will almost certainly make
mistakes and errors in all the
activities of the build some of these
are found and removed by the authors of
the work but it is difficult for people
to find all the mistakes while building
a product fail ability is compounded
when there is a lack of experience or
when right information is not available
available information is misunderstood
or if we are careless tired or under
time pressure all these factors affect
our ability to make sensible decisions
human brain either don't have the
information or cannot process it quickly
enough additionally we are more likely
to make errors when dealing with
perplexing technical or business
problems complex business processes code
or infrastructure changing technologies
or many system interactions this is
because our brains can only deal with a
reasonable amount of complexity or
change we'll all the defects lead to
failure mistakes in software systems or
documents
result in defects but not all defects
result in the failures we could argue
that if a mistake does not lead to a
defect or a defect does not lead to a
failure then it is not of any importance
we may not even know we've made an error
example say traffic signals are
controlled by simple software in a busy
crossroad due to an error in the program
all the directions see red signal
between 12 a.m. to 1215 a.m. every day
this may not lead to a failure as
signals will be set as orange light
blinking during this period however if
the same error sets the red signal
between 12 noon to 1215 p.m. every day
this leads to a failure is signalling
and may cause major accidents which can
be as serious as leading to death</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
