set of techniques methods and processes
are employed we can categorize them into
three sectors such as detecting and
preventing data migration to the cloud
protecting data moving to and within
cloud and lastly protecting data in the
cloud
detecting and preventing data migration
to the cloud in many organizations users
or businesses move confidential
information without the approval of the
concerned person
in such cases we can use database
activity monitoring da M or file
activity monitoring F a.m. URL filters
and data loss prevention DLP for
detecting and preventing data moving to
the cloud
da M and F a.m. are usually used for
internal data migrations
before data can be moved to cloud it has
to be extracted from the database when
this is done without authorization da M
or F am can detect it URL filters are
primarily used to monitor and sometimes
prevent users from connecting to cloud
services when users try to access the
administration console it can be
detected
DLP is used to identify any data leakage
DLP tools are employed to determine data
security at all levels
protecting data moving to and within the
cloud
in any service model it is important to
protect data in transit that is data
migrating for the first time to cloud
provider data moving between existing
cloud provider and new data moving
within instances in a given cloud
techniques used for protection are
clients or application encryption link
or network encryption and proxy based
encryption
clients or application encryption refers
to a scenario when data is encrypted on
the server before being transferred
link or network encryption refers to
standard Network encryption techniques
including SSL VPN and SSH it can be done
for both hardware and software
proxy based encryption data is
transmitted to an external proxy
appliance or a server which encrypts
before transferring it protecting data
in the cloud
there are multiple methods to protect
data but the best possible methods being
used are content discovery IaaS
encryption paas encryption and SaaS
encryption
in the next slide we will discuss some
recommendations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
