management training by simply learn
before proceeding further let us recall
what we have learned in previous lessons
lesson one gave us an introduction about
lean lesson two was a study of types of
waste lesson three discussed about
various tools used in lean Lesson four
detailed about lean in manufacture while
lesson five talked about lean in service
this is lesson number six and we will
talk in detail about lean in office in
the next slide we will start with the
agenda of what we are going to cover in
this lesson and then go into detail
about lean in office
here is the agenda we will start with
Theory of Constraints
and explain how to identify and remove
constraints from any process next we
will cover quick response manufacturing
where we will cover benefits of reducing
internal and external lead times and
then cover factory physics which is a
detailed framework for manufacturing
management and then we will cover Six
Sigma methodology which provides tools
and techniques to reduce variation and
improve quality in the next slide we
will start with the Theory of
Constraints also known as TOC
in this section we will cover Theory of
Constraints the Theory of Constraints
was developed and popularized by
manufacturing guru dr. Alya M Goldratt
in 1984 the Theory of Constraints
has evolved over the past 20 years from
a production scheduling technique to a
systems methodology which is primarily
concerned with managing change it
encompasses a wide range of concepts
principles solutions tools and
approaches the Theory of Constraints
state that every system must have at
least one constraint limiting its output
a constraint is a factor that limits the
system from getting more of whatever it
strives Theory of Constraints provides a
reliable process that insists on
follow-through and focuses improvement
efforts where they will have the
greatest immediate impact on the bottom
line of the company in other words it is
a thinking process that enables people
to invent simple solutions to seemingly
complex problems Theory of Constraints
adopts the common idiom a chain is no
stronger than its weakest link
this means that processes organizations
etc are vulnerable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
