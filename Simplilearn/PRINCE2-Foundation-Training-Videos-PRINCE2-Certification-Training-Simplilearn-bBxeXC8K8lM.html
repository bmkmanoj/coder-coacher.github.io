and practitioner certification course
offered by simply learn this lesson
we'll give an overview of the course in
the next screen we will list the
objectives of this lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to list the learning objectives of
prince2 certification course describe
the prince2 certification exam outline
and syllabus we will discuss the
learning objectives of this course in
the following screen
the main objective of this course is to
ensure participants understand the four
integrated elements of prince2
methodology the four elements are seven
principles seven themes seven processes
and tailoring to project environment we
will be covering each of these core
elements in detail during this course
knowing these elements will help imprint
to foundation examination another
objective of this course is to help
participants to prepare for the prince2
foundation examination we will also
provide sample questionnaire to test the
preparation for the foundation
examination in the next screen we'll
find out about prince2 foundation exam
the salient features of prince2
foundation examination are as follows it
is one our exam consisting of 75
multiple-choice questions out of this 75
questions five questions are trial and
do not contribute towards the score
the question number of the trial
questions is not shared with the
participant so all the questions have to
be answered to pass the prince2
foundation examination one must score 50
percent that is 35 out of 70 questions
answered should be correct the prince2
foundation examination is a closed book
examination the book cannot be carried
inside the examination centre in the
next screen we will find out about
prince2 practitioner exam
the salient features of prince2
practitioner examination are the
following the practitioner examination
is based on a case scenario each exam
will comprise of eight questions
covering a different syllabus area which
will be clearly identified at the
beginning of each question there are
eight questions containing ten marks and
the questions are further subdivided
into two parts the passing mark is 44 or
55% the duration of the examination is
of two and a half hours
the questions of prince2 examination are
based on managing successful projects
with Prince to the syllabus includes
seven principles seven themes seven
processes and tailoring to project
environment we would be studying these
elements in our course for example learn
from experience is one of seven
principles of prince2 methodology risk
is one of the seven themes and directing
a project is one of the processes
imprints to prince2 methodology believes
in customization meaning that this
methodology cannot be used as it is it
would need to be tailored down up to
suit the specific project need
there are total of 20 lessons after
completing the first three lessons
please go through lesson 11 first and
then lessons for till 10 for better
understanding the last lesson is a
guideline of the prince2 practitioner
exam the lessons and the time dedicated
to each lessons are listed in the table
on the screen we will continue our
discussion on the course outline in the
following screen
as seen in the table on the screen in
lesson seven eight nine and ten four of
the seven themes of prince2 are
explained in detail lesson 11 is an
introduction to seven processes of
prince2 we will continue our discussion
on the course outline in the following
screen
as seen in the table on the screen
lesson 12 to 18 is where all the seven
processes are explained lesson 19 which
is tailoring prints to to project
environment describes the need of
tailoring of prince2 methodology in
various project environment please note
the prince2 exam is based on prince2
manual published by TSO our lessons
correspond to the lessons in prince2
manual that is to say prince2 manual
also has 19 lessons an extra lesson has
been added in the course which gives us
guidelines on prince2 practitioner exam
at the end of each of these lessons we
have a quiz attempting these quizzes is
recommended for an increased grasp of
the topics covered once the 19 lessons
are completed the participants can take
the online practice tests these tests
will help improper ation for the actual
exam
hello and welcome to prints to
foundations the vacation course offered
by simply learn this lesson introduces
us to prince2 methodology let us discuss
the objectives of this lesson in the
next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to explain the challenges faced by
an organization during project
management define a project explain the
need for project management methodology
list the six variables of project
explain the structure and benefits of
prince2
let us look at the challenges faced by
the organizations in the next screen
in the current business scenario the
organization needs to manage business
operations and need to respond to the
changes in the business simultaneously
if changes are not responded to in the
business it becomes difficult for the
organization's to sustain in the market
managing current business operations as
well as business changes is a
challenging task they need to transform
business operations to sustain in the
changing business circumstances to do
that they need to have a balance between
business as usual also termed as BAU and
business change by implementing a
project for example a computer
manufacturer provides support and
maintenance of the existing products as
a part of BAU however at the same time
tries to introduce faster and more
efficient computers with new features in
the market
this is to sustain or grow its market
which is an example of business change
a business change is introduced by
implementing a project
in the next screen we will discuss the
definition of a project
the official Prince to manual defines a
project as a temporary organization that
is created for the purpose of delivering
one or more business products according
to an agreed business case sometimes
projects are undertaken to introduce a
change in the organization or the
projects are executed as part of a
contract let us take the scenario of a
project to introduce a change for
example if the sale of a company product
has declined in the last three months
and a decision is taken to broadcast a
new advertisement campaign to further
promote the product in the market
introducing a new advertisement campaign
is a project according to Prince to a
project is taken as there is a problem
the expected change is introduced
through projects the characteristics of
projects are as follows
project introduces change in an
organization each project has definite
start date and an intended end date
which makes all projects temporary in
nature each project is unique the
resources from various units with
multiple skillsets are involved in the
project this makes all the projects
cross-functional each project has its
own share of risks hence there is an
uncertainty in each project in the next
screen we will find out why we need
project management methodology
prince2 defines project management as
project management is the planning
delegating monitoring and controlling of
the entire project and the motivation of
those involved to achieve the project
objectives within the expected
performance targets for time cost
quality scope benefits and risks
despite of best efforts by the higher
management and the project manager
projects still fail millions of pounds
are lost when the project's failed to
achieve its objectives the image on the
screen represents the core concept of a
project management methodology
there are various reasons for failures
such as lack of support from senior
management unclear scope and incorrect
estimates there is a need for following
a systematic way of project management
if the projects are managed in a
systematic way throughout the project
lifecycle the project has a higher
possibility of success the project
management methodology helps project
managers to keep control over the
specialist work such as building a
website design a building and to manage
the risks effectively the next screen
will introduce us to prince2
prince2 is a non-proprietary project
management method this means
a license fee need not be paid to any
person or organization for using the
standards in the project it is a generic
methodology that can be applied to any
project in any industry or domain
irrespective of project scale type
organization geography or culture any
product specific development methodology
can be integrated with management aspect
of prince2
it is a widely accepted method for
managing projects
note that prince2 does not provide
specialist aspects such as industry
specific activities detailed techniques
such as earned value analysis and
leadership and motivational skills in
the next screen will list the six
aspects of prince2
/ prince2 the project managers need to
control the following six aspects or
variables of a project first aspect is
cost as the project has to be affordable
and though initially there may be a
particular budget there will be many
factors which can lead to overspending
and perhaps some opportunities to cut
costs second is time skills as the next
most frequent question asked of a
project manager is the time scale of a
project next is quality as finishing on
time and within budget is not enough if
the result of the project is not
functional in prince2 terms the project
products must be fit for purpose fourth
is scope because if the scope is not
known then the various parties involved
in a project may end up talking at
cross-purposes fifth is risks as all
projects entail risks but how much risk
is acceptable should be predefined
the last aspect is benefits as the
project manager has to have a clear
understanding of the purpose of the
project as an investment and make sure
that what the project delivers is
consistent with achieving the desired
return let us look at the structure of
prince2 in the next screen
as seen in the image on the screen the
prince2 is a project management
methodology that includes four
integrated elements of principles themes
processes and the project environment
a project is called a prince2 project
only if it follows the seven principles
described by prince2
the principles are the guiding
obligations and good practices that
determine whether the project is
genuinely being managed using prints to
the themes described aspects of a
project management that must be
addressed continually and in parallel
throughout the project the purpose of
themes is achieved by performing prints
to processes throughout the project
there are seven themes that describe how
the seven principles can be followed
while achieving the objectives of the
themes
the seven processes of prints to
describe how a project should be managed
effectively from start to project
closure
prince2 provides guidelines support the
activities recommended for each of the
seven processes it also provides the
responsibilities for various roles in
project organization structure
in the next screen we will learn about
the benefits of prince2
prince2 is an established and proven
best practice for managing projects it
can be applied to any type of project
and integrated with specialist product
development method it is widely
recognized across industries it provides
common vocabulary among the suppliers
and customers and has well defined
project roles and responsibilities it
includes best practices for managing
projects it is independent of the
industry domain and technology it can be
integrated with specialist product
development method it has clearly
defined project roles and
responsibilities
it provides project organization with
structure of accountability delegation
Authority and communication it also
provides sufficient project controls so
that the project can make efficient and
best use of senior management time by
supporting the principle of management
by exception it also ensures that a
project is a viable desirable and
achievable let us move on to the quiz
questions to check your understanding of
the concepts covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what we have
learned in this lesson
project is defined as temporary
organization that is created for the
purpose of delivering one or more
business products according to an agreed
business case as per prince2 cost time
scales quality scope risks and benefits
are the six aspects of any project that
need to be controlled the prince2 is a
project management methodology that
includes four integrated elements of
principles themes processes and the
project environment
hello and welcome to prints to
foundations duplication course offered
by simply learn
this lesson is about prince2 principles
the principles are guiding standards and
implied the attitude of a person or an
individual prince2 is a principles-based
project management methodology
these principles have originated from
the lessons learned from projects that
have been successfully executed and the
projects that have failed let us discuss
the objectives of this lesson in the
next green
after completing this lesson you will be
able to list the seven principles of
prince2 methodology explain the seven
principles of prince2 methodology in the
following screen we will list the seven
principle
seven principles of prince2 methodology
are as follows continued business
justification learn from experience
defined roles and responsibilities
manage by stages manage by exception
focus on products and tailor to suit the
project environment in the next screen
we will discuss the first principle
which is continued business
justification let us discuss the first
principle of prince2
that is continued business justification
a prince2 project must have continued
business justification there should be a
justifiable reason to start a project
for example a popular pizza chain has an
online order processing system which
allows registered customers to place an
order for their products the same system
has been used in the organization to
process the order and to deliver the
products for the last three years the
number of customers has gone up in the
last couple of years and most of the
customers complained about the slow
speed of the system
due to the increase in sales and users
the current system is no longer able to
process the data efficiently so a
decision was taken to upgrade the order
processing system the new system will
process orders 50% faster leading to an
increase in customer satisfaction by at
least 20%
in this example there is a justification
why the current system should be changed
the justification is that the new system
will process orders faster and make
customer happier leading to a possible
increase in repeat of orders this
justification should remain valid
throughout the life of the project and
should be documented and approved
although the justification should remain
valid it may change or evolve this
project is part of the nationwide
program being implemented by the pizza
chain to promote greater automation
leading to lesser dependence on
brick-and-mortar stores for increase in
sales
for a prince to project the
justification should be approved and
documented in a business case the
justification should drive the decision
of continuing the project throughout the
project lifecycle so the first principle
of prince2 says that every project
should have continued business
justification if for whatever reason the
project is no longer justified it should
be stopped it is a wise decision to
close the project if it is proved that
it is not going to achieve its
objectives the funds and resources
should be released and utilized in a
better manner in the project with
business justification
let us discuss the second principle of
prince2 that is learn from experience
prince2 project teams learn from
previous relevant experience lessons are
sought recorded and acted upon
throughout the life of the project
learning can be from historical data
based on previous similar projects in
the same organization or from a
different organization but in the same
industry learning from experience
happens as the project progresses
which means learning is a continuous
process lessons are included in reports
and reviews learning from experience
happens as the project closes which
means the project passes on the lessons
learnt it is the responsibility of
everyone involved with the project to
proactively seek the lessons learned for
example a Japanese bank is to provide
partial funding of an infrastructure
project in a developing country however
they want an assurance from the local
government as a similar project in the
past had faced local labor problems
the next principle we will discuss is
defined roles and responsibilities
let us discuss the third principle of
prince2 that is defined roles and
responsibilities a prince2 project has
defined and agreed upon roles and
responsibilities within an organization
structure that engages the business user
and suppliers stakeholder interest a
project is typically cross-functional
may involve more than one organization
and may involve a mixture of full-time
and part-time resources to be successful
projects must have an explicit project
management team structure consisting of
defined and agreed-upon roles and
responsibilities for the people involved
in the project and a means for effective
communication between them as seen in
the image on the screen all projects
have the following primary stakeholders
business sponsors are those who endorse
the objectives and ensure that the
business investment provides value for
money
users are those who will use the
products which enables them to gain the
intended benefits suppliers are those
who provide the resources and expertise
required to make the product suppliers
may be internal or external to the
organization where project is being
implemented
let us discuss the next principle of
prince2 that is managed by stages
if the work is broken in small
manageable chunks then it becomes easy
to deliver the product prints to also
suggests that the work be divided in
multiple logical stages which helps in
better management of the project work
and these stages are called management
stages a prince2 project is planned
monitored and controlled on a stage by
stage basis
the steps are followed to produce the
specialist product of the project are
dependent on the technology domain and
industry for example the technical
requirements of constructing a bridge
and/or producing a Cola bottle are
different
however the production is carried out in
phases and is driven by the technical
aspect of the finished product these
phases are called technical stages
prince2 requires a minimum of two
management stages one initiation stage
and one or more further management
stages shorter stages offer more control
while longer stages reduce the burden on
senior management stages are to be
planned delegated monitored and
controlled according to the business
priority risk and complexity in bold
management stages provide senior
management with control points at major
intervals throughout the project at the
end of each stage the project's status
should be assessed
in this case and plans should be
reviewed to ensure that the project
remains viable we will look at the next
principle which is managed by exception
in the next screen
a prince2 project has defined tolerances
by each project objective to establish
limits of delegated authority every
prince2 project has four levels of
management the first level is called
corporate or program management this is
the senior management level that decides
to take on the project and it defines
the project level tolerances corporate
or program management can lay down a
rule saying that if the project cost is
expected to exceed five percent of the
original project cost it must be brought
to its notice and approved to continue
with the project the corporate or
program management appoints an executive
whose responsibility is to get the
project executed as per the tolerances
defined by them the executive is a part
of project board along with executive
the project board also has
representation from user and supplier
project board is the second level of
organization it is responsible for
providing overall direction and
management to the project the project
board appoints project manager to take
care of day-to-day management of the
project within the constraints set by
the project board this is the third
level of organization the project
manager gets the work done through team
managers who deliver the actual
specialist product of the project this
is the fourth level of management let us
take an example the corporate management
defines the budget and timeline for the
project of upgrading the CRM system the
corporate management appoints mr. Smith
as an executive or this project he has
been handling two more projects mr.
Smith appoints Miss Julie as a project
manager to manage day-to-day activities
of this project he allocates budget and
gives timelines to Miss Julie
mr. Smith does not want to spend time in
day-to-day activities of the projects
however would expect regular progress
reports from Miss Julie so this
principle provides a very efficient use
of senior management time the senior
management including mr. Smith and
corporate management should be available
for guidance and ad hoc directions
whenever the project team needs their
help so the senior management directs
the project manager the project manager
manages day-to-day work and the team
manages deliver the project which means
they deliver the specialist product of
the project there is a defined
accountability at each level next
management level is involved only if
tolerances are forecast to be exceeded
implementation of management by
exception provides the very efficient
use of senior management time we will
continue our discussion of this
principle in the next screen
the accountability is established by
delegating authority from one management
level to the next
by setting tolerances against six
objectives or the respective level of
the plan
according to Prince to the project
manager controls six aspects of the
project and they are time cost scope
benefits risks and quality
object controls are set at each level of
management for these six parameters time
plus or minus an amount of time on the
target completion date cost plus or
minus and amount of the planned budget
scope permissible variation of the plans
products for example mandatory
requirements plus or minus desirable
requirements
benefits plus or minus degrees of an
improvement goal for example 30 to 40
percent cost reduction risks limits on
the plans aggregated threats for example
cost of aggregated risks to remain less
than 10 percent of the plans budget it
also refers limits on any individual
threat for example a threat to
operational service
quality plus or minus degrees of a
quality target for example a product
that weighs a target of 300 grams width
and allowed minus 5 grams to Plus 10
grams tolerance
by setting up controls if those
tolerances are forecast to be exceeded
they are immediately referred to the
next management layer for a decision
this ensures that the senior management
time is used aptly and right decision is
made by people at a right level at the
right time
now we will consider the next principle
which is focus on products a prince2
project focuses on the definition and
delivery of products in particular their
quality requirements the document that
captures the details of each product is
called
a product description the product
description includes each products
purpose composition derivation format
quality criteria and the quality method
the product description is used to
estimate efforts determined resource
requirements determined dependencies and
determine schedule of the activities
without a product focus projects are
exposed to several major risks such as
acceptance dispute uncontrolled change
or scope creep user dissatisfaction and
underestimation of acceptance activities
according to Prince to a successful
project is output oriented not activity
oriented output oriented project means
the project agrees upon and defines the
project's product prior to undertaking
the activities required to produce them
let us now discuss the last principle of
prince2 that is tailored to suit the
project environment
prince2 is a generalized methodology
that can be applied to any industry it
is tailored to suit the project's
environment size complexity importance
capability and risk the tailoring aspect
of a project is documented in feed the
project initiation documentation or the
pede describes how the method is being
tailored or project the purpose of
tailoring is to ensure the project
management method relates to the
project's environment for example
aligning the method to the business
processes that may govern and support
the project such as Human Resources
finance and procurement project controls
are set based on scale complexity
importance capability and the risks
involved in the project all the
principles of prince2 have to be
followed if any one of them is missed
then the project is not a print ative
project let us move on to the quiz
questions to check your understanding of
the concepts covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what we have
learned in this lesson
a prince2 project has continued business
justification prince2 project teams
learn from previous experience lessons
are salt recorded and acted upon
throughout the life of the project
a prince2 project has defined and agreed
upon roles and responsibilities within
an organization structure that engages
the business user and supplier
stakeholder interests a prince2 project
is planned monitored and controlled on a
stage by stage basis a prince2 project
has defined tolerances for each project
objective to establish limits of
delegated authority a prince2 project
focuses on the definition and delivery
of products in particular their quality
requirements prince2 is tailored to suit
the project's environment size
complexity important capability and risk
hello and welcome to prince2 foundation
certification course offered by simply
learn this lesson is about prince2
themes
let us discuss the objectives of this
lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to explain the prince2 themes
explain the considerations while
applying themes in projects let's
discuss the themes in the next screen
the themes imprints to describe facets
of project management that must be
addressed continually each theme has a
purpose and the purpose is achieved by
following the principles any project
manager who gives thorough attention to
these themes will fulfill the role
professionally the themes are based on
the prince2 principles let us understand
each of these seven themes in the next
screen
the table on the screen lists the seven
themes what they seek to address and
what they describe the business case
theme gives the business justification
or undertaking the project that is why
the project is taken the organization
theme describes the roles and
responsibilities of key stakeholders in
the project that is who is taking up the
project
quality theme describes the quality
attributes of the product to be
delivered that is they describe what
will be delivered
it checks whether the product of the
project is fit for purpose
the plans theme describes how to create
or modify the products of the project
how much time and money is required for
the project and when to perform the
activities
the plans also describes the steps
required to develop plans and apply
prince2 techniques it provides the
control and communication mechanisms
the risk theme answers the question what
if that is it describes the plans for
managing uncertain sees the change theme
describes how project management
assesses and acts on issues which have a
potential impact on any of the approved
and agreed aspects of the project in
other words it describes the steps for
assessing impact of change and managing
the change issue can be any unplanned
event that has already occurred and
needs to be dealt with
Progress theme addresses the ongoing
viability of the plans this theme
explains the decision-making process or
approving plans the monitoring of actual
with planned performance and escalation
process if events do not go according to
the plan let's learn about applying
these themes in a project in the next
screen
all seven themes must be applied in a
project however they should be tailored
according to the scale uncertainty and
complexity of the project concerned
themes can be tailored up or down this
means for a complex project one can go
for detailed documentation and tighter
process control for a simple low-risk
project even a concise bullet points
presentation on how themes should be
implemented in a project and informal
processes would be adequate
let's move on to the quiz questions to
check your understanding of the concepts
covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what we have
learned in this lesson the themes
imprint to describe facets of project
management that must be addressed
continually the seven themes in prince2
are business case organization quality
plans risk change and progress all seven
themes must be applied in a project
hello and welcome to prince2 foundation
application course offered by simply
learn this lesson is about business case
which is one of the seven themes of
prince2 methodology before beginning
this lesson it is advisable that you go
through the lesson on introduction to
processes let us discuss the objectives
of this lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you'll be
able to define a business case theme
explain the prince to approach the
business case theme describe the
development of a business case let us
look at the purpose of business case in
the following screen
the purpose of the business case theme
is to establish mechanisms to judge
whether the project is and remains
desirable bible and achievable as a
means to support decision making in its
continued investment in other words the
aim of business case is to ensure that
working on the project is justified
spending money on the project is
justified and resulting output of the
project will be worth the investment and
associated risks at any point if it is
realized that resulting output of the
project is not beneficial enough and not
as per the plan project work should be
stopped that is the reason why in the
definition it states project is and
remains desirable viable and achievable
now let's look at the meaning of
desirable viable and achievable
desirable means that cost benefits and
risk associated with the project balance
out in other words one does not end up
spending too much of money a little
benefit and vice-versa
similarly the risk associated with the
project is worth the benefits that the
project intends to provide
bible means that the project is
practical project is practical only if
the output that the project intends to
deliver can actually be delivered in
other words project is realistic
achieve Abul means the products can
deliver the benefits every project is
started with some intended benefits and
the current project should deliver those
benefits in a business case scenario
user or users is responsible for
specifying the benefits and subsequently
realizing it while executive is
responsible for ensuring those benefits
represent value for money in the next
screen let us find out what a business
case is the business case presents the
optimum mix of information used to judge
whether the project is and remains
desirable viable and achievable and
therefore worthwhile investing in the
project board and stakeholders must
always have confidence that the project
remains viable in prince2 the business
case provides the vital test of
viability of the project it provides the
answer to the question is the investment
in this project still worthwhile since
the viability question is ongoing the
business case is not static it should
not be used only to gain initial funding
for a project but should be actively
maintained throughout the life of the
project
and be continually updated with current
information on costs timescales
risks and benefits outlined business
case is developed during starting up a
project process while detailed business
case is developed during initiating a
project process for making investment
decisions it is important to ascertain
what benefits can be gained when with
what degree of risk and from what level
of investment projects should be
evaluated on how well they will
contribute to the corporate objectives
such an ALICE ease enables one project
to be compared with another so that the
organization can choose to invest in the
best set of projects let us discuss the
outputs outcomes and benefits of the
project in the next screen
we spoke about outputs and benefits of
the project on the previous screen let
us look at these terms individually a
projects output is any of the project's
specialist products whether tangible or
intangible if the aim of the project is
to develop a new sales information
system that captures all sales related
data of a company's customer then sales
information system is the output of the
project an outcome is the result of the
change derived using the project's
output by implementing the sales
information system the company
executives are able to capture sales
order more quickly and accurately that
is the outcome of this project a benefit
is a measurable improvement resulting
from an outcome that is perceived as an
advantage by one or more stakeholders in
this case example of benefits would be
costs associated with capturing sales
order of customers reduced by 10%
possibly because there is no double
entry of same customer data in different
systems or by different executives
volume of sales order increased by 15%
as executives are getting more time to
focus on customers and revenue increased
by 10% annually due to better sales for
example a new ERP system was installed
or the HR department which is an output
this installation that led to faster
application and approval of leaves which
is an outcome the benefits of this
installation were employee productivity
increased by 5% employees have
dysfunction levels increased by 7.5% and
revenue increased by 10% annually in the
next screen we will discuss the
relationship between outputs outcomes
and benefits
in the image on the screen the
relationship between outputs outcomes
and benefits have been represented in a
graphical form
this benefits is opposite of benefits it
can be considered as a negative impact
of the project let's understand what
benefits review plan is in the next
screen
the executive is responsible for the
business case however it is the
accountability of the senior user to
specify the benefits and ensure the
project benefits are realized the senior
user represents the user community who
are expected to use the benefits of the
project senior user is a part of the
project board every project should have
benefits review plan or PRP the RP
defines how and when a measurement of
the achievements of the projects
benefits can be made if the project is
being managed within program this
information may be created and
maintained at the program level the
benefits review plan is first created by
the project manager in the initiation
stage and is submitted to the project
board or approval when seeking project
authorization the benefits review plan
is developed by the project manager
however by default responsibilities lies
with executive PRP defines the scope
timing and responsibilities of reviews
depending on the expected benefit the RP
is updated at the end of each stage by
including the actual benefits achieved
if any PRP is different from project
plan and stage plans in the next screen
we'll discuss the business case for
different types of projects
the nature of the project will determine
the objectives to verify the
desirability of the project and later to
confirm the projects products have met
those objectives if a private company
takes up a commercial project the
benefits are always measured in
financial term this might not be the
case of a project undertaken by a
government agency the various types of
projects are compulsory to address
compliance issues not-for-profit project
used at British councils Center of
Excellence evolving customer or supplier
Accenture helped GlaxoSmithKline
realized 1.5 billion GBP in 18 months
and multi organization project some of
these projects may be measured
principally on return on investment
however others like B not-for-profit
projects may be measured on other
non-financial benefits regardless of the
type of measure it's important to ensure
that project is and remains desirable
viable and achievable in the following
screen we will learn about the prince2
approach to business case
continued business justification is
ensured by assuring the justification of
the project when starting and also re
verifying this at the end of every stage
prince2 advocates the project be managed
in stages in prince2
the business case is developed at the
beginning of the project and maintained
throughout the life of the project being
formally verified by the project board
and confirmed throughout the period that
the benefits accrue we will discuss some
the key terms of this definition in the
next screen
business case should be first developed
in the beginning of the project and
maintained through the life of the
project at the end of each stage of the
project the project board needs to
verify to make sure the project is
desirable viable and achievable as per
the business case at the end of each
stage the project manager needs to
maintain business case with actual costs
and benefits data of current stage and
provide the forecast of the costs and
benefits of the upcoming stage finally
an assessment of whether the planned
benefits had been or will be realized is
made important point to note here is
that confirming benefits may take place
post project that is all or most
benefits may be realized post project
let us find out how to develop the
business case in the following excrete
in prince2 the executive is responsible
for the business case executive is
identified find the corporate or program
management as a person with overall
responsibility of the project executive
can also be considered as project owner
principality of developing the business
case is with executive which does not
mean executive rights the business case
executive may delegate development of
the business case to a business analyst
or to the project manager or take
assistance from project assurance as
seen in the image on the screen the
development of the business case is a
two-stage process the outline business
case is derived from project mandate and
developed pre project in starting up a
project process every project requires a
trigger and that trigger is called
project mandate in prince2 methodology
based on this trigger some quick initial
work is done to check whether it's
worthwhile to even initiate the project
this is called pre project the outline
business case is developed at this stage
approval on the outline business case is
required by the project board to
initiate the project
the detailed business case is derived
from the outline business case the
project plan which provides inputs like
costs timescales and products and the
risk register
the process of developing the business
case is ITER ative in the following
screen we will discuss verifying and
maintaining the business case
is the responsibility of the executive
to assure the project's stakeholders
that the project remains desirable bible
and achievable at all times the
corporate or program management approves
the outlined business case reviews the
detailed business case as part of
benefits review the project board may
review the outlined business case during
the starting up a project process to
take a call on whether to initiate the
project at the end of initiating a
project process when the detailed
business case is available project board
takes the call on whether to authorize
work on this project there are some
other cases also for example in case of
exception business case needs to be
reviewed business case is also referred
by the project manager while assessing
impact of any change issue or risks it's
the project manager who updates the
business case with actual cost time and
benefits data at the end of each stage
in the next screen we'll discuss the
content of a business case
the business case should explain the
reason that the project is required the
reasons are likely to be defined in the
project mandate it should contain an
executive summary the business case it
should also include details on which
business option is to be selected in
this project out of three options
concerning any investment
in any business concerning investment do
nothing should always be the starting
option which acts as the basis for
quantifying the other options
the analysis that each option provides
the project board and the project
stakeholders with sufficient information
to judge which option presents the best
value for the organization the business
case should also include the expected
benefits and this benefits time and cost
investment appraisals and major risks
associated with the project the business
case should list each benefit that it
claimed would be achieved by the project
outcome in quantifiable terms the
quantification of benefits is necessary
for setting up the benefits tolerances
for instance in our sales information
system example the expected benefits
could be a 10 to 15% increase in sale
the quantification also ensures that the
benefits can be measured and can be
proven the benefits can be financial and
non-financial
there could be some negative outcome of
carrying out a project for example when
the organization decides to implement a
new sales information system the staff
needs to undergo two days extensive
training and hence there will be a delay
in activities that they were supposed to
do on those training days such negative
outcomes are documented under expected
dis benefits section in the business
case document the business case includes
the timeframes corporate and all program
management is interested in knowing over
what period the project cost will be
incurred and when the organization can
expect to accrue benefits the business
case also includes the earliest or
latest feasible start date for the
project and the earliest or latest
feasible completion date it should
summarize the cost derived from the
project plan together with the
assumptions upon which they are based
the costs should also include details of
the ongoing operations and maintenance
costs and their funding arrangement next
it should document the major risks
foreseen in the project another
important section in the investment
appraisals which includes the
development operations and maintenance
costs against the value of the benefits
over time in the following screen we
will look at the different
responsibilities in a business case
the table on the screen lists the
responsibilities of different roles in
business case the corporate or program
management provides the project mandate
and it should also define the standards
to which the business case needs to be
developed the executive is responsible
for the business case during the project
the senior users are responsible or
specifying the benefits upon which the
business case is approved the corporate
is also responsible of the post project
benefits review plan senior supplier
confirms that the products required can
be delivered within the expected costs
and are viable executive is responsible
for the business case or the duration of
the project
another responsibilities of executive is
the benefits review plan or the duration
of the project
unless it is being managed by a
corporate or program management
executive also oversees the development
of a Bible business case ensuring that
the project is aligned with corporate
strategies and secured the funding for
the project
the senior user is responsible for
specifying the benefits upon which the
business case is approved senior user
ensures the desired outcomes of the
project is specified the project
produces products which delivered the
desired outcomes and the expected
benefits the riot from the project
outcomes are realized senior user
provides actual versus forecast benefits
statement ad the benefits reviews senior
supplier is responsible for the supplier
business case if they exist and confirms
that the products required can be
delivered within the expected costs and
our Bible
prepares the business case on behalf of
executive and conducts impact analysis
of any new or revised issues or risks
that affect the projects desirability
viability or achievability
against the original or approving the
project project manager also assesses
and updates the business case at the end
of each management stage and assesses
and reports on project performance at
project closure the role of project
assurance has business assurance
responsibilities it assists in the
development of the business case and
verifies and monitors the business case
against external events and project
progress project assurance also ensures
the project fits with overall program or
corporate strategy and monitors project
finance on behalf of the customer
it ensures the value-for-money solution
is constantly reassessed and monitors
changes to the project plan to identify
any impact on the needs of the business
or the business case finally project
assurance reviews the impact assessments
of potential changes on the business
case and the project plan and verifies
and monitors the benefits review plan
for alignment to corporate or program
management the business case should have
a baseline and therefore be under
configuration management project support
should advise the project manager of any
proposed or actual changes to products
that affect the business case let us
move on to the quiz questions to check
your understanding of the concepts
covered in this lesson
here is a quick recap of what we have
learned in this lesson
the business case presents the optimum
mix of information used to judge whether
the project is and remains desirable
viable and achievable and therefore
worthwhile investing in the senior user
specifies the benefits and is
accountable for the benefits realization
development of the business case may be
delegated to a business analyst or a
project manager
it is the responsibility of the
executive to assure the project
stakeholders that the project remains
desirable viable and achievable at all
times
hello and welcome to prince2 foundation
certification course offered by simply
learn this lesson is about the
organization theme organization is one
the seven themes of prince2 methodology
this theme is based primarily on the
principle defined roles and
responsibilities let us discuss the
objectives of this lesson in the next
screen
after completing this lesson you'll be
able to define key terms in organization
theme explain the prince2 approach to
organization theme identified the roles
and responsibilities in an organization
theme let's look at the purpose of
organization theme in the next screen
the purpose of organization theme is to
define and establish the project's
structure of accountabilities and
responsibilities this theme is based on
the principle of defined roles and
responsibilities prince2 is based on a
customer or supplier environment it
assumes that there will be a customer
who will specify the desired result and
probably pay for the project and
supplier who will provide the resources
and skills to deliver that result let's
discuss the definition of an
organization in the next screen
this is one of the most important prints
to themes people are required to perform
the project activities and so it's
essential to define the project
organization structure beforehand
let's study the key definitions
associated with organization to
understand prince2 methodology these
definitions have to be remembered and
understood
program is a temporary organizational
structure created to coordinate direct
and oversee the implementation of a set
of related projects and activities to
deliver the outcomes and benefits
related to the organization's strategic
objectives program has a longer life
than a single project a project can be a
standalone entity or be a part of a
program of related projects let us
continue our discussion of the
definitions in the following screen
project is a temporary organization
created for delivering one or more
business products according to the
agreed business case prince2 does not
define management jobs to be allocated
to people on a one-to-one basis it
defines roles each of which is defined
by an Associated set of responsibilities
roles might be shared or combined
according to the project's needs but the
responsibilities must always be
allocated let's look into the three
project interests in the next screen
prince2 defines a project as a temporary
organization that is created for the
purpose of delivering one or more
business products according to an agreed
business case the prince2 principle of
defined roles and responsibilities
states that a prince2 project will
always have three primary categories of
stakeholder as seen in the image on the
screen they are business user and
supplier the reason for undertaking a
project is to introduce change to meet
the current business challenges we will
continue our discussion on the three
project interests in the following
screen
the reason for undertaking a project is
to introduce change to meet the current
business challenges the output of the
project should meet a business need
which will justify the investment in the
project
the project should also provide value
for money the executive role is defined
to represent this business interest
viewpoint of the project the ESL
viewpoint should represent who uses the
output to realize the benefits it also
represents the individuals or groups who
will operate maintain or support the
project's output and who will be
impacted by the project's output this
viewpoint is represented by a senior
user role
the supplier viewpoints should present
those who will provide the necessary
skills and produce the project's product
the project may require both in-house
and external supplier teams to create
the project product this viewpoint is
represented by senior supplier role all
the three roles that is executive senior
user and senior supplier are part of the
project board the three rows represent
the three project interests or primary
stakeholders of the project the term
customer is also used in prince2
normally in the context of a commercial
customer-supplier relationship
customer can usually be interpreted as a
collective term for the business and
user interests let us look at an example
which illustrates these three project
interests in the following screen
for example for the project to construct
the Sydney Opera House
the business was NSW state
Conservatorium of music and Ministry of
Public Works the users were the
Australian Ballet Sydney Theatre Company
and Sydney Symphony Orchestra the
suppliers were construction firm civil
and civic and Hornibrook Group Pty
Limited let's discuss the prince2
approach to organisation in the next
screen
prince2 separates the direction and
management of the project from the
delivery of the project's output as seen
in the image on the screen the project
management structure has four levels
three of which represented the project
management team and the fourth which is
outside of the project as per prince2
the four levels of management are
corporate or program management
directing managing and delivering let us
discuss these levels in detail in the
following screen
corporate or program management level is
outside the project management team
however they will be responsible for
commissioning the project this level is
also in charge of identifying the
executive and defining the project level
tolerances within which the project
board will work the second level called
directing is represented by the project
board which is responsible for the
overall direction and management of the
project within the constraints set out
by corporate or program management the
project board is accountable for the
success of the project
the third level called managing is
represented by the project manager who
is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the project within the
constraints set out by the project board
the project managers prime
responsibility is to ensure the project
yields are required products in
accordance with the time cost quality
scope risk and benefit performance goals
the last level is called delivering
representing this level team members or
managers are responsible for delivering
the project's products within defined
time cost and the quality expectations
in the next screen we will look at the
project management team structure
prince2 suggests a strong project
management team structure as seen in the
image on the screen a project management
team structure allows for channels of
communication to decision-making forums
prince2 suggests that the skills
knowledge and experience required for
all roles in the project organization
should be described for effective
project management along with the roles
and responsibilities the reporting
structure and authorities for various
activities should also be defined
prince2 also gives the guidelines on
which roles can be combined if needed
the executive representing the business
viewpoints and seen a user representing
the user viewpoint roles can often be
combined however some of the prince2
responsibilities cannot be shared or
delegated for managing the projects
effectively such as the project manager
and executive roles also the project
manager and project board
decision-making accountability cannot be
delegated
let us discuss all the roles depicted in
this diagram in detail from the
foundation exam prince2 perspective you
should understand the roles and
responsibilities clearly in the next
screen we will discuss the first role
which is executive
the executive is appointed by a
corporate or program management and
eventually is responsible for the
project's success executive is also
responsible for the business case the
executive has to ensure that project
gives value for money and appoints the
rest of the project management team
including project manager
in the following screen we will discuss
the next role which is project manager
let's look at the role of a project
manager in a prince2 project this role
should not be shared it is the project
manager who is responsible but they
today management of a prince2 project
project manager is responsible for the
work of all the prince2 processes except
managing product delivery directing a
project process and appointing the
executive and the project manager in the
pre project starting up a project
process the project manager is
responsible for liaison with project
assurance and project board a project
manager will need to send the highlights
report which reports the progress of the
stage to the project board the project
manager will interact with project
assurance and will seek their active
involvement in developing business case
and benefits review plan if there is a
team manager present in the project
environment the project manager may
delegate responsibilities or developing
specialist products the project manager
will be responsible for day-to-day
management of the team managers and
project support team members usually
project manager comes from the customer
corporate organization however there may
be projects where the project manager
also comes from the supplier
organization in the next screen we will
look at the senior user role
as per Prince - there should be a
representation of the users of the
projects products on the project
management team this role is played by
the senior user or users the primary
responsibility of this role is to
specify the needs of the users for the
specialist products the individuals or
group of individuals performing this
role monitors the solutions from quality
functionality and user friendly
viewpoint against the requirement the
senior user commits the user resources
this role is also responsible for
specifying the benefits and accountable
for demonstrating the realisation of
benefits this role may also be involved
in the post project life we will now
discuss the role of the senior supplier
in the next screen
would consist of executive senior
supplier or suppliers and senior user or
users the project board has authority
and responsibility for the project
however the executive is accountable for
the success of the project and he can
make senior supplier and senior user
accountable for the project
the project board is accountable for the
success or failure of the project in
terms of the business user and supplier
interests
the project board is responsible for
facilitating integration of the project
management team with the functional
units of the participating corporate or
external organizations the project board
should provide the resources and
authorize the funds necessary for the
successful completion of the project
the project board consists of executive
senior users and senior suppliers so all
of them are responsible for providing
the resources required for the project
project board ensures effective
communication both within the project
team and with external stakeholders
there should be a representation from
the team who would be involved in
designing developing facilitating
procuring and implementing the
specialist products of the project this
role is accountable for the quality of
products and for the technical integrity
of the project the scene a supplier
provides supplier resources which can be
internal to the organization or can be
obtained from external vendors or
service providers after understanding
three important roles
let us now discuss the role of a project
board in the following screen
now let's look at the four key
characteristics of a project board
Authority the members of the project
board should be senior enough within the
corporate organization to make strategic
decisions about the project credibility
the credibility of the project board
members within the corporate
organization will affect their ability
to direct the project
ability to delegate a key part of the
project boards role is to ensure that
the project manager is given enough it
space to manage the project by keeping
project board activity at the right
level availability project board should
be available to make decisions and
provide direction to the project manager
in the next screen will understand what
project assurance is
the project board may not have skills
knowledge and or time to perform the
assurance activities for example the
senior supplier may be managing multiple
product lines and do not have sufficient
time for assurance activities for the
projects in that case the project board
may appoint other members of the
corporate organization to take a
specific project assurance role team
members of project assurance report to
project board
personnel involved in project assurance
are also responsible for supporting the
project manager by giving advice and
guidance on issues such as the use of
corporate standards or the correct
personnel to be involved in different
aspects of the project it has to be kept
in mind that the project assurance team
members are not decision-makers ultimate
decision-making power rests with the
project board the project assurance can
review advise and monitor the project
work
it is important to note here that the
project board should not assign any
project assurance roles to the project
manager as they monitor all aspects of
the project's performance and products
independently of the project manager
members of this team may come from an
organization's project management office
PMO for example Environment Canada's
project delivery office guides and
advises the project manager on project
management and it's best practices in
the next screen we will look at the
personnel in charge for change Authority
as per Prince - it is the project
board's responsibility to agree to each
potential change before it is
implemented the project board may wish
to delegate some Authority for approving
or rejecting requests for change or oft
specifications
projects in a dynamic environment which
expects lot of requests for change may
appoint a separate change Authority the
project manager and all the people with
delegated project assurance
responsibilities may act as the change
authority for example the project may be
given an authority to approve the
changes only if the impact on the
timescale is less than five days change
Authority may need to have technical
knowledge to evaluate potential changes
depending on the severity the request
for change could be handled by corporate
or program management by the project
board or it may be delegated to either a
change authority or the project manager
let's discuss the role of the team
manager in the next screen
in prince2 the only optional role is
that of team manager if the project is
small then a project manager may not
appoint a separate team manager the team
manager reports to and looks for
direction from project manager the team
managers primary responsibility is to
ensure production of those products
allocated by the project manager the
project manager should plan the role
during the starting up a project process
or for each stage in the managing stage
boundary process
the project manager allocates work
packages to team managers or team
members
manager is responsible for production of
the allocated products as per the work
package the projects are usually
executed in customer supplier
environment the team manager may come
from the supplier corporate organization
in this case there could be a reporting
line to a senior supplier one important
point to understand is that the
structure of the project management team
does not necessarily reflect seniority
what is important here is the role on
the project for example an executive may
not have the skills for project
assurance however should be able to
represent the business view clearly the
executive should have the authority to
secure funds for the project
manager or even a team manager maybe
more senior in the corporate
organization we will now discuss the
role of the project support in the next
green
this role is not optional project
support is the responsibility of the
project manager if there is a lot of
administrative work or guidance is
required on the use of project
management tools or configuration
management in the project the project
manager may decide to delegate some of
this work to a project support role
project support defaults to the project
manager if it is not otherwise allocated
it could also provide specialist
functions to a project such as planning
or risk management
project support is also responsible for
administering any configuration
management procedure and tools as
defined in the configuration management
strategy
project support and project assurance
roles should be kept separate to
maintain the independence of project
assurance after all project assurance
needs to be independent of the project
manager while the project support team
reports to the project manager in the
next screen we'll find out how to work
with the project team
it is important to understand how
project team works together knowledge of
different types of personalities and how
they work together help the project
manager in assembling balanced teams
that can work effectively during a
project extra care should be exercised
by the project manager in case of
part-time teams for example reporting
needs may be different and stringent in
case of part-time workers it's also
important to understand that at the
start of the project team members may
need training few examples of trainings
can be training on any process and
standard to be used on the project that
is configuration management procedures
progress reporting and quality methods
training on introduction to the project
and its goals and training on prince2
processes and terminologies in the next
screen
we'll find out how projects fit into the
overall corporate organization
there are usually two structures in a
corporate organization the first is line
management or functional management in
this setup project managers can find
difficulties when managing
cross-functional projects due to the
disagreement on overall leadership from
various groups the second structure is
Center of Excellence concept
their structure consists of essential
standards unit which defines standards
such as processes templates and tools
and provide skills training and possibly
independent assurance functions to a
number of projects in the next screen we
will learn about organizations working
with stakeholders
people are required to perform
activities as it cannot be performed
solely by machines
a professional project manager must
understand the importance of
stakeholders in a project in prince2
terms there are some individuals or
groups who are not part of the project
management team but are affected by the
project or who may need to interact with
the project
these groups or individuals are the ones
who can support or oppose the project
you gain or lose as a result of the
project delivery or the ones who
consider project as a threat or
enhancement to their position there are
active supporters or blockers for the
project and its progress
a project manager should perform the
stakeholder analysis to understand the
stakeholder engagement and find the
information needs of the stakeholders
though there are number of stakeholders
involved in the project all the
information are not shared with every
stakeholder in the next screen we'll
discuss the procedure for stakeholder
engagement
let us now understand the six step
procedure for stakeholder engagement as
suggested by office of government
commerce UK's managing successful
programs the first step is identifying
stakeholders which involves identifying
individuals and groups affected by the
project grouping similar stakeholders
together helps in effective addressing
of key messages
this step answers who are the
stakeholders
the second step is creating and
analyzing stakeholder profiles from a
project perspective it is very important
to analyze the importance of each
stakeholder there is a need to gain an
understanding of the influences
interests and attitudes of stakeholders
they have the potential to affect the
success of the project
so it is very important to address the
perceptions even if it is erroneous and
negative for the project this step
answers what do the stakeholders think
of the project
this step answers the how to engage with
the stakeholder question by defining
stakeholder engagement strategy it is
important to define how the project can
effectively engage the stakeholders
including defining the responsibilities
of communication and key messages which
need to be conveyed the four step when
to engage with stakeholders is planning
the timing of engagements defining the
methods frequency of communication is
critical or project success
they each interested stakeholder the
information sought from the project
requires to be understood timing in what
format and how the information needs to
be sent and lastly the sender and
recipient of the communication
the fifth step is actually performing
activities to engage stakeholders do
involves carrying out planned
engagements and communication
success of effective stakeholder
engagement lies in measuring
effectiveness of stakeholders engagement
results step is all about checking the
benefits of the current stakeholder
engagement activities by assessing the
current stakeholders who have been
identified their information needs and
the communication channels being used in
a prince2 project this measurement may
be undertaken by the project assurance
for example Transport for London
regularly sends out emails to its
customers asking for their opinions
before taking major decisions the
customers who have registered on the
website are included in this mailing
list in the next screen we will look at
an example to illustrate this concept
for example a
the bank states that stakeholder
engagement helps to minimize risks
identify ideas for new products and
services heads for a project they
typically do the following identifying
stakeholders by conducting regular
dialogue across a number of business and
functional areas on an annual basis
which includes consideration of silence
stakeholders such as future generations
and the environment
a global stakeholder database is used
for managing information and
communicating to our stakeholders this
list includes government regulators
customer and community groups suppliers
investors and employees defining
stakeholder engagement strategy a and
Z's strategy is based on the principles
of congruence consultative collaborative
creative communicate and commitment
approaches include dialog in the form of
stakeholder forums participation in
multi-stakeholder initiatives and
meetings
saltation through surveys focus groups
and online feedback forms communication
through CS newsletter and website
employee engagement through annual
survey my voice and through online CEO
chat feedback forum
engaging stakeholders NZ holds forums
for specific stakeholder groups each
year to seek formal input into their
business agenda these forums are
attended by a consistent group of
stakeholders along with new participants
ensuring progress and tracking of issues
that have been raised in past forums
together with the identification of new
and emerging issues measuring
effectiveness ANZ does this through the
shareholder review annual general

needs for each interested party the
project manager is responsible for
documenting the communication management
strategy for example project manager
prepared the communication management
strategy while initiating the project
however during the project one of the
suppliers changed during the next age
boundary after the supplier is of
boarded and the new supplier is on
boarded the project the communications
management strategy needs to be updated
by deleting the old supplier and putting
the name of the new supplier instead

management strategy should be reviewed
at each stage boundary and while
