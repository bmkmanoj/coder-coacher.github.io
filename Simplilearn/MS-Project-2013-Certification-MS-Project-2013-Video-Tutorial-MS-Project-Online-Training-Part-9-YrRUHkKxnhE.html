resources working on multiple projects
typically in a company several projects
will be in operation at a given time
sometimes the same resources work on
more than one project the project
manager does not need to recreate the
same resources for every project file
and can create a resource pool for these
resources all projects link to the
resource pool are called
share projects if the project manager
changes the cost or working time for
resources in the resource pool this
information gets updated in all the
projects linked to the resource pool to
view availability of resources that have
been assigned to multiple projects the
project manager must ensure that their
names have been entered in the resource
pool if the project manager is working
with other project users across a
network the resource pool can be stored
at a central location such as a network
server and the project managers can
share the common resource pool in the
subsequent slide we will learn to create
a shared resource pool
creating a resource pool is almost
identical to creating a regular project
file the project manager can create a
new blank project by selecting blank
project in the file tab of Microsoft
Project 2013 resources can be added
through the resource sheet just like it
is done for a normal project the steps
to create a resource pool are shown here
in the resource sheet the project
manager can add resources and resource
information such as cost availability
overtime etc the project manager needs
to ensure that the file is saved after
creating the resources but before
creating any tasks the resource pool is
thus created resource information can be
imported from Microsoft Outlook active
directory or a HR database resources can
also be copied from a project file and
paste it into the resource pool once
created the resource pool can be opened
as a read-only file if the project
manager wants to view resource
information yet allow others to make
changes to the pool the resource pool
can also be opened with a readwrite file
if the project manager wants to update
resource data the change will be
reflected in other projects let us learn
to create a shared resource pool through
a demo in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
