statistical analysis system or SAS
course offered by simply learned in this
video you'll see some interesting
highlights of this course have you faced
challenges during data processing
because of the size of the data have you
felt the need to combine separate
compare and extract data based on a
specific requirement as interpreting
data been difficult because you couldn't
manipulate it have you ever wanted to
learn the most in-demand analytics
technology SAS can help you achieve all
this and more it offers a variety of
data analysis tool that can deal with
large data SAS provides and into in
solution for the entire analytic cycle
it's the undisputed leader in the
commercial analytic space SAS is an
integrated system of software solutions
which enables you to perform the
following tasks data entry retrieval and
management report writing and graphics
designer
statistical and mathematical analysis
business forecasting and decision
support operations research and project
management applications development data
science is concerned with organizing
packing and delivering data SAS can help
in all three stages with the tools at
their disposal in SAS data scientists
can organize analyze and provide
interpretations or results SAS has an
edge over other tools with its huge
array of statistical functions
user-friendly graphical user interface
and technical support industries that
use tests include automotive banking
capital markets consumer goods defense
health care higher education
manufacturing media retail sports
entertainment and so on demand for SAS
professionals has increased dramatically
compared to other data analysis software
professionals if you are someone who is
interested in the field of data science
and analytics then this course is ideal
for you all you need is an analytical
bent of mind and the rest is taken care
of
by the data science with class course it
covers the essentials of statistical
techniques and basics of programming
using this tool simply learns data
science Swift as course will enable you
to understand the role of data scientist
use the SAS tool apply data manipulation
and optimization techniques work on
advanced statistical concepts like
clustering linear regression and
decision trees apply data analysis
methods to real-world business problems
understand and apply predictive modeling
techniques this course enables you to
learn the key concepts of SAS which are
important for data analytics using
practical examples let's start this
lesson by defining what statistical
analysis system is statistical analysis
system or SAS is a software suite
developed by the SAS Institute for
advanced analytics multivariate analyses
business intelligence data management
and predictive analytics SAS is a set of
solutions for enterprise wide business
users and it provides a powerful force
generation programming language for
performing tasks such as data entry
retrieval and management statistical and
mathematical analysis business planning
forecasting and decision support
operations research and project
management and quality improvement
