of certified business analysis
professional cpap preparatory course
offered by simply learn this module
deals with planning the analysis
approach in the first module we were
introduced to CPAP in this module we'll
discuss the first step in the analysis
process and the approach to plan the
analysis during this important step in
analysis the BA needs to gather enough
information to get an idea of the
company its history markets competition
and organization before meeting the
project sponsor and other stakeholders
he or she also needs to examine how the
organization operates in other words
clients like to see the BA up and
running as quickly as possible
another important point to be kept in
mind while gathering preliminary
information is to maintain an open mind
as the on-site situation may be
different from the preliminary
information let us begin by looking into
the agenda of this module in the next
slide this slide provides an overview of
what will be covered in this module the
topics dealt with are a part of the
normal document and action plan
preparations for pre elicitation process
we will be discussing the two general
types of business analysis scenarios
then we will move to document analysis
which the BA needs to review prior to
elicitation we will also look into a
review of the enterprise analysis
followed by an analysis of the sponsor
and stakeholders the finding of roles
and responsibilities and the pre licit
ation action planning once all these
documents have been set up the BA will
be ready to develop the output of
elicitation phase these outputs will
then be the input to the development of
a formalized documentation for
identifying the business needs
developing a solution scope building the
all-important business case and
formalizing stakeholders roles and
responsibilities
throughout the business analysis process
same inputs can be used many times these
inputs can be updated as new information
is gathered during the progress of the
analysis in other words at this
preliminary information gathering stage
the items in the agenda will morph over
time and can be used in multiple
iterations throughout the process let us
discuss the general business analysis
scenarios in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
