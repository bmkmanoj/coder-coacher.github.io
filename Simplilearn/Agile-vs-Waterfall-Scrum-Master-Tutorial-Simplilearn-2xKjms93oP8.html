management the traditional waterfall
approach and the agile approach
originally agile developed as a way to
better manage software development
projects agile emerged in the late 1990s
specifically in response to the
challenges encountered when managing
software development projects using the
traditional waterfall approach
specifically addressing the burdens of
heavy documentation and frequent changes
in requirements agile techniques and
best practices began to emerge and
gained prominence in software
development projects this led to a
meeting in February 2001 in Park City
Utah where seventeen leading software
developers wrote what has become known
as the agile manifesto let's review the
agile manifesto for software development
together we are in covering better ways
of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it through this work
we have come to value individuals and
interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation customer collaboration
over contract negotiation responding to
change over following a plan that is
while there is value in the items on the
right we value the items on the Left
more before you take your agile scrum
Foundation certification exam I
recommend you memorize these four lines
we call them the statement of value and
you can see that on the right hand side
those are items that are more relevant
for the traditional or waterfall
approach and on the Left you have those
things that are more agile in nature
let's review each of these four lines
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools clearly any project
requires processes and tools however
individuals and their interaction
deliver better results when the emphasis
is not on the processes and the tools
working software over comprehensive
documentation documentation here refers
to things like status reports progress
reports detailed specifications which do
not really demonstrate any real progress
or value therefore the emphasis is on
working software that can be delivered
and demonstrated customer collaboration
over contract negotiation organizations
need to be flexible and accommodating
rather than following detailed
definitions listed in contracts
responding to change over following the
plan in agile small pieces of working
software are delivered to the customer
incremental II and the customer is
involved in the project from the
beginning to the end so an agile we are
responsive to the customer and willing
to make even mid-course corrections in
order to deliver to the customer the
value that the customer wants remember
you will be tested on these four lines
so again I urge you to memorize them in
fact knowing these four lines and having
a feel for what they mean will actually
help you get to the correct answer on
many questions in the exam here we can
see what it might look like to manage a
project using the waterfall approach you
can see that the system and software
requirements would need to be identified
and documented upfront that would be
followed by the necessary analysis and
program design work then comes the
actual coding and testing that's then
followed by the handoff to the customer
or to operations as you can see there is
a heavy upfront cost of documentation as
well as the status reporting that would
be to be done during the course of the
project you can also see that it would
be difficult to respond to change in
this kind of an approach in fact the
Standish Group issued a study that
showed that software development
projects using the agile approach
seed three times more often than when
using the waterfall approach the
Standish group defined project success
as being on time on budget and
delivering all of the planned features
the study summarized as follows the
agile process is the universal remedy
for software development project failure
software applications developed through
the agile process have three times the
success rate of the traditional
waterfall method and a much lower
percentage of time and cost overruns
