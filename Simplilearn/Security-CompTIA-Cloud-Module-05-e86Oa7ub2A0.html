important steps to be initiated in the
production environment
it takes care of authentication
authorization and accounting we'll learn
about various network security concepts
in the coming slides
let's begin the discussion with ACL
access control lists ACLs are the
network filters utilized by routers and
some switches to permit and restrict
data flows into and out of network
interfaces a network filter refers to
the ability of monitoring the data flow
of a system when an ACL is configured on
an interface the network device analyzes
the data which is passing through the
interface compares it to the criteria
described in the ACL and either permits
the data to flow or prohibits it ACL s
are used for many reasons the primary
reason is to provide a basic level of
security for the network ACLs are not as
complex and in-depth in providing
protection but they do provide
protection on higher speed interfaces
where if the line rate speed is
important and the firewalls are
restrictive in addition ACLs are also
used to restrict updates for routing
from network peers and they can be
instrumental in defining flow control
for network traffic further ACLs /
routers are not as complex or robust but
they do offer a significant amount of
firewall capability as an IT network or
security professional placement of the
defenses is critical to protect the
network its assets and the data ACLs
should be placed on external routers to
filter traffic against less desirable
networks and known vulnerable protocols
one of the most common methods in this
case is to set up a DMZ or demilitarized
zone in the network this architecture is
normally implemented with two separate
network devices in the next slide we
will discuss
detail about DMZ</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
