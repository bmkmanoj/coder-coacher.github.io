financial risk manager frm pop one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use foundation of risk
management we appreciate your decision
to get frm certification you have taken
an important step in your career and we
hope this course will not only help you
pass the exams but will be of great help
in your career the entire course is
split into four parts and each part has
10 to 12 sections or presentations let
us begin from the first line of our
curriculum agenda in this presentation
we will learn about risk the types of
risks such as business risk non-business
risk and financial risk the entire
certification program is centered on
financial risk financial risk has been
further divided into credit risk market
risk liquidity risk operational risk and
legal risk after discussing various
types of risk we will learn how risk is
managed what tools are currently in use
for managing risk and the advancement in
risk management then we will learn the
basics of a very important tool for risk
management VAR or value at risk its
application and a few examples
types of risk starting from the very
basic question what is risk risk can be
defined as the chances of having an
unexpected negative outcome firms are
exposed to various sources of risk which
can be business risk non-business risk
or financial risk business risks are
risks purposely taken by firms in order
to maximize shareholder value and
profits these pertain to risks taken in
marketing designing product innovation
etc for example a company can
aggressively market its new product
hoping to get higher sales so by
incurring high costs in marketing the
company is taking a calculated risk on
its own and cannot blame others if the
campaign fails apart from the business
risks there are also non-business risks
on which the firm's have no control
these types of risks arise due to shifts
in the political and economic
environment that may affect the firm for
example in the late 1980s the threat
from the Soviet Union disappeared and
has led to a decrease in defense
spending adversely affecting defense
industries financial risk is going to be
the main topic of discussion throughout
the frm curriculum this type of risk
arises from losses in financial markets
due to movements in stock prices
currencies interest rates we will cover
financial risk in more detail in full
coming slides types of financial risk
financial risk is classified in various
types of risks market risk arises due to
movement in prices of securities
currencies interest rates or any
financial instrument to which the
company is exposed the risk can be in
absolute terms such as the dollar value
of the exposed risk or it could be
relative that is risk with respect to
the benchmark for example a company that
earns index return if investing on any
index fund is exposed to relative risk
if it invests in
the other portfolio these to market
risks are called absolute risk and
relative risk respectively market risk
may be classified into directional risk
and non directional risk in directional
risk there is risk due to direction of
movement of the price for example for a
company having funds invested in say
portfolio eggs any decrease in the value
of the components of this portfolio will
result in loss for the company a
non-directional risk the risk does not
depend upon any practical direction of
the price movement non directional risks
could be basis risks or volatility risks
basis risk is the risk that the price of
the hedging instrument and the price of
the asset being hedged are not perfectly
correlated volatility risk arises due to
chance in implied volatility of the
market for example if a company has
invested in options then there might be
risk due to change in volatility of the
market options are derivative
instruments that will be covered later
in the curriculum types of financial
risk credit means owning a sum of money
to another party you must have used
credit from banks while using a credit
card if anyone is unable to pay his
credit card bill this will be a default
and the bank is exposed to credit risk
similarly there can be various scenarios
when one party has an obligation to
fulfill whether there is a change in the
ability of one party to honor the
obligation it is termed as credit event
a default situation is the worst credit
event credit risk is further classified
as sovereign risk and settlement risk
under sovereign risk a party faces a
situation when the change in policies by
a foreign country makes it impossible to
honor the obligation for example a
country may restrict foreign exchange
transactions in settlement risk the risk
occurs on the same day when one party
makes the payment while the others fails
to honor the obligation in return for
example a party transfers the money into
another party's account but the other
party fails to transfer the required
basket of securities in return types of
financial risk liquidity risk arises
whenever there are transactions of huge
size for example a company wants to sell
shares worth 100 million dollars but
there might not be sufficient buyers for
such a huge amount in such cases the
price of the shares might decline when
they might not usually have declined
alternatively any buy order for a huge
lot might need to increase in the stock
price such risks that arise due to
insufficient buyers and sellers are also
called asset liquidity risk another type
of liquidity risk funding liquidity risk
arises when a party fails to fund the
required amount during times of margin
calls or need to increase collateral in
a hedged position the concepts of margin
calls and hedging will be dealt in
detail later in the curriculum types of
financial risk operational risks arise
when there is a management or system
failure inside the firm due to poor
controls technological failure
miscalculations human errors and other
factors that might adversely affect the
firm in many cases the employees might
falsify information and misinterpret
financial data purposely these can be
termed as frauds sometimes there can be
human errors under lack of systemic
control and supervision another risk
called model risk arises when firms
wrongly apply the financial model for
calculating their positions or risk
types of financial risk sometimes there
are legal constraints while executing
any financial transactions a perfect
example is the case of Procter &amp;amp; Gamble
which had lost 157 million dollars in a
complex swap
causing a shareholder to file a lawsuit
against it the company had to face legal
proceedings before writing off the
losses such risks are termed as legal
risks usually in the case of credit
default the party files a lawsuit
against the defaulter the concept of
swaps will be discussed at length later
in the curriculum
summary of risk types summarizing the
various risk types financial risks are
classified as market credit liquidity
and operational risks market risk could
be directional or non directional
absolute or relative risks non
directional risk to be basis risks or
volatility risks liquidity risks are
further classified as asset liquidity
risk and funding liquidity risks credit
risks include credit event risk
sovereign risk and settlement risks
finally operational risks include fraud
risk people risk model risk and legal
risks
managing financial risk having learned
the various types of risk we see that it
is imperative for a firm to have a sound
risk management practice various tools
have been used to manage risk
advancement in technology and research
has brought new tools for managing risk
such as VAR derivatives have been the
most widely used tool for managing risk
that are now used to manufacture some
complex hedging and structured products
these will be covered later in the
course for now let's begin with the
basis of derivatives derivatives are
private contracts and as the name
implies they derive their price from the
underlying assets such as stocks bonds
currency etc how the price is derived
will be discussed with the help of an
example in the next slide various types
of derivatives in use our forwards
futures options and swaps each one of
these will be discussed at length in
separate modules later in the curriculum
managing financial risk in the given
example a trader wants to purchase 100
stocks of Microsoft next month and wants
to fix the rate with other party now the
rates at which he will purchase his dogs
next month from the other party will be
fixed now through a private contract the
reason why the party wants to fix the
price now is that he does not want to
take a risk in case the price increases
abnormally next month now how do we
arrive at the price of the contract if
both the parties expect that the price
will increase in the coming month then
the party willing to sell at a fixed
price will agree only to a price higher
managing financial risk VAR or value at
risk is the most innovative and widely
used tool in the management of market
risk this is used to quantify market
risk in absolute terms the value of var
gives the worst loss to a portfolio over
a horizon at a given confidence in
of all for example if the VAR of the
portfolio at five percent confidence is
1 million dollars then we can say that
there is a five percent chance that the
portfolio can lose 1 million dollars
today companies use a technique to set
aside the amount equivalent to the VAR
they have calculated in case they are
exposed to such loss cases the
conservative companies sell aside an
amount of var that is calculated at a
very low confidence level say of one
percent that is they calculate the worst
loss in one percent of the cases
obviously the value is higher than the
VAR calculated at say five percent
confidence in the upcoming slides we
will see how this value is calculated
from the return distribution managing
financial risk many times the companies
face risk from multiple sources and
those risks can be credit risk market
risk operational risk and legal risk
also sometimes the credit risk can be
decreased by investing in the market
thus transferring credit risk to market
risk also using VAR to measure just the
market risk might not be helpful if the
company is facing multiple risks as such
today an enterprise-wide risk management
practice is followed and a balanced
approach to managing risk is targeted
that aims to limit each of the risks to
an optimal level VAR value at risk in
slide 12 we have learned the concept of
VAR in this slide we will see how a
typical var calculation is done in the
given diagram the return data of a stock
is plotted we see that most of the data
is centered on the mean and the number
of observations for extreme returns
diminish rapidly into a tail as we move
further on either side of the return
suppose that we segregate the worst five
percent of the returns and find that 95
sent of the observations have a return
of more than minus ten percent that is
only five percent of the observations
have returned below minus ten percent
this means that if we rely upon
historical data then there is a five
percent chance that the loss could be
more than minus ten percent hence if we
want to be five percent confident then
we can set aside this value as a safe
limit the exact dollar value can be
obtained by multiplying ten percent with
the total portfolio value that is if the
portfolio value is 150 million dollars
then VAR at five percent confidence will
be ten percent of 150 million dollars
that is 15 million dollars extreme
market movements several recent and
significant events have increased the
market the market volatility and led to
growth of risk management industry here
are the examples of such extreme market
events 1973 stocks the oil price high
inflation volatile interest rates 1987
Black Monday minus twenty three percent
decline in US stock prices 1997 Asian
contagion decimated asian equity markets
1998 Russian debt default and the
collapse of ltcm 2001 September 11
attacks on world trade center and the
2001 US equity market collapse 2007 to
2009 credit crisis resulting from the
mortgage market meltdown and huge
amounts of Bank leverage increased
market volatility caused significant
financial losses which could have been
avoided by appropriate use of financial
risk management tools firms also have
become more exposed to economic and
financial variables due to bank
deregulation and globalization all these
have led to the growth of risk
management industry because
financial institutions are now exposed
to a wide variety of risks functions and
purposes of financial institutions
financial risk management is the process
of detecting assessing and managing
financial risks financial institutions
serve as financial intermediaries for
managing financial risk as part of this
function they create markets and
instruments to share and hedge risks
provide risk advisory services and act
as a counterparty by assuming the risk
of others other risk management tools a
stop loss limit seeks to limit the
amount of loss on the position by
eliminating the position after a
cumulative loss threshold has been
exceeded notional limits of a position
is a limit on the notional amount
invested in a position or asset exposure
limits are limits to risk factor
exposures var is an ex ante measure and
captures exposures to risk factors and
accounts for Co variation in risk
factors var is comparable across
different business units with different
assets and risk characteristics
valuation and risk management using VAR
valuation is the process of discounting
the expected future cash flows of an
asset to determine the current price so
the expected value of an asset is the
mean value for the distribution of
possible values the AR is a risk
management tool estimates the future
distributions of asset values with a
focus on the lower tail of the return
distribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
