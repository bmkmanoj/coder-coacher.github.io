course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project
management framework a project is a
temporary endeavor undertaken to create
a unique product service or result for
example developing a new product service
or result constructing a building
industrial plant or infrastructure and
implementing improving or enhancing
existing business processes and
procedures in the next screen we will
focus on the characteristics of a
project a project can be distinguished
based on its characteristics the
definition describes two characteristics
of a project first it is temporary in
nature temporary here does not mean
short in duration a project can extend
for long duration based on the
requirements for example creating a new
indigenous missile defense system for a
country however there is always a
definite plan start and end date for a
project it cannot go on indefinitely
secondly the project is supposed to
produce a unique output the output could
be a product service or result there can
be many common activities between two
projects but the outcome of each project
should be unique in some way or the
other now let us look at what marks the
end of a project a project ends when
either the objectives are met or the
project is terminated because the
objectives will not or cannot be met the
other reason to terminate the project
can be that the need for the output of
the project does not exist anymore
usually the sponsor of the project takes
a call about the closure of the project
it is important to differentiate project
work from regular operational work for
example your office receptionist does
the same work every day of picking any
incoming call and directing the call to
the right person in the office this is
an ongoing
repetitive work and can be classified as
operation operations unlike projects are
neither temporary nor unique creating a
new software system to effectively track
your customer complaint can be an
example of a project when the software
is successfully developed the project
objective is met which marks the end of
the project when you start using this
software to track customer complaints
you are entering into the operations
phase in the next screen let us now look
into project management as defined in
the PMBOK guide project management is
the application of knowledge skills and
tools and techniques applied to project
activities to meet the project
requirements project management is
achieved by proper application and
integration of the 47 processes project
application and integration means these
processes should be executed in the
right manner as well as in the right
order in the next screen let us discuss
how to manage a project program
management is defined as the application
of knowledge skills tools and techniques
to a program to meet the program
requirements and to obtain benefits and
control not available by managing
projects individually as defined in
PMBOK guide a program is a group of
related projects which when managed as a
group in a coordinated fashion provides
benefits and control that are not
available while managing them
individually these benefits could be
from decreased risk economies of scale
improved management of dependencies
delivery of additional capabilities
optimal utilization of shared resources
and so on let us now learn the various
features of program management random
projects cannot be grouped together as a
program the projects in a program should
be related in some way or the other and
there should be some value added in
managing them together a project may not
be a part of any program but a program
will always have projects a project can
also be executed as a standalone
a program is designed to deliver some
strategic benefits value to the
organization these benefits can be
tangible or intangible examples of
tangible benefit could be increased
profit margins or operational cost
savings examples of intangible benefits
could be improved team morale or
building up certain competencies while a
project manager focuses relentlessly on
the fulfillment of the project's
requirements that is scope cost time
quality a program manager needs to focus
on ensuring that the organizational
benefits are realized in the next screen
let us understand what a portfolio is
portfolio is yet another term used along
with project and program a portfolio may
have multiple projects and programs that
are managed as a group to achieve
strategic objectives note that all
projects and programs in a portfolio may
not be necessarily interdependent or
directly related a portfolio can be
created based on the business objectives
for example an IT service company can
have a portfolio named Japanese projects
which is formed with an aim to take over
the Japanese markets by giving more
attention to these projects within this
portfolio similar projects can be
managed as a program and all banking
projects from Japan can be managed as a
banking program in the next screen let
us discuss portfolio management
portfolio management is the centralized
management of one or more portfolios
this includes identifying prioritizing
authorizing managing and controlling
projects programs and other related work
to achieve strategic business objectives
therefore whether the company should
have Japanese projects as portfolio or
not is decided buying portfolio
management in the next screen let us
understand the relationship between
portfolios programs and projects the
image on the screen will help you to
understand the terms
portfolios programs and projects a
portfolio is part of an organization's
overall strategy it represents a
conscious decision by an organization to
invest in the portfolio the overall
objectives of a portfolio are then
cascaded down to the lower level
components the components could be sub
portfolios programs or projects these
components can further be broken down
into smaller components for ease of
management although a project may not
contain operations a program or a
portfolio it can include other work this
other work may comprise training and
development customer support and
services etc if the other work has
synergy with the overall objectives and
adds to the capability to deliver the
higher-level benefits then it can be
included in the program or portfolio as
well in the next screen we will discuss
project management office project
management office or PMO is a specific
type of body or department within an
organization PMO performs several roles
in the organization and these can
broadly be classified as primary roles
and other roles typically the PMO may
take up any one or a combination of the
three primary roles it provides the
policies methodologies and tools and
templates for managing projects within
the organization it provides support and
training in organization on how to
manage projects and finally it provides
project managers for different ongoing
projects in the organization PMO may
also help in managing inter dependencies
between the projects selecting managing
and deploying shared or dedicated
project resources if need be terminating
a project and organising lessons learnt
sessions and maintaining the project
management knowledge base for an
organization in the next screen we will
discuss how to manage the triple
constraints
any project can be done successfully if
there is no constraint on time or there
is unlimited budget available
unfortunately that is not true in real
life a project is performed within some
constraint and these constraints are
usually competing therefore if you
change one it would affect the other for
example if the project duration
increases it would lead to increase in
the project cost as well triple
constraint is a term that originally
referred to the three competing project
constraints within which the projects
are performed these constraints are
costs time and scope quality is a
primary concern for a project manager
therefore the project manager has to
make trade-offs to keep the scope cost
time quality plane in balance to achieve
the balance the project manager also
needs to manage other aspects of the
project for instance the people
stakeholders risks communication and
procurements the project manager plays
the essential role of integrating all
these different aspects of project
management in the PMP examination you
can expect business scenario based
questions focusing on the triple
constraints in the next screen let us
understand who a stakeholder is a
stakeholder can be defined as the one
whose interests may positively or
negatively be affected or perceived to
be affected by the decision activity or
outcome of the project as per the
definition the project team project
manager project sponsor PMO office
customer etc are the stakeholders of the
project a project sponsor is the one who
gives a go-ahead for a project and
provides the necessary resources to
execute the project therefore the head
of projects in the organization who
provides a green signal to start a
project and allocates required resources
to the project is the project sponsor a
project sponsor is usually somebody
placed high up in the organizational
hierarchy
the Performing organization that is the
organization in which the work of the
project is being carried out in the next
screen let us look at stakeholder
management one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to manage stakeholders a project manager
has to involve the stakeholders from the
beginning of the project until the end
so they are aware of every step a
project manager has to take up specific
activities for stakeholder management
identifying both internal and external
stakeholders missing out any stakeholder
can be disastrous for a project a
stakeholder who is identified towards
the end of the project may come up with
his own requirement at that stage and
incorporating them can be risky
determining stakeholder requirements
after identifying all the stakeholders
the project manager also needs to ensure
that their requirements are clearly
identified sometimes stakeholders might
themselves not know of their
requirements and it is the job of the
project manager to get them right by
doing a proper stakeholder requirement
analysis determining stakeholder
expectations stakeholders might also
have some unstated expectations which
need to be clarified to see if it can
become a project requirement it is again
the role of the project manager to
determine the stakeholders expectation
communicating with stakeholders
once all the stated and unstated
stakeholder requirements are known the
project manager as part of stakeholder
analysis should focus on communicating
them regularly to keep stakeholders
involved in the project once you
understand the practices of stakeholder
management it will be easier for you to
answer scenario-based questions and the
examination in the next screen let us
look at the various organization
structure projects are performed in an
organization and the functioning of the
organization might affect the project
the different organization structured
types explained here are based on the
level of authority that a project
manager
tend to in those organizations in a
functional type of organization the
organization is grouped by the area of
specialization within different
functional areas for instance marketing
accounting engineering etc are
departments within the organization each
employee typically reports to a
functional manager in such types of
organization normally projects are
undertaken within the department itself
if a project requires any assistance
from another department the request
moves from the head of the requesting
department to the head of the concerned
department the team members do their
normal departmental work in addition to
the project work the next type of
organization is projectized organization
in such organisations there are no
departments the organization's resources
mostly work on projects team members
report to a project manager the project
manager has complete control over the
resources when the project is completed
either they move on to another project
or they look for some job outside the
company they do not have a department
for themselves the third type of
organization is a matrix organization
which is a blend of functional and
projectized organizational structure a
team member belongs to a department as
well as they are part of a project team
in such organization team members have
two bosses one their department head and
the second their project manager since
there are two bosses here this type of
organization is further classified into
three different types they are weak
strong and balanced matrix organization
so out of the two bosses that team
members have in matrix organization if
the project manager has more authority
over the team member such organizations
are called strong matrix where the
functional manager has more authority
it's a weak matrix organization if they
both share equal Authority then it is a
balanced organization
there is another term that you might
find in the exam called tight matrix
this generally refers to a co-located
team that is a team that has been placed
in the same location to enhance their
performance in the PMP exam if there is
no mention of the organization type you
can assume it to be a matrix
organization let us look at each of
these organization structures in detail
in the next screen let us look at
functional organization in a functional
organization the resources of the
organization are grouped by functions
sometimes called departments examples of
functions could be sales finance
administration manufacturing etc each
function plays a definite role in the
organization and is headed by a
functional head or supervisor all the
resources in such an organization report
directly into their functions therefore
a salesperson would report into the
sales organizational hierarchy a
purchase executive would report into
procurement and so on you would notice
that in a functional organization the
project manager's role is not explicitly
called out when a functional
organization embarks on a project each
of the functions that are involved may
volunteer some resources to work on the
project one of these resources may end
up playing the project managers role the
resource assignments may not even be
full-time and sometimes even the project
manager is part-time since the project
manager has no authority over any of the
resources they are dependent on the
functional heads this makes it more
challenging for the project manager to
coordinate in the team however
functional organizations provide an
opportunity for specialization for
example if a purchase executive was
reporting into the purchase department
that executive would have exposure to
all the purchasing that happens within
the organization and has a well-defined
career path in functional organizations
project management happens at the
functional head level next
let us look at the projectized
organization and the next screen the
project eyes Dorgan ization has all the
resources aligned around projects the
project managers have complete control
over the resources working on their
projects the biggest advantage of the
projectized organization is that the
resources have loyalty to their projects
and project execution becomes easier
this kind of structure is suitable for
organizations whose work is in the
nature of projects there are few
disadvantages in this structure as well
firstly the role of the resource is over
once the project is completed secondly
highly specialized roles within a
project may not be fully occupied all
the time for example a purchase
executive may have worked for selected
periods on a project while purchase
activities are going on however for the
rest of the period their capability may
not be optimally utilized there is less
scope for functional specialization as
the project boundaries limit the kind of
work for the resources each project
manager is in charge of a project and
its resources next let us look at the
matrix organization in a matrix
organization the resources report to the
functional managers and are managed by
the project managers as well there might
even be a function that represents all
the project managers in the organization
which provides project management
expertise the matrix structure has three
variants commonly referred to as weak
balanced and strong in a weak matrix the
authority of the project manager is the
weakest and strongest in a strong matrix
structure the titles given to project
managers and functional or weak matrix
organizations are project expediter or
project coordinator they would be called
project managers in a balanced or strong
matrix structure and have slightly more
authority over the time of the team
members the advantage of the matrix
structure is that resources can be
optimally utilized
while preserving the capacity of the
project managers to get projects
executed efficiently resources can
specialized in their functions and have
stability in their careers also
contribute to the projects at the same
time potentially
the disadvantage of matrix organization
is that the communication overhead
increases significantly this is because
every resource in the organization
belongs into a project and into a
function leading to a dual reporting
structure in a matrix organization
project management happens at project
resource level in the next screen let us
summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of different
organizational structures each
organization structure has its own set
of advantages and disadvantages the
advantage of functional organizations is
that resources may find clearly defined
career paths and achieve specialisation
and skill development in their
respective fields it will be a flexible
workforce since only one manager will be
responsible avoiding confusion the
disadvantage of such organization type
is that project work is hampered
department work is always given higher
priority than the project work in
addition there is no career path in
project management which leads to lower
interest in projects in the case of the
projectized organization one of the
clear advantages is better communication
within the projects since Project Work
is the only work team members are doing
it also leads to loyalty towards the
project goals the disadvantage of such
organization type is the inefficient use
of resources because every project team
has their own support function therefore
this might lead to the duplication of
effort it also leads to the resources
being left with no work since their
roles are over once the project is
completed
it also hampers skill development
because the project requirements dictate
what kind of work team members perform
at different stages on a project now let
us
look at the matrix organization it also
has the advantage of better coordination
and maximum utilization of resources
however the disadvantage is the higher
potential for conflict among the
managers which might lead to
communication complexity and overhead
management in the next screen let us
focus on the comparison on project
lifecycle and product lifecycle project
lifecycle spans the initiation of a
project until the closure of the project
the product lifecycle on the other hand
also encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases a typical product
life cycle starts with conception of the
product and goes until its withdrawal
from the market the withdrawal might be
because it becomes obsolete or there is
no further need for the product in the
market a product has a long life cycle a
product can require or spawn many
projects over its life for example a
project and product conception phase
could be to determine customer needs
whereas a project during product
maturity phase could be used to perform
competitive analysis typically a product
life cycle is longer than the project
life cycle a project also has its own
life cycle and this life cycle depends
upon the industry and the organization
within which the project is being
executed sometimes different
organizations within the same industry
use different life cycles there can be
questions in the exam based on the
comparison of project lifecycle and
product life cycle so understanding the
differences will be useful in answering
such questions in the next screen
let us discuss more on project lifecycle
a life cycle is composed of phases each
phase represents a discrete unit of work
required to be done on the project there
are different ways of classifying
project life cycles let us first discuss
the sequential versus overlapping life
cycle in sequential phases the
subsequent phase starts only after the
previous phase has been completed or
as in overlapping faces two or more
phases may run in parallel for some time
this could help fast tracking and
compressing the amount of time required
the other way of classifying life cycles
is how they go about the process of
planning and predictive life cycles
there is a large upfront planning phase
where all the details of scope costs
time are planned before beginning the
subsequent phases these phases then are
executed in either sequential or
overlapping modes they are suitable for
large projects where all the
requirements are likely to be known in
advance and where upfront planning
effort is required to get the necessary
approvals another feature of predictive
life cycles is that each phase may
potentially be different in the nature
of activities and may require people
with different skill sets for example
traditional software development life
cycle has phases like requirements
feasibility planning design construction
testing and transition we will continue
project life cycles in the next screen
incremental and iterative life cycles
have a short upfront high-level
definition and planning phase the
product is then developed through a
series of iterations where iteration
increments or adds to the functionality
by a little all the activities are
intentionally repeated in iterations
adaptive or agile life cycles are
variants of incremental and iterative
life cycles where iteration is very
short typically two to four weeks agile
methodologies are becoming very popular
in the software development industry and
in other industries where the
requirements are highly changeable and
frequent feedback is beneficial let us
now check your understanding of the
