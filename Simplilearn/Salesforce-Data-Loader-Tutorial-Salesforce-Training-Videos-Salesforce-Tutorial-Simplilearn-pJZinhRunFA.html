following when installing the data
loader the data loader is an app for the
bulk import or export of data choose the
data loader when you import your list of
50,000 or more data loader can insert
update delete or extract salesforce.com
records to install the data loader go to
setup and click data management click
data loader and click on the link to
download so let's go into Salesforce and
actually follow these installation steps
so now we're logged into Salesforce and
we're gonna click on setup and over here
we're going to go to data management and
then click on data loader so I'm on the
data loader page I'm going to click
download the data loader for Windows
it's going to prompt me to select a
download so I'm going to click save file
and you can see here that the download
has started so now that my download is
finished I'm going to minimize my
browser I'm going to open up this apex
data loader file here so I'm going to be
prompted to open it which I'm going to
click run I'm going to agree to the
terms click Next and it's going to set a
default install path I'm going to go
ahead and click on install now I'm going
to click close and as you can see a new
data loader icon has been placed on my
desktop if I double click that icon it's
going to open up the data loader so here
I'm prompted with a bunch of different
options to insert update up cert delete
so in the following topics we're going
to discuss each of these options
our next topic will be importing records
with the data loader
remember these important facts use data
loader when you need to load fifty
thousand to five million records data
loader supports loads of up to five
million records you need to load into an
object that is not yet supported by the
import wizards or you have to schedule
regular data loads such as nightly
imports you have to export your data for
backup purposes and the data loader does
require the use of the force comm API so
let's import some sample data into
Salesforce so I'm logged into Salesforce
and I also have the data loader up and
running here on my screen so I'm going
to first click the insert button and I'm
going to scroll down and choose leads
that's the object that I want to import
next I'm going to click on the Browse
button and I'm going to click desktop
and then grab my lead list and then
click open
now I'm going to click on the next
button you can see that the
initialization succeeded and the
operation will contain ten records so
that sounds right I'm going to click on
OK
and now I need to map these fields so I
can click on create or edit map here and
what I can do is start mapping these
fields one by one so I can grab company
drop it down there grab email I can
scroll down a little bit here grab first
name last name and then I can look for
that status field and map that as well
now at this point I can click on save
mapping and actually save this mapping
file so if you plan on doing a lot of
data imports you can save your map file
that way you can just reuse it over and
over again so now I'm ready I'm going to
click OK click on next and now I'm asked
for a directory for the success files so
I want the success in air file saved to
my desktop I'm going to click on browse
choose the desktop and click OK now the
success in air files are very important
because they will actually tell you
which records were successfully in
horded which ones had errors etc so it's
important to make sure those go to a
place that you can get to now I'm going
to click on finish I'm going to be asked
one more time and I'm going to click yes
and now the insert process is going to
start so you can see here that the
operation is fully completed there were
ten successful inserts zero errors I can
click on the view successes here and
then I can see I've got all the brand
new record IDs for those leads that were
imported you can see the status item
created as well so this is a successful
attempt to import leads using the data
wizard the data loader in Salesforce
our next topic is deleting records with
the data loader
keep the following points in mind use
the data loader when you have large
amounts of data to delete run a report
or export the data you wish to delete
make sure to include the record ID
import your file with the data loader
and use the ID column to select records
for deletion the data loader has a hard
delete button that means that if you use
it those records will be deleted forever
to use the hard delete button you also
must have the bulk API hard delete
permission enabled on your user profile
so let's go back to the data loader and
see what it's like to delete records
so now I'm logged into Salesforce and
again I have the data looter up and
running I'm going to click on this
delete button I'm going to choose the
leads object just like before
I'm going to browse for my file leaves
that need deleting now I'm going to
click next and I'll see my operation
will contain ten records now here you
can see there's only one field that
needs to be mapped and that's the ID
field the reason that is is we're not
actually updating or creating anything
we're actually deleting these records so
all Salesforce needs to know is which ID
of Records are we deleting so I'm going
to click Next
confirm my output area click finish and
you'll see here that I'm going to
confirm the deleting of records now
you'll notice there's this warning the
number of records a lot on your recycle
bin is limited so just like I was saying
before using the mass delete tool
there's always a chance you push out
records from the recycle bin because of
actions you're taking with the data
loader so definitely keep that in mind
so I'm going to say yes I want to delete
these leads and let the data loader run
so now you can see I can click on view
successes here and I simply have those
IDs and the item has been deleted
the next topic we'll discuss is
exporting records with the data loader
remember the following points you can
use the data loader to export large
volumes of data reports can timeout if
you try and work with too many fields
and records the data loader does not
have these limitations Salesforce does
archive some records automatically to
include archived records in the data
loader export choose export all so let's
jump back to the data loader and see
this so I'm logged into the data loader
here and I'm going to click on the
export button so I want to go ahead and
export lead so I'm going to choose leads
I'm also going to choose a target for
extraction I'm going to click on browse
and I want these to be exported right to
my desktop now I'm going to click the
next button and here I can choose which
fields I want included in the export I
just want first name last name ID and
let's say we're going to grab the phone
and the email now at this point if you
want to do an advanced query you can do
what's called a Socko query by creating
different queries using the fields
now this isn't covered on the exam on
any exam really as far as the data
loader is concerned but if you are
interested in creating very intricate
queries you can do them here if you just
want to leave it blank you don't have to
put in any conditions at all so now I'm
going to click on finish it's going to
confirm that I want to export I
definitely do so now that operation is
going to be in progress you can see now
there were 20 successful extractions I
can click on View extraction and see all
the leads that have been extracted using
the data loader now what happened is the
data loader simply outputted that file
directly to my desktop so I can go to my
desktop open up that spreadsheet and see
all of the leads that have been exported
