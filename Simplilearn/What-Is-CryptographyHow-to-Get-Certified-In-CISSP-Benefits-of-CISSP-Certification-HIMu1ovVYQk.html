cryptography introduction hello and
welcome to lesson seven of CISSP
certification course by simply learn
this lesson is about cryptography
cryptography is one of the ten domains
of the common body of knowledge cbk for
the CISSP certification exam one of the
most fascinating domains in the CISSP
CBK is cryptography no other domain has
the history challenge and technological
advancements that cryptography enjoys
throughout history cryptography has been
a crucial factor in military victories
or failures treason espionage and
business advantage cryptography is both
an art and a science
the use of deception and mathematics to
hide data as in steganography to render
data unintelligible whoo the
transformation of data into an
unreadable state and to ensure that a
message has not been altered in transit
and other features of some cryptographic
systems is the ability to provide
assurance of huge sender message
authentication of source and proof of
delivery the purpose of cryptography is
to protect transmitted information from
being read and understood by anyone
except the intended recipient ideally
unauthorized individuals would never be
able to read an inside message in
practice reading and in cyber
communication can be a function of time
however the effort and corresponding
time that is required for an
unauthorized individual to decipher an
encrypted message may be so large that
it can be impractical by the time the
message is decrypted the information
within the message may be of minimal
value cryptography can be used to
implement confidentiality integrity
authentication and non-repudiation as a
basis for exploring the fundamentals of
cryptography common definitions of
cryptographic terms are necessary these
definitions are presented in the
following section
objectives according to the ISC to
candidate information bulletin a CISSP
candidate will be expected to know the
basic concepts within cryptography
public and private key algorithms in
terms of their applications and users
algorithm construction key distribution
and management and methods of attack and
the applications construction and use of
digital signatures to provide
authenticity of electronic transactions
and non-repudiation of the parties
