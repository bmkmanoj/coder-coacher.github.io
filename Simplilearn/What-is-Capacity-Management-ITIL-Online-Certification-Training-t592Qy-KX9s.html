the activities that needs to be done
let's now discuss the activities defined
the capacity management some activities
in the capacity management process are
reactive while others are proactive the
proactive activities of capacity
management should include preventing
performance issues by taking necessary
actions before they occur producing
trends of the current component
utilization and estimating future
requirements using trends and thresholds
for planning upgrades and enhancements
proactive activities also include
modeling and trending the predicted
changes in IT services and identifying
the changes that need to be made to
services and components of the IT
infrastructure and applications to
ensure that appropriate resource is
available and ensures that upgrades are
budgeted planned and implemented before
SLA and service targets are breached or
performance issues occur other proactive
activities include actively seeking to
improve service performance wherever it
is cost justifiable and tuning and
optimizing the performance of services
and components the reactive activities
of capacity management should include
monitoring measuring reporting and
reviewing the current performance of
both services and components responding
to all capacity related threshold events
and instigating corrective action
reacting to and assisting with specific
performance issues for example the
Service Desk may refer incidents of poor
performance to technology management
which will employ capacity management
techniques to resolve them in the next
slide we will look at the sub processes
of capacity management
in this slide we will learn about the
sub processes of capacity management in
detail business capacity management this
sub process translates business needs
and plans into requirements for service
and IT infrastructure ensuring that the
future business requirement for IT
services are quantified designed planned
and implemented in a timely fashion this
can be achieved by using the existing
data on the current resource utilization
by the various services and resources to
trend forecast model or predict future
requirements these future requirements
come from the service strategy and
service portfolio detailing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
