and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
DHCP ntp and high availability
this lesson will deal with enhanced
interior gateway routing protocol e IG
RP let us begin with the objectives of
this lesson by the end of this lesson
you will be able to describe e IG RPS
metrics and administrative distance
describe how e IG RPS topology and
routing table are created including dual
describe automatic and manual
summarization describe neighbor
requirements configure e IG RP for ipv6
let us discuss the eigrp in the next
slide enhanced interior gateway routing
protocol e IG RP is a proprietary cisco
protocol it replaced interior gateway
routing protocol IG RP e IG RP is an
advanced distance vector routing
protocol but it is also called a hybrid
it does not have a total view of the
network as a link state protocol would
be IG R P does not require a
hierarchical addressing scheme but it
works better with it
ew g RP is the only routing protocol
covered in this course that can support
non IP protocols protocol dependent
modules PDMS handle Novell IPX appletalk
as well as IP convergence occurs rapidly
a network needs to converge or settle
down to normal operations after a change
for example if a router interface fails
many events occur the router recognizes
that there is a failure the neighbor or
neighbors on the other side of the link
recognize that there is a failure the
router and its neighbor must recalculate
the routes for their routing tables
since any roads using the interface no
longer work these are just a few of the
processes that occur after a change in
topology the time taking for the
completion of these processes is called
convergence time
let us discuss tables in the next slide
e IG RP maintains information in three
different tables the first is the
neighbor table to exchange routing
updates routers must become neighbors ew
GRP maintains information about these
neighbors in the neighbor table the
second table is the topology database a
router stores the routing information it
receives from its neighbors in the
topology database the dual algorithm is
run against this topology database to
determine the best route for each
destination which is offered it to the
IP routing table the third table is the
routing table this is the IP routing
table shown with the show IP route
command now we will discuss how routers
become neighbors in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
