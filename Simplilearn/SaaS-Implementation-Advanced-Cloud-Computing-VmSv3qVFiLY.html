configure the SaaS server for software
development in the previous slides in
the coming slides we'll look into
accessing the services from SaaS user
the user can access the service from the
server by using the default URL which is
HTTP colon forward slash forward slash
IP address forward slash session manager
after getting an access to the URL the
user must select the user to log in and
then insert the password after filling
in these fields the user must click on
login button given on the screen
if the credentials are perfect the user
will get the dedicated access to the
selected user portal
on clicking the login button on the
screen the dedicated user portal screen
will appear the user should always click
on the Run button given on the screen
whenever a digital signing window pops
up the screenshot on the slide shows the
digital signing pop-up window that a
user is likely to see further after
clicking on run button on the screen
the user must click on the Open Office
option to access the software through
the web browser this option is displayed
under my applications tab on the Left
pane
the user will now be directed to the
welcome screen of the openoffice.org the
screen shows the software being accessed
through the web browser this also shows
a perfect Hardware independent of the
software that is being used by the user
so far we have discussed accessing the
services from SaaS server in the next
slide we'll move on to the load
balancing policy
load-balancing as we've discussed in the
previous module can be implemented in
the SaaS server load balancing can be
done with respect to RAM CPU and user
connections this feature will help the
server to maintain business continuity
in order to perform any setting on the
load balancing policy the user can go to
the configuration tab of the
administrator portal and click on the
server settings later the user can set
the load balancing policy as per the
load needs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
