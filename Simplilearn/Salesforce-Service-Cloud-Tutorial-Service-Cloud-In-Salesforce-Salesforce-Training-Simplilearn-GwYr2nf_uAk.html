professional and a new aspect of
Salesforce to look at hi I'm Martin a
customer service manager of XY networks
our company deals with both technical
support and customer service of late we
have been struggling to manage the
inbound customer enquiries and issues
efficiently my boss told me that the
management will get us trained in
Salesforce shortly well that's good I
believe it will help them in their
career growth
I know Salesforce helps in managing
sales effectively however how is it
going to help us in managing inbound
customer enquiries you know Martin
that's a common misconception Salesforce
is a part of but not limited to sales it
can be successfully implemented in
different aspects of running any
business customer service can be a tough
department to work in customers calling
emailing chatting texting posting all of
this can cause even the best customer
service teams to fall apart with the
service cloud companies can get control
over these issues start managing their
time better and get meaningful reports
from Salesforce metrics such as average
number of cases per day cases by issue
time to resolution on a per customer
service rep basis these are all the
foundation on which the service cloud is
built let us go through this lesson
together to better understand this ok
well let's start next we're going to
talk about creating case assignment
rules
there's a couple of following points to
keep in mind when creating your case
assignment rules one you can assign
cases to users or queues in a variety of
ways
only one assignment rule can be active
at a time and you can update case
ownership with a user or queue so what
this means is you can assign a case to a
user or a queue based on a variety of
ways you can use different criteria such
as where the case is coming in from what
the different you know product interest
is or geography might be for that
particular area so you know that case
that comes in can be controlled based on
the criteria of the case you can even do
certain things like look for keywords in
the case so for example if somebody
mentions that you know they need to
update their credit card information you
can actually program Salesforce to look
for the words credit card and then
assign it to particular queue for
billing issues for example one thing to
keep in mind is that you can only have
one assignment rule at a time now for
some that seems a little you know
confusing because of course you need to
have different rules well the reality is
you have one rule but it you can have
multiple rule entries so you have one
primary rule but then the rule entries
allow you to control what happens when
the various criteria are met it's just a
matter of Salesforce going in the order
of those particular rules which you'll
go over here in a second and then lastly
the most important part of these
assignment rules is it updates the
ownership of the case so it's either
going to update it to a user or it's
going to update it to a queue you know
whatever the case may be these case
assignment rules are going to control
the ownership of the cases so we're
going to go ahead and jump into
Salesforce now and actually demonstrate
creating some case assignment rule so
I'm logged in to my org I'm going to
start by clicking on set up in the top
right hand corner over on the left hand
side I'm going to click customize and
scroll down to cases
and then I'm presented here with a
variety of options so first I'm going to
click on case assignment rules now if
you already have an assignment rule
created in your org you're gonna see it
here as being active and I can click on
for example the rule name main office
and I'm taken directly to this
assignment rule now this assignment
rules
is a pretty minimum really it just
changes the case owner to Justin Davis
whenever the type equals a feature
request well I want to add to that so
I'm going to click on new and I'm going
to choose the sort order as number two
since we already have a number one there
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come over here and I'm going to put case
type let's say for example the case type
is going to be you know I don't know a
problem and then I also want to filter
on the case origin so let's say the case
origin is you know email for example so
what this rule is here is doing is if
the issue if the type field comes in as
a problem and the origin is over email
so it gets sent in via email to case
which will actually talk about in a
minute then we can control who the owner
is so I can come over here and I can put
in you know Justin Davis and that's
going to make me the you know particular
owner of that case at this point I can
click Save and then you can see that my
rule entry has been added now if if your
company is working to you know setup
different assignment rules what you can
do is actually you know deactivate this
case assignment role so there's no
active rule at any given time and then
you can come over here and actually
create a second assignment rule so you
can see here it's no longer active but
let's say I want to create some new
rules so let's say new rule main office
something like that and then I can make
it active so that way it becomes the
active rule and remember you can only
have one active rule at a time but the
active rule can have multiple criteria
multiple rule entries so here I can put
again you know sort order number one and
then I can come over here and I can can
you know do the exact same thing I can
configure you know what the criteria
will be based on you know that specific
issue with that case and now another
popular option is to create a queue so I
can come over here under manage users
and click on queues now you can see I've
got to lead queue setup but I don't have
any case queues so I'm going to click on
this new button
and I'm gonna call it you know
unassigned cases so this might be for
example cases that come in that I'm not
really sure who the owner should be but
I'm gonna go ahead and add all the
individuals to the akin to the
Salesforce work here that can access
that so now I can actually go back to
cases and I can click on any case I have
in for example I can change the case
owner and when Salesforce loads you'll
see that I can choose a queue so I can
have this actually default to the
unassigned cases queue so that's who the
owner will be so likewise I can go back
and I can adjust my case assignment
rules so I can come back under cases
click on case assignment rules and I can
adjust this rule here and for example I
can create a new entry so I'm going to
choose sort order as one and I'm going
to choose case origin equal equals the
web for example and then I'm going to
change this from a user to a queue so
I'm gonna come over here and I'm going
to just call it unassigned and click
Save and then what will happen is it's
going to save my change and whenever a
new case comes in where the case origin
equals web it's going to sign it to the
unassigned cases queue as you can see
here on the right hand side now
something important to keep in mind is
that anytime you're filtering for
something you have to remember to filter
for something that does not exist for
example what happens if the case origin
field is blank you know so you need to
come back over here and say case origin
equals blank for example and so you know
where should those cases go
so creating assignment rules is a little
bit tricky because you have to plan for
you know what happens if you have that
data that information
Bota happens if you don't you need to
plan for all scenarios usually at the
end of an assignment rule that we set up
will we'll put some kind of catch-all
criteria in there that says you know it
if these five criteria aren't met then
you know at the end of the line push
these cases over to you know and
unassigned cases to you or you know
assign it to let's say the customer
service manager that way they don't end
up slipping through the cracks
otherwise the case owner is going to end
up being your default the default case
owner that you have in the system so if
I come over here indirect aces I can
change support settings so under these
support settings for example I've got my
default user as Justin Davis which is
myself
so you know you can also make a variety
of other changes here but the bottom
line is if you don't have an active case
assignment rule in place or you have an
active rule that doesn't cover all
scenarios then your default case owner
which is a lot of times the system
administrator the person that first
setup Salesforce then it's going to go
into that person's name and if you want
to change that you can always come back
here under customize and then go to
cases and then you can actually click on
support settings to see this page the
next thing we're going to talk about
here is creating a web to case form so
web to case in Salesforce is a very
simple web form that when created allows
you to create a case from a web page so
this is not a tricky one but a lot of
times customers are a little bit
confused as to what this actually does
so the following key points are that you
choose fields from the available fields
column as you can see here from
available fields to selected you also
choose a thank you return URL for after
the case has actually been submitted and
then of course you generate the HTML
using that generate button so what this
does is it literally generates the HTML
that a Salesforce customer would put on
their web site using a web developer or
web design company whoever the webmaster
is for that website so some customers
believe that this form will actually
come pre formatted it definitely doesn't
you need to take that each tml and add
formatting a style sheet or a table or
something at a minimum you know
otherwise it's not going to have any
format so what we're gonna do next is
we're going to generate a web to case
form and we're actually going to show
what that form looks like out of the box
so I'm logged into Salesforce and I'm
gonna get started by clicking on the
setup link in the top right corner so
over on the left hand side I'm going to
go over a customized and here I can
click on cases and you'll actually see
that there isn't a web Decay's option
here so you know funny enough the
Salesforce has put the web to case
option under self-service so what you
should do is come over here under web to
case HTML generator and then you can
choose what fields you want from the
left-hand side to the right-hand side
and then choose a thank-you URL so I'm
gonna I'm gonna pick that now cloud
creations comm for example and then over
here on the left hand side I'm going to
choose what fields I want to have made
available so it's real simple I just
choose whatever fields are available in
cases as my selected fields so any
custom fields that you've created can be
added here and are selected so now I'm
going to click on generate and it's just
going to generate some very basic HTML
for me so I'm gonna I'm gonna select all
and I'm gonna copy this now before I
paste this what I'm going to do is I'm
going to scroll down and we're just
going to look at it real quick here so
it's very simple you have a meta text
area and you've got a bunch of comments
in here but essentially it's just a post
and you know for those of you that are
technical you know it's just a it's just
a very simple post to the Salesforce
server for everybody else this form is a
standalone form you don't have to tie it
into anything you can literally paste it
anywhere on the Internet if somebody
submits a record from here it's going to
go into your Salesforce or your
Salesforce account so scrolling down you
can see just some HTML here that you can
modify make it look however you want it
to look if you've got drop-down menus
then you can see those option values
here and at this point you can just
click finished so when you click
finished all it does is it just brings
you back to this web Decay's page so
there's a couple of other options you
can set up for starters you can choose
whether to enable or disable it you know
most Salesforce accounts come with it
enabled by default and
you can also choose a default case
origin most customers want web as the
default case origin because that's where
it's coming from you can also set up an
auto response so if a tease comes in
from this web Decay's forum you can just
put in a template here from any email
template you've created as an automatic
response so the next step in this
process is to you know what you're going
to do is you're going to have that code
and you're going to want to send that to
web developer so here for example you
can see we've got all that code I've
just pasted it to notepad file so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
save this Pacific file I'm gonna call it
you know web to case dot HTML and select
all files and click Save and what that's
going to do is it's just going to create
this notepad file as an HTML file on my
desktop so once you've saved that HTML
file you can literally open it up right
in your browser so I'm going to open it
here and this is what that web Takase
form looks like so it literally looks
just like this so you need to come in
here and do some formatting with the
HTML but you know if you haven't done
any kind of formatting you can come over
here and fill out you know all the
pertinent information into the
individual field so I'm going to put you
know my email I'll put subject you know
I can say that I've got a product issue
and for the description you know I'm
gonna be difficult I'm gonna say you
know call me and then here I can put in
the type I'm going to put a problem case
reason I'm gonna put a new problem and
then at this point I'm just going to
click Submit query so what that's gonna
do is it's going to take me to my
thank-you page and it's going to submit
a case into Salesforce so if I come back
under cases I do need to wait at least a
minute or two for that case to show up
once that case does show up then I can
come back in here and I can actually you
know see that the case has been
submitted for example we've got this new
case in here that was created from that
form you could see subject product issue
description you know call me and what it
did is it automatically found my contact
name and it linked the case to my
contacts so I could actually click on my
contact and I can see the cases that
have been submitted but here you can see
that directly from that web de keys form
I didn't touch the code at all it just
created a new case inside of Salesforce
so it works very very simple a few
things to keep in mind is that web takus
you know when they're created they do
respect assignment rules also you can
wait up to two minutes for a case to
come in just depending on how busy
Salesforce is that particular day the
Salesforce servers I should say but in
general you can definitely expect it
within two minutes a lot of times I see
usually in about 30 seconds or less but
it can take up to two minutes for that
case to be created
the next thing we're going to talk about
here is creating an email to case
address with Salesforce you've got a
couple of options to create cases we've
already gone over creating a case
manually we just went over how to
collect a case from a website using the
web to case form the other option here
is using email to case now email to case
in Salesforce allows the case to be
created directly from an inbound email
you can also set up you know forwarding
rules on your email server to forward
those emails that's what most customers
do and the contacts are going to be
matched based on the email address very
similar to the web to case form so in
short what you can do is you set up an
email address at your company that when
an email is sent to that email address a
new case is created in Salesforce so you
can have support at salesforce.com for
example have a case automatically
created based on that inbound email
which is what a lot of companies do so
next we're going to jump into Salesforce
and get this email to case setup so I'm
logged into Salesforce here and I'm like
always I'm gonna jump into the setup
area over on the left hand side I'm
going to click customize and I'm gonna
click on cases and then email to case so
I'm on the email to case page and I
actually have email to case disabled so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
click edit I'm going to talk through
these different options so the first
thing I want to do is click on the
enable email to case checkbox what this
will do is it will permit inbound emails
at the service address to create cases
inside of Salesforce I also want new
case owners to be notified whenever
those emails come in and I want to
enable HTML email so the notifying case
owners is pretty self-explanatory
they'll get an email whenever a new case
comes in however this enable each team
email means that the HTML format of that
email is brought into Salesforce rather
than just plain text we also have a few
options for inserting the thread ID so
when using the email to case option you
can send replies and receive replies and
there's a reference ID that's in
in that email so here you have the
option to choose it in the subject or
the body or both we can also choose
whether or not the user signature is
before the email threads or after I'll
just leave that unchecked because it's
not really relevant and move on here so
the next one is the email enable the
on-demand service so for most customers
this is the option that you would want
so on the certification exam you're
going to need to understand the
difference between on-demand email
service and you know the standard
service so the standard service is is
much more involved where you have to
install the email to case agent so if
you can actually see that here you have
to install that behind your firewall in
reality with on-demand it's it's quite
simple you set up a forwarding rule from
your email server to send an email to
the service address that we're going to
create here in a second we also have a
couple of options for you know the email
rate limit has been you know received we
can riku the message and have it in sort
of a holding area we can bounce it or
just delete it and then if there's an
unauthorized sender you can either
bounce it or just delete it as well
at this point I'm going to click Save
and let Salesforce save my settings so
there you can see everything's been set
up now
I had previously created a routing
address for demonstration purposes and
you can see here I've got the support
team for support at Salesforce comm it's
pending and you can see that email
service address there now let's say I
want to create a new one I'm going to
click on that new so you can see here
after that new button I can then choose
my email - cows routing information so
for the routing name I'm going to choose
you know let's say cloud creations
support and then for the email address
I'm going to choose something like
support at cloud creations comm now it's
very important that this email address
is a real email address with a real you
know inbox a real account it's not a
fake account it has to be a real one set
up by your email you know service
provider whether that's in-house or
extra
you can also choose whether or not to
save the email headers so you know check
that checkbox if the headers are
important you can also choose where the
emails are received from so what this
would do is you know allow you to have
only emails come from certain domains if
you want for most companies you can just
leave that alone next down here is
whether or not to create a task from an
email so if you want a task to be
created for that inbound case that
inbound email check that checkbox
I recommend recommend leaving that
unchecked I'm not a big fan of automated
tasks I think tasks should be created
manually for the most part so they
actually get done but if you do want an
automated task created go ahead and
check that checkbox and then down here
we also have a few options for case
priority high medium low case origin
email so these might seem very obvious
from the onset case origin of our email
however with case priority you actually
may want to set up three different
support email addresses so most
companies just have one but let's say
you have a VIP customer where you want
them to be able to send an email you can
put something like you know tier 2
support at cloud creations com and then
all of those emails that come in will be
of the level high so the case priority
for any of those emails will come in as
high because it's it's sent directly to
that tier 2 support so at this point I'm
going to click Save and I'm going to be
prompted here now this is very important
just as I mentioned that email address
needs to be a real email address because
right now Salesforce is going to send a
confirmation email with the link to that
account you need to click on that link
in order to make that email address
available so at this point I'm going to
click OK and as you can see here and
brought back to the page so we've got
this email address which you see in
italics because it hasn't been verified
yet and we've got this email service
address created now this is a very long
email address now you can actually copy
and paste this send an email to it and a
new case within a minute or two a new
case will be created inside of the
Salesforce account so at this point a
lot of administrators get a little
confused because they don't understand
the relationship between this address
here and this very long address there
the point is is that there's no way in
the world you'd want to give this
address to one of your clients or one of
your customers right so instead of
giving them this very long address you
have that address that tier to support
at cloud creations comm which is much
more memorable that you can then hand
out put on your website put on a
business card whatever the case may be
this is the one you give to customers so
again you may ask well what's the
connection between the two in your email
server you need to set up a forwarding
rule like I mentioned before that will
forward a hundred percent of the emails
that are received to this address
so all the emails sent to this address
need to be forwarded to this service
address so your email administrator
needs to set up a forwarding rule that
will forward all emails from that email
address to this one so this is the real
email address this is the one that
Salesforce assigns you it's this one
where you need to set up that extra step
that does a link you know so an email
received here automatically goes there
and then when you use it you can simply
click on the cases tab you can see all
open cases and then when when that email
has been sent in that case comes in of
course you can always click refresh and
just see that new case here right on the
list
the next thing we're going to talk about
here is creating an email to case
address with Salesforce you've got a
couple of options to create cases we've
already gone over creating a case
manually we just went over how to
collect a case from a website using the

let's say I want to create a new one I'm

then choose my email to Cal surrounding
information so for the routing name I'm
going to choose you know let's say cloud

it's very important that this email

real you know inbox a real account it's
not a fake account has to be a real one
set up by your email you know service

that's in house or external you can also

put something like you know tier 2
supports at cloud creations comm and
then all of those emails that come in
will be of the level high so the case
priority for any of those emails will
come in as high because it's it's sent
directly to that tier 2 support so at
this point I'm going to click Save and
I'm going to be prompted here now this
is very important just as I mentioned
that email address needs to be a real
email address because right now
Salesforce is going to send a
confirmation email with the link to that
account you need to click on that link
in order to make that email address
available so at this point I'm going to
click OK and as you can see here and
brought back to the page so we've got
this email address which you see in
italics because it hasn't been verified
yet and we've got this email service
address created now this is a very long
email address now it you can actually
copy and paste this send an email to it
and
new case within a minute or two a new
case will be created inside of the
Salesforce account so at this point a
lot of administrators get a little
confused because they don't understand
the relationship between this address
here and this very long address there
the point is is that there's no way in
the world you'd want to give this
address to one of your clients or one of
your customers right so instead of
giving them this very long address you
have that address that tier to support
at cloud creations comm which is much
more memorable that you can then hand
out put on your website put on a
business card whatever the case may be
this is the one you give to customers so
again you may ask well what's the
connection between the two in your email
server you need to set up a forwarding
rule that can mention before that will
forward a hundred percent of the emails
that are received to this address
so all the emails sent to this address
need to be forwarded to this service
address so your email administrator
needs to set up a forwarding rule that
will forward all emails from that email
address to this one so this is the real
email address this is the one that
Salesforce assigns you it's this one
where you need to set up that extra step
that does a link you know so an email
received here automatically goes there
and then when you use it you can simply
click on the cases tab you can see all
open cases and then when when that email
has been sent in that case comes in of
course you can always click refresh and
just see that new case here right on the
list
