happen if there are defects in software
which we use now let us see what could
cause software defects as software is
designed by human beings and human
beings make errors or mistakes these
mistakes produce defects or bugs in the
software these defects are not only
introduced during the coding phase of
the software but are introduced
throughout the development lifecycle
right from when requirements are
understood written and designed these
can also be a result of a mistake while
porting the application into production
when this faulty system is executed it
might cause a failure not each mistake
leads to a defect and not each defect
will lead to a failure sometime defects
lie dormant within software until they
are triggered we will look at this point
more in detail in the following slides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
