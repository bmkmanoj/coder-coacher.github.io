management training by simply learn
before proceeding further let us recall
what we have learned in previous lessons
lesson one gave us an introduction about
lean lesson two was a study of types of
waste lesson three discussed about
various tools used in lean lesson for
detailed about lean in manufacture while
lesson five talked about lean in service
this is lesson number six and we will
talk in detail about lean in office in
the next slide we will start with the
agenda of what we are going to cover in
this lesson and then go into detail
about lean in office
here is the agenda we will start with an
overview of lean maturity matrix we will
discuss assessing process that helps an
organization to implement lean we will
then discuss assessment criteria for
evaluation of lean after this we will
introduce lean maturity levels that an
organization uses for assessment and
improvement
in this section we'll cover an overview
of the lean maturity matrix the need to
have a lean maturity matrix is to help
organizations to determine the extent to
which they have transformed themselves
to adopt lean principles with a
structured means of assessing where it
is in terms of implementing a lean
culture in its organization as discussed
in earlier lessons the Lean principles
that are evaluated our value value
stream flow Po and perfection the focus
of the Lean principles is on analyzing
processes in terms of customer or client
value and eliminating waste this is done
by mapping processes and analyzing them
rigorously to determine what is value
adding and what is not on the basis that
value is defined as something a supplier
considers a customer or client internal
or external is prepared to pay for the
rest is waste and processes are
redesigned to try and eliminate this
lean maturity matrix works like guiding
factor and helps a team assess
themselves against Lean principles and
see their adoption over a period of time
the ultimate goal of any lean production
process is to minimize wastes and
develop new processes to maximize the
added value the definition of wastes
will vary depending on the type of
process being analyzed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
