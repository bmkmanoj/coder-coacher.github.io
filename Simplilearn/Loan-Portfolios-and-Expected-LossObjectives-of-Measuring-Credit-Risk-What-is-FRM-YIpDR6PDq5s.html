financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
loan portfolios and expected loss
welcome to the 49th session in your
preparation for the frm part 1 exam we
are now coming very close to the end of
the course the next two sessions will
focus on credit risk of loans including
expected and unexpected losses resulting
in the case of a default in this session
we will cover the topic unexpected loss
in the next session we will learn about
unexpected loss
agenda will begin the session by
introducing you to the concepts of bond
and loan portfolios we'll learn about
the various aspects of a loan such as
outstandings exposure covenants and
commitments we will then learn about
expected loss on a loan in the case of a
default we will learn to calculate
expected loss the concept of usage given
fault or ugd will be introduced which is
similar to the option of drawing an
amount during distress finally we will
end the session by learning about the
various challenges in framing a reliable
credit risk model objectives of credit
risk measurement in their role as
financial intermediaries banks hold
credit sensitive assets although these
assets are the main revenue generator
for the banks they have a positive
probability of default however the
distribution of losses is highly skewed
so banks should have a keen awareness of
the need to identify measure monitor and
control credit risk as well as to
determine that they hold adequate
capital against these risks this would
maximize risk adjusted return
bond and loan portfolios let us begin
the session by learning about bond and
loan portfolios bonds have a standard
structure and they pay regular interest
payments or coupons and principal on
maturity these portfolios have less
complex lending arrangements than other
portfolios and are more liquid than
loans loans are usually negotiated and
have a non-standard structure the
covenants list down the various terms
and conditions of the loan they are
associated with complex tanks and
accounting implications and are
considerably less liquid than bonds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
