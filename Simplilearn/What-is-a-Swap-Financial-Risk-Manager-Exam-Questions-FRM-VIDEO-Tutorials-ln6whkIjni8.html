financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
swaps welcome to the 30th session in
your preparation for the frm part 1 exam
we are almost halfway through the
financial markets module and until now
we have learned about futures forwards
and options in this session we will
introduce a very interesting concept
called swaps wherein one can transfer
the cash flow liabilities to another
person and vice versa for example one
can convert a fixed-rate loan into a
floating rate loan this is done by
entering into a swap agreement agenda
the agenda of a discussion will be
learning about swap contracts we will
begin by introducing the concept of
swamps we will then learn about plain
vanilla swaps using both bonds and
forward rate agreements we will then
learn about currency options the
calculations might seem a bit tricky but
as you practice it will become quite
easy questions from this section
especially about currency swaps are
always asked in the exam so you are
advised to fully understand the concepts
as well as the numerical questions we
will end the session with a brief
discussion on the comparative advantage
of swamps and the risk involved in swaps
concept
let us now understand what swaps are
imagine that one person is holding a
semi-annual bond that pays a 4% coupon
on the principle of $100,000
this person receives a fixed payment of
$2,000 every six months as coupon
payments as shown in the slide consider
another person holding a bond that pays
floating interest based on six months
LIBOR suppose that the interest rates
for the next three periods are 4% 4.5%
and 4.8% then this person will receive
two thousand dollars two thousand two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and
two thousand four hundred dollars every
six months now they mutually agree and
enter into a contract so that the person
receiving a fixed payment will pay this
fixed payment to the person receiving
floating payment and in return the other
person will pay the floating payment to
the first person the net payment is
shown in the chart therefore the
contract enables both parties to
interchange their cash flow liable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
