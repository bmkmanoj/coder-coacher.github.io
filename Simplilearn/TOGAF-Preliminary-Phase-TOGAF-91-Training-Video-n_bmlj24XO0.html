through a little bit more detail each
one of the phases in the ADM so we'll
start with the preliminary phase and
let's go through what what the
preliminary phase does what are the
actual steps in it so there's a
preliminary up there and this is what
you don't really have a tailored TOGAF
method yet so you're going to have to do
all the work to establish an
architecture group that uses this
tailored toe gap method you're going to
come up with so first we want to
determine within your organization the
the need for architecture and you're
also going to look at kind of the scope
of your whole enterprise and what part
of your enterprise needs architecture is
it the whole part whole ARCIC enterprise
or just maybe one or one or two business
units so first they say the
organizational model so we have to you
know how are we going to organize
architectural groups what teams are we
going to have and what parts of our
enterprise and then we come up with our
process tools we're also going to define
our architecture principles in
preliminary here are the steps in the
preliminary defined the enterprise
remember when we did a we looked at that
cube in a front face of the tube had
strategic Enterprise on the top level
then it had segments a next level down
on the front face and then had
capability on the bottom and then it had
breadth in the third dimension
basically had the four domains in the
third dimension so in preliminary that's
what you're going to have to do right
away is take a look at your enterprise
your company your companies within
companies and sometimes I've even run
into some companies where they have more
than one enterprise within the company
like they say what was
I was talking to mmm I think with
Citigroup Merrill Lynch
they're like combined with each other or
maybe I got him wrong but Citigroup and
one of these kind of like I'm Merrill
Lynch or somebody but they were like two
different enterprises in the same
corporate entity and they were so
different that they really didn't even
cross paths so they literally when they
do to their Cube they're going to have
one Enterprise and then what are all the
organizations within that enterprise and
then they're going to do their
organizational design in terms of you
know what what what our architecture
groups are going to have in different
parts of the enterprise and different
parts of different business units based
on how they partitioned everything
within the enterprise and then they're
going to also have the scope of their
governance of architecture based on that
all they partition the enterprise now we
want to and then requirements for the
architecture work so what our
requirements well we're going to have to
do all the principles architecture
principles we're going to have to tailor
the method we're going to have to pick
some tools and maybe there are specific
business drivers and objectives that are
behind this need for architecture so we
can actually set some objectives for our
preliminary implementation of
architecture you find the principles the
framework the framework would be you
know are we going to use TOGAF and are
we also going to pick from Zachman
framework some of the artifacts or maybe
go Daffy some of the artifacts from that
so it's a customized framework in some
organizations it is and then you know
with multiple frameworks and then you
define the relationships between
management frameworks which is different
that's the relationship between the
architecture framework you come up with
and
other management frameworks like ITIL
service management framework project
management group project management
framework PMI or prince2 and COBIT is a
governance framework for IT
so how does as your architecture going
to fit into that when you come up with
your architecture method are you going
to integrate with these other the other
processes really in the other frameworks
what are the outputs inputs and outputs
you pass back and forth between them and
then evaluate the enterprise
architecture maturity so when we set up
our architecture board in preliminary
and that's what we're going to do we're
going to create our architecture board
they are accountable for the maturity
level of your architecture group groups
so they need to somehow be able to
evaluate what level of maturity your
processes are in architecture and we're
going to go through a maturity framework
kind of how to how to actually measure
the maturity of an architecture group
and that's what you do in preliminary
and based on what you found out what
level you're at you would then set goals
for what level you want to get to we've
got well the toe gap specification
basically I call it the smorgasbord the
hole spec is a big smorgasbord is really
what it is you take a look at it and
then you tailor your own TOGAF method
you look at other architecture
frameworks like Zachman or DOTA or you
know there are some other ones in the
federal government there's a federal
enterprise architecture framework but I
think usually people look at Zachman
because they have some pretty good
artifacts you can use with the TOGAF
method business strategies so you want
to understand the drivers in the
business because you can capitalise on
that and really focus your architecture
private your implementation of
architecture capability to to you tying
it to your the business drivers that are
going on and so what kind of frameworks
also governance and legal frameworks
that's going to give you get some
direction on on what level you need to
attain in your architecture capability
and what's the content of what you're
going to have to architect and then use
any existing things
okay so you're the six steps in
preliminary so number one scope your
enterprise and that's use the do
partitioning remember partitioning is
one of the four guidelines well that
this is where you do it you do it right
here in preliminary step one you
partition your enterprise and you pick
the scope in that cube that you're going
to implement architecture within and
have architecture governance over and
then step two you're going to confirm
governance and support framework so
there you're going to go out to these
other frameworks and IT COBIT ITIL PMI
and you're going to make contact there
and work on integrate integration with
those frameworks three define and
establish the enterprise architecture so
here we're going to set up
organizational structures within your
enterprise kind of cube or partitioning
of your enterprise where you're going to
have an architecture group you're going
to have it in this business unit that
business unit this enterprise level
architecture team etc for identify the
principles so the 21 architecture
principles we went through our a good
starting point for creating architecture
principles five is go ahead and tailor
your method this is where you're going
to create your tailored architecture
methods in the preliminary and your get
a stimulant the architecture tool so
you're going to implement your
repository and store your tailored TOGAF
method in that repository in the
architecture meta model and you also
take your architecture then you also
take your content meta model that you
pick from so gas etc and put it in the
architect's repository any cut in your
content metamodel area that's
preliminary and you actually are going
to create your first request for
architecture work as output of this
preliminary so you can do your first ADM
cycle it might be a good idea to
implement your architecture tools and
your method with your very first ADM
cycle just so you have a pilot or kind
of the you know create a competency
center so you have an example and some
people have actually
use the method and you can use the
project of implementing all your tools
and stuff in your method as your first
alien project how are you going to
implement architecture so that's one one
thing you could do okay so these are all
the steps I don't know that I'm going to
go through all the steps on all the
slides because I think we talked it
through pretty well but in the interest
of being able to do some other
activities so here you do find the team
establish the principles and we went
through the 21 principles who's going to
be involved in putting together the
principles
well the enterprise architects may be
some key stakeholders can be on a team
to define the architecture principles
and they remember the template it got
the name a statement rationale and the
implication r is the template for
architecture principles and we went
through examples of these and women
through the 21 so those principles self
serve example here were the five
qualities of the principles again
they're understandable robust complete
consistence and stable so they don't
change very much
they don't contradict one another so
principles could pop could be a building
block if you wanted them to be they can
relate to specific drivers goals and
objectives for instance tailored TOGAF
so this is yes that that question do we
come up with our own customized method
yes you do
and here's where you do it step five of
preliminary and you also you know tailor
your terminology any methodology has
like a policy for implementing it and
that's part of the book the policy has
the terminology you're going to use in
it and provide a glossary so you can
tailor this put pass through it so you
can you know skip phases a reorder
phases all that kind of stuff so there's
flexibility in it so we're tailoring the
content obviously we're creating our own
meta model and then this was just
another picture of the metamodel
go ahead and implement the actual
architecture tools in them set up your
directories based on how you partitioned
everything here's some outputs for
preliminary an organizational model for
our enterprise architecture yeah so what
teams are we going to have tailored
architecture framework including the
principles the architecture repository
actually implemented with the tools the
business principles goals and drivers
which are kind of driving the
implementation of architecture request
for architecture work would be your very
first ADM cycle that you're going to do
after preliminary and architecture
governance framework would be kind of
your architecture board and the Charter
for the architecture board and the
processes that you're going to do for
governance you can do architecture
change management you're going to do
compliance reviews you're going to do
capability assessments we're going to do
dispensation request you're going to set
standards there's all kinds of processes
you're going to do within this
governance framework in the architecture
board so it got and here's this more
detailed picture of the metamodel with
artifacts in it these are just a few of
the artifacts so we've got a principals
catalog especially in a so that here's a
question which of the following is
completed during the preliminary phase
of the TOGAF ADM yes a is correct
architecture principles which one of the
following is a reason to adapt the ADM
yeah he's correct
so all of them are reasons to adapt the
ABM what's the main objective of
preliminary prepare an organization for
a successful enterprise architecture
project by defining how we do
architecture that could be a little
misleading because you only do oh you
don't do it before every single
architecture project however if you're
going to do an architecture project and
your architecture board determines they
don't think you really organize stuff
then you go ahead and do what you need
to get organized in preliminary and
define how we're going to do the
architecture you know so hopefully you
don't do it before every architecture
project that you're that just
organized but that may be what you need
to do for every architecture project so
but in general it's on my TOGAF island
anyway preliminary isn't done before
every single project and here's all the
steps the inputs and the outputs you've
got that on one of the cards I sent out
to you in 1:13
it has all the steps inputs and outputs
for each phase one per one page per
phase okay so that's the preliminary
phase
