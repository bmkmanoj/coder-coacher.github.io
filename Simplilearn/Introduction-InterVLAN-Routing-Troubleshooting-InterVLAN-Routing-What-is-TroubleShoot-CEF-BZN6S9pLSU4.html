and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
troubleshooting spanning tree and VLAN
this lesson focuses on troubleshooting
interval and routing let us begin with
the objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain interval and routing
troubleshoot CEF discuss ICMP discuss
ping sweep and trace route commands use
internet control message protocol
packets in the ping extended ping and
traceroute commands to troubleshoot let
us start our discussion of interval and
routing a layer 3 device is required for
interval and routing this means that
either a router or a multi-layer switch
can be used there are differences
between two devices in terms of overall
capabilities for example a router has a
wide area network capability whereas an
mls does not a router iOS has more
features than an mls iOS for example
firewall or intrusion prevention a weber
and mls normally forwards packets faster
than a router internet control message
protocol icmp is a network layer
protocol that belongs to a control
protocol group and has been designed
keeping the characteristics of an IP
protocol in mind ICMP echo request and
echo reply messages are used by the ping
and traceroute commands when issuing
these commands the source sends a series
of echo requests for every ICMP echo
reply received by the source an
exclamation point appears in the output
for each echo request with no matching
reply a period appears in the output a
ping or traceroute command will be
successful only if the source router has
a route to the destination and the
destination router has a route back to
the source in their routing tables this
is why these commands are so useful they
check layer 3 connectivity in two
directions at once in the next slide we
will discuss how to use arguments to the
ping command to find more information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
