business mathematics where we collect
organize analyze and interpret numerical
facts statistical methods are the
concepts models and formulas of
mathematics used in the statistical
analysis of data they can be subdivided
into two main categories descriptive
statistics and inferential statistics
descriptive statistics
further consists of measure of central
tendency and measure of dispersion and
inferential statistics consists of
estimation and hypothesis testing
descriptive statistics methods involve
summarizing or describing the sample of
data in various forms to get an overall
gist about the data most often the
results are shown in qualitative form as
the name suggests in contrast
inferential statistics try to make
assumptions on population of the data
given the sample or in predicting
various outcomes we will discuss each of
these methods in detail in this topic in
the next slide we will talk about
population and samples a population is
an entire collection of objects or
observations from which we may collect
data
it is the entire group we are interested
in which we wish to describe or draw
conclusions about for each population
there are many possible samples it is
important that the investigator
carefully and completely defines the
population before collecting the sample
including a description of the members
to be included a sample is a group of
units selected from a larger group the
population by studying the sample it is
hoped to draw valid conclusions about
the larger group
a sample is generally selected for study
because the population is too large to
study in its entirety the sample should
be representative of the general
population
this is often best achieved by random
sampling in the next slide we will look
at how to develop a sample plan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
