is different from product lifecycle as
mentioned earlier each product life
cycle consists of a series of projects
to plan develop launch enhance and
maintain the product a project lifecycle
is a logical sequence of activities to
accomplish the objectives of the project
regardless of complexity of the project
all projects go through a series of
activities from inception to closure the
starting stage of a project is the
initiation phase in which critical
success factors or core objectives for
the project are defined the key
deliverable from this phase is a project
Charter which authorizes the project
start and defines the objectives high
level budgets and sponsored commitments
for the project in the planning phase
the approach to the project is
determined and project is divided into
smaller tasks with interim deliverables
the project manager plans for all
support requirements identifies risks
and defines roles and responsibilities
for the project this phase also includes
determining milestones for each of these
deliverables the next phase is the
execution of phase in which the project
plan is executed this is the phase where
the actual project execution happens and
the project deliverables are created and
implemented the last stage is closing
phase that marks the completion of the
project in this phase the project is
formally closed or handed over to the
next team in line for taking over for
example once a product is developed and
launched it will be handed over to the
production supporting who will maintain
and enhance the product in the long run
activities must be grouped into phases
because by doing so the project manager
and the core team can easily and
effectively plan and organize resources
for each activity and also objectively
measure achievement of goals and justify
the decisions to move ahead looking at
the figure we can understand that these
are phases which are to be carried on
sequentially and cost and staffing
levels increases gradually to project
execution phase while decline in project
closing phase while these phases are
sequential in the first iteration they
more often become atira to during the
course of the project as constant re
planning and re execution is required to
maintain the risks and change requests
for the project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
