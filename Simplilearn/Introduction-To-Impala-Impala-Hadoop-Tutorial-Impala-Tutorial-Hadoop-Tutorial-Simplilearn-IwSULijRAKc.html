covered in this course take a look at
the lesson names that are listed on the
screen wishing you all the luck for this
course in the next lesson we will focus
on introduction to Impala hello and
welcome to the first lesson of the
Impala an open-source sequel engine for
Hadoop course offered by simply learn
this lesson provides an introduction to
Impala let us look at the objectives of
this lesson in the next screen after
completing this lesson you will be able
to describe Impala explain the main
benefits of Impala describe the steps to
install Impala demonstrate how to get
started with Impala describe the
functions of different Impala shell
commands let us begin with understanding
Impala in the next screen cloud era
Impala is a massively parallel
processing MPP sequel query
execution engine that runs on the Hadoop
platform using Impala you can run a
query evaluate the results immediately
and fine-tune the query if necessary
this engine was introduced in October
2012 with a public beta test
distribution and the final version was
made available in May 2013 analysts and
data scientists use Impala to analyze
Hadoop data via sequel or other business
intelligence tools using impalas MPP
style execution along with other hadoop
processing MapReduce frameworks you can
perform interactive ad hoc and batch
queries together in the hadoop system
let us discuss some benefits of Impala
in the next screen Impala is a flexible
engine that integrates well with the
existing Hadoop components this enables
the use of files stored in HDFS
different data formats available in HDFS
security metadata and Storage Management
used by MapReduce Apache hive and other
Hadoop software further Impala adds
capabilities that make sequel querying
easier than before the Impala
architecture also enhances sequel query
speed on Hadoop data the fast turnaround
of Impala queries enables new categories
of solutions you can also use Impala to
run interactive queries this helps you
come up with the best solution without
disrupting your workflow instead of
trying to shrink data to a
representative subset you can analyze
all data you have and produce the most
accurate solutions to problems further
Impala is apache licensed it enables
users to query low latency sequel data
from HDFS and Apache HBase without
causing any data movement or
transformation in the next screen let us
continue to discuss the benefits of
Impala Impala introduces high
flexibility to the familiar database
extract
form and load process you can access
data with a combination of different
Impala and Hadoop components without
duplicating or converting the data when
the query speed is slow use the parky
columnar file format for a faster
response this format easily reorganizes
data for maximum performance of data
warehouse style queries for users and
business intelligence tools that use
sequel impala introduces an effective
development model to handle new kinds of
analysis the combination of big data and
Impala makes sequel easy to use Impala
also provides flexibility for your big
data workflow sequel capabilities of
Impala such as filtering calculating
sorting and formatting lets you perform
these operations in Impala this helps
organize the query results for
presentation in the next screen let us
understand the role of Impala in
exploratory business intelligence prior
to Impala business intelligence data was
typically condensed to a manageable
chunk of high-value information the
information then passed through a
complicated ETL cycle before it was
uploaded to a database with Impala this
process is minimized the data arrives in
Hadoop after fewer steps and Impala
queries it immediately the high capacity
and high speed storage system of a
Hadoop cluster lets you bring in all the
data as Impala can query raw data files
you can skip the time-consuming steps of
loading and reorganizing data this
provides new possibilities for querying
analytic data you can use exploratory
data analysis and data discovery
techniques to query this type of data in
the next screen let us look at the
requirements to install Impala
in this demo you will learn to use cloud
Aero manager to start all the impalas
services open the cloud there a manager
page in the browser and go to the home
page in the home page click
host tab to see the Hadoop services
running on that host click the Hadoop
service running on the host
on the host page click the processes tab
to see the Impala services configured on
this host
on this page you see that three Impala
services are configured state star
catalog and Impala server click the
state store service which acts as a
coordinator between different Impala
servers running on different hosts on
this page you can see many default
charts generated for analyzing the
performance of state star to start the
state store click the action drop-down
shown at the rightmost corner of this
screen in the drop down list select
start this Impala State store a
confirmation pop-up will appear on the
screen click the start this Impala State
store button
now a command detail page will open
which will display the progress of start
this in Paulo state star close the
command detail page now go back to the
processes page click the Impala catalog
server service
warning unresponsive script message will
appear on the screen click the continue
button
to start the catalog server click the
action drop-down shown at the rightmost
corner of the screen in the drop down
list select start this emphatic catalog
server in the confirmation pop-up click
on start this Impala catalog server now
a command detail page will open and
display the progress of start this
Impala catalog server close the command
detail page go back to the process page
click the Impala server service
warning unresponsive script message will
appear on the screen click the continue
button to start the impaler server click
on the action drop-down shown at the
rightmost corner of the screen in the
drop down list select start this Impala
server a confirmation pop-up will appear
on the screen click start this Impala
server now a command detail page will
open and display the progress of start
this Impala catalog server close the
command detail page this concludes the
demo on using cloud error manager to
start all the Impala services let us
learn how to start Impala in the next
screen if you install Impala with cloud
era manager you can use cloud Aero
manager to start and stop the services
the cloud era manager GUI lets you
conveniently check if all services are
running and set configuration options
using form fields in a browser to start
the Impala state store and Impala D from
the command line or a script you can use
the service command alternatively you
can start the daemons directly through
the Impala D State store D and catalog D
executables start the Impala State Store
and then start Impala D instances you
can modify the values of the service
initialization scripts when starting the
state store and Impala by editing slash
etc slash default slash Impala start the
State store service using a command such
as sudo service Impala - state - store
start start the catalog service using a
command such as sudo service Impala -
catalog start start the Impala service
on each data node using a command such
as sudo service Impala - server start in
the next screen we will look at a demo
on starting Impala in this demo you will
learn to start Impala from come
and line connect to the impala server
using putty
execute the command to start in Paulo
state store
you
press Enter
after starting in Paulo state store
start the Impala catalog server by
executing the command shown on the
screen press Enter once you have state
store and catalog services running start
the Impala server by executing the
command shown on the screen press Enter
this concludes the demo on starting
Impala from command line let us discuss
data storage in Impala in the next
screen Impala uses two media to store
its data Hadoop distributed file system
or HDFS and HBase Impala depends on the
redundancy provided by HDFS to protect
from hardware or network outages on
individual nodes in HDFS Impala table
data is represented as data files in
HDFS file formats and compression codecs
for creating a new table impaler reads
these files regardless of their file
names new data is added in the files
with names controlled by Impala HBase is
a database storage system built on top
of HDFS without built in sequel support
it provides an alternative storage
medium for Impala data when you define a
table in Impala and map it to its
equivalent table in HBase you can query
the data of the HBase tables through
Impala in addition you can perform join
queries including both Impala and HBase
tables let us discuss managing metadata
in the next screen for tracking metadata
of schema objects such as tables and
columns Impala uses the same
infrastructure as hive invalid maintains
table definition information in a
central database called the meta store
you can use my sequel or post grey
sequel to act as a common meta store
database for both Impala and hive each
Impala node caches all the metadata to
reuse in future queries against the same
table
therefore you need to make a metadata
update for an Impala
if metadata change that occurs is made
from another Impala d instance in your
cluster or through hive a metadata
change also occurs if change is made to
a database to which clients such as the
Impala shell or ODBC connect directly
database and table metadata is typically
modified by hive via alter create drop
or insert operations and Impala D via
create table alter table and insert
operations invalidate metadata marks
table metadata as stale and reloads when
the table is referenced next let us
learn about controlling data access in
the next screen you can control data
access in Impala through authorization
authentication and auditing you can use
the Sentry open-source project for user
authorization century includes a
detailed authorization framework for
Hadoop when authorization is enabled
Impala picks the user ID of the OS where
the Impala shell or other client
programs are run and associates various
privileges with each user of the
computer you can control access to
Impala data by using authorization
techniques let us now discuss impala
shell commands in the next screen the
Impala shell tool and Impala shall help
perform functions such as creating
databases and tables inserting data and
issuing queries for ad-hoc queries and
exploration sequel statements can be
used in an interactive session in an
interactive session the - queue allows
issuing of a single query from the
command line you can do this without the
help of the interactive interpreter you
can use the - queue option to run Impala
shell from a shell script you can also
use the - queue option with the command
invocation syntax using scripts such as
Python or Perl using the - o option you
save the query output as a file using
the - B option you can print a text file
as an output with comma separated tab
separated or other delimited values when
printed in a non interactive mode the
query output gets printed to the
standard output format or to any file
that the - o option specifies incidental
output on the other hand is printed -
standard error this allows you to
process only the query output is part of
the unix pipeline in an interactive mode
the read line command is used by Impala
shell to recall or edit any previous
commands let us look at more impala
shell commands in the next screen you
can use the Impala shell tool to run the
following commands Connect describe
explain help history insert quit refresh
select set shell show use and version
commands such as alter compute stats
explain insert and connect can be used
to pass request to the Impala deed
daemon that the shell is connected to
within Impala shell in the next screen
let us view a demo on launching the
Impala shell command in this demo you
will learn to launch impalas shell to
execute sequel query to launch impalas
shell execute the Impala shell command
this will open an Impala shell
type help in this shell to see the list
of supported commands type help command
to get the help regarding a particular
command type help connect
type help explain
type help select
type help describe
type help insert
type version
type help values
type help profile
this concludes the demo launching
Impaler shell to execute sequel query
let us now proceed to the quiz section
