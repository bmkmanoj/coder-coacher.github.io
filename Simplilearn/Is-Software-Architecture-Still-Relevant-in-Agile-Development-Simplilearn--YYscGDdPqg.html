makes our stand apart in the league
Milton loss the leader simply learn calm
the industry leader in online education
and training for professional
certification courses
mr. Raja bhavani chief architect of mine
tree he's going to have a session as
software architecture still relevant in
agile a little bit of brief about Raja
he's the chief architect of mind I
product engineering services PSN ID
services groups in place and roles and
place in the role of a novel in jail
evangelist he has more than two decades
of experience in the IT industry he has
published papers as international
conferences on topics related to code
quality distributed agile customer value
management and software estimations Raja
holds a Master degree in electronics
from the Barisan unicity and perceived a
poor graduate diploma in computer
science and applications he is a member
of the IE Computer Society he regularly
interfaces with educational institutions
to offer guest lectures and rights for
technical conferences he writes for
magazines such as a gel record cultural
IT journal and st times please welcome
Raja Bhavani let us do some reorg so
there are some empty
on the topic title of the slide itself
the session title was this architecture
are still relevant in agile rancher is
of course yes so there is no meaning
debating about that rather we get into
something which is going to help us
understand that subject little more
right so what I do is I go around talk
to people deliver these sessions write
blogs and the most interesting part is
when people come to me and ask some
conflicting questions share their
experiences and participate in
discussions and that is what I expect
today so I want you to be engaged I want
you to ask questions and in many forums
like this we know one or two people who
have the curiosity the curiosity is will
you share the ppt at the end of the
presentation will you share the ppt at
the end of the session the answer is yes
if you want the BP day again he would
write a mail to me I can send it to you
but in in order to benefit all of you
what i have done is i have put the whole
thing as a four-part blog see these in
my blog post so what are we are going to
talk today it is all match fixed it is
all stare stage-managed and i have
thought through it and all that has been
articulated in a four-part blog and it
is it has been posted on the internet so
when you go home you go and search on
the internet on my name are at the end
of the session I will tell you the URL
of my blog go through it read it and
participate in
discussion so with that note is a fine
morning the traffic was not that bad
today and it's good to have all of you I
know all of you play a significant role
in your organization's watching my
texting
so if you have any questions we can have
a discussion around your questions or
nectar decision so what I am going to
cover today is with certain assumptions
one assumption is that is we know the
basics of a jail adopted I'm not going
to go deep into jenny manifesto
attainment suppose it's subscribe and of
course if you are new to a genuine
attempt to any programs you are going to
go through all those and I assume that
is all of us know what the Chinese we
know basic definition of what it is all
about and expectations are one is mobile
phone in silent mode and to me mobile
phone in silent mode is take your mobile
put it in mute and after putting it in
you have to take it like this and put it
in order on your desk so the screen is
not flashing one but there is a SMS or
call deliver your attention does not go
there otherwise if you have some
emergency situation informed if you are
expecting something you have to be on
Form keep it closer to keep it in a
vibrate more and people face and feel
free to ask questions and this is what
eggplant cover today just get into the
word the term architecture talk about
what software architecture is all about
and what is the role of an architect and
what do we expect from architects and
what kind of role these terms playing
software licensing we do architecture me
to design and what kind of role these
things play there are two different
schools of thought one in architecture
thinking how do these vary from each
other and architects and designers to be
about should they be in the world or
should we just do something else and
then what what can evaluate they can
bring to the table evaluating the
clothes and how does it relate to agile
methods so that's what you're going to
cover today and I want to start the
whole thing's a very light of north so
another hand raising exercise how many
of you recognize this building everyone
should raise your hand is standing or
what I in pony when you are what I am
cunent when it wants to stand in front
of a monument like this one of your mind
to some cards some words your software
engineers right you're soft IT
professionals as an IT professional you
go and stand in front of a building like
this several terms come to your mind
some people they go order right
architecture and what a solid design
and then slowly you start focusing on
certain elements that attract your ice
elements maybe those are slim
rectangular ridges or gaps which are
designed so that if the enemies are
going to attack you even direct your
arrows to light anyway you will not see
you but however up through direct you
wanna keep that image and there are
certain holes on top you can see the
window like big holes those are meant to
pour hot liquid on people's enemies are
going to come and stand and try to bang
on the door they are not going to do it
in a comfortable way the one for hot
water or hot liquid on so every element
has a purpose so what you do is you
slowly start observing certain sections
and say what is this why is this bill
you want to know more and more about
later you look at the door the door is
about 21 feet higher than autism and 21
feet high door because an elephant must
be able to get into the room this door
is not put just for human beings and
if that enemy is were attacked with his
elephants then the elephants are going
to come and band with their heads on the
door they should not be able to bang
their head because in order to do that
there are iron spikes so the end spikes
are meant to deter elephants from anyway
these elements may come and hit on the
door man on the go and like this you
keep on observing and go to the backyard
and see the race the whole thing has
been done with some planning in mind
there are some internal elements there
is a courtyard rooms or places to stay
and so on multiple games and you
understand every element in this
architecture in this building has office
and then which again I am working on
this project and spending so many hours
day in and day out I don't know what
this architecture is all about why don't
we do cool things like this in I people
so what is different in our our book so
in many conferences many speaking
sessions like this it is very easy to
compare civil engineering and software
but we do not go deep in such
comparisons
so those because those comparisons are
misguided us these two are different
things what is a highly mature
discipline another one reason you this
is maturing and there are so many other
differences however if you look at and
treat these sources as alternate sources
to not from definitely in have some
tables you can ask questions such as do
you think those days 1800 so late
seventeen hundreds there was an
architect who had an architectural
vision of Senegal one who created the
witching contacted a meeting in tolerate
this is how the architecture vision of
shinee aura is going to be now my face
is over I am going to go to Delhi
because they are building a new fourth
there I want to play the role of my part
is were i given you the architecture
vision ambition I have given yourself
diagrams I have given you some
guidelines and I am over this face and I
am going into so what do you think he
must have done nobody knows we should go
and do some research or do you think
that he must have stayed with his team
throughout the construction and he must
have had an open mind to collect ideas
from any given those
architecture so that when it is done and
delivered it has a better problems these
are some of the things we can definitely
think about and go with certain paper
very strong there is more our all is
different our world is dying when you
are doing a project you have to change a
new version of the OS is released a new
version of the database is released so
you are the upgrade you have
compatibility is issues and you have
made sure that your product is is going
to be released in another country of
geography so it should comply that line
it's a price so our role is done and our
world is different and in our world from
A to Z you will find these there are so
many tribes out the application
architecture and someone says business
architecture and you get anything to see
when deeper data architecture enterprise
architecture hardware architecture
information network performance security
and what so many buzzwords and every
everything has a meaning it's not that
somebody has all those goals on
something and live is life happily ever
after and we have n number of
architectures and in spite of these we
have adequate amount of fuzziness
what we do so now our focus of this
session is going to be software article
what is softonic what do we mean by
software objects so when we understand
this will be able to tell how it works
in evolutionary methods are agile
methods and how we it should work so
typically architecture talks about the
different components of the structure of
the system how these modules or
components are interrelated and what are
the interface is what are the external
systems and what are the performance
scalability reliability and all these
requirements and what are the guidelines
that the development team should follow
in order to implement this is so that is
one definition do you need to write it
down all these are there of the web and
it is all about making significant
decisions certain decisions which are
required to be made at early stage sort
of decisions that are going to help the
team in doing the development I'm
talking about the structural elements
interfaces their behavior how they are
composed and how these components are
going to relate to each other and make a
system as a whole in addition to that if
you see last paragraph this is not only
about the structure and behavior is not
you know just to a block diagram which
is the structure you have to define the
behavior that is you used drive em Fleck
sequence type so the behavior it is not
just about those static and dynamic
diagrams is more than that you say
functionality performance and reuse
economics how much money i ever spent
whatever our connection you have defined
is that going to assure
you that you will complete the project
within budget very important you cannot
assume that you have an unlimited budget
and define a lot of attention so this is
so going by this definition if you just
step back and relate or think about the
various types of arguments you have
worked with in your career I think all
of you must have at least 10 plus years
of experience so we come across the
lowermost type who is a PowerPoint
article so this is a person who is
passionate about creating our finds
block diagram and say this is the
architecture and his goal is you go to
the management team will explain the
whole thing present the whole thing now
he is 80 now active is at hand
architecture is ready the designers and
developers in return and the second
person is a release for documents who
who believes that his role is the
superior role he creates an architecture
is a form of a block diagram a small
word document he will hand it over to
the team and say that monologue change
his word I am moving into the next 13
and saw and the next one is a part-time
article is an architect who has
eliminated himself in organization at
any point of time he works on three or
four products and he will spend just a
day or two not more than that and he
thinks that he has a capability to
deliver of application be called when
there is a proposal made it will be
called when a project is starting and
sometimes in any call in a project is
under fire so he's a part-time so he is
very good at finding halls is very good
him talking about things and gay
general suggestions and the next cattle
is glorified warrant so that is there is
a coder there's a programmer who is very
good performing very well but here this
ambition of becoming architect he is
behind this manager he always follows up
and say they know what I well I get my
promotion then or do you want to become
you become a project manager no no
marketing and they say no if I don't
make it may not be very new design so
let me better make him an architect so
he's a glorified code already has been
given the type he's passionate about
things he wants to learn but he doesn't
know the ins and outs and the other
category is a project manager who failed
in many columns and people find today is
not a project management method manager
material but he knows technology so we
should make use of his skills and all ye
can be an architect for the organization
decides and say look a little let us
make fun of it let us call from an
architect and the ground reality is that
he miserably failed in the role of a
problem for that reason the organization
is pushed him into the role of and
finally you have the being there and
done that type of politics so those are
the real experts who have done that for
been in several projects who played the
trope go stay with the team until the
project is delivered and she will see
the ups and downs say they know the
ground realities so that is the real
picture of what is happening here in
history we have seen architects under
these five or six categories and you can
come up with more categories also based
on your experience
the being there and done that architects
are very hard to find sometimes
organizations try to categorize them as
introverted they don't go on mingle with
people but they are very hot kotecki
guys I want you to do only architecture
but he does coding awesome what I don't
like how they come but ideal architect a
great team player great coach so what do
we expect we expect all this experience
is a trade and in addition to that an
architect must be a humble person you
must always think that there is hope to
learn new things he must know how to
design use tools a developer Acco we
will be able to call coding is very
important and mentoring and coaching
working with the team and creating
multiple designers and architects inside
a project is very very important and he
has been a true leader a true leader is
someone who can influence people who can
negotiate who can present his
recommendations to the stakeholders who
can work with the management and make
them trust or make them believe how a
project is going to succeed because of
certain architectural decisions so these
qualities are very much tougher so when
we talk about architecture all these
coins are very very important we cannot
ignore so after knowing all these real
casa question do we need architects and
designers in certain kind of comments or
when we apply certain kinds of methods
or methodologies what is the role of an
architecture what is the role of a
design so then this question comes the
first thing I would ask what do you mean
by an architect what do you mean
so that is why I have pulled these
slides to set the context that the role
of an architect is not to create a block
diagram the role of an archetype is not
to create the powerpoint or an
architecture document it is more because
when you try to create a PowerPoint
presentation or an architecture document
what are you going you are trying to
define djokovic so defining the
architecture is one part another part is
implementing the occupation if you are
good at defining the architecture
Oh
Jesus yeah definitely is because a giant
is all about working as a team and not
taking position so taking position is
bureaucracy so taking positions has not
helped in any teams volunteering
becoming a role model becoming coach
becoming an influential person support
the whore takes a position does not
become an influential person because CEO
keep on going to know what I am to see
you as a CEO I'm doing this so he loses
it those who get on the ground and work
with people so going by all these
concerts I want to ask a very critical
question when you release a product when
you release an application in production
it is in the hands of the production
support people sustenance team or the
consulting and something thing goes
around implements of graves and always
so do you ever do they ever feel the
value of an architect or designer what
do they use array in them when there is
a fog when you are debugging something
on when you're doing customization in
most cases they wade through hundreds of
lines of code try to understand the code
try to understand the design try to
understand architecture then make the
pics so what kind of impact an
architectural design creating on the
post production release faces are active
practically nothing
all of you close your eyes and assume
that you're going to fix a very
difficult part and you have a facility
by which you are able to get a map of
the entire architecture zero down to
which modules you need to go and fix the
bug wouldn't be a gift for you isn't it
so in practice what happens is you have
an outdated architecture government you
have outdated designs online and you
have production code so those who spend
time reading the architecture and
document designed up when they
disappoint because the port talks over
nothing else and finally as part of
production support team or sustenance
team or consulting team what do you do
is you go to code in right understanding
so then my question is what value to
architects and designers add on how do
they intend to add some quality to the
work life who are involved in production
support systems and sometimes we have
not seen that happen but there are a lot
of people who are thinking about you are
researching and telling that there
should be some way of going until you
specify a module name specific
functional name the system should tell
people that I probably owe to take these
classes and start looking at these
nights you have to start looking at this
pond layer and architecture
and we have google maps we have so many
sophisticated applications on our
smartphone as well you get into your
work that work is a dumb world there's
not an intelligent world people are
frustrated
so traditional approaches I have left us
here with this question we have not seen
any benefit it is a ok now what is
actually do the utility is the thing
with our ability to create would respond
to changes and leaving a world where the
business environment is comfy you cannot
track requirements or product product
you would deliver every time we can
understand your market you must be able
to change according to what the market
experts and adaptability is important
people are important than the processes
and collaboration is important and a
giant believes in badly sufficient
mention doesn't go in textbook what we
do matters rather than what is returning
the text and to put it in simple clowns
when you work at least society you come
across terms like this delivered early
delivered frequently short intervals do
that in sustainable pace you must be
able to sustain the pace if you are
delivering every two weeks or every
three weeks or six months or 12 months
human you must be able to sustain that
the team should not gone out there
should be work-life balance and then
ever what values to the business what
matters to the business you should have
self enabled teams customer
collaboration is important responding to
change and failure you understand the
risks trying to fail early so that he
can recover you then understand what
happened even in and working code is a
foolish
not that you create an architecture
document of design document and your
project manager reports that the project
is completed twenty-five percent so that
is not the true measure of completing
documents and updating the project
status is not the true measure of
progress in our view there are two
schools on Thompson one is architecture
thing what you have seen in traditional
grow up there is an architect two things
you know what I am an expert I hope the
the cool title in this company I am a VP
around a general manager or someone who
is above all I will decide what we have
heard so many years of experience big up
front design is what I do I understand
all the requirements I draw a
specification of all designs and
architecture is a very complex entity I
promise I make my decisions coding is
what I used to know several years ago
but I am very busy these days and to
this and up in the hierarchy and a lot
of coding but I don't even get time to
review your ok I only do two or three
hours per day I'll come and sit in
meetings and hear some suggestions I'd
walk versus a jolly thinking is we do
just enough architecture and we always
stay together as a team we don't do big
upfront design because a big upfront
design has disadvantages they make the
system very rich it really makes a
certain decisions you you make too many
decisions and you don't want to move you
don't want to change those positions and
later on you end up wasting time and
changing certain components that you've
done it is good to do just enough design
and always a J people feel that I know I
hope with you you do not show me
your mentor equally emerging
architectural design we understand the
overall purpose of what we are going to
do we developed architecture and design
in bits and pieces and implement
demonstrate the feature get feedback and
move for this is the curve we want
accommodate changes in the cost
effective manner or in a cheap man
whenever there is a change we must be
able to accommodate change without
making a lot of modifications and for
this we will work as a team to evolve
the right architectural design renew
provide the right diagrams and documents
as is necessary well we are not going to
give documents that never get updated
when the project is at the logical end
we will decide if an architecture
document or design document are a cool
feature that i told you about is going
to help it if that is what is going to
help the team we will deliver it maybe
your production support guy comes and
types and few keywords on my system I
documentation depositary is going to
give him on direct him towards the right
interesting right there right component
it is going to make his life these cool
thoughts are totally and using a lot of
success in vagina a general is be
happening thing a giant method so
successful many companies are adopting a
giant which means that those who live
with artificial thinking they need to
change their mind and they become okay
they have come here believe that
architecture can emerge they are believe
that there is no big upfront design they
are do believe that architecture is not
a phase wise activity this architecture
phase but it continues throughout the
life line they have to believe that they
have a role to play in making the team
better and better so when you don't have
those things in your mind you always get
frustrated are just busted architect
architects and designers to be about you
what do we do with these guys we call
them as always we condemn the designers
now we ever start a scrum project in my
company then there is a scrum master and
the team members so how do we put these
architects and designers in this station
but to be a model is your job or you
want to have the job title or these
tiles already subject and they are not
dead we need architects and designers
and you must understand what is I
occifer you must understand the
principle suicide and they must believe
that they can add value so now the
question is how can they add value I
think I talked about some of those
already how can they are why they can
add value in many ways they can do
architectural planning along with the
team team understands the overall
picture of econ clip it appears the
vision of what are critical come I gotta
leave their RJ needs those things do not
have a clue about the vision of the
architect we keep doing orders
keep doing what Oscar Islamic
architecture driven approach is a way to
understand technically there is no other
way how to implement certain end-to-end
reaches you have to implement those
features the right kind of the
production life data that is when you
and identify certain risks and fix
otherwise you fill the entire system it
moves in production then you come across
under my sheets and forward mission and
roadmap enables T and the team members
know that there is a person who draws
the road who knows what is going to
happen in this project or the next two
or three months they feel happy about it
that enables them and it creates a
learning environment architect sits with
the team members they learn architecture
they learn designs they learn how to
write beautiful corn we learn how to
write and architects and designers can
become role models and then once take a
valium so I Chad Michaels but
unfortunately what happens in our
industry is you have a bad word but that
is a phenomena called the window seat
everybody wants a windows and if you
also question what is your window seat
somebody's is a delivery manager what is
your window sweet and execute your vice
president what is your windows you know
I know I want to windows it but I don't
know what that is another person what is
your windows is I want to become an
architect so in order to capture the
window see from the time your onboarding
start you graduate out of college
onboarding starts from that time in each
and every step they are fast very fast
they don't understand the opportunities
to learn things they don't write
beautiful home they don't do software
engineering very well with high quality
because there is a hard question to
occupy the window seat sometimes you are
in a mattress you go and realize that
there is no illusion there is nothing
like sometimes you go and occupy later
you feel that you're incompetent you are
not ready to talk about rather a
PowerPoint architect on your release for
us
I'll if you if we want to reverse this
trend doing a chinese the way when agile
teams work together and assuming that
you have the right architect in your
team he is not a release product you're
going to sit with the team throughout
the project right so those end engineers
who have boarded into your company from
university they are going to go through
a great experience I want to write
beautiful coat don't understand what
architecture is and whether they are in
a mad rush to occupy the windows either
of art in each and every step there were
no pain good how many of your way raise
your hands so don't three how to do that
experienced over T those end kids who
graduate from college and come and go
bishop so with that note this is
yes there can be a valuable to come up
with a system like this before example
there are software systems or products
that live for more than 10 years they
undergo upgrades there are greater not
operating systems and data vision but
the life is more than 10 years so
imagine that your system like this as
well let me extend it beyond imagination
presume when you're sitting in your
office burst the production support bulk
powerful immediately or go to a
smartphone application it helps you
browse through the map of your
architecture and arrive at the location
where the enhancement has to be you will
reach the office and swipe your card the
mindset you want to do it you want to
satisfy the customer now as soon as you
receive a main like that what happens
blood body's temperature in your body
because you don't know where the bug is
even know whether you are going to solve
it before five o'clock that day and your
son or daughter's birthday that they are
your spouse birthday they will go home
on time there is no guarantee and that
puts lot of stress on IT positions
that's a good point we should
so no sometimes that way
and how do you justify the ry meaning
you know typically like you said you
know architects us senior people they
are from a cost perspective if they are
expensive so from our perspective if we
have more number of architects in the
company that you know every small team
as an architect engaged all the way to
hume of the project execution you think
you know from this perspective of cost
is it justified or is there a way to
what rectification just different say
assume that we have a real international
swimming pool which means all these
international standards a lot of young
kids in pune come and learn swimming
there and there are these five
lifesavers they come there well-dressed
they sit there and they're listening to
radio will see every day and they see
somebody groaning they were going to
help and comfort for their activities
done and this happens only once or
poisoning so you never know other three
guys are efficient effective you convert
all of them as trainers you want to save
people's life when you're also going to
be in the pool all the time you're going
to train these entries so now apply this
the hopper process instead of having
those architects who sit in a cabin in
closed doors put them on the block so
that will either help you eliminate bad
architects are that will help us
cultivate the architectural culture and
things that will nurture those skills
and competence and things otherwise I
think any software professionals with
certain number of years of experience
can get into a project and money comes
sometimes those Falls may be false
of any real defense short happens if we
want to do if you don't equalize
architects the real roi happens when
architects working the team and motivate
with you so you're not equate an
architect's hour with money you not say
that this architect is worth 200 hours
how do you know what kind of deliverable
mean architects of the liver problems
and how do you estimate that ROI based
on knowledge which that has not been
proved just because somebody has 20
years experience you cannot put a dollar
with a rubber blue raider you understand
my point of view and all go by fast tell
that last year this architect got me
this much revenue so with that ROI I
will compare what I'm gonna do so do we
have any numbers to compare in most
cases we don't we go with assumptions
and those are dial dangerous disastrous
that's how I will put it we talked about
all I especially what value we will
bring onto the table just get onto the
ground work and in that process let
these same athenaeus lanka within learn
what designers because by just by
sending somebody for two day training
program on design I don't think they
were competitive desires they know what
this is all you know something about
this then they have to go to us or
across their great a lot their
experimental out there
and some activities and when that is
just senior person who is capable of
doing whatever maybe somebody who does a
lot of design but he is not going so
much of coding that's okay if team
members are not designed for this person
why and in that process is this
architect ready to learn coding from the
team are as this person's giving the
mindset that coding is all over in my
life i am going to be a block diagram
course i am going to create go and
continue happen more of a pre sales
person you can go on market thing sell
things you cannot implement the river
deliver I of the you need again our
questions complete what kind of project
we need to focus considerable time on
the defining and implementing
architecture and design and see what
kind of projects we need not we can go
clean implement creature so this is a
schematic I came up with there are four
factors or key factors this is the
investment should be linked to the
costings making the maintenance of a
return of mobile financial thoughts all
right if you look at only money Michelle
the return of investment counsel is very
clearly very simple whatever you in u.s.
water return you're getting but what are
the pipeline's see we keep on what you
see i can increase my return on
investment by keep on working on
projects and after five years already
going to happen to my health to my
family what kind of coffee tendencies I
made the book I'm a developing myself
these are important when you work as
software teams where you are senior
person who calls in local designer or an
archetype more than the monetary the
monitor is eternal value is important
more than that how is the same getting
motivated with this person what kind of
learning is a Lincoln is he creating new
designer is he creating new architects
are always we have the worry that those
five days lrc things what will happen in
these three guys design we are going to
be the next up are you creating the next
level of people in the company so we
have to see all this together and see if
the ROI just because it what's not a
kind of activities do not have a direct
mission of power for example I am coming
and speaking here my company is what is
our way of Roger going and spending half
day in a hotel in pune I don't have a
nice what are you going talk you don't
but this is a community we are learning
so many things similarly an architect
believe it is he has certain things to
do to its team in terms of increasing
their experience or competency doing the
quality of product yes yes so it is good
to compare ask you what is the current
dollar and what are we are we expecting
next year and demonstrate and we don't
know the current column and then
somebody has a question is like very
nightmare and get it out of your bread
bed and your throat is all warmed up you
want to drink of water I have a little
treat take a look
what is ur so I came up with this key
factors the four key factors identified
there may be some more also one is the
primary thing is the competence
architectural design competency of the
set of people who perform the title you
may have an expert you may have a
horseshoe there is no and technology
what kind of technology is involved in
your prime whether that technology stack
is familiar of the steam or it is
totally a new path you stuck next is
domain what kind of domain are they
working what doe mind is this project
all is familiar my curriculum and
complexity for example is it a massive
complex project several interfaces and
stuff or it's a simple project let us
take that size hello side as you the CEO
of a company wants to implement the
timesheet matter attendance management
system and all of you sit in a meeting
and the project manager are one of the
senior members the so-called designer or
architect says know what we need at
least a month to define and construct
the architecture complex CA what are you
guys doing I want this system in three
weeks I cannot wait
so assuming that the company has defined
platforms defined technology to develop
their applications smart architects and
go and reuse existing components they
are not going to write new exception
handlers they are not going to write new
logging thing works they will reuse
existing things they're going to work on
features because they want to show how
the system works to the stakeholders
early so they can start implementing
features whereas if you are on this side
switched I come over the clean side let
me know what angle side where things are
fuzzy you are asked to define and create
an exchange traders exchange for
commodity play across the keys the new
device and it is going to go multiple
technology is any more people from
multiple countries then it is worth
doing a good number of meetings and
decision-making on your architecture and
design it is good good to prototype
market we desire a certain set of
combinations an operating system
database application server and stuff it
is good to take some prominent use cases
or user stories implement them and see
if the architecture can hold those
features
on stranger because it is not like a
typical city development in a civilian
Kooning City Planning sits in somebody's
office but all you see is a narrow road
that gets develop a lot of apartments
are surrounding that and all of a sudden
what happens from me a brother and have
a few years road widening happen nobody
was aware that the road was going to be
thanked broad and all of other end the
code is wrong so these kind of
implementations are approaches in
software will create a big mess you
should think lewisham how at the same
time you cannot afford it on big upfront
design I don't mean a big upfront this
empty should take certain decisions you
have to think about some things which
are very very necessary and move on to
implementing things so that you get an
opportunity to identify risks Adam okay
and so which means that even if I pure
agile methods say that you know what
from the first iteration start
delivering features that doesn't work in
scientist you have to fit your method to
the project you cannot fill to your
project into the matter what are
depending on the nature of your project
depending on the circumstances the
running of the competency technology
your mind project complicating factors
like is you have to take a cost again
doesn't say that there is no thing
called an architecture sprint you can do
that you can click start with an
architecture sprint explain or not to
springs or one or two iterations and if
you want to spend one full iteration
only in testing you do that because that
is your way of doing things if it makes
sense to you do that and that is good
for that concluding remarks thank you
any questions so this is my last slide
yes
all structure is an architect see an
architect as I told you that there are
several types of architects and these
day you you clear about Enterprise
architects who are responsible for
defining and maintaining the
architecture it enterprise level but
instead of project software architect
work in a software project belongs to
that organization and ideally taking
positions doesn't work then what I Jane
methods are examples from say then the
scrum master will more like a coach and
enabler facilitator but not a manager
and with the scrum master the scrum team
works the scrum tee is typically seven
to ten feet or seven to nine p and all
of them are called team and they work as
a team so an architect has to fit into
that structure where is the SDM which is
another a giant litter talks about
technical leaves role contantly
architect leader of political but now he
defines a soul what do these are you
bring onto the table what are their
delivers but fitting it to a scruffy
districts is jurisdiction right you were
expected to work or cross streets in a
project should your student in there is
a person so what it depends on the
structure is one thing but behavior in
the prob what do you what kind of
behavior is computed do you think that
an architect working with that thing
until the end of a project is going to
give you better results then why would
you like to work on different parts I
didn't say different projects of
different teams on the same project that
is that is also any different if it were
big project is happening it has multiple
from team italian architects code
information with all things and that he
makes valuable develop he should not be
enough
depending on the expectations of the
project from fat oxidation you were to
design the reporting sir I is an ongoing
basis he may be reporting into a
functional head of the CTO receptor
that's fine but as soon as he located to
a large project which is beautiful from
things and he is responsible for working
with all these things in delivering
there has to be a comment that Yoga is a
full-time architect on this Kazakh and
he will report it to someone who is
warning this product on the earth is
organizing it can be your chief scrum
master tenure delivery head of orange
you having you spend more time and
thinking about the reporting structures
and authorities and irr is that thinking
about how we can do things that that is
going to continue in it but it is good
to pass at regular intervals and think
about that counts that will make our
lives better that's what I I believe we
should do that let me make some
difference if you keep on thinking about
these are these are important things we
live in a corporate life you cannot
ignore these supporting structures they
cannot ignore this harder
rider to the start of your sprint one
yesterday you have a speed 0 we're so in
spring zero like what old architecture
or designer shipley where your
conceptual design is in the process so
what kind of inputs should be going to
look into that the teams actually get
started on the spirit first priority
Development stopped at sea
sprint 0 of the first for three weeks
and one month you spend in a project is
about understanding the one of the
high-level needs of the project and who
our customers and on what kind of
platform is this project is going to
hardware software platforms and the
questions of the software tools and
packages you will refuse the development
environment a given configuration
management system and various other
tools that are going to enable your team
like a bug tracking tool or agile
project management tool that you're all
these decisions are important after that
how this system is going to get
implemented at the end how many later
apprised of the box and then but you
create division in the team the team
member should know oh this is what we
are going to do because be a team
exercise and she doing those iteration
of it so that is where you are
restraining yourself from big upfront
design and you're doing minimalistic
design minimalistic definition your
delegate developing teachers and you
create an opportunity to fail early on
fail fast when you fail early pay pause
you also have opportunity to you prove
yourself post and do things so if you
want to leave a descriptive thing about
what I'm telling you written oh there's
a PDF on critical success factors
industry
so you search critical success factors
and my name probably that PDF to come on
download the PDF reading I think I
elaborated in it in a section called
base so we call it a page when you start
a father you have a face that is before
starting your flaking on complex
mountains you go based on all people
come together they understand what they
were who is going in which direction and
what time they want to come back and me
today so base camp or sprint 0 is very
essential as you should have planet e
and what you're going to do in spreading
otherwise you complete all day instead
20 you remind pruners and that's one
good question are you running out of
time where we have time okay
and the problems that we face post you
know implementation of the system so
since we age I don't recommend is a
print design what happens like as you
know we've progressed we figured out
that you know we should have shuddered
this class reserved or something you
know well in advance then it would have
helped you know who follows a standard
guidelines so since we don't do that we
end up having some port which is not
align with you know which is not uniform
or project and see end up and doing
refactoring or remote so this also we
get into maintenance problem so our
teacher and insight on balancing see
that is what you realize how steady and
joyful journey towards the window seat
you are not resting on each and every
step you ask you reflect your on and can
you go project without all these
mistakes gran turismo but when you
reflect and learn you can do course
correction you can do things in a better
way whatever you're told I think it's a
good learning for all of us and you have
done that in part maybe next time you're
going to think about it you ever asked a
question are we ignoring something in
sprint Z or are we ignoring something in
this place do you think we have
developed one more critical component
and make sure that it works if s what is
that can you identify the critical
comment so these dialogues will happen
in meetings it will not blindly follow
somebody but can lead to a project
speakin styles of day one today and
deliver I don't think
extrano water Taj Mahal was built them
forget about historic monuments even
some of the cool things like ipad all
these devices I don't think they are
constructed them you always do the fact
I'm with something you find it every
time better in fact move towards the
front design can change people can
prepare your people making wrong
decisions a giant value they are
accommodating they learn more they don't
start the plane came and stopped the
show we have time for one last question
I'm on if the suspicion often now I have
seen you know even Enterprise architects
would whenever they're planning for a
solution they would think of either from
a technology point of view but very few
people think of business model because
these are the dynamic things in business
and same industry or same cup with you
know a kind of a typical kind of thing
would follow different business model so
how does one take care of that because
teams are typically focused on you know
a very specific aspect of the solution
of holy power and to bring in that kind
of thinking and the you know
discipline into the team to think about
the business model view of the customer
the understanding the planning that
business requirement of the customer is
very important today there itself is any
teams fault of faith participating in
discussions asking questions and showing
working features the customer getting
their feedback so these are the
activities where you are going to get
more and more response to the business
users so when you interact more and more
with business users and you've awoken
mind to lunch you are going to learn
more about business requirements the
next stage is understanding their
business model how the business model
works who are competitors in what way
this software application or product is
going to make sense to the emphasis what
were you going to tell them meet their
business groups who are their fears for
growing competitors so these kind of
questions have to be asked it cannot be
also a junior 18 years so these
questions have to be a special senior
