called equivalence partitioning
equivalence partitioning is a method of
deriving test cases when we have large
number of input data to choose from
using equivalence partitioning helps us
cut down exponentially on the number of
test cases required to test system when
we have large number of input data
ranges it is an attempt to get good test
coverage to find the most errors with
the smallest number of test cases in
this method classes of input conditions
called equivalence classes are
identified in which each member of the
class causes the same kind of processing
and therefore leads the generation of
the same output result in other words a
class is a set of input conditions is
likely to be handled the same way by the
system if we are supposed to get an
error while testing a condition with
certain input from a class then system
should get same error for all other
inputs from the same class let us look
at how we can implement equivalence
partitioning the first step towards
implementation is to examine the input
and output divided the inputs and
outputs into equivalence classes based
on the behavior inputs can be valid or
positive scenarios and invalid or
negative scenarios following are some
general guidelines for identifying
equivalence classes if the requirements
state that a numeric value is input to
the system and must be within a range of
values identify one valid class input
which are within the valid range and two
invalid equivalence classes inputs the
invalid classes will be lower than
expected inputs and higher than the
expected input
if a system accepts dates of birth as an
input and gives age as an output we can
identify classes as follows first valid
input class will be date is greater than
zero this will generate a valid output
which is greater than zero second
invalid class will be date is less than
zero for this invalid input output class
will generate an error message hence in
this case our classes will be all date
of birth less than zero and other class
will be all date of birth greater than
zero any value within same class gives
output value from the same class either
age which is greater than zero or an
error message but one should notice that
in first valid input class the output
will not be the same rather the output
will be different for each different
input value but will remain in the same
class which is age greater than zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
