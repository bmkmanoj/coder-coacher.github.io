course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on process group
view a project manager is supposed to
fulfill a project's requirements that is
to deliver a unique output in a timely
manner it starts in the form of an idea
that is approved by a project initiator
or sponsor the project manager and the
project team then elaborate their
understanding of the requirements and
produce the final deliverable which can
be a product a service or a result
throughout the project the project
management team needs to ensure that the
stakeholders are engaged in the project
and their expectations are being managed
the project management team also needs
to ensure that there is good
communication between the project team
and the stakeholders in addition the
team should make sure that the
constraints of scope cost time quality
and others are balanced in addition to
producing deliverables a project
generates data such historical data
archives or records are important for
planning future projects there are five
major process groups in project
management in the next screen we will
discuss how these process groups are
related to each other the five process
groups and project management are
initiating planning executing monitoring
and controlling and closing processes
the image shows how these process groups
interact with each other the initiating
processes occur only once during a
project or phase within a project at the
beginning whereas the closing processes
occur only once towards the end however
planning executing and monitoring and
controlling processes are repeated
several times during a project the
planning processes take information from
the initiating processes and help to
prepare an initial baseline version of
the plan as the team starts execution
they understand the ground realities
better the deliverables produced and the
data of the progress are fed into the
monitoring and
controlling process group in the
monitoring and controlling process group
the information generated during
execution is processed and utilized in
three different ways
firstly it can be used for revising the
plan which is termed as replanting
secondly it can be fed back into
execution as defects or corrective and
preventive actions or approved changes
and thirdly the information can result
in the cancellation of the project or
the successful completion of the project
upon validation of the deliverables
produced while discussing processes
consider it from the perspective of
project manager or as part of the
project management team this implies
that you are essentially functioning in
the integration management knowledge
area the initiating process includes two
steps which include getting the project
charter approved and identifying
stakeholders click each tab to learn
more a project manager is concerned
about getting the Charter for the
project approved project Charter sets
the beginning of the project where the
management has decided in its favor and
is ready to commit resources for it the
other process in the initiating process
group is identifying stakeholders the
project manager and the project team
should know the stakeholders and their
requirements which is the starting point
for planning you may get concept based
questions in the PMP exam so study the
initiating process to answer such
questions easily planning accounts for
most of the processes in the project
management framework as many as 24 out
of the 47 project management processes
belong to the planning process group the
basic objective of the planning
processes is to produce the project
management plan collectively the
developed project management plan under
integration management assimilates the
output of all the planning processes
under various knowledge areas the
project management plan is the
collection of all subsidiary plans that
address different aspects of the project
the project management team integrates
all these plans and ensures that they
are in harmony with
another the team also prepares a
blueprint of how the project needs to be
executed controlled and closed the
planning process starts with scope
planning which is to understand exactly
what you are trying to achieve this is
translated into a project scope
statement which can be decomposed into a
work breakdown structure or WBS which
forms the basis of other planning
processes any change to the scope
invariably has a bearing on other
parameters that can affect the project
following the same logic it is easier to
understand how the planning processes
and other knowledge areas such as
quality cost and time can influence the
time that will be taken the costs that
will be incurred and the way quality
will be managed to satisfy the scope
cost time and quality equilibrium the
project team needs to manage
communications risk stakeholders
procurements and human resources this is
where the planning processes under these
knowledge areas come in all these
planning processes interact with each
other planning is an interactive
activity that gets elaborated refined
and adjusted as more and more
information about the project is
discovered planning without execution is
futile
but execution without planning is fatal
however in execution processes the
project team spends a lot of time
putting the plan into action when you
perform the executing processes you
often blend the execution and
controlling processes execution is all
about performing the plan that is
producing the deliverables and providing
information on the progress processing
of this information and the validation
of the deliverables is a control
function the executing process is the
direct and managed project work where
the project manager essentially puts
certain mechanisms in place to ensure
that the work is being carried out the
project manager primarily focuses on
ensuring that the procurements are
conducted these procurements are
deliverables or services that the
project needs to buy from external
sources the project manager also needs
to ensure
smooth flow of communication within the
project team and with the external
stakeholders the manager should make
sure that stakeholders are engaged in
the project and that the processes for
managing quality are being followed
correctly it is important for the
project manager to make sure that the
right team is being used they have the
knowledge and competencies to do the job
and they work together as a team the
project manager should also manage the
team to make sure they are positioned
for success monitoring is observing and
getting data about how things are going
within the project where as controlling
is taking actions to bring things back
on track monitoring and controlling
apply to different aspects of project
management the image shows the various
areas of project management where
monitoring and control applies however
the knowledge area that has a
corresponding control process is human
resources because human resources should
be managed not controlled an important
aspect of controlling is having an
elaborate mechanism to handle changes
closing processes bring a project or a
phase within the project to an orderly
conclusion only to knowledge areas
include a closing process these are
integration management and procurement
management closing a project or phase
falls under integration management and
applies to the overall project before
the project is formally closed all the
procurements or contracts that are
entered to end - for the project must be
formally closed as well study the
closing processes in detail to answer
concept based questions in the PMP exam
