ability to move and reuse the
application components regardless of the
provider platform operating system
location storage format of data or api's
it is one of the key aspects while
choosing a cloud vendor since the vendor
offering portability services will
protect the user from vendor lock-in
they also offer business value by
allowing identical cloud deployments
with different cloud providers this is
done to facilitate disaster recovery
data backup as well as global
deployments of a single solution
Portability and interoperability art is
essential irrespective of the type of
cloud deployment it is important while
selecting a service model regardless of
where the migration happens to
inability to conform to Portability and
interoperability in cloud can create
serious and expensive problems these
problems may further lead to project
delays let's discuss in detail about the
problems that should be avoided the
first problem is vendor lock-in this is
a situation where the user is unable to
switch to another cloud offering or
another vendor
the next problem is incompatibility of
process causing disruption of service
this in turn causes malfunctioning of
application within different cloud
infrastructures
the next problem is switching to a new
provider which requires rework of
existing process functions or changes in
code therefore lack of interoperable and
portable formats may lead to unexpected
changes in the data while moving to a
new provider the unexpected application
re-engineering
or business process change can also
result in project delays
moving on to the next problem that is
costly data migration or data conversion
lack of portable formats is a problem
while moving to a new provider leads to
high cost during data migration even the
process of data conversion is a costly
affair retraining or retooling new
application to the organization's
business needs is a difficult task this
is also one of the major problems which
results in project delays
in addition to this different providers
may have different security policies and
compliance standards this can further
create new risks like loss of data or
application security while moving to a
new provider
migrating to cloud services can be
compared to outsourcing where we know
the plan upfront and also plan an exit
strategy upfront
similarly Portability and
interoperability should be the key
aspects for organizations to migrate to
cloud and also to have an unhindered
exit strategy
have come to the end of this domain
let's have a short recap of this domain
we discussed briefly about
interoperability and portability
we looked into recommendations for
interoperability which looks at the
infrastructure aspects we also looked
into the recommendations for portability
with respect to the issues pertaining to
security
SLA etc lastly we discussed in detail
about the recommendations for the
different types of cloud models this
brings us to the end of this domain
following slides are dedicated to the
quiz section which will help you
understand this domain better in the
next domain we will be learning about
traditional security business continuity
and disaster recovery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
