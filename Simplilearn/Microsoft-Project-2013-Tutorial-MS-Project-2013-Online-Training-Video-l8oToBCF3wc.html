the introduction in the next slide
the objective of any project is to
create a product obtain a desired result
or deliver a service to meet this
objective a project manager needs to
define the scope the work that needs to
be performed and the time by when the
work should be completed the project
manager also needs to define the cost of
the project cost includes the material
equipment and resources or people who
will work on the project resources can
include a group of people who have
different skills or are present in
different locations hence these people
may influence the cost of a project in
different ways in the next slide we will
understand the concept of project
management
project management refers to the
application of knowledge and methods to
execute projects successfully the
project management life cycle consists
of five phases they are initiating
planning executing closing and
monitoring and controlling project
initiation is the phase where a project
manager discusses the project scope and
its feasibility with stakeholders during
project planning the project manager
outlines the tasks and schedule and
comes up with an approximate budget and
resource plan the project manager
executes the project by allocating tasks
to resources project related information
is updated regularly the project is
closed after the client approves of
product or service quality monitoring
and controlling is an ongoing phase in a
project the project manager monitors and
controls project activities throughout
the project cycle this cycle continues
until all the tasks are completed
although all these phases are important
planning is the most critical since
proper planning can help control the
time and cost of a project we have
discussed project and project management

Project 2013 interface
the screenshot of Microsoft Project 2013
Start screen interface is shown here
there are different ways in which a
project is created in Microsoft Project
2013 firstly a new project can be
created from a blank or existing
template secondly a project can be
created from an existing project thirdly
it can be created from a Microsoft Excel
workbook finally a project can be
created from a Microsoft SharePoint task
list these methods are discussed in
detail in the forthcoming slides let us
understand how to create a project from
a blank project template in the
following slide
a new project can be initiated in
Microsoft Project 2013 by creating a
blank project and then adding project
details into it the highlighted section
on the screenshot is the blank project
template which you can use to create a

chart view 6 zoom tool 7 status bar in
the next slide we will focus on how to
create a new project using an existing
template
Microsoft Project 2013 has many
pre-installed templates that can be used
to create a new project some of the
important pre-installed templates are
new product launch commercial
construction residential construction
market research schedule etc these
templates include a sample task
structure and reports which can be
modified to suit the project let us
understand how to create a project using
an existing template through a demo in
the next slide
Andrew Murphy is an IT manager working
at neutral Worldwide Inc the firm plans
to develop a software application to
efficiently manage its product
development process the completion date
for the software development project is
April 11th 2014 Andrew wants to create
the initial plan in Microsoft Project
2013 using a built-in software
development plan template he also wants
to edit the start and finish dates of
the project click the demo icon to learn
how Andrew creates a project from an
existing template and changes the dates
in Microsoft Project 2013
let us read the steps to create a new
project from an existing template in
Microsoft Project 2013
in this slide we will discuss how to
create a project from an existing
project a new project can also be
created from an existing project a
similar project can be used from the
previous history to enter the new
project details to it when a project is
created this way the existing project
acts as the foundation for the new
project in the next slide we will learn
how to create a new project using a
Microsoft Excel workbook
you can create a new project from an
Excel workbook if your project
information is in Microsoft Excel
workbook format it can be imported into
Microsoft Project 2013 without losing
the data and its format an example is
shown in the next slide to explain the
conversion of an Excel workbook into a
project file
the first screenshot is of an Excel
spreadsheet project data and the second
screenshot is of the same Excel
spreadsheet after converting it to
Microsoft Project 2013 as you can
observe the data and formatting in
Microsoft Project data tabulation is
intact even after the conversion let us
understand how to import tasks from
Excel through a demo in the next slide
Andrew Murphy has created a new project
using the built-in template of Microsoft
Project 2013 during the initial project
discussions
Andrew created a task list in a
Microsoft Excel workbook since he is
using Microsoft Project 2013 to create
the plan he wants to import this task
list instead of re-entering the tasks in
the project file click the demo icon to
learn how Andrew imports tasks from the
Microsoft Excel workbook into Microsoft
Project 2013
let us read the steps to import tasks
from a Microsoft Excel workbook into
Microsoft Project 2013
let us discuss how to create a project
from Microsoft SharePoint task list in
this slide another way to create a new
project in Microsoft Project 2013 is
from the Microsoft SharePoint task list
if the development team is using
SharePoint for a project the project
manager can synchronize the task list
from SharePoint without using the
project web app this will allow the team
members to view the project schedule on
SharePoint any updates on SharePoint
will be reflected in the Microsoft
project plan in the next slide we will
see a sample task list from a SharePoint
project
a sample task list from a sharepoint
project is shown here we will learn the
different ways of sharing project data
using SharePoint in a later lesson let
us proceed to the next slide and discuss
base calendar in Microsoft Project 2013
when planning a schedule knowledge about
working days and hours downtime
vacations holidays etc are critical for
a project manager these details allow
the project manager to plan the project
resourcefully hence the project manager
can set up a base calendar to plan his
project in a better way the key elements
of a base calendar are resource
allocation this helps in assigning the
right resources for the project project
scheduling this helps in scheduling the
project resource availability this helps
in identifying the working time to
determine when the resources are
available to work in the project in the
next slide we will discuss the types of
base calendars
there are three types of base calendars
namely standard calendar nightshift
calendar and 24-hour calendar click the
audio icon for more details on each base
calendar type
andrew has imported a task list from an
Excel workbook into the Microsoft
Project 2013 application andrew is now
planning the working hours of the
resources the team will be working on a
weekend or a public holiday to test how
well the product integrates with other
office applications andrew needs to
update the working days in a project
calendar using Microsoft Project 2013
click the demo icon to learn how Andrew
updates the working days in a project
calendar in Microsoft Project 2013
let us read the steps to update the
working days in a project calendar in
Microsoft Project 2013
this slide covers the concept of
creating a new base calendar you can
also maintain different calendars for
the same project using the create new
base calendar option in Microsoft
Project 2013 the steps to create a new
base calendar are shown on the slide
click the change working time option
followed by the create new calendar
option the create new base calendar
window will be displayed if the project
team is spread across geographies with
each region having its own set of
working and non-working days the project
manager can create a new calendar for
each geographical region he can apply
these calendars to the resources and
tasks we will cover this concept in
detail in subsequent lessons let us
proceed to the next slide and understand
the set baseline command
the screenshot of the set baseline
window in Microsoft Project 2013 is
shown here if the project manager wants
to compare the status of the project
with the original plan the set baseline
command can be used baseline records the
project plan and resource allocation and
this can be used as a benchmark to
compare the project performance you can
set up to 11 benchmarks in Microsoft
Project 2013
in this slide we will discuss how to
create a template from a completed
project Microsoft Project 2013 allows
you to save the completed project plans
as project templates this is
advantageous because the strategies from
past projects such as tasks
relationships productive resources or
project reports can be shared and can be
applied to future projects creating a
template involves exporting the project
plan and saving it as a project template
once a project template has been created
it can be used as a template for other
projects
information such as project information
project schedule project calendar start
date and finish date of the project are
important to create a new project in
Microsoft Project 2013 a new project can
be created using a blank template an
existing project an existing template a
Microsoft Excel workbook and a Microsoft
SharePoint task list a base calendar is
the main calendar used in a project the
types of base calendar are standard
night shift and 24-hour calendar the set
baseline command can be used to create a
base point that acts as a benchmark to
compare the project performance
Microsoft Project 2013 provides an
option to save an existing project as a
template for future use
in the next lesson we will focus on
project tasks in Microsoft Project 2013
hello and welcome to lesson three of the
Microsoft Project 2013 course offered by
simply learn this lesson describes how
to setup and manage project related
tasks information in Microsoft Project
2013 let us explore the objectives of
this lesson in the next slide
by the end of this lesson you will be
able to add new tasks in Microsoft
Project 2013 create a project outline
scheduled tasks manually create task
dependencies with links create project
milestones rearrange tasks set tasks as
active or inactive display project
summary in Microsoft Project 2013 in the
next slide we will understand how to add
new tasks in Microsoft Project 2013
entering a task name in the task sheet
or the Gantt chart adds a new task to
the project tasks are added by entering
appropriate task names in the task sheet
available in the Gantt chart view
the components of the task sheet are
highlighted in the given screenshot the
indicators column reveals if the task or
a resource has notes or a hyperlink to
provide additional information the task
mode column indicates if a task is
manually or automatically scheduled the
task name column contains the name of
the task or the resource a task name can
be edited and changed anytime during the
project's lifecycle it is recommended
that the task name communicate the exact
work to be performed and be concise the
duration column indicates the total
working time required for a task when
you enter a new task it is added as a
manual task by default without duration
or a start date project managers can
enter duration in hours days months or
years duration can be specified by
entering the number in this field along
with a duration unit such as H for hours
d for days w for weeks or M o for months
the start and finish columns indicate
the task start and finish dates the
predecessors column indicates the task
that precedes the given task the
resource names column contains the
details of materials or human resources
needed for the task there is an
additional column called add new column
in the task sheet you can add a new
column if required by entering the
details of the tasks or resources in the
column let us understand how to add new
tasks through a demo in the next slide
you
Andrew Murphy is an IT manager working
at nutria Worldwide Inc the firm plans
to develop a software application to
efficiently manage the product
development process Rachel Milton and
Denise Richards are the available
resources Andrew is managing this
project and has already created a few
tasks for the same he wants to add a new
task of fixing bugs under the
development phase using Microsoft
Project 2013 the duration of the task is
one day click the demo icon to see how
Andrew can add new tasks in Microsoft
Project 2013
let us read the steps to add new tasks
in Microsoft Project 2013
we will discuss the difference between
manually scheduled tasks and auto
scheduled tasks in this slide a task can
be scheduled manually or automatically
when you enter a new task it is added as
a manual task by default in the case of
manually scheduled tasks you need to
enter the duration and start date of the
task the finish date is calculated
according to the duration entered
manually scheduled tasks can be used
when a task has specific requirements
with respect to dates you can manually
schedule tasks in order to accomplish
the date specific requirements and later
switch to the auto schedule in the case
of auto scheduled tasks you need to
enter the duration of the task the start
and finish dates are calculated
automatically the start date of the
first task is by default set as the
project start date it is ideal to enter
task duration instead of start or finish
dates to appreciate the auto scheduling
features as the project manager
continues to enter more tasks link them
and assign resources the start and
finish dates in the project plan get
adjusted automatically if the project
manager directly edits the duration
start date or finish date of an
automatically scheduled task the task
will switch to a manual scheduled mode
in the next slide we will learn about
the project outline
while creating a task list the project
manager can create a project outline by
grouping tasks tasks are grouped as
summary tasks and subtasks the
screenshot of software development
project is displayed as an example on
this slide related tasks are grouped
under an appropriate title this title is
called a summary task in Microsoft
Project 2013 summary tasks are easily
recognized as they are in bold a summary
tasks encapsulate s' the details of all
its subtasks a summary task consists of
several subtasks in Microsoft Project
2013 subtasks are indented below the
summary tasks that they belong to the
expand or collapse arrow next to a
summary tasks can be used to expand or
collapse the outline Microsoft Project
2013 automatically generates the project
summary task however it does not display
the project summary task by default in
the next slide we will discuss how to
create task dependencies with links
sometimes the tasks in a project are
dependent on other tasks this dependency
can be projected in Microsoft Project
2013 by linking these tasks Microsoft
Project 2013 supports for relationships
for linking to tasks they are finish to
start start to start finish to finish
start to finish click tabs for more
information on these relationships
Andrew Murphy has created the tasks to
develop a software application
he needs to organize these tasks as
summary tasks and subtasks he also needs
to link the tasks according to their
dependencies using Microsoft Project
2013 click the demo icon to see how to
organize tasks in Microsoft Project 2013
let us read the steps to organize tasks
in Microsoft Project 2013
let us discuss how to create project
milestones in this slide milestones
refer to significant events in a project
which are either reached within the plan
for example completion of one stage of
work or are dependent on the plan for
example deadline to apply for a loan you
can create milestones to highlight the
critical points of a project milestones
indicate the progress of a project
milestones can be recognized in

zero duration the steps to create a
milestone task in Microsoft Project 2013
are shown on the slide

next slide let us understand how to
rearrange tasks
tasks and subtasks can be rearranged in
the project plan using the cut and paste
commands in order to move a task the
project manager needs to select the task
right-click and cut the task cell it can
then be pasted to a new summary task or
moved within the summary task several
tasks can also be shifted at once a
complete summary task along with its
subtasks can also be moved in the same
way when the auto scheduled tasks are
rearranged the start and finish dates
get adjusted accordingly when tasks with
dependencies are rearranged the links
will be lost
unless the dependent tasks are shifted
along with the main tasks let us
understand how to rearrange tasks
through a demo in the following slide
Andrew Murphy has organized the tasks as
summary tasks and subtasks he has also
linked the tasks based on their
dependencies in order to identify the
task order easily Andrew wants to
rearrange the design and coding tasks
depending on their start and finish
dates he is using Microsoft Project 2013

let us read the steps to rearrange tasks
in Microsoft Project 2013
this slide covers the concept of
inactive tasks in Microsoft Project 2013
all the tasks added in Microsoft Project
2013 are entered as active tasks however
in a project there may be tasks that are
on hold or are not a part of active
tasks these tasks can be set as inactive
tasks in the project plan
note that the tasks in activation
feature is available only in Microsoft
Project professional inactivated tasks
do not affect resource availability
project schedule or the scheduling of
other tasks in activation may not be a
recommended way to archive the completed
tasks because it may have unexpected
effects on the remaining schedule
instead you can mark the tasks as
completed click here to see the steps to
inactivate a task
the Timeline view in Microsoft Project
2013 allows a project manager to view
all project related information at a
glance this view includes all the tasks
and milestones in a project and also
includes a task summary click the View
tab and select the timeline checkbox to
activate the Timeline view in Microsoft
Project 2013 in the next slide we will
learn about the project summary
a project summary summarizes the
timeline of the entire project the
project summary is automatically created
by Microsoft Project 2013 however it is
hidden by default click the format tab
and select project summary task to
display the project summary
in this slide we will summarize the
topics covered in this lesson tasks are
added by entering an appropriate task
name in the task sheet available in the
Gantt chart view a project is outlined
as summary tasks and subtasks tasks can
be scheduled either manually or
automatically milestones in a project
are used to highlight critical points of
the project cut and paste tools are used
to rearrange tasks tasks that are unhold
or are not a part of active tasks can be
set as inactive tasks the project
summary summarizes the timeline of the
entire project
in the next lesson we will learn about
project resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
