here with you I have been an exam prep
coach and project management trainer for
many years were pushing 1213 years now
and over the years I've conducted
something like 250 trainings the
training sessions have been on the ASM
like this one the PMP pmi-acp PMI RMP
I've had over 5000 folks come through my
trainings over the years I've got a pass
rate that's about 99 percent so those
are the certifications that I have of
course the one that you're concerned
with is that one right there am I
qualified to do this
maybe I am with that kind of a pass
raped and I've been doing this course
for a while I actually love this course
this is a great course I have been doing
project management for many years and
I've had project management experience
in the business sector the public sector
and as an entrepreneur for example I was
a project manager at compact in HP vice
president of business development at a
company called legal net executive
director the California Commission on
the bicentennial celebration of the
United States Constitution California
director of the national center for
constitutional studies you know it's
interesting is that even though sound
rather varied all of them had some kind
of content development and presenting
responsibilities with them so I've been
at this kind of stuff for 35 years plus
you know what's interesting is when it
comes to a workshop like this where
we're seeking a certification I don't
know if you know this or not but there
are studies that are done every year by
various organizations that compare what
certified project managers make compared
to what their uncertified colleagues
make and depending on the year it ranges
between 15
and 20% more if you're certified now
that may not be your driving factor to
be here and participate in this but to
make more money is a good thing and I
just did a calculation that you know of
all those that have gone through my
workshops and considering that average
increase in income I figure that they
collectively make sixty million dollars
more more per year now than they did
before and I've been with simply learned
now doing classes for them in these
various topics for over three years and
simply learn which you may or may not
know is the largest training
organization in the world and was
recently recognized as one of the top 10
most influential or education
organizations in the world so you are in
the right spot if you want to get
certified and get ahead in this or in
other areas simply learn is the place to
be and we have been around now for about
six years our journey started relatively
small and you can see that from those
more humble beginnings we now have
basically a presence throughout the
world and we offer training and
certification prep classes for all of
these organizations here of these
organizations this is the one that we
are focusing on for this workshop eggs
in and the ASM certification and we have
certification courses in all of these
different categories right here of
course with these categories the one
that is relevant for us right now is
agile scrum certifications but there are
others and you know kind of when we get
into a mode of the study and the prep
and they're getting ready for a
standardized test sometimes it's a good
time to take on more than just one thing
and somebody has simply learned came up
with this brilliant idea of what they
called an all-access online classroom
pass where if you upgrade
your tuition you can have access to over
25 of our certification exam prep
courses 120 instructor-led batches
meaning live batches like this for 90
days and so you can fast track your
career at your place your pace all
you're kind of in the mode of doing this
and so the way it works is you pick
which of the certifications that you
want like you're doing for this you can
choose whether you want to do a weekend
batch or a week day batch if you do a
weekday batch it's going to be a
three-hour session
Monday through Friday and if you do a
weekend batch like this one it'll be for
our sessions on Saturday Sunday Saturday
Sunday etc so and then not only do you
get access to the 120 instructor-led
batches but you have access to the
e-learning content for six months now if
you're not happy we'll give you your
money back and it's just you know a way
to you know kind of leverage your mode
that you're in and I have a number of
individuals that have been in other
classes that we're doing two or three at
the same time so I'm not sure if that's
relevant to you or not but that is an
option and as soon as this is displayed
on my desktop I can share it which I
just did so you can see that this is the
course overview and when you're finished
with this course you should be able to I
know it says right here after completing
this lesson but really what we're
talking about is the course here you
should be able to play the the role of
an effective scrum master you should be
able to lead agile and scrum
transformations meaning going from
waterfall to scrum or from waterfall to
some other methods in agile be able to
guide your team's using the proven and
recommended practices of scrum describe
practices of other edge
methods and adapt those that are
beneficial for your teams that are
relevant for your project and then you
should be able to also talk about scrum
in the context of DevOps as well as
linking scrum to IT Service Management
so that's and then of course be ready to
pass the exam so you know scrum so let
me back up we've talked about
traditional project management versus
agile project management and different
kinds of projects lend themselves to
being best managed by either waterfall
or by agile and waterfall is the
traditional make a big plan upfront get
your baselines established make sure you
know you understand the requirements and
then go get the work done when you're
finished you know presented to the
customer and do the handoff and so while
you're executing on a waterfall project
you're looking at your actual results
comparing them to your baselines and
that's how you do it agile which is
really a family of methods is a
different approach it's an evolutionary
incremental approach that fits well with
projects where there's a lot of
uncertainty about the scope so the
solution to deliver the scope will
reveal itself or be discovered in an
evolutionary way as the project goes
forward and rather than completing the
project overall and then showcasing it
for the customer like in waterfall or
waterfall you can suck it up and chunk
it up into big phases and deliver it
that way agile is different we do very
small increments and at the end of the
increment we're delivering value to the
customer
and in the and we discover how to
actually get to the solution that the
customer wants
so Waterfall you've got a stables
scope and you don't expect a lot of
change great in agile there's
uncertainty and it's relatively complex
and of all of the agile methods scrum is
the most popular of them about 50% of
all agile projects use from and then the
next most popular one is extreme
programming and that's about 30% so 80%
of all agile projects are going to be
using either scrum or XP and even though
there's a lot of folks that don't like
the idea of doing hybrid projects those
that practice scrum actually end up
using a lot of XP practices as well so
the bottom line is is that when it comes
to agile scrum is the most used most
proven and it delivers it actually works
and it works well so our focus for this
course is going to be broadly on agile
and I'll even take you through a little
bit about XP and a couple other methods
that belong to the family of agile but
we're going to drill down on scrum and
so when we talk about project life
cycles it will be how to do a project
using scrum and there are a number of
roles for a scrum project we're going to
cover all of them but we're going to
spend most of our time on scrum master
which is one of the roles and then we're
going to talk about how to scale agile
agile was originally designed for small
projects with small co-located teams but
as things have changed over the years
agile can be adapted to very large
enterprise size
projects and so one of our lessons is
dedicated to that and then also we're
going to dedicate one whole lesson to
doing a transition from waterfall to
scrub so this certification is unique in
that regard
there are certifications like certified
scrum master
that's not offered by Exynos offered by
I think it's the scrum Alliance and
there's value to that but it's one that
doesn't require training you won't be
able to sit for the ASM exam until you
finish this training with the CSM it's
kind of an open book thing a little bit
more of you know you go do some training
and the test is proctored right there
and there's value in that I'm not saying
there isn't but the the scrum master
certified scrum master training and
certification doesn't get in to
transition like this does there's also
another agile certification and this
one's offered by PMI so the pmi-acp and
that certification gets much deeper into
the family of agile and so that course
will cover oh I think it's like eight or
nine different agile methods most of the
emphasis will be on scrum because of its
popularity but the course itself is
boards generic about agile and there's
value in that but the HCP doesn't get
into the scaling and agile like this one
so you know if you wanted to go get
another agile certification and this is
me but the one I'd recommend is the
pmi-acp so you know I kind of back to my
career coaching thing get your ASM and
then if you want to continue go get your
PMP probably or prince2 depending on
your environment and where you think
you'll be and then go get your pmi-acp
once you have that you are going to be
well equipped to run projects and you'll
be very desirable to employers out there
not that you're not now but you know
they'd like to see those you know those
letters after your name and then also in
that mix is DevOps and integrating into
IT Service Management so maybe you know
some DevOps and some IT o work would
also serve you well and you know I'm not
one that particularly thinks
standardized testing is that great of a
way to measure someone's knowledge and
predictable potential in the real world
I'm just not I've seen people who just
really have a hard time passing a
standardized test who just crush it in
the real world and kind of I server
sighted people who really get taking
tests and then you know put them in the
real world and they just don't do so
well but that said there's no better way
to really present yourself to the world
as to what your skill sets and
experiences so well standardized testing
may not be the best predictor it is the
best way to demonstrate your pedigree
you know your history and what you bring
to the table so it's important and
learning how to pass the test and get it
done and have those initials that you
can put after your name at the bottom of
your emails and on your business cards
etc you know like I was showing you
earlier probably means fifteen two
percent twenty percent more money plus
if that's it fast tracks your career so
this course here down down to this
bottom box here this course here is
going to accomplish two main things in
summary it's going to train you give you
lots of knowledge and it's also going to
prepare you for the ASM certification
the target audience I think we pretty
well saw that when we were introducing
each other each of us to ourselves
commented on that you can see that you
know those of us that are here in this
group the perfect target audience and we
were all in kind of different places but
yet all relevant for this so you're at
the right spot now when it comes to
prerequisites there are none for this
although if you want to sit for the
exams training is mandatory eggs in will
not let you sit for the ASM course
unless you have training this course
meets those training requirements so at
the end of this course you'll get a
certification asserted as a certificate
and what eggs in has you do is actually
upload that certificate to demonstrate
you have the training and then you'll
have access to excuse me
taking the course you know yawning
they're by the way team I didn't really
tell you where I am did I I am in Utah
in the United States I am in the Salt
Lake area of about 30 miles south of
Salt Lake and I had a late night my
niece was moving and so family got
together to help move and we weren't
done until late I didn't even get home
till about midnight and and so right now
for me it's 913 in the morning so I had
to get up earlier than I wanted but I'm
glad I did I'm glad that I know you glad
that were acquainted and I love the
subject matter and I love assisting
folks in you know learning this material
and advancing in their careers
absolutely love it so I may not be good
at a lot of things but I got a lot of
experience here and
you know nothing better than seeing
folks like you go through one of the
courses that I have a hand in and having
success as a result of that now the
value of this course goes beyond just
getting your initials and I think we've
probably talked about most of this here
we're going to talk about you know
looking at the top left here good
practices in agile generally and scrum
specifically how to actually implement
things that you learn get a lot of
knowledge about scrum and if you already
have some deepen that knowledge
give you some guidance on how to deal
with transformation projects you know
well specifically I got a one slide
about criticism that you can get when
you're doing a transformation and have a
whole slide and discussion about
resistance and how to overcome it then
of course we're going to learn new
things and we're going to drive value
not just from you know getting your
certificate but also from the point of
view of value for your organization
value for you value going forward the
course syllabus looks like this lesson
one is what we call the agile way of
thinking so it's what's agile we're
going to get into some agile principles
we're going to cover what's called the
agile manifesto and we're going to kind
of tease you a bit on continuous
improvement specifically when it comes
to an agile transformation efforts
lesson two is about other agile
frameworks so we will touch on waterfall
again as an approach and then we'll talk
about some other methods that belong to
the family of agile will touch on XP and
lean and crystal and dsdm a turn not
that you're going to be tested on those
but it will help you as a
I'm master to recognize that there's
this family from which you can draw some
information experience that will
actually enhance your ability to be a
good scrum master this is the lesson
where we're going to deal with DevOps
and you know linking scrum projects with
operations so that there's things that
are done in parallel rather than doing
some you know development work and then
doing a handoff doing some more
development work and then doing a
handoff have some things going in
parallel is a big thing right now as
organizations are trying to improve
efficiencies and be more responsive to
dynamic market places so we've got a
couple of slides on that that you'll
find interesting and then similarly
linking agile with IT Service Management
and doing some things in parallel there
as well is helpful and understanding
that is becoming more and more important
as the marketplace for projects and
folks like us increases now when we get
to lesson 3 this is where we start
diving deeper into scrum so we're going
to talk about a scrum project lifecycle
we're going to talk about the concept of
time boxing and what ceremonies and
events in scrum are time box we're going
to actually also talk about individually
the ceremonies that are part of scrum
one of us in the introduction talked
about retros and that was short for
retrospective and we're going to talk
about retrospective and when we're
finished you're going to realize that
retrospectives are critical to scrum and
that they are the single most important
thing
that you will do in scrum to make sure
that you are experiencing effective
continuous improvement and we'll also
talk about scrum artifacts things like
you know product backlog release backlog
sprint backlogs we'll talk about the
definition of done we'll talk about some
information radiators and you know
things like that
Lesson four is about the roles that
belong to scrum so we're going to talk
first about the scrum master but then
we're going to touch on the product
owner and developer and then we'll get
into some of the best practices of being
an effective scrum master lesson number
five has to do with sort of doing scrum
and so we'll talk about you know user
stories and epics and we'll talk about
product roadmaps and how we do
estimating both using point and ideal
time we'll talk about planning poker and
affinity estimating as common estimation
techniques and we'll get into
communicating the status and progress of
a project this is what will again touch
on some information radiators like burn
down charts burn up charts etc and then
how that allows us to stay in control if
you will of the project make sure we're
headed in the direction we want to go
lesson six is the one that I talked
about that has to do with scaling agile
and then the last one lesson seven which
is about adopting agile the the you know
transition projects the the test itself
has you know domains that you're tested
on and you might have picked up on this
the scaling of agile and the
transformation projects you know
transitions I like those a lot I
actually when I took the real exam I got
a hundred percent on the
areas on the exam there were a couple of
areas that I didn't do great I did good
enas and and that might be how it is for
you you know we all have different
strengths and weaknesses you saw that we
have varying levels of experience and
you know areas of experience and so
there'll be you know parts of this whole
experience that are your golden on and
then we'll the others where you know it
is a little bit more of a learning
process so and I'm no different as I
just mentioned so when it comes to the
exam itself you know when we created
this slide here we put a hundred and
twenty hours of study is recommended and
we are trying to set the bar high for
that and now we recognize that if you
have experience you're probably not
going to need that much but you know
what also we're discovering is that if
you will stick with the materials that
we have and I got some guidance for you
and you know how to use the materials
you know after we're finished with this
and this isn't a super long training
course we're going to have four sessions
four hours each right sixteen hours now
we're going to cram a lot of stuff in
there but you know it's interesting is
it turns out that we have just really
done a great job on what we cover and
this along with those standard or
practice tests rather there's a pretty
darn good chance that you're not going
to lead need to do a whole lot of other
study I will have you do some things
between sessions and you know it's not
just being here for the four hours so
it's definitely more than that but if
you're willing to do it and if you're
willing to embrace my guidance I'm going
to get you there much faster than if you
were to do the more traditional study a
ton of stuff make sure you can lead with
knowledge
we're going to kind of focus on the exam
part of this as you know leaving with
strategy and not with knowledge the test
itself Oh case studies I should mention
this there he is
something that I need you to download
and I think I already put it in the LMS
and it's the assignment can I do that
let me just double check yeah it's this
right here team I don't know if you can
see my cursor or not it's the one that
says assignment scrum project now
there's nothing to turn in on this but
at the end of each session I want you to
return to this assignment paper and we
have some questions that build on the
lessons that we have just been using the
same scenarios for the project here so
this is a part of the course and you'll
need to you know promise that you've
actually done this in order to get your
certification nothing for you to turn in
on that though but you do to have that
homework assignment so the test itself
as I've mentioning earlier it's 90
minutes and I think I said a hydrogen 80
excess use so it's an hour-and-a-half 90
minutes probably some of your life just
in an hour and a half an inch saying 180
minutes okay so there you go I'm awesome
at math there are 40 multiple choice
questions like the samples that you saw
a B C or D and you know when I first
embarked on getting my asam and I
thought you know a 40 question exam I
thought easy peasy you know this isn't
going to be a robust certificate
certification and then I got into the
prep work and and then I got into the
practice exams and I thought oh I get
this ASM is an awesome credential to
have and there might only be 40
questions
but they're not easy unless you've been
through the workshop and you know except
that some of my guidance on how to
approach a standardized set then you'll
be golden let's see something over here
do all the lessons and concepts have
equal weights in the test or are some
concepts more important it's all equally
weighted and your results are in the
aggregate it's not for each of the
domains so while everything's weighted
equally you can do really good in an
area like I did which will help make up
for some areas where you're not quite as
strong good question and I like that
question came because you're thinking
about the exam right and getting it done
so your heads in the right spot
now here's also what's interesting is
you only need 65% to pass meaning you
got to get 26 out of the 40 questions
and Enslow I get that it seems well but
you know after you've gone through this
workshop and you've taken the exam
you'll be like me to think wow they
really did a great job of crafting this
exam and making that credential
something of relevance in the
marketplace so that's about the course
if you're new to eggs in what you may
want to do is just at some point in time
just go to eggs in comm and poke around
see what kind of certifications they
have there and then eventually drill
down to the ASM one sorry about that
you're paying the price for me trying to
be a blessing for my niece and her
family it's all good right win-win okay
and I noticed the the confirmation there
Viraj that we got your question answered
okay so that takes us to the end of
lesson one so what we're going to do now
is we're going to shift gears and we're
going to go to lesson number three so
this lesson is about scrum events and
artifacts scrum events are also called
ceremonies by the way and at the end of
this lesson you should be able to list
the values of scrum explain the life
cycle of a scrum project from backlog to
working system conduct the scrum event
sprint planning sprint review sprint
retrospective and daily scrum
participate in the creation and
interpretation of scrum artifacts like
product backlog sprint backlog finish
deliverables and the definition of done
let's see somebody oh there was a
question here that was chatted oh can
you please come again with the strategy
of going through the last first fall
selecting an answer I can do that and
that's actually one of the documents
that you can download and simply talk
and this is it right here so question
strategies five of them read the last
sentence first then the whole question
if necessary read all four answers
throughout the eat the ones that you can
throw out and then select the best from
those that are remaining that's the
strategic approach on the questions let
me minimize that and now let's talk
about the values of scrum now this is
different than pillars this is values so
there are five values for that and this
is something that I want you to memorize
I'm going to switch my cameras here and
go to the whiteboard
and we're going to add to our list Oh
Ron color you can tell I'm a project
manager because that would bother me so
the five values of scrum and there's an
acronym you can see that on the screen
right cforce okay so five values of
scrum and she f o r C and you kind of
know my style here you don't have to do
it this way you know whatever works for
you but have some kind of a strategy for
memorizing things it will probably serve
you well so the the first C is
commitment the next one there are four
4s is focus o is openness that two ends
or one I don't know openness will blame
it on the marker if it's not right
r is for respect and the last C is
courage and so there's your little chart
right there and let me just briefly go
over these none of these will be a big
surprise here we've talked about some of
them already in one context or another
so the four commitment that means the
commits the team is going to commit to
deliver value to the customer
they're on board there's the buy-in all
of that's their focus the team is going
to focus on a few important things at a
time so we're going to do time boxing
we're not going to do things Bradley
specifically focus on a few things at a
time
oh it's openness that's analogous to the
tea transparency and the pillars meaning
we're going to be completely open in
sharing information about the project
our own opinions our fears our concerns
etc our stands for respect and that's
kind of a 360 of view we respect
ourselves we respect others we respect
the concepts that we are using as part
of scrum and and you know and we respect
the other stakeholders as well 360 and
the lassi stands for courage and that's
the courage to make commitments even
when we're in an uncertain environment
courage to deal with fear that comes
from a failure courage to share
disagreements openly yet respectfully
courage to participate in debating
technical approaches etc okay so now
let's go to the scrum lifecycle chart
and what I want to do is I want to
elaborate on this just a little bit and
I'm going to try and use my mouse to do
some some additions to this first of all
we have the product backlog the product
backlog has to be kept current and we
call that grooming grooming is adding
user stories and removing user stories
from the product backlog product backlog
is the scope of the project the product
owner owns that the team assists in that
effort
grooming is pruning pruning the backlog
is prioritizing and reprioritizing so
the product backlog is pruned and
groomed regularly throughout the course
of the project now there is a meeting
that takes place right here which is
called the sprint planning meeting can I
just do P SP here sprint planning
meeting okay that is one of the
ceremonies or events that takes place in
scrum in the the sprint planning meeting
it is a time boxed event and it is time
boxed to two hours for each week of the
sprint so in our example here we have a
30-day sprint so if we have a four-week
sprint then our sprint planning meeting
will be eight hours in duration and two
things happen during the sprint planning
meeting the user stories that are going
to be included in the sprint are
selected right there put into the sprint
backlog which is a subset of the product
backlog containing the user stories that
are going to be completed during the
sprint and the second thing that happens
during the sprint planning meeting is
the selected user stories are then
disaggregated into tasks and estimated
once that's done then the work of the
Sprint begins there will be a daily
scrum like we did at the beginning of
our workday together as our team and
then at the end of the work of the
sprint there will be the Sprint review
the Sprint review meeting or ceremony is
also time boxed and it is time box - one
hour for each week of the sprint so for
doing a four-week sprint the Sprint
review meeting
be four hours in length the primary
purpose of the review is to showcase and
demo the software and get feedback from
relevant stakeholders and allow the
product owner to say I accept or I
reject the work that has been done then
after that is the Sprint retrospective
now this is where the team asks and
answers three questions what went well
what did not go well and what are we
going to do different going forward
regarding the previous sprint that was
just completed and the ones that is is
just coming up and then the Sprint
itself will result in working software
or value for the customer and then of
course everything goes back and repeats
for as many Sprint's as necessary to
complete the scope of the project let's
see I see a chat here how similar or
different is the product backlog to SRS
software requirement specs document
which is widely used in projects um it's
different and if you will hang on to
that question we're going to have a
discussion later on about user stories
and that will help you understand the
differences and we'll get into the user
stories that come from the customer and
user stories that come from the text
domain and that will help answer your
question so you can hang on to that okay
great thanks okay so a little bit more
detailed view of the scrum project
lifecycle now let's talk about a couple
other things here when it comes to a
sprint there are some things that affect
the duration of the sprint so the team
is going to have to decide how long each
of the Sprint's are going to be and
things that are a factor in
include the stability of the product
backlog if the product backlog is
changing a great deal then that's going
to argue for shorter durations because
there's a high level of uncertainty and
so you have a greater amount of control
on your project if you have shorter
Sprint's now on the other hand another
factor is the cost of iterating every
time we do a sprint there are costs
associated with the sprint planning
meeting the Sprint review the Sprint
retrospective right people shop through
those meetings you gotta pay them and
excuse me so there if there is an
overhead cost to actually doing sprints
the goal of the sprint is working
software at the end the end product
should be near releasable or potentially
shippable now there might be working
software that the product owner isn't
going to want to release maybe because
it as a standalone component of working
software for the system doesn't create
any value or any usability for end-users
and maybe you wait till the end of a
release before you release everything
but the idea is is this working software
and it could be released if the customer
wanted to do that sorry I just dropped
something I see a question there I will
circle back to your question in just a
sec the Sprint duration and deliverables
do not change once the team has
committed this is another one of those
things that has to be viewed as absolute
when we're doing scrum so if we say that
we're going to do a two-week sprint and
we select five user stories based on our
velocity or capacity once that decision
has been made the duration of the sprint
does not change
and we do not add or remove any user
stories now it could be possible for the
product owner to cancel a sprint but
that would be extreme that would be
because there is such a major change to
the product backlog that the work of the
current sprint is going to be completely
irrelevant you don't change the Sprint
you cancel the Sprint and then the
bottom one here the Sprint begins with
planning and ends with review and a
retrospective and there was a question
here are there any issues with combining
the retrospective and the planning
ceremonies and the answer to that is yes
now could they be combined depending on
the environment the answer is yes and
the way we would arrive at whether or
not it would make sense is who's going
to be participating but they would be
separate agendas so the agenda for the
retrospective is what went well what did
not go well what are we going to do
different and the mandatory participants
for that meeting are the the team the
scrum team is the scrum master going to
be there likely as a facilitator is the
product owner going to be there maybe
maybe not if the product owner is there
you know the product owner could maybe
answer questions and help clarify but
the product owner does not weigh in on
what went well but do not go well and
what are we going to do differently that
is all owned by the team in the planning
meeting the product owner has to be
there and the product owner is the main
driver of that meeting the product owner
is talking about or dealing with the
priority of the user stories the team's
weighing in maybe there's some
dependencies that need to be considered
but the product owner has to make the
hard decisions with regards to what's
going to be done in the next sprint
based on the constraints from the team
like velocity and technology and
sequencing and things like that so I
kind of answered that from a real-world
point of view yes it could be it's not
desirable
the test they are completely separate
that get you there I keep my eye on the
chat box make sure I got that answered
well enough for you and let's move ahead
okay the sprint planning meeting this is
looking right down here this is
conducted at the beginning of a new
sprint it's attended by the team the
product owner and the scrum master and
there are two approaches to deciding
what's going to be included in the
sprint it can be based on commitment and
it can also be based on velocity and the
goal here is to get team buy-in make
sure that there is clarity between the
team and the product owner as to what
the definition of done looks like for
the user stories that are going to be
included in the sprint and of course it
should be realistic and achievable and
you know there can be a little bit of an
issue where you've got you know a
well-meaning product owner that's
driving really hard and the team says
you know we can do these sprints and the
product is honor thing no come on you
got to do at least one more I got to
have this one in this sprint you can get
a question like that and it might be
what would the scrum master do if you
had a dominant product owner that's
trying to persuade the team to do more
than the team thinks it can do and
that's where the scrum master comes in
the scrum master plays the role of the
mentor the coach and you know assisting
in the resolution of those kinds of
issues without the citing the scrum
master is not at the fighter the team
decides when it comes to how and the
product owner decides when it comes to
what okay
the scrum meeting daily scrum we've
talked about it right the entire team
attends the meeting could the product
owner be there yes does the product
owner need to be there no sometimes the
product owner can be
you know an impediment to the meeting
but would be welcome but if the product
owner started asking questions or became
the focus of questions being asked the
scrum master would have to help
facilitate a change because that would
not be effective for the daily scrum
duration 15 minutes we talked about that
and the agenda what did i do yesterday
what am I going to today and what are my
impediments the Sprint review now who
attends it's going to be the team the
product owner the scrum master and
potentially others so optionally others
you know that we would want to get
feedback from would be end-users
operations folks pursuits all of those
would be welcome depending on the
relevance of the software that's being
demoed and being subject to the
acceptance testing and the product owner
you know giving the thumbs up or the
thumbs down when it comes to acceptance
the duration for this we mentioned this
before it's not just a flat two hours
it's one hour per week so if you did a
four-week sprint you would plan on the
review being a maximum of four hours in
duration the agenda is to demo the
completed software get feedback and then
see where we are when it comes to the
the release plan the retrospective who
is there it's attended by the team and I
would modify this slightly and I would
say this is the the mandatory group that
needs to be there optionally the scrum
master would be there potentially you
could have an external facilitator the
role of the scrum master would be the
facilitator now a good scrum master
being a facilitator in a retrospective
would have some knowledge of control
charts the five why's Ishikawa diagrams
things like that
and although the scrum master would not
be participating in the acts
use of the tools the scrum master would
be facilitating the effective use of
those tools when it comes to duration
the rule is 45 minutes for each week ooh
that was a good four that was kind of a
lousy five so if you had a two week
sprint then you would have an hour and a
half retrospective max and what's the
purpose there is the agenda for the
retrospective three questions what
worked well would to not go well what
are we going to do different and it's
not just a chat session well that would
be part of it you will use tools and
techniques like some that I mentioned
control charts Ishikawa diagrams five
why's there's a number of things that
you might use in order to surface
assignable causes for issues so that we
could then come up with the resolution
to those this is where continuous
improvement is going to happen you know
continuous improvements the result of
other things but this is the main thing
and if Yuri get a question about the
relevance or the necessity of
retrospectives there is no equivocation
you do a retrospective after every
sprint if you don't do a retro so if you
don't then there's no improvement you
know things just stay static okay
so we talked about the four main
ceremonies right in a scrum project
sprint planning you with me daily stand
up the Sprint review
and then the Sprint retrospective all
considered mandatory for effectively
doing scrum and not doing them or one of
them would be considered a fail okay
artifacts that we use when it comes to
scrum we've talked about the product
backlog we talked about the Sprint
backlog there's also a release backlog
depending on the size of the project it
might be advisable to group user stories
into releases if you have a product
roadmap your releases would line up for
that for example I've got a real life
project that I'm working on and my
product roadmap is got three versions
it's a website the first version is free
the second version includes a membership
component and the third version includes
a referral Commission portion to it and
so I will then do three releases I'll
have all the user stories that will
result in version 1 all over the user
stories that really result in version 2
so that's what the release backlog is
and so if you look at it in sequence the
product backlog is the overall scope of
the project the release backlog is a
subset of the product backlog and then
the Sprint backlog would be a subset of
the release backlog the product backlog
might look something like this
it's a list of user stories that are
written by the product owner and are
going to be developed by the team
members and didn't we have we had a
product backlog for the thing that we
did this morning right so here's another
example of a product backlog this is
more of a lid
it just has the title there would be a
user story card for each of the items in
the product backlog but the idea would
be it would be prioritized there could
be user stories that are added or
removed depending on what the product
owner wants product owner owns the
product backlog that's a given
does the product owner create all the
user stories for the product backlog in
isolation
no absolutely not because there are
technical considerations that the
product back there the product owner
might not even consider the product
owners perspective is more the customer
side the end user side and so the
product owner might not even think of
things like security or architecture
related things and there might even be
user stories that come from the
technical domain that need to be
developed before some of the products
owners user stories another artifact is
the definition of done the definition of
done is primarily a checklist and this
is what forms the agreement between the
product owner and the team as to when we
consider something completely done and
if we look down here if I where's my I'm
looking for my cursor it says here it's
usually prepared by the scrum master and
consultation with the team that is I
would modify this slightly on the
definition of done is really driven by
the team that you see the scrum master
is never a decision maker if you have a
scrum master that's saying we have to
have this in the definition of done then
that's an infringement on the
empowerment of the team I agree that the
scrum master is a part of the effort to
develop the def
initiative done but I would kind of flip
that the scrum masters the facilitator
it's the team that still owns that so
now is the product owner involved in
this absolutely because the product
owner is involved in defining the story
and what a fully implemented story looks
like so here's a list a short list of
what a definition of done could look
like the story has been fully
implemented or the code completed as
described automated unit tests have been
developed with at least 80% code
coverage it could be more than that this
is just an example automated unit tests
and acceptance tests for the story are
passing no severity has one or two
defects and then high-priority test
cases have been automated and added to
the regression suite the definition have
done we point out is likely to evolve as
the team's maturity increases as the
project advances so what did we talk
about we talked about the five values of
scrub we talked about the four
ceremonies or timebox events that belong
in a scrum project we talked about the
sprint planning meeting we talked about
the daily scrum we talked about the
sprint review and we talked about the
Sprint retrospective and then we talked
about artifacts the primary artifacts we
talked about the four of them the
product backlog the release backlog the
sprint backlog and the definition of
done so pretty good right keen so what
we're going to do now is we're going to
take our quiz on lesson number three
uh-oh question here is there going to be
a definition I've done at the release
level yes there should be a definition
of done at the release level absolute
and depending on the nature of the
project the team and the product owner
may decide to do a definition have done
for a sprint as well but clearly for
each user story right and clearly for
each release potentially for a sprint
okay so will you double-check and change
your chatbox send to option to me
privately and let's go ahead and do our
quiz question number one how should the
team respond to this last sentence first
right and then after the start of a
sprint
the product owner wants to add one more
story to the Sprint backlog how should
the team respond to this okay seeing
some good comments here
okay let's see how many looks like most
of us have responded so this is testing
us on our understanding of time boxing
in general and how we do sprints so
first of all I remind you that once a
sprint has been decided on right once
the planning meeting is over you never
add or remove anything from the sprint
backlog and number two when it comes to
Thai boxing you never extend the
duration of the time box so with that
reminder now granted that's some
knowledge right but that's critical
knowledge for being a good scrum master
and passing the exam so if we look at
answer a included in the backlog and
extend the sprint right that's a
violation of both of those two things be
included in the in the backlog only if
the PIO the product owner removes
another item of equal size and can't do
that right because that's adding and
removing both she asked the product
owner to wait until the next sprint
that's possibility hang on to that one d
add as a stretch goal but make no
commitment nope you cannot add so there
you go the answer is C now there was if
there was a question about an example on
cancelling a sprint I will do that after
we're finished with the quiz and I think
it's already not displaying anymore so
if I forget just reminding me again
whoever it was that answered that
question and I'll give you an example
that might help you understand that
better okay so for this question the
answer has got to be
in my opinion makes sense there it is
okay question number two which of the
following is a scenario where the
product owner should consider canceling
the Sprint well maybe we'll take care of
that question right now okay so looking
at our choices here we are kind of all
over the place on this one so that means
I didn't do a great job in explaining
the cancellation part so you have my
apologies and we're going to remedy that
right now
now remember we never add or remove
items from a sprint nor do we ever
extend the duration of a sprint we're
good on that right so that doesn't
change when we consider this question
right here so let me give you an example
let's say that the product owner created
a product backlog to do a accounts
receivable and accounts payable system
and we're into the project and the
product owner says you know what what I
really need us to do is to come up with
a RM system a customer relationship
management system so the accounts
receivable part is relevant we need to
know who our customers are and we're
going to need to track the revenue and
things like that that's all needs to be
part of our CRM but I don't need
accounts payable anymore and so if that
would be what we would call a mid-course
correction a mid-course change now if
the team were in a sprint working on
user stories that have to do with the
Accounts Payable system once the product
owner made the decision to make go in a
different direction the work of that
sprint that has to do with the AP system
is now irrelevant and
so that would then be a case where the
whole sprint itself would be canceled
because the work being done in the
sprint is no longer going to be part of
the project so major change now that
probably helps gets us to the correct
answer right a the product owner wants
to add a high priority item to the
sprint backlog no we don't cancel it for
that reason what we would say to the
product owner is you know we're in the
middle of a sprint right now I mean
Sprint's are short right
you tell the product owner hang onto it
will you know we'll be pruning and
grooming the product backlog that can be
the top priority for the next sprint be
the product owner felt that one of the
sprint backlog items was no longer
needed
okay now the team may then not do that
user story but you're not adding or
removing you're not replacing it with
something else and then see the team
reporter that they were way behind
schedule in the sprint not that that
would ever happen right but that's not a
reason to cancel the Sprint boy that's a
reason to have a good retrospective and
say why is it that we're so far behind
you know there could be a lot of reasons
but one of the reasons might be you know
the team really screwed up when it came
to sizing the user stories and you would
not want to cancel the sprint because it
would rob the team of a lot of
information about why that sprint was
failing or a portion of it it was
failing so then we get the G the Sprint
backlog was rendered useless due to a
major change so that's the answer right
and that after we kind of reinforced the
the knowledge on that that makes sense
now there was a question here that I
think is relevant for this oh there was
a question posed what if the product
owner is adamant that a user story be
added to a sprint and is not willing to
wait
ah okay that's where a good scrum master
becomes invaluable to an organization
and the scrum master would of necessity
have to talk with the product owner and
do some coaching and mentoring and say
you know this isn't the way it works and
you know you're talking about one user
story but remember you've got a whole
product backlog of user stories and if
we start abandoning the practices that
work you know the practices that will
deliver the value you want you know
it'll be it'll be messed up and so we
got to stick with it now if the product
owner has a really high priority item in
a sprint planning meeting there may be
some discussion and some give-and-take
and you know some you know a way to
figure out a way to maybe you know meet
a deadline that the product owner has
maybe by you know doing part of it or
something but other than that the
product owner does not get the dictate
to the team how it's going to do its
work and doing so derails the scrum
process and Rob's the project of the
effectiveness of using scrum to run the
project okay so back to this question
here gives the right answer there it is
okay so question number three what
should be done about the remaining two
stories a team completed eight out of
ten stories planned in a sprint what
should be done about the remaining two
stories
okay so let's just chat about this and
my compliments to you as a team
everybody was throwing out B and D as
near as I could tell and I saw catch
like the sprint is time box so it
couldn't be so you can't extend it let's
see there's some chats about D I would
throw out B and D definitely not be
indeed C no intermediate sprint should
be done yeah
comments like that so and there's a lot
there's probably some that have already
scrolled off at the top here so B and B
are out right so then it's down to a or
C and I saw a couple chat said it's kind
of a tie between a and C so for some of
us it became a 50/50 now I had one chat
that said probably he because if there
were only ten users stories in the
product backlog and there's just two
left over there's no point to
reprioritize I can't remember who
chatted that but notice that the
question is about a sprint and it's not
referring to the product backlog it's
eight out of ten user stories for the
sprint there could be a hundred user
stories in the product backlog yet so
that's probably just the case of reading
a little bit too fast and that's one of
the dangers right we mentioned that
earlier today I think you know there's
the pressure to go fast but then there's
the risk going too fast so the idea here
would be that oh and somebody chatted
this the product owner chooses what goes
into the sprints not the team
so therefore the item should we move
back to the product backlog and then be
candidates for the next sprint based on
what the product owner wants to do and
that's probably the best chat that I saw
as far as the logic to going with a / C
so I believe then that a is a superior
answer to see it might end up being that
she happens but it wouldn't be what is
automatically done
here's another chat so before moving to
the next print the product backlog
should be pruned and therefore it should
be a yes that is exactly right the
product backlog is continually pruned
and groomed and it's definitely pruned
and groomed when we're doing the review
and we're doing the planning it can be
pruned in groom at other times as well
but definitely that's part of the agenda
for those two meetings okay so therefore
I believe the best answer is a and there
it is okay question number four who
should determine the duration of a
sprint in scrum some brilliant catch
here this is great yeah Bianca
excellent okay so let's chat about this
just briefly and let me see if I can use
your chat to actually do this instead of
me here here's a chat a scrum master is
never the decision maker oh that's a
true statement that would suggest we got
to throw out be right
let's see what other tests do we have
here team has to decide upon the the on
how the the work is done another chat
product honor deals with the watch the
team deals with the house
so therefore the product owner gets
eliminated and as well the scrum master
let's see the team is an empowered team
it has to make the decisions yes King
there was a chat here it says maybe the
scrum master after collecting inputs
from the King now that looks more like a
project manager that's not how we do it
in scrum the scrum master may facilitate
discussions but the team owns the
decision the product owner
doesn't dictate to the team how the work
will be done neither does the scrum
master yep then they would work as a
team for the Sprint which the teams been
formed yep go with a cool cool cool it
see that I miss anything here I think
that's right the customer you know
interestingly enough the customer is not
part of scrum the product owner is the
customer voice now the customer could be
the product owner but on the only time
the customer is a role a defined role in
agile message is for XP it's the actual
customer in scrum we call the product
owner could be the customer but the
product owner is at a minimum the
customer voice is not the actual
customer so Dee goes out it's actually
not even a possibility because it's not
possible who the customer doesn't exist
in scrum and so the answers got the BA
and there it is okay so team that takes
us to the end of our slides for lesson
number three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
