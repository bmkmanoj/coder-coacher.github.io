significant impact on the performance of
service assets such as management
organization people process knowledge
and information automation is considered
to improve the utility and warranty of
services automation does that by
providing real-time and historical data
for analysis and correlation of data
from multiple devices all through
service impact analysis for
prioritization of incidents problems and
change tickets or by service performance
optimization for example adjusting
capacity based on demand when
judiciously applied the automation of
service processes helps improve the
quality of service reduce costs and
reduce risks by reducing complexity and
uncertainty and by efficiently resolving
trade-offs some of the areas where
service management can benefit from
automation design and modeling typically
a what-if analysis an online Service
Catalog pattern recognition and analysis
of service issues classification
prioritization and routing of incident
problem and change ticket
detection and monitoring of events and
alert optimisation of services and
underlying technology the service
management tools functionality may
include a self-help which is a web
front-end offering a menu driven range
of self-help and service requests with a
direct interface into the back-end
process handling software and usually a
workflow or process engine which allows
responsibilities activities timescales
escalation paths and alerting to be
predefined and then automatically
managed usually a part of the ticketing
tools you
for service management or an integrated
CMS where si eyes relationships record
related to incident problems known
errors and change are stored or in
discovery and deployment wherein CMS
data is populated or can be verified
assist in license management ability to
deploy new software at target locations
all a remote control or commonly known
as remote desktops which allows relevant
support groups to take control of the
user desktops diagnostic scripts and
utilities and reporting and dashboards
are also examples of automation enabling
service management now that we have
covered the key concepts and principles
of service strategy we will take a look
at the concepts of service strategy
processes that is to say demand
management and financial management in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
