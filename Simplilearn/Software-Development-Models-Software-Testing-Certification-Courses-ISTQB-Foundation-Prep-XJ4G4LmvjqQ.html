software development lifecycle usually
any software development process is
divided into several logical stages
which allows a software development
company to organize its work efficiently
in order to build a software product of
the required functionality within a
specific timeframe and budget software
development companies adopt the best
suited model which suit the team members
and the software product there are many
development life cycles that have been
developed each to achieve different
required objectives these life cycles
range from lightweight and fast
methodologies where time to market is
the motiv through to fully controlled
and documented methodologies where
quality and reliability are key reasons
each of these methodologies has its
place in modern software development and
the most appropriate development process
should be selected to each project each
model has its own phases and the order
in which they are carried out so what is
the impact of a specific life cycle
model being implemented on testing it
will have a big impact on the testing
that is carried out as testing does not
exist in isolation test activities
depend on software development
activities what where and when of our
plan testing influence regression
testing and largely determine which test
techniques to use all depends on what
model is being selected the way testing
is organized must fit the development
lifecycle or it will fail to deliver its
benefits miserably if time-to-market is
the key driver then the testing must be
fast and efficient if a fully documented
software development lifecycle with an
audit trail of evidence is required the
testing must be fully documented</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
