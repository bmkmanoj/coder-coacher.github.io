hello and welcome to Microsoft Excel
2013 MOS intermediate course offered by
simply learn this is the first of five

errors in Excel 2013 in the next slide
we will discuss how to share workbooks
in Excel 2013 you can easily share and
collaborate workbooks using Microsoft
SkyDrive when you share a workbook
multiple users can work on the same file
simultaneously in the previous Excel
versions if you wanted to share a file
with others you would require to send
the shareable workbook as an email
attachment which was difficult to
organize in Excel 2013 you can share
workbooks by posting on social networks
mailing as attachments sending files
through instant messengers inviting
people and sharing workbook links by
sharing a workbook you can easily
collect comments updates changes and
suggestions from other users you can
also restrict changes to the worksheet
structure and data by protecting with
password in the next slide we will
continue to talk about sharing workbooks
once changes are done by users beta can
be merged into the original version from
the copied one you can remove the users
from sharing a workbook or stop sharing
a workbook once all the changes are made
when a workbook is in shared mode it
does not support all the features in
Excel such as worksheets cannot be
deleted worksheets or workbooks cannot
be protected or unprotected macros will
not run text the columns command will
not work tables cannot be created cells
cannot be merged and the merged cells
cannot be split
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
the track changes feature in Excel 2013
only works if the workbook is in shed
mode it is useful when several users
edit the workbook simultaneously it is
also useful in inserting reviewers
comments if it needs to be merged or
incorporating the changes when changes
are made in the shared workbook you can
view the change history directly on the
worksheet or on a separate history
worksheet in either ways you can
instantly review the details of each
change for example you can see who made
the change what type of change was made
when it was made which cells were
affected and which data was added or
deleted three ways to track changes in
Excel 2013 are highlight changes on
screen Excel 2013 outlines changed areas
in a different color for each user and
displays the basic details as a comment
when you rest the cursor over each
changed cell highlighting changes on
screen is useful when a workbook does
not have many changes or when you want
to see what has changed at a time
history tracking Excel can display a
separate history worksheet that provides
a principal list of change details on
which you can filter the finds changes
of interest the history worksheet is
useful when a workbook has many changes
or you want to review what occurred in a
series of changes review changes Excel
can guide us through the changes in
sequence so that you can decide whether
you should accept or reject each change
at a time this method is useful when you
are evaluating comments from other users
in the next slide we will understand how
to highlight changes and the track
comments
once you turn on the track changes
feature you can highlight all the
changes in two ways one is highlight
changes on screen with this the modified
cells will be highlighted with a unique
border and indicator highlight changes
on screen helps when there are only few
changes and the changes need to be seen
at a point of time this allows reviewers
to see what has been changed and who has
made the changes another is highlighting
all the changes in a new worksheet
called history you have the options to
highlight changes and comment by using
when who and where options when in this
by default since I last saved all not
yet reviewed and since date options are
available since date option is for
manual date selection who by default the
options of everyone everyone but me and
list of all the users are available
where here you have the option of
selecting range
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
you
track changes are useful for reviewers
to know the changes made in the workbook
the Save Changes permanently you need to
accept change accept all changes in
document lets you accept all the changes
in one go you can also reject change or
reject changes in document the latter
option lets you reject all the changes
at once alternatively you have the
option to accept or reject the data of
only some cells by using when who and
where options when here the options that
appear by default are not yet reviewed
and since date who here by default
options are everyone everyone but me and
list of the shared users we're here by
default the entire worksheet and option
for selecting a range is done manually
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
you
many formula errors are simple mistakes
Excel 2013 quickly spots these types of
errors and displays error message in a
cell hash division forward slash zero
exclamation mark is displayed when the
formula values are divided by zero hash
named question mark is displayed when
any invalid name is selected in formula
arguments hash number is displayed when
any invalid numeric value is found in a
formula or function hash value is
displayed when you are working with a
mathematical formula and if the formula
includes cells that contain different
data types
hache not applicable is displayed when a
function or formula cannot find any
value in the table
hache reference is displayed when a
formula reference cell or a cell range
is deleted unexpectedly hash null
exclamation mark is displayed when a
formula includes a space between two
ranges to indicate intersection and the
ranges have no cell in common
in Excel 2013 you can use the trace
command to identify the cell causing an
error in formula the formulas may
contain presidents and serve as a
dependent to other formulas presidents
are cells or ranges that affect an
active cells value dependents are cells
or ranges affected by the active cell
trace precedents what ARP the cells are
range selected to work with the formula
trace dependents select any cell or
range click on this option to check what
are the formulas in this workbook
accessing the selected values or range
evaluates formula by using this option
you can evaluate formula steps and
identify the error portion
let us do a quick recap of the steps
John performed
you
let us summarize what we've learned till
now in Excel 2013 workbooks can be
shared to enable multiple users to work
on the same file simultaneously in the
Excel 2013 rug books can be shared by
inviting people sharing workbook links
posting on social networks and mailing
attachments the track changes feature in
Excel 2013 only works if the workbook is
in shared mode it is useful when several
users edit the same workbook
highlighting changes can be done in two
ways
highlighting changes on screen and
highlighting all changes into a new
worksheet the trace command is used to
identify the cell causing an error in a
formula in the next lesson we will learn
how to apply custom format and layout in
the Excel 2013
