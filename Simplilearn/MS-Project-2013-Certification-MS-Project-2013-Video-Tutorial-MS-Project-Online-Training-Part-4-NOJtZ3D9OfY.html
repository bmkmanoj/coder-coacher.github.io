able to describe the importance of
resource management in planning projects
the advantages that come with ensuring
the project is set up to work with
resources are many and these aid in
effective project management you will
also be able to list the different types
of resources that can be created within
Microsoft Project 2013 each type along
with the examples of their usage will be
discussed the steps to create and manage
them will also be discussed in this
lesson finally you will be able to
allocate resources to tasks and
understand how this activity enables you
to handle additional project management
activities in the next slide let us
understand what resources are
a resource is a named object within the
application scope that can exist
independently or be assigned to a task
resources have a great impact on the
timing and cost of a project there are
many tools available in Microsoft
Project 2013 to create and manage
resources in the next slide we will
discuss some of the advantages of
creating resources within a project
there are many advantages of creating
resources in a project some of them are
as follows you can easily understand
many new aspects of the project based on
the assignment of resources to a task in
large projects you can find out all
those tasks that are not assigned to a
resource creating resources also helps
you easily avoid slippage of tasks a
major use of resources is to create a
responsibility matrix which will be
discussed in the next slide
responsibility matrix describes the
contribution of various roles in
carrying out tasks for a project it
enables both project managers and team
members to see the tasks that are
allocated it also shows the order of
tasks to be completed a project manager
gets to see the overall matrix that
defines which resource needs to be
available for which task in order to
ensure that these tasks are completed a
sample screenshot of a responsibility
matrix is shown on the slide
in the next slide we will discuss the
types of resources</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
