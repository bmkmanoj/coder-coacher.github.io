and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
switch port configuration this lesson
focuses on VLANs and trunks let us begin
with the objectives of the lesson in the
next slide by the end of this lesson you
will be able to describe VLANs types of
VLANs and VLAN ID ranges configure VLANs
including VLANs on trunk and stopping
VLAN traffic explain trunk encapsulation
and DTP configure DTP including DTP
negotiation and verification let us
start our discussion on VLANs
all Cisco Catalyst switches support
VLANs depending upon the hardware the
maximum number of Elance varies from
four to four thousand ninety four and
the VLAN ID range varies from 1 to 1005
with extended VLANs from one to four
thousand 94 since the number of VLANs
recommended per access which is three
even the least capable switch provides
an adequate number of VLANs most of our
discussion deals with catalyst switches
using Cisco IOS there are also catalyst
switches that use Kat OS in the next
slide let us look at the VLAN IDs the 3
VLAN ID ranges are reserved normal and
extended reserved VLAN ID is r01 and
4096 normal range varies between 1 and
1005 this is the range that you have
probably used IDs 1002 through 1005 are
reserved for token ring and FDDI VLANs
in Cisco Catalyst switches this range
and the default VLAN of 1 are
automatically created and cannot be
removed normal range VLAN configurations
are stored in a file and can be managed
by VLAN trunking protocol btp extended
range VLANs are used for Ethernet VLANs
only extended range VLAN IDs above 1005
have restricted capabilities this range
can be employed only for transparent
switches in BTP versions one and two
body and BTP version 3 servers and
clients can also be assigned a VLAN ID
in the extended range since an extended
range VLAN ID requires more storage
space you must enable MAC address
reduction in the next slide let us look
at switch port membership modes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
