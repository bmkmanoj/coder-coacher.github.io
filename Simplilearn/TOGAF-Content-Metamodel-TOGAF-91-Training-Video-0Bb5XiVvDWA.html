we're looking at for instance we
downloaded all the deliverable templates
and the artifacts remember we did that
downloaded that to folders and then by a
days it had all the deliverables and
artifacts and within those artifacts are
were building blocks various things that
make up the artifacts so and you look
through that list and look at other
places too like maybe Zachman or
whatever for their artifacts and from
the content not a model that TOGAF gives
and maybe Zachman if you want to use it
you pick your own content metamodel what
artifacts you want to use you know what
models what building blocks all that
kind of stuff so that is all part four
of the TOGAF spec so where you go
through and you look at what TOGAF
offers and even other frameworks if you
want to look at some of their their
views and our facts and you pick what
you're going to use so that's what the
architecture content framework is and
the metamodel is gives the rules by
which you're going to create your models
and what models you're going to create
as you do your architectures and here's
just a big picture of you know it's
stored in the repository the artifacts
you use etc so if you have a Content
metamodel gives you a little more formal
definition of how to do enterprise
architecture and how you're going to
actually work their way through the
projects and you learned how to how to
do those with the particular tools that
you have you can do it in a formal way
or an informal way so yesterday we were
took this a little while because the
tool wasn't it was a real familiar with
it but because it's yet new museo 13 but
we were doing more of a formal kind of
thing where we follow certain rules to
put together in the model and you can
also do an informal kind of modeling
where maybe just sit down on a
whiteboard you draw a few pictures it
really depends on the audience so what
we did yesterday was more the audience
for the architects or yourself if you
were an architect by yourself just to
get a complete rigorous picture of the
process flow and the the automation
would be in the application and data
part how you automate the process
business process flow and then the
technology architecture would be what
that runs on so so you can you can do
some modeling in that so from the in and
from this formal one that the architects
understand and that the users don't
necessarily even want to look at you can
create certain views based on your
stakeholder management you know what
views and viewpoints the viewpoints are
related the viewpoint of a stakeholder
what's friendly to them in terms of what
they want to see what are they
interested in what are they concerned
about really they have these concerns so
from the engineering diagram which we
did yesterday you can create you know
views from the viewpoints of the
stakeholders and continue to gather
business requirements and what their
concerns are start to negotiate smart
objectives with targets then we got poor
content metamodel so this is this meta
models actually separated into two
different parts there's a core content
which TOGAF says everybody would be
recommended to use and then the
extension is you use those extension
content building blocks and artifacts
and things if you're into that
particular extension use like if you're
in if you really into services they're
going to have a extension
content for services which are building
blocks and artifacts which are going to
help you track services within your IT
architecture in your overall
architecture so let's let's take a look
at that so here is these your the six
extensions again like we did look at
this little before bit but we got
governance extensions are things like
remember we were just a minute ago we
were talking about drivers and goals and
objectives those are building blocks for
the governance extension oh I'm sorry
I'm sorry
those are building blocks for the
motivation extension we on the right but
then when you get those targets in the
governance extension you have the
you have the like a contract and you
have the actual metrics because you now
have the goal so the governance
extension the motivation extension to
work together motivation extension gets
your drivers goals and objectives the
governance extension gets the metrics
and the in the contract to track whether
you're meeting the goals and objectives
services are when you have organized
your IT offerings I guess to the to the
users into things called services so
it's kind of like the way I describe as
an IT service is it's like a menu item
in a restaurant so you go to a
restaurant and say you go to McDonald's
or something you get a number 6 it's a
chicken sandwich but it also comes with
fries and a coke
services are really a bundle of things
and an IT services the same way so you
get there are certain bundles of
services that you get in your IT
menu-item your IT service within an IT
Service Catalog you have application
services you have you know which would
have business applications
infrastructure applications and but then
you also have network services like
print services things like that so they
all go in a big Service Catalog and then
then you can also get into the idea of
service-oriented architecture or
services as well where when you develop
your cert your your services or your
applications you're actually calling
reusable services useable components
that have standard interfaces and so
there it's service or architecture is a
establishes a reusability using standard
services to put together your your
applications for your services so there
again you know more at a detailed
technical level you have things called
application services and you know in
data services and other things like that
so process modeling that would be if
you're doing really getting in a process
modeling deeply where you're actually
identifying the triggers and controls
within processes things like that so you
can have building blocks for a trigger
to a process to a control on a process
data extensions or if you're doing a lot
of data modeling and you can have
logical and physical data components the
date a data entity is is in the core
content but I guess if you just do more
more layers of abstraction
in your data you can have data
extensions infrastructure consolidation
is when you're consolidating different
data centers together or servers
applications then you have location and
some physical like application
components things like that because you
have to show locations and physical
versus logical so that's there's these
some of the core metamodel entities an
actor so everybody expected to have some
kind of actor entity an application
component and they're they don't
necessarily specify whether it's a
logical application component or a
physical one here it's just application
component business service data entity
function information system service
organizational unit platform service
role and technology component so yeah
obviously you can have a lot of
different kinds of entities pretty quick
and it makes the diagrams a little more
complicated so what we did yesterday is
I only had four entities right I had a
process diagram or at a process and an
actor dataflow which was an interaction
and or like an interface I guess it'll
no word you could call it and then I had
a data store so I only had four and you
can do pretty good modeling in a B C and
D just with those four you can certainly
add more if you need to but if you just
want to get the essential flow it's
usually complicated enough just getting
the flow and the application modules and
all that kind of stuff and I might add
these other these other core ones a
little bit later especially when you get
to the technology infrastructure and
when you get to phase D that's when
you're you're definitely going to need
more of these core these different
entities you're going to need no
technology components and platforms and
you've got physical servers and logical
groups of servers all that can you got
networks
so they're your get you're definitely
going to get a lot of different symbols
that represent these building blocks in
that level so then we've got this is
just a little showing how you have
different kinds of building blocks and
they represent the business architecture
the application the technology
architecture the data is with you is
mixed in with the application
architecture and then they've got some
organizational stuff like they've got
business services in there and
organizations with business functions so
yeah you can you can put in a lot of
building blocks and in some of these are
necessary probably in your we need OOP
use or your stakeholders you're probably
going to have to put in business
functions some of those kinds of things
in the views just for them to understand
what they're looking at okay and then
the so here's stakeholder needs well I
guess this is yeah it's kind of like
what we were talking about there's
certain building blocks they're going to
want to look at to understand their
stakeholder needs because that's what
they relate to and here we just have in
our big menu there are a lot of
different kinds of building blocks
bi-phase are used it commonly used in
various phases like we got the business
architecture there's on the left and
blue in the middle of the diagram and it
has it has drivers goals objectives and
measures the content metamodel we picked
from tow gas content metamodel to create
your own custom content metamodel is
kind of the idea here and here's a very
high-level view by phase the content
metamodel so every phase is represented
like on the bottom there they call it
architectural realizations phases E&amp;amp;F
are in opportunity solutions and
migration planning on the left and phase
g's and implementation governance so the
ideas or what you know what kinds of
building blocks and artifacts are we
going to use in those phases here's one
that's a little bit more a little bit
more detailed more specifying the the
types of building blocks by phase
notice in the information system
architecture and the technology
architecture in the middle has logical
and physical like in the data
architecture has logical data component
physical data component so if you if
you're look in the definition in TOGAF
of what logical means versus physical
physical means real means you can really
see it touch it whatever logical means
it's an abstract grouping in your mind
so and you give it some kind of name
like I don't know maybe farm or
something like that or or Enclave can
anybody actually see an enclave no it's
a logical grouping kind of thing uh yes
it is it yeah yes so you are talking
about go gaps contained metamodel and
you pick up whatever you need and make
make that make that as you're contained
metamodel right so when when you make
that as your content metamodels but
that's nothing but your architecture
framework right that's right yeah yeah
and you're so powerful for your work
yeah your full framework could include
the you tailored method to write with
the pages in the description what you do
in each phase along with the models so
the metamodel would be what the models
look like in the building blocks and
stuff and in how to put together these
models rules to put them together and
then you know so sort of to intersect it
on so if I just to labor this point or
the slide that that is on your screen
right now and to put it very crudely say
this is toe caps contain metamodel I
just pick a information systems
architecture within that there is
application application rectangle within
that there is a three rectangles so if I
throw
that one out and say this is my tailored
contain metamodeling I'm saying it's a
crude way because I went given my
support to it but then that's my
architecture framework right they
learned my architects can work
yeah that's your architecture probably
metamodel content meta model but it's
not you also have to have remember we
had the tailored TOGAF method you're
documented methods of how you're going
to do TOGAF like phases steps activities
we do a business scenario we do
stakeholder management what techniques
you use really a methodology you've ever
seena system development methodology
document it kind of documents how you do
a system development you're going to do
one of those for the architecture too so
it's really two things you have the
metamodel what are the models and the
the instructions put together and then
there's some document that define that
you that defines by phase what processes
you're going to do as you put together
the models does that make any sense let
me actually let me go back here yep okay
that's really exactly what I mean the
partly least the place where it is is in
let's go back and look at that
repository again so here's the
repository so here we've got the
architecture metamodel so this is going
to be your meta model right a Content
part has what you know when you pick
from the smorgasbord and what kind of
building blocks and what kinds of
artifacts I'm going to create what kind
of models I'm going to create in what
order and what are the rules I create
those by like yesterday when we were
creating the data flow diagrams some
certain rules so creating a data flow
diagram so you put all that in there
over on the left here we have this
architecture method that's a document
that defines all the phases you're going
to use if you're going to adapt TOGAF
you're going to have a preliminary phase
you're going to have a phase a phase B
phase c/d
f g and h right so the description of
what you do in those phases and how you
work your way through those phases is
going to be in this architecture method
document and you may have different
paths you may go through the ADM cycle
for a big huge project in a different
way than you go through for a smaller
architecture you might go through for
one that you know it's going to be a
custom development a little different
then you'd go through for one work it's
pretty obvious you're going to pick a
package like a manufacturing system does
that make sense so you have a little
document that describes your path how
you go through gather those two things
give your your architecture metamodel
John yeah architecture method I thought
architecture Mathur describes your the
process that you are going to follow as
part of your tailored architecture and
it's nothing but country in meta model
that you have selected from the TOGAF
and pentameter model when you customize
to gaps contained metamodel and said
that could be your contained metamodel
and that's nothing but your
architectural method right so see this
whole thing is called the architecture
Maremma the architecture metamodel has
both the methods and and the artifacts
and deliverables and the instructions
about how to put together the models
okay does that make sense it called the
architecture metamodel has both the
method and the content method of model
the content metamodel just has what is
the content the deliverables artifacts
and building blocks
okay hip and the instructions of how to
put together those those models which is
different from the method in a way are
it's actually the content model
metamodels probably a subset of the
architecture method okay yeah okay
kind of full order yeah yeah this sorry
complicated but once you get it it's an
important point
yeah architecture method is nothing
architecture method is nothing but the
phases that you would follow but the
content comes from what you pick from
little gaps contained metamodel correct
yeah it was fine right okay
thank you yeah
okay so there's
more detailed metamodel picture content
here's other kind of show the core
content building these are building
blocks it looks like mainly there are
all types of building blocks and it like
they make kind of like an entity
relationship diagram out of these
building blocks John just to just put
one point across so if I'm saying I've
customized my architecture method I have
a customized architecture method I'm not
going to do phase say C and I'm saying
that very crudely so if I am going to
customize content metamodels I am not
supposed to pick any content from face C
as a that I mean it doesn't make sense
to pick any Content and customize that
contained prophecy because I am I've
customized my architecture method which
doesn't include face C I am speaking
very crudely or without giving much
thought but we'll just understand that
point yeah so probably with that would
really would be is within your
architecture method you have a certain
path of a type of architecture project
which you really didn't need to go
through see maybe like a technology
refresh or something like that right
there you wouldn't spend a lot of time
on the architecture on the application
or data architecture you go right to the
technology architecture so you have a
path you'd have like a map the way the
way to do that is when you document your
architecture method document you put in
different procedures we'd have like one
big master procedure or process and then
you'd have sub processes that you call
out for each of the phases and that kind
of stuff and then
so you have different paths through the
master process you call out certain
processes for different kinds of
architecture projects like we're doing a
free fresh you wouldn't call out the
procedures that for phase C because you
don't need to do them so to interject
John just to put a couple of points here
so you said if we are doing technology
refresh and that's a good example where
you may not probably go for phase B and
C or phase C and you may not take that
phase C but when you define your
architecture method and contained your
current 10 metamodel you are not going
to define it for your project is it for
your organization it's a starting its
initial phase where you need to define
that what is your architecture method
and contain tomato model and and reject
suit come come would follow later on so
I'm not going to define my architecture
method and containment a model based on
this technology refresh project that I
am supposed to do it's much much more
about that right so you go actually yeah
the preliminary is where you define your
architecture method right and put the
paths in it and stuff so and then
preliminary you just do once and train
everybody and then yeah then when you
get a request for architecture work and
do a actual phase a project then you
pick your path from the architecture
method or your architecture project and
that's what you're going to follow to go
through the project and you probably put
that in your statement of architecture
work you'd say what path are we going to
take through this architecture project
understand make sense yeah yeah yeah I
think you got it anything else no thanks
ok so here see this one has this one
actually is detailed that it has the
artifacts by phase in these are the core
artifacts in the metamodel the TOGAF
and these are the ones like when we
download it you've got examples of these
in the download buy phase here is more
of a picture which shows all the
extensions and the core again like green
is governance extension it has measures
or metrics has contract which has you
know the metrics for a certain business
objective in it and then the service
quality would be like the target so
what's the action the miracle target
from the measure so governance is all
about measuring stuff and seeing whether
you're meeting that the objectives or
not and see the red is the motivation so
that has drivers you know the business
drivers goals and objectives that can be
kinda you can think of a minute and
almost as a chain driver to goal to
objective and the objectives end up
being smart objectives ideally which are
quantitative and then we got see the
data we've got big identity a plain old
data entity as core kind of like we had
in our use case with the two data stores
yesterday we basically had data entities
and then when you get into lower level
of detail you're probably going to start
breaking things out into you know second
third normal form of the data doing any
relationship diagram at some point in
see you do logical and physical data
components you do logical ones as a
breakdown like order think about
customer order really has two physical
tables in it he stands on order header
and order detail right so the physical
tables would be order header order
detail table in the database the logical
one would just be or customer order
would really be a logical data component
it actually might be a data identity too
and it certainly a data entity is a lot
let's complete a component right because
it's just a abstract concept okay so
that's the content metamodel so here
we've got it just made a big energy
relationship diagram out
thing with the core and and the
extension content in here is a picture
it's kind of hard to see but here's a
picture of all of the artifacts by phase
both core and extension artifacts
different kinds of models the artifacts
would be tables I mean their effects
would be catalogs which are lists of
things matrices which show relationship
and diagrams which show pictures and
these are these are the corporate
extension artifacts and if you in that
they're also in that download examples
of them anyway
so there's that's the metamodel
extensions the governance extension here
is in green and that has to do with
basically tracking metrics and whether
you're meeting the objectives in the
contract and then the the red are how
you set the objectives driver goal
objective
those are motivation extension building
blocks so a lot of times people think of
building blocks as function as
functional blocks I tend to think of
them as asset blocks so if you have an
architecture think about when an asset
is an asset is something you have which
helps you accomplish what you want to
achieve right you're going to use that
asset and so you can actually have
building blocks which not are not
hardware and software they're not hard
assets in a certain sense they're not
tangible necessarily but they're assets
like goals and objectives which can be
building blocks and you can see can
actually put them in your architecture
to get a more holistic picture of them
an architecture with capability in it
capability has both soft and hard assets
in the governance extension here's the
services extension if you get into so ah
a lot or ITIL you would have services
and then you'd have to start putting
those in your in your models in your
diagrams or in any of your artifacts
probably
process modeling here the extension ones
are the event the control and a product
product is really the output that you
produce from the process so every
process has inputs so every process has
inputs that the process transforms the
inputs into an output so it's work every
processes just work and so the simplest
is you have an actor who's involved in
the work they provide the inputs and
they actually do the work in the process
of different actors to transform the
inputs into the output which is the
product the control is at some point in
the process before you produce the
output you check against some standard
and see whether this what you're
producing meets the standard or not if
it doesn't then you're going to have to
continue to work on it before you make
it and help the output or the product
and the event is what triggers a process
it's really it creates the demand for a
process to do the activity so every
process has an event that triggers it
and then we have the data extension so
this would be we've got physical now if
we look at data we get a logical data
components and physical data come and
then we have a data entity so the entity
assay is the core physical data
components would be if you want to see
what the actual physical tables are in
the database and then the names of those
in the layout logical data component
would be groups of physical data
components basically that you group in
your mind and then the infrastructure
consolidation is the one in red and
that's you have logical technology
components groups of of your servers etc
or enclaves may be might be an example
of a you know a certain grouping of your
technology that's like mythological
concept and then a physical application
component is
your actual exe or whatever your
physical component that gets installed
and you can note that you can know
exactly what box is actually on for a
consolidation effort and they've got
location over there as well so you have
to know what location it's in motivation
that's the driver goal and objective we
talked about that quite a bit
so that's medibot metamodel done the two
queries intact for you often okay anyway
you get something ah thank you thank you
yeah let me yeah you put that chat again
all right okay so let me look up here
okay so here's a Rajesh John do you mean
to say that we can have customized ad
method from toga method yes yes Rajesh
definitely actually I would say you
always have to customize the TOGAF
method this TOGAF really doesn't give
you everything it just kind of gives you
guidelines and and a content it's this
framework which has to be filled in and
modified to actually be followed in a
method so yes in putting that
preliminary you you will tailor your
architecture development method and when
you create it it's a good idea to put
paths in there kind of like we were
talking about so let me give you a
little example of hot is good tailoring
say you get into phase a and you're
working on phase a and you realize that
you could do all of phase a and get to
the target in one project it's only
going to take you like say a year and
that's fine for your company to have a
year-long project so you say I'm in a
and hey this is only going to take one
project to do so I don't really need a
big roadmap of projects because it's
only one project so I can go right to
these D if I've got the budget if not I
have to go to phase out to get approval
for the budget but I can go right to
phase G and just do the project right so
I don't even need to go through BC and D
and
F if I find out it's just one project
it's not really a program with a series
of projects so yeah so you want some
methods or some pass through your method
and yes you tailor it you're going to
tailor what what models you're going to
use and what built in even the the
symbols in the building blocks that kind
of thing you have to pick that that o
gap doesn't even give you the symbols
like yesterday we did the example we did
I picked the symbols for a process it
was kind of our like a kind of a rounded
off squared box or a bubble kind of
thing and then the actors were
rectangles and the parallel lines were
the data stores I had to pick that TOGAF
doesn't tell you what the symbols mean
they just give you the building blocks
you have to pick the symbols that's
actually what our key beat does if you
get in our teammate it picks the symbols
for the building blocks so it's a
combination of picking building blocks
and symbols it has like 15 of the
symbols and then building blocks it uses
my opinion it's a little too complicated
for somebody just starting out if you
want to do it together as a group
slide it that's why I just do data flow
diagrams
