strategic thought and action are
difficult for the following reasons
using theory to support strategy theory
is often discounted because of
associations with the abstract or
impractical theory however is the basis
of best practice Engineers use theory to
solve practical problems investment
banks use portfolio theory to validate
investments key methods of Six Sigma are
based on the theories of probability and
statistics strategy must enable service
providers to deliver value a good
business model describes the means of
fulfilling and organization's objectives
however without a strategy then in some
way makes a service provider uniquely
valuable to the customer there is little
to prevent alternatives for displacing
the provider degrading its mission or
entering its market space a service
strategy therefore defines a unique
approach for delivering better value a
basic approach to deciding a strategy
imagine you have been given
responsibility for an IT organization
this organization could be internal or
external commercial or not-for-profit
how would you go about deciding on a
strategy to serve customers firstly
acknowledge that there exists other
organizations whose aim is to compete
with your organization even government
agencies are subject to competitive
forces secondly decide on an objective
