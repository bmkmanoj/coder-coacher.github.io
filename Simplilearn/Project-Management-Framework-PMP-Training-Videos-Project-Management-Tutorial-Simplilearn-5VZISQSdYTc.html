course offered by simply learned in this
lesson we will focus on project
management framework let us begin with
the objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define project project management
program management and portfolio
management recognize the roles of
project management office identify the
project constraints and their impact on
the project explain the role of a
project manager in stakeholder
management describe different
organization structure differentiate
between a project lifecycle and a
product lifecycle
let us begin this lesson with
understanding what a project is in the
next screen a project is a temporary
endeavor undertaken to create a unique
product service or result for example
developing a new product service or
result constructing a building
industrial plant or infrastructure and
implementing improving or enhancing
existing business processes and
procedures in the next screen we will
focus on the characteristics of a
project a project can be distinguished
based on its characteristics the
definition describes two characteristics
of a project first it is temporary in
nature temporary here does not mean
short in duration a project can extend
for long duration based on the
requirements for example creating a new
indigenous missile defence system for a
country however there is always a
definite plan start and end date for a
project it cannot go on indefinitely
secondly the project is supposed to
produce a unique output the output could
be a product service or result there can
be many common activities between two
projects but the outcome of each project
should be unique in some way or the
other now let us look at what marks the
end of a project a project ends when
either the objectives are met or the
project is terminated because the
objectives will not
or cannot be met the other reason to
terminate the project can be that the
need for the output of the project does
not exist anymore
usually the sponsor of the project takes
a call about the closure of the project
it is important to differentiate project
work from regular operational work for
example your office receptionist does
the same work every day of picking any
incoming call and directing the call to
the right person in the office this is
an ongoing repetitive work and can be
classified as operation operations
unlike projects are neither temporary
nor unique creating a new software
system to effectively track your
customer complaint can be an example of
a project when the software is
successfully developed the project
objective is met which marks the end of
the project when you start using this
software to track customer complaints
you are entering into the operations
phase in the next screen let us now look
into project management as defined in
the PMBOK guide project management is
the application of knowledge skills and
tools and techniques applied to project
activities to meet the project
requirements project management is
achieved by proper application and
integration of the 47 processes project
application and integration means these
processes should be executed in the
right manner as well as in the right
order in the next screen
let us discuss how to manage a project
program management is defined as the
application of knowledge skills tools
and techniques to a program to meet the
program requirements and to obtain
benefits and control not available by
managing projects individually as
defined in PMBOK guide a program is a
group of related projects which when
managed as a group in a coordinated
fashion provides benefits and control
that are not available while managing
them individually these benefits could
be from decreased risk economies of
scale improved management of
dependencies delivery of additional
capabilities
optimal utilization of shared resources
and so on let us now learn the various
features of program management random
projects cannot be grouped together as a
program the projects in a program should
be related in some way or the other and
there should be some value added in
managing them together a project may not
be a part of any program but a program
will always have projects a project can
also be executed as a standalone project
a program is designed to deliver some
strategic benefits value to the
organization these benefits can be
tangible or intangible examples of
tangible benefit could be increased
profit margins or operational cost
savings examples of intangible benefits
could be improved team morale or
building up certain competencies while a
project manager focuses relentlessly on
the fulfillment of the project's
requirements that is scope cost time
quality a program manager needs to focus
on ensuring that the organizational
benefits are realized in the next screen
let us understand what a portfolio is
portfolio is yet another term used along
with project and program a portfolio may
have multiple projects and programs that
are managed as a group to achieve
strategic objectives note that all
projects and programs in a portfolio may
not be necessarily interdependent or
directly related a portfolio can be
created based on the business objectives
for example an IT service company can
have a portfolio named Japanese projects
which is formed with an aim to take over
the Japanese market by giving more
attention to these projects within this
portfolio similar projects can be
managed as a program and all banking
projects from Japan can be managed as a
banking program in the next screen let
us discuss portfolio management
portfolio management is the centralized
management of one or more
fools this includes identifying
prioritizing authorizing managing and
controlling projects programs and other
related work to achieve strategic
business objectives therefore whether
the company should have Japanese
projects as portfolio or not is decided
by portfolio management in the next
screen let us understand the
relationship between portfolios programs
and projects the image on the screen
will help you to understand the terms
portfolios programs and projects a
portfolio is part of an organization's
overall strategy it represents a
conscious decision by an organization to
invest in the portfolio the overall
objectives of a portfolio are then
cascaded down to the lower level
components the components could be sub
portfolios programs or projects these
components can further be broken down
into smaller components for ease of
management although a project may not
contain operations a program or a
portfolio it can include other work this
other work may comprise training and
development customer support and
services etc if the other work has
synergy with the overall objectives and
adds to the capability to deliver the
higher-level benefits then it can be
included in the program or portfolio as
well in the next screen we will discuss
project management office project
management office or PMO is a specific
type of body or department within an
organization
PMO performs several roles in the
organization and these can broadly be
classified as primary roles and other
roles typically the PMO may take up any
one or a combination of the three
primary roles it provides the policies
methodologies and tools and templates
for managing projects within the
organization it provides support and
training in organization on how to
manage projects
and finally it provides project managers
for different ongoing projects in the
organization PMO may also help in
managing inter dependencies between the
projects selecting managing and
deploying shared or dedicated project
resources if need be terminating a
project and organising lessons learnt
sessions and maintaining the project
management knowledgebase for an
organization in the next screen we will
discuss how to manage the triple
constraints any project can be done
successfully if there is no constraint
on time or there is unlimited budget
available unfortunately that is not true
in real life a project is performed
within some constraint and these
constraints are usually competing
therefore if you change one it would
affect the other for example if the
project duration increases it would lead
to increase in the project cost as well
triple constraint is a term that
originally referred to the three
competing project constraints within
which the project's are performed these
constraints are cost time and scope
quality is a primary concern for a
project manager therefore the project
manager has to make trade-offs to keep
the scope cost time quality plain and
balanced to achieve the balance the
project manager also needs to manage
other aspects of the project for
instance the people stakeholders risks
communication and procurements the
project manager plays the essential role
of integrating all these different
aspects of project management in the PMP
examination you can expect business
scenario based questions focusing on the
triple constraints in the next screen
let us understand who a stakeholder is a
stakeholder can be defined as the one
whose interests may positively or
negatively be affected or perceived to
be affected by the decision activity or
outcome of the project as per the
definition the
project team project manager project
sponsor PMO office customer etc are the
stakeholders of the project a project
sponsor is the one who gives a go-ahead
for a project and provides the necessary
resources to execute the project
therefore the head of projects in the
organization who provides a green signal
to start a project and allocates
required resources to the project is the
project sponsor a project sponsor is
usually somebody placed high up in the
organizational hierarchy of the
performing organization that is the
organization in which the work of the
project is being carried out in the next
screen let us look at stakeholder
management one of the key
responsibilities of a project manager is
to manage stakeholders a project manager
has to involve the stakeholders from the
beginning of the project until the end
so they are aware of every step a
project manager has to take up specific
activities for stakeholder management
identifying both internal and external
stakeholders missing out any stakeholder
can be disastrous for a project a
stakeholder who has identified towards
the end of the project may come up with
his own requirement at that stage and
incorporating them can be risky
determining stakeholder requirements
after identifying all the stakeholders
the project manager also needs to ensure
that their requirements are clearly
identified sometimes stakeholders might
themselves not know of their requirement
and it is the job of the project manager
to get them right by doing a proper
stakeholder requirement analysis
determining stakeholder expectations
stakeholders might also have some
unstated expectations which need to be
clarified to see if it can become a
project requirement it is again the role
of the project manager to determine the
stakeholders expectation communicating
with stakeholders
once all the stated and unstated
stakeholder requirements are known the
project manager as part
of stakeholder analysis should focus on
communicating them regularly to keep
stakeholders involved in the project
once you understand the practices of
stakeholder management it will be easier
for you to answer scenario-based
questions and the examination in the
next screen let us look at the various
organization structure projects are
performed in an organization and the
functioning of the organization might
affect the project the different
organization structured types explained
here are based on the level of authority
that a project manager gets into and
those organizations in a functional type
of organization the organization is
grouped by the area of specialization
within different functional areas for
instance marketing accounting
engineering etc are departments within
the organization each employee typically
reports to a functional manager in such
types of organization normally projects
are undertaken within the department
itself if a project requires any
assistance from another department the
request moves from the head of the
requesting department to the head of the
concerned department the team members do
their normal departmental work in
addition to the project work the next
type of organization is projectized
organization in such organisations there
are no departments the organization's
resources mostly work on projects team
members report to a project manager the
project manager has complete control
over the resources when the project is
completed either they move on to another
project or they look for some job
outside the company they do not have a
department for themselves the third type
of organization is a matrix organization
which is a blend of functional and
projectized organizational structure a
team member belongs to a department as
well as they are part of a project team
in such organization team members have
two bosses one their department head and
the second their project manager since
there are two bosses here this type of
organism
is further classified into three
different types they are weak strong and
balanced matrix organization so out of
the two bosses that team members have in
matrix organization if the project
manager has more authority over the team
member such organizations are called
strong matrix where the functional
manager has more authority it's a weak
matrix organization if they both share
equal Authority then it is a balanced
organization there is another term that
you might find in the exam called tight
matrix this generally refers to a
co-located team that is a team that has
been placed in the same location to
enhance their performance in the PMP
exam if there is no mention of the
organization type you can assume it to
be a matrix organization let us look at
each of these organization structures in
detail in the next screen let us look at
functional organization in a functional
organization the resources of the
organization are grouped by functions
sometimes called departments examples of
functions could be sales finance
administration manufacturing etc each
function plays a definite role in the
organization and is headed by a
functional head or supervisor all the
resources in such an organization report
directly into their functions therefore
a salesperson would report in to the
seals organizational hierarchy a
purchase executive would report into
procurement and so on you would notice
that in a functional organization the
project manager's role is not explicitly
called out when a functional
organization embarks on a project each
of the functions that are involved may
volunteer some resources to work on the
project one of these resources may end
up playing the project managers role the
resource assignments may not even be
full-time and sometimes even the project
manager is part-time since the project
manager has no authority over any of the
resources they are dependent
on the functional heads this makes it
more challenging for the project manager
to coordinate in the team however
functional organizations provide an
opportunity for specialization for
example if a purchase executive was
reporting into the purchase department
that executive would have exposure to
all the purchasing that happens within
the organization and has a well-defined
career path in functional organizations
project management happens at the
functional head level next let us look
at the projectized organization in the
next screen the project eyes Dorgan
ization has all the resources aligned
around projects the project managers
have complete control over the resources
working on their projects the biggest
advantage of the projectized
organization is that the resources have
loyalty to their projects and project
execution becomes easier this kind of
structure is suitable for organizations
whose work is in the nature of projects
there are few disadvantages in this
structure as well firstly the role of
the resource is over once the project is
completed secondly highly specialized
roles within a project may not be fully
occupied all the time for example a
purchase executive may have work for
selected periods on a project while
purchase activities are going on however
for the rest of the period their
capability may not be optimally utilized
there is less scope for functional
specialization as the project boundaries
limit the kind of work for the resources
each project manager is in charge of a
project and its resources next let us
look at the matrix organization in a
matrix organization the resources report
to the functional managers and are
managed by the project managers as well
there might even be a function that
represents all the project managers in
the organization which provides project
management expertise the matrix
structure has three variants commonly
referred to as weak balanced and strong
in a weak matrix the authority of the
project manager is the weakest and
strongest in a strong matrix structure
the titles given to project managers and
functional or weak matrix organizations
are project expediter or project
coordinator they would be called project
managers and a balanced or strong matrix
structure and have slightly more
authority over the time of the team
members the advantage of the matrix
structure is that resources can be
optimally utilized while preserving the
capacity of the project managers to get
projects executed efficiently resources
can specialize in their functions and
have stability in their careers also
contribute to the projects at the same
time potentially
the disadvantage of matrix organization
is that the communication overhead
increases significantly this is because
every resource in the organization
belongs into a project and into a
function leading to a dual reporting
structure in a matrix organization
project management happens at project
resource level in the next screen let us
summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of different
organizational structures each
organization structure has its own set
of advantages and disadvantages the
advantage of functional organizations is
that resources may find clearly defined
career paths and achieve specialization
and skill development in their
respective fields it will be a flexible
workforce since only one manager will be
responsible avoiding confusion the
disadvantage of such organization type
is that project work is hampered
department work is always given higher
priority than the project work in
addition there is no career path in
project management which leads to lower
interest in projects in the case of the
projectized organization one of the
clear advantages is better communication
within the projects since project work
is the only work team members are doing
it also leads to loyalty towards the
object goals the disadvantage of such
organization type is the inefficient use
of resources because every project team
has their own support function therefore
this might lead to the duplication of
effort it also leads to the resources
being left with no work since their
roles are over once the project is
completed
it also hampers skill development
because the project requirements dictate
what kind of work team members perform
at different stages on a project now let
us look at the matrix organization it
also has the advantage of better
coordination and maximum utilization of
resources however the disadvantage is
the higher potential for conflict among
the managers which might lead to
communication complexity and overhead
management in the next screen let us
focus on the comparison on project
lifecycle and product lifecycle project
lifecycle spans the initiation of a
project until the closure of the project
the product life cycle on the other hand
also encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases a typical product
life cycle starts with conception of the
product and goes until its withdrawal
from the market the withdrawal might be
because it becomes obsolete or there is
no further need for the product in the
market a product has a long life cycle a
product can require or spawn many
projects over its life for example a
project and product conception phase
could be to determine customer needs
whereas a project during product
maturity phase could be used to perform
competitive analysis typically a product
life cycle is longer than the project
life cycle a project also has its own
life cycle and this life cycle depends
upon the industry and the organization
within which the project is being
executed sometimes different
organizations within the same industry
use different life cycles there can be
questions in the exam based on the
comparison of project lifecycle and
product lifecycle so
understanding the differences will be
useful in answering such questions in
the next screen let us discuss more on
project lifecycle a lifecycle is
composed of phases each phase represents
a discrete unit of work required to be
done on the project there are different
ways of classifying project life cycles
let us first discuss the sequential
versus overlapping life cycle in
sequential phases the subsequent phase
starts only after the previous phase has
been completed
whereas in overlapping phases two or
more phases may run in parallel for some
time this could help fast tracking and
compressing the amount of time required
the other way of classifying life cycles
is how they go about the process of
planning and predictive life cycles
there is a large upfront planning phase
where all the details of scope costs
time are planned before beginning the
subsequent phases these phases then are
executed in either sequential or
overlapping modes they are suitable for
large projects where all the
requirements are likely to be known in
advance and where upfront planning
effort is required to get the necessary
approvals another feature of predictive
life cycles is that each phase may
potentially be different in the nature
of activities and may require people
with different skill sets for example
traditional software development life
cycle has phases like requirements
feasibility planning design construction
testing and transition we will continue
project life cycles in the next screen
incremental and iterative life cycles
have a short upfront high-level
definition and planning phase the
product is then developed through a
series of iterations where iteration
increments or adds to the functionality
by a little all the activities are
intentionally repeated in iterations
adaptive or agile life cycles are
variants of incremental and iterative
life cycles where iteration is very sure
typically two to four weeks agile
methodologies are becoming very popular
in the software development industry and
in other industries where the
requirements are highly changeable and
frequent feedback is beneficial let us
now check your understanding of the
topics covered in this lesson here is a
quick recap of what was covered in this
lesson project management is the
application of knowledge skills and
tools and techniques applied to project
activities to meet the project
requirements PMO provides the policies
methodologies and tools and templates
for managing projects within the
organization project manager has to
integrate various project aspects like
the people stakeholders risks
communication and procurements with the
project constraints time scope cost and
quality identifying internal and
external stakeholders determining their
requirements and communicating with them
regularly is an important role of a
project manager functional projectized
and matrix are the three types of
organization structures based on the
level of authority given to the project
manager project lifecycle spans the
initiation of a project until the
closure while product life cycle also
encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases with this we have
come to the end of this lesson in the
next lesson we will discuss project
management processes
