valuation of debt securities vol 5 study
session 16 reading 56 fixed income
review welcome to reading 56 of the
simply learn cfa level 1 tutorial in the
last tutorial we identified the interest
rate policy tools available to a central
bank described the yield curve and
various shapes of the yield curve learn
the basic theories of the term structure
understood the spot rate and various
yield measures and explained how
embedded options liquidity and issue
size affect the yield spreads this
session is on reading 57 as prescribed
by the CFA Institute learning outcome
statement or LOL we learned about LOL in
the first session please go through the
learning outcome statement for a
detailed list of learning outcomes after
this lesson the candidate should be able
to value a bond using both traditional
as well as our patridge free approach
agenda the agenda of the session is to
cover reading 56 as prescribed by the
cfa level 1 curriculum you can go
through this reading from volume 5 of
the cfa level 1 curriculum made
available to you by cfa institute in
this lesson we will start by
understanding the general principles of
bond valuation we will learn to estimate
future cash flows and determine
appropriate interest rates for
discounting the future cash flows we
will also learn how to discount the
expected cash flows and learn the
traditional approach of bond evaluation
for a coupon as well as for a
zero-coupon bond we will then learn the
arbitral free approach to bond valuation
lastly we will compare the traditional
and the arbitrage free approach to bond
valuation as per the learning outcome
statement after completion of this
lesson the candidate should be able to
explain the steps in the bond evaluation
process described types of bonds for
which estimating the expected cash flows
is difficult
calculate the value of a coupon and a
zero coupon bond explain how the price
of a bond changes if the discount rate
changes and as the bond approaches its
maturity date
calculate the change in value of a bond
given a change in its discount rate
explain and demonstrate the use of the
arbitrate free valuation approach and
describe how a dealer can generate an
arbitrage profit if a bond is Miss
priced
general principles of bond the valuation
there are three main steps involved in
the process of bond evaluation step 1 to
estimate the expected future cash flows
coming from the bond like the coupon
payments and the principal payment step
2 to determine the appropriate interest
rate or rate that we are going to use to
discount the future cash flows step 3 to
calculate the present value of all the
future cash flows found in step 1 using
the interest rates found in step 2 the
sum total of all present values of the
future cash flows is the value of the
bond we will look at each of these steps
in detail in the coming slides
estimating cash flows and determining
appropriate interest rates cash flow is
the cash we expect to receive in the
future from an investment that we have
made these cash flows are affected by
the change in interest rates in the
future since the changing interest rate
environment affects the options embedded
in the bond estimating the future cash
flows can be difficult under the
following scenarios when the issuer or
investor of the bond has the option to
change the contractible due date for
payment of principal callable bonds
portable bonds mortgage-backed
securities and asset-backed securities
fall under this category when the coupon
payment is reset periodically by a
formula based on some value or values of
reference rates prices or exchange rates
floating rate securities fall under this
category when the investor has the
choice to convert or exchange the
security into common stock convertible
bonds and exchangeable bonds fall under
this category a minimum interest rate
that is required on an investment is the
yield available on a default free cash
flow like in the US the yield on the
Treasury security for non-government
security the yield required is the yield
available on an on the run Treasury plus
an additional risk premium since each
cash flow is unique it is more
appropriate to value each cash flow
using an interest rate specific to bank
cash flows maturity rather than using a
single interest rate to value all the
future cash flows
discounting the expected cash flows here
we take a look at the method to discount
the future expected cash flows given on
this slide is the formula used to
discount a future cash flow to find its
present value this formula uses as its
inputs the future cash flow that is to
be discounted the interest rate used for
discounting the cash flow and the period
from now when the cash flow is going to
be received when we have found the
present value of all the future cash
flows using the above formula the value
obtained by summing up all these present
values gives the value of the financial
asset let's take a look at the example
where we need to find the value of a
bond that matures in four years has a
coupon rate of ten percent and has a
maturity value of one hundred dollars
the bond pays interest annually at a
discount rate of eight percent for
solving this we first identify the cash
flows that are going to occur in the
four years to come the cash flow for
years 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 is ten dollars the cash
flow in the fourth year will be 110
dollars as it will include the principle
of one hundred dollars as well as the
fourth interest payment of ten dollars
each of these cash flows is then
discounted to the present using the
interest rate of eight percent as
mentioned in the problem the sum total
of the present value of all the four
cash flows is the value of the bond that
is one hundred and six point six to four
three dollars when we plot the price of
security with the discount rate on a
graph we see that higher the discount
rate the lower is the securities value
you
you
valuing a zero-coupon bond in this slide
we look at how to value a zero-coupon
bond the only cash flow involved in a
zero coupon bond is its maturity value
the value of zero coupon bond is found
by discounting the maturity value of the
bond with the semi-annual discount rate
let us consider this example where we
need to find the value of a five year
zero coupon bond with a maturity value
of one hundred dollars discounted at an
eight percent interest rate the
semi-annual discount rate is one-half of
eight percent that is four percent using
the formula we get the value of the zero
coupon bond to be sixty seven point five
five six four dollars
arbitrate free bond valuation in this
slide we look at the floor with the
fundamental approach to bond valuation
and the method of arbitrage free bond
valuation the fundamental flaw of the
traditional approach to bond valuation
is that every cash flow of the fixed
income security is discounted at the
same discount rate arbitrage profit can
be made in this method by taking apart a
security and selling off the stripped
securities at a higher aggregate value
than it would have cost to purchase the
security in the market the proper way to
view a bond is as a package of
zero-coupon bonds whose maturity value
is equal to the amount of cash flow and
whose maturity date is equal to each
cash flows payment date this method is
the amperage free valuation approach
treasury spot rates are used for
valuation in this method because the
value determined using the treasury spot
rates does not allow for the generation
of an arbitrage profit
comparing traditional and arbitrary free
models in this slide we will compare the
traditional and our bridges free value
of an eight percent 10-year treasury
bond for all the cash flows
corresponding to the twenty time periods
we will calculate the present value of
each cash flow using the discount rate
as well as the spot rate corresponding
to the particular time period when we
sum together all the present values of
the cash flows calculated using both the
spot rates and the discount rates we see
that the two values come out to be
different the difference in these two
values is the operative value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
