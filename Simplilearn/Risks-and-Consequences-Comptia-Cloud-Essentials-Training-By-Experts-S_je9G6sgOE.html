similarities with IT system deployments
but they also have many differences let
us look at some important techniques and
some pitfalls associated with cloud
computing
broadly we will look into networking
automation and self-service federated
identity and increased importance of
standards the next slide introduces us
to the concept of networking with
respect of cloud computing cloud
computing is solely dependent on
networking for any cloud deployment to
be successful network connectivity has
to be taken into consideration key
dimensions of network design that
relates to cloud computing are location
bandwidth latency tolerance firewalls
and access control and redundancy let's
look at each of these factors in detail
location in a typical Network design
there is a single point of control
connecting the access network a client
PC server network or data center and the
external connections of the business
client amidst this there is a firewall
zone - but in cloud this single point of
Connect is completely removed clients
can access the services from all
locations and the same holds true for
servers and business partners bandwidth
the speed at which data mousse over
connection is called bandwidth local
network connections are said to have
much higher bandwidths than wide area
connections cloud moves processing away
from a local network as a result
available bandwidth becomes an issue
delayed tolerance it is similar to what
we saw in bandwidth as locations become
more spread out the transmission delays
also increase not all applications can
accommodate this
firewalls and access control in cloud
there is a need for multiple touchpoints
between a company Network and the
Internet
unlike the firewalls which are confined
to a single location resilience cloud
computing is capable of creating new
components that can break down or become
unstable at the same time cloud services
create new techniques for introducing
redundancy for example it is better to
store data in more than one single
location in the next slide we will
discuss automation and self-service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
