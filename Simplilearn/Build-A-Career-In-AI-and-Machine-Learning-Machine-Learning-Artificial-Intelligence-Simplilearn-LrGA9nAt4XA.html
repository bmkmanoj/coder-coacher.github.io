and how to build a career on it I'm
honored I am the chief product officer
for simply learned and I am actually
really honored to have Ronnie Van Loon
here Rana Van Loon is somebody who runs
the data consultancy firm is a blogger
you know consultant and helping a lot of
companies succeed and you know the best
part of it he is actually a category
advisor procedure where he helps people
like me build great courses and make
sure that they are world-class top
knowledge so Ronald did I cover your
introduction relatively well would you
like to add something now perfectly and
thanks for having me here truly a
pleasure wonderful all right for the
audience for the great just so you know
of you have a bunch of topics we are
going to cover today starting with
what's a I what's hot in the space what
should you do to get start on your
career how you move forward with it what
are the skills you need so lots of juice
in this discussion today but the most
important thing is do ask questions my
team is actually actively monitoring the
chat making sure that the questions are
actually posted and that we can pick
those and actually discuss those as well
so try to make it as interactive as we
can and take these questions from the
audience as well I also believe we're
live on YouTube today so if you're
youtuber hey great to have you here as
well so that's said Ronald are you ready
to jump right in
that's a group that's car all right
let's do this
so Romano let's start it up really um
like a set up question for you right so
warm it up a little bit you know
fundamentally a lot of people actually
are confused about what artificial
intelligence is versus what machine
learning is and all these terms are very
confusing to a lot of people right so
maybe to get us started
can you help us by just defining these
terms and maybe you get applied and how
do people use these technologies let's
start there that's I think a good start
maybe start as well with we talking
about careers in AI so we can start and
talk about the careers net AI the impact
on the jobs some statistics some
overview what K is and the machine
learning is and some details
so a eyes are really quickly developing
domain and that's going to create around
2.3 million jobs in 2020 a business
that's forecasted it will also release a
number of jobs but in total there's a
surplus
around half a million jobs and if we
look to all the companies that are
involved to AI and with AI they say 83%
test that technology is really reading
in this domain for creating this new job
so AI bring a topic really forth
interests I think and excitement for a
long long time but recently it gets a
lot of traction and I think that's a
good reason one of the main reasons is
the acceleration and it's AI is really
providing innovation across many many
industries whether it's health care
whether it's transportation but it's
travel telecom smart home smart cities
entertainment media you name it
basically and there are some some
development and innovation so in fact if
we look through these major tech
companies and they employing
applications throughout or any industry
verticals the most major vendors are
integrating AI and machine learning into
their product models which means that is
really coming to market partly at the
large scale so what we see with AI
applications they're really going to
grow the coming years and by 2025 it's
compilation research and forecasters at
this market will grow and surpass even
hundred billion dollars so it's
substantial so what all this means is
that they I which is a subset of machine
learning are offering really a lot of
unique and viable career opportunities I
think for everybody who's attending here
but also therefore for many people all
over the world now let's go a little bit
more detail so AI is how we make
intelligent machines robots and
computers and it's software that learns
similar to how humans do so it's
mimicking human cognitive functions and
AI so this is human brain analyzing the
human cognitive processes and finding
connections and compatible
so these insights are then applied
towards development of software and
systems that performs its tasks like we
do as a human so we talked a lot about
the Ibis I think in general AI augment
the human capabilities I mean north and
capabilities and help to make a life
more predictive more efficient and more
easy so if we talk about AI as to
basically two components on one hand is
automation and on the other end is
intelligence and what we see is that the
typical goals that AI are covering so we
can think about cognitive functions like
reasoning or we can also think about
things like automated learning and
automatic scheduling machining is also
part of that a is covering but also
natural language processing computer
vision and robotics and what we're all
aiming for in the end is more the
general intelligence so I think if we
talk about AI there are three different
main stages and stage one is the machine
learning which is an algorithm that
steps and that is used by by intelligent
systems to help learn from from
experience if we then move to the next
phase it's more machine intelligence
which is where our current AI technology
basically resides not nowadays and in
this stage that false set of algorithms
are utilized for machines to learn and
learn from from experience and take 3
where we trying to have two is machine
consciousness where it's self learning
from experience without any external
data for example this page includes
virtual assistants like Siri or katana
from Microsoft it was we wanted I gotta
say anything machine consciousness is at
the same time exciting is it scary so
please continue but I just worry called
an interesting term and I want to come
back to the scary part as well because a
lot of scary talks about machine machine
can basically take over the world but I
I can come back to that life
for later on I'm not afraid any houses
if you do it yeah so and if you can see
their many aspects of AI that help
businesses to extend research and to
help with this innovation but if you
look to the career that's what we talk
about today I think there's a huge gap
in AI and machine learning and it needs
to be filled with qualified and then
skilled professionals and I think that's
something that we will dive into more
detail as well today so we see that
these large companies are actively
searching for this talent and then
that's why we have to scale so if we
look through machine learning and now we
go a little bit more in detail machine
learning is a subset of a I and this is
how we create intelligent machines and
it enables computers to learn like
humans do and they do it through present
recognition and through learning from
from experience
so algorithms use a set of training data
allowing computer programs to learn to
do something that they are not
explicitly programmed to do and this is
different from what we are used to in
from the processing so what we see
looking machine learning is also
supports a decision-making capability so
it's utilizing the power of predictive
analytics to forecast potential outcomes
and this what we see evaluate in more
future events as well so DIF analytics
algorithms analyze and visualize raw
data and they do this to find this
meaningful results so machine learning
really provides us with the technology
to augment our own ability as a human
arrange of capabilities as a human and
support functions in the variety of ways
but it also helps businesses to assess
risk to define opportunities and to
better help the customers as well so if
we look from example for for machine
learning it will probably recognize all
of us is campus
everybody's familiar with this form of
machine learning and that helps
businesses leverage on one hand new
opportunities but it also levers
leverage and levels and a number of
interaction and customization so we see
that world is increasingly getting
digital and steps box gives us this fast
personalized responsive way during
directory business and they're an
intelligent digital assistants that help
companies understand and the shift in in
everything was there with the customer
care I think this is a nice example of
the combination of cleaning and
artificial intelligence so they are
combination in if you said box of
natural language processing of knowledge
database data storage and also from the
same application so machine learning is
widely used and you probably interact
with it or daily basis so if you have an
apple you talk to Siri if you talk to
your computer with Microsoft Word to
Cortana if you have your Amazon Alexa or
you have your Google home home
assistants
so these digital assistants they a depth
based on your user experience they
collected data and interpreting
interpreting offer two unique answers to
see my screen is and finishing so I hope
you can still like and take it so
seriously yes that's right and so
look the machine learning I think it has
an expensive range of application and
every other mange and you can think
about fall section as analysis gesture
recognition predictive maintenance
health diagnostic and this is just just
a few so furthermore and I also have man
happy to join a panel a week ago in IBM
in New York which was broadcasted like
machine learning it's a letter to AI and
we discussed that in this panel a week
ago and it facilitates the ability for
organizations to implement excelent
automated capabilities in their own
digital infrastructure but it also
accelerates processes and data analytics
can be leveraged to build intelligent
applications for fast applications
throughout all departments but a
sadistic product report finance
manufacturing filter marketing basically
any have any department so hope this
gives us good first press inside it
doesn't actually Ronald oh you know I
have Siri Cortana and Alexa home and
unfortunately they work when they want
to go today so I can definitely tell you
that you're right
machine consciousness is a little ways
off I think but I think we're making
steps in that direction but on a more
serious note and by the way some great
questions coming in all bring those in
as we get this conversation going there
you talked about a few other topics
right natural language processing image
processing machine learning so if you if
you take licking learning an AI and kind
of break down further how do these
relate these sub terms right natural
language processing machine learning how
do they all relate to each other and one
day subsidiary conversation if you take
a bunch of very common today in terms of
what's being used in industry if
something were to start the career we're
probably the great starting point for
them to get that career launch and we're
getting the details up in a few minutes
but that question came from the audience
so we might as well read it in this
conversation so maybe first get into
more in depth from what's the relation
between young learning and artificial
intelligence and I discussed already
machine learning is a subset of a I but
AI is a larger concept of machines that
are capable of completing all kind of
intelligence tasks and receiving
learning is an application
of AI that centers around the idea of
machines having access to this data and
learning autonomous absolutely so that's
a one and very scary but on the other
hand it's also the capability and the
nice bounces off of AI so if we then
look to for example neural networks and
so we were talking about discussing
about deep learning they have an
integral to teach computers basically to
think and learn by specifying
information and they can do that similar
to to what you do so it can be thought
to recognize images and categorize these
images by specific elements there's dogs
I think this is a the nicest and most
common example that's that we use how to
recognize and based upon these input and
we can make predictions or also can make
decisions with a high level of accuracy
so another component of AI is what you
were talking already about is natural
language processing which is dependent
on machine learning and it's able to
understand the human language and this
gives a lot of that they knew potential
and possibilities so we can also
communicate with this by a natural
language processing and through natural
language processing machinery is able to
assist machines in learning to respond
in a manner that is just a specific to
audience can understand and that's a
tremendous capability which is really
going to change all the interfacing that
we have right now with all computers
then we have deep learning and which is
more at the cusp of cutting edge of
intelligent automation and it focuses on
machine learning tools and deploying
them to solving by solving problems
basically by by making the decision and
the data inputs in a system and this is
then used to make the decisions about
the data
we also see is that the data and process
through neural networks which getting
closer more to say how do you think as a
human and this can classify complex
methods amounts of data set so deep
learning can be applied to audio to
speech to images and then to text to
right conclusions that really start
limiting human decision-making so we
have AI River such as machine learning
and research and deep learning so this
is a little bit more and an overview and
I hope this also gives more in-depth
insight in the relation between AI
machine learning and Angela absolutely
will get in the career of question a few
minutes so let's let's actually take one
additional question which has come up
quite a bit from the audience as well
and we were planning to talk about it as
well so let's just dive into it you know
one question that is very important here
is what industries actually use AI so
who cares that AI is there and how they
apply it and you know what are the
innovations that are happening out there
that are applying a is some creative
innovative ways right fundamentally the
people that are you know watching this
are interested in finding out if I were
to switch industries where would the
best exciting innovations happen and
where are they being used so what are
your thoughts from there so it's really
through AI a machine it's already
creating some interesting innovation I
think across many disciplines and many
industries and there's a lot of
promising I'm a conference everybody
knows about the self-driving cars it is
to say just one part and the qui se
already autonomous driving application
process lab with Adi with Google with
uber and this is let's say one industry
and what the self-driving car does it
reacts to objects and their environment
like a human's life
I think another part of the industry is
the predictive maintenance where we can
start forecasting maintenance that that
can be performed so when a machine
equipment might failure and we can
improve and predict that it's going to
happen so we start we start predictive
maintenance basically and this improves
on one end and
safety but also there's tremendous cost
saving in this area and we see this
applied in for example in transportation
like in trains and I've been instance n
Italia and whereas if he helped them or
with the French railway with IBM and it
is really focusing si in the industrial
equipment another entry for example we
have small city and making cities more
less a energy efficient or using try or
reducing pollution and improving safety
this is really important aspects where
AI machine learning health in smart and
smart cities but also smart metering or
smart traffic lights and small building
and even law enforcement tools with
cameras that police have to check if
somebody has a as a wrong track record
basically are important areas very
diseases one other application and what
other let's say domain I would like to
do emphasize is virtual reality and
literally reality and itself it's not
let's say pure AI but if we look to
gesture recognition and if we look to
all the players that are within a game
this is all driven by AI and memory
learn application so many applications
in many different different industry
basically and if it's fair to say Ronald
based on what you just said right it
feels like you know in your example
self-driving cars for example you've got
the automobile industry that's probably
looking at that the ubers and all those
are probably looking at it in a video
smart city there are you know
infrastructure providers they're
probably looking at artificial
intelligence so you can take these right
if you had you come up with a bunch of
companies are getting into space as well
what are some of the names that come to
mind so the big brands or names that you
know are starting to get in the space
that are relevant to these innovations
that you talked about I think you
brought up a few names already idea
Banyan for topiary
Amazon and Vidya Microsoft IBM Accenture
Satan these are all the companies that
apply machinery at large scale driving
innovation and basically drive the
future for for low
gotcha all right so when we go on so now
we get into the career discussion right
so you talked about machine learning AI
natural language processing neural
networks a bunch of very interesting
topics
some more niche some more broad right so
a few questions that are come from the
audience
plus you know the conversation we wanted
to have where you think someone might
start right and for example you know one
thing I know and you're an expert right
if you get a neural networks that's
probably a very specific domain maybe
it's a little more narrow or ditch
versus machine learning India might be a
lot broader you know so in your mind
where should one get started and what
are the kind of basic key skills you
need to have to be called a machine
learning engineer or data scientist with
machine learning expertise in your mind
yeah so if we look where to start I
think that where study mom so if we look
through the mom and we see that a
different kind of industries and
different kinds of skills that that are
required so there's a strong emphasis
what we see and let's say
not despair teens having entered into
the purpose interdepartmental sorry
collaboration and modern businesses and
so these are typical skills that you
need to cover as well so sharing inside
and being able to communicate it's a
part of innovation and a part of AI so
to obtain jobs in AI we need to have
this education and you need to have
these type of skills so that's something
I think what where you need to start and
where you need a strong foundation as
well some let's say areas that you need
to start with is in mathematics and you
can need to start in the machine
learning and you can start with all
different types of courses from
technical skills
I think computer science degrees it's
important to have but also programming
skills like Java Python C C++ are
desirable type of skills so it's also to
supplement these let's say with general
business knowledge because if you don't
know to understand the data if you don't
understand the business it's definitely
hard to get meaningful insight from
English and on the other hand I think
what what's quite important and AI never
stops and it's advancing so tremendously
fast that you cannot stop learning so
and it's something once you start you
never felt basically culture alright so
in terms of demand police in a bigger
demand is and the careers that are being
built right so what are the roles
companies we talked about a little bit
already
and playing what kind of industry do you
think the great the most demand is and
typically you think of salary ranges
people what people people can expect
right what your voice your sense of what
the market is today and and what people
can expect in the space
good question hat specify I think for
this audience over here and so we look
to the demand for the AL AI
professionals and they revolve around a
few couples so with loop through AI and
machine learning
researchers I think it's quite important
so machine learning algorithms improved
through research and identification of
solutions so this is an important rule
another role is AI software development
so program management and in testing
systems and infrastructure are developed
that apply machine learning to an input
of the data set it's a crucial role as
well because without applications
basically you cannot improve the
customer experience then we have data
mining and analysis so investigating
large data sources often creating and
creating training systems and
recognizing patterns these are let say
capabilities that are important as well
and of course the machine learning
application to apply machine learning
and AI frameworks to specific problem in
a different domain and this includes
applying machine learning to for sample
gesture recognition as we already were
talking about in gaming or EV analysis
of fault detection so and then if you
were talking about today with the D mobs
and we were talking about the companies
like IBM Accenture
Facebook and Nvidia and Amazon you had a
large company but if you're not able
let's say or you don't want to work for
these larger companies there's plenty of
options across different industries and
you can think about industrial IOT for
example predictive maintenance machinery
and any equipment such as presenting
failures that's becoming really an
important part and another nice nice
light figures if you look to the average
cost that the plant is down in the US
extent $32,000 per minute and in general
let's say plant which is down for more
than 800 hours so this thus essential
business value and it's also substantial
that they work and improvements to to be
realized but you also can think about
for this predictive maintenance or in
transportation sectors in fund in train
companies like this 20
or the Front's railway or airlines and
airplanes like Boeing so also smaller
companies smart manufacturing smart
agriculture smart farming smart energy
oil and gas I think these are all
industries which yeah where you can go
ahead and develop your skills other
industries like finance so the finance
sector really heavily reliant on
machinery and for many thing that
ecosystem loan approval and asset
management risk management algorithmic
algorithm Italy algorithmic trading or
security it's all driven by machinery if
you think about commuting but it's
either order smaller variant from uber
they are really relying to continuing as
well they optimize the estimated time of
arrival for right so we vent fault or
predict passenger demand and also
working on self-driving cars
technologies and this is really being a
research and increased and they're
already testing at testing with this so
if we look then and then and summarizes
them and look for typical typical kinds
of jobs is machine learning engineers
it's data scientist research scientist
are the engineers business intelligence
developers and they're probably computer
vision engineers as well so we're
talking about it well about salary
ranges and they're the yeah sometimes
even unbelievable I think if we look
through the industry and if you being a
skilled professional and there's quite
that say a high demand and you can see
this in the salary ranges as well so if
I go over some key purpose in demand for
for AI careers and the New York Times
has a nice report so for people that
work in AI specialists including PhDs or
people even write to me directly from
from school and we believe it less
education and put up let's say a celery
space between 300 and 500 thousand
dollars per year the reaches tremendous
amount and sometimes even they add some
stock as well if you that they start and
if you do some average start and
salaries in an AI job they are bought
from the thousands and ten thousands
annually and which is even two times
million pay I think for for full time
jobs from American workers and we make
that important three fifty fifty
fifty-five thousand third dollars
because of the machine learning
engineer's and data scientists they are
120 hundred thirty thousand robot
robotic scientists live it lower similar
likely research scientist around $80,000
and business intelligence developers
$92,000 and this is that these are
figures that say for for the u.s. so
it's important of course where are you
located
related to the 2d market that you can
turn so I think it's quite an impressive
amount that you can earn so worthwhile
investing some education in it as well
great you run oh I know we wanted to
talk about a little bit of the direction
of ear as well but there are a lot of
questions for the audience on how do I
get started what training can I take
what course can I take so I've seen like
you and I need to address that question
if you don't mind maybe we'll take a
little bit of a diversion for the
audience mistake and you know maybe you
can get it started and I can jump in and
start talking about it as well I think
you talked about a broad topic we're
good let's see I'm I'm curious you're
having the product development and
already for for quite a time and I think
you learn and I think all the people are
very curious okay how can they get
started what the posture they follow and
when you experience when you look
experience helped us out yeah wonderful
and actually I'm going to I'm going to
ride on the great platform you're set up
for me I want to I want to come back to
you once you go to the beginning right I
think it comes down to you need math
skills programming skills and be able to
use the
in conjunction to actually do real-world
programming right now I think a
conversation the question that's come up
a few times in the audience has been I
don't know anything about math or I
don't I don't have anything in
programming what do I get started I'm
brand new to this industry and then
thinking of the fundamental I'm going to
try to keep it divergent from simpler
right now I just talked about general
capabilities you talked about math and
statistics capability that is crucial to
understanding the algorithms that you
mentioned right the second part is
programming and being able to actually
write these frameworks and utilize these
algorithms programmatically a question
that was asked is our business Python
actually if you guys go back to one of
those fireside chats we had I think a
couple months back about the same
question was asked and answer at the
time was Python is by far slightly more
popular than R right so if you have to
choose one pick Python is pretty much
what came out of that discussion at the
time so so net-net
you know it I think generally of people
who are interested in getting into
machine learning come in sort of three
different buckets one I don't know
anything I wanna get started - I'm a
programmer I want to get started and
three I'm a data analyst and I'm barb
get a scientist I'm gonna get more into
machine learning and dependent really
where you start you already have a head
start or you don't write what a disk rut
is somebody who's getting started
completely brand-new you've got to learn
the algorithm so you gotta understand
the math behind it you gotta understand
the programming and I'm hands-on
hands-on hands-on as much as you can get
right if you are a programmer read it
guess what you can skip that module go
straight into the machine learning
algorithms start coding and if you if
your data scientist you know that part
of it already you need to learn the
programming bits possibly you know
montón together and get started on
programming together so now the little
bit of tables plug I'm a product I'm not
a marketing guy but I'll talk about it
really quick
we do have the exact same path learning
kind of--if lunar already we have a
master's program or a learning task for
people who are brand new getting started
it starts with an intro to AI talks
about what the different disciplines are
how you apply them it gets into machine
learning talks about it actually gets
you to do Python programming the 25
hands-on exercises + and then get to the
deep learning and we're building our
national language processing image
processing as we talk through it right
so there's the whole
plan that comes together from basic to
very advanced and very niche which is
already available today you know and
another thing I'm gonna call it is
irrespective of how much you learn
theoretically it all means nothing if
you don't actually practice this so
whatever you do make sure there's a lot
of hands-on practice as part of what you
learn and that's the only way you're
going to get really good at it because
at the end of the day what you find a
job if you really want the questions are
going to be can you actually program
this can you actually get this framework
done can you actually build this yeah
application and that would be the key to
it and knowing the theory will not help
you there right so pause here Ronald any
thoughts from your site you're welcome
to disagree with you as well
we're friend you're my adviser so I
would love to hear your thoughts if you
want to add in a bigger yeah I was
looking to the questions while you were
talking
sure so let's see
so we're which companies are offering
jobs on machine learning this is an epee
from youtube I think we recovered this
already there quite extensively so I
hope this question has been answered
more questions about which companies are
offering and job for machine learning
and so I favor a question the relation
to AI machining using technologies like
40 and 5g how I would like to use it in
my product let's say that the difference
between 40 and 5 gm is system mainly the
latency so the speed and application and
what you see inform quite some machine
learning and AI applications you need
low latency if you are a car and you
need to pencil data you cannot rely on
high latency so what you see it's
relation between 5g which will be rolled
out for some companies already started
with this like direction some companies
are started rolling this out in the
coming year like wow way and you see
that the number of let's say machine to
machine applications where low latency
is important and to give you an example
if you want to control
all machines or trucks on a distance
that they have retracts in the
construction side and you want to
control them drive them and in Europe
let's say remote control and put can be
somewhere in the US and you can be in
Europe these are typical applications
where 5g is really required on the other
hand let's say you have four g 2g 3G 4G
5g which is all a combination of
networks and depending on the latency
and the requirements this just really
defines which network is used so not for
all applications ai machine of all a I
am handling applications 5 G's is really
required but I expect that there will be
tons of new innovations with the
capability to 5 G's coming use which we
don't even think about the path talked
about recently so it's really we need to
explore it we need to to find a find
router
we have some some cash
you won't give answer I think it covered
all the questions that came from the
audience for the most part let's jump
into questions that we want to cover so
you know Ronald one final question for
you in a major level if you think about
where AI is headed at this point of time
right you know what do you think it's
ongoing and what's the future here yeah
so it's with this pace of development
it's not easy to to forecast the future
and if we see the how fast machine
learning is applied in different
industries compared to one or two years
ago so forecasting is is risky but if we
look at say if we look through
educational on one hand and we wants to
get access to a career in Nai it's
really a necessity to have yet to start
working for and to start developing all
your your skills that we were discussing
so to answer your question and just want
to touch a couple of exciting projects I
think about the future of AI and the for
example natural language processing you
can imagine if you look to the
capabilities and the possibilities of
voice and voice can be now we have an
interface which is most of the time
typing that if you can start speaking to
any device you can imagine that the
let's say customer experience and our
behavior will change substantially by
the use of natural language processing
and by voice and but also let's say in
this domain we have voice biometrics so
instead of having passport
passwords and then maybe even test
products in security and you can use
let's say voice to use fraud and to
increase security so there are different
types of of computing and so we see some
computing developments with with Intel
and Qualcomm which is called no morphic
computing
so this gives some much more advancement
and truly intelligent machines and then
giving the capabilities of going through
this machine consciousness so whether
use electronics rather than software to
develop machine cognition and through
sexual mapping of brain functionalities
and into hardware so this is a different
approach but it's something is advancing
I talk frequently with with Intel and so
it's exciting to hear all these
different kinds of development so what
this this technology does is basically
instead of M and Miller emulating human
neural function computers basically
functions like like the human brain and
these and all of these elements yeah
what a majority before it's calling
imagination and innovation in the coming
years which we cannot even think about
right now from from what what is even
possible and I just wanted mm WC Mobile
World Congress where you see so many new
applications coming up it's really
incredible and this is also I think a
good sign for the demand in these type
of jobs you have to get into this domain
everything is is data and everything is
data driven in the future so without the
skills and without escape abilities it's
much harder to to find a job and if you
stay ahead of your say other pairs I
think it's a good of job opportunity got
it so this is probably a good time to
stop or you know discussion in the sense
of very formal in a box gonna cover the
audience has a lot of questions which
self we've already answered and by the
way folks who are listening obviously we
can't go through every single question
ask but we'll try to cover a few that
have come up that we will try to you
know give a broad view to you know one
thing Ronald obviously similar and other
folks are already providing courses out
there but you know in your time you know
learning machine learning an algorithm
whether it go to plays are there books
you recommend or blogs or in a website
that you recommend people can go to as
rescore resources from my time you think
I'm all no no look you let me rephrase
the question you admission learning a
lot longer than a lot of us right and
the way I look at it is you know folks
we're just getting started it's bit of
journey one or two years for you this
journey has been how long six seven
eight ten years yes I'm a bank
management or a defense Katya very often
don't anymore and and so simple simple
question regulated this way longer than
pretty much anybody here including me so
in your time of these 25 years right
you've been looking at this sort of
organically so these resources that
we're talking about can come up more
recently so once your be one you know if
there are some resources beyond courses
that are there are the places people can
go to it or good blogs good place to
read yeah I think definitely and so I
used to interlock and also to educate
myself and see what's going on and
what's new and where are the best
resources where you can use a farm
spirit in Twitter you can search certain
Twitter handles and on a certain topic
you can find great great input I am use
data science central a lot system I
produce as well but I use it a lot to to
educate myself and Katie nuggets is
another resource resource that I use a
lot and I follow some people which I
really appreciate and like in this
domain what they are saying and
especially from where the second where
where is AI where is machine learning
because there's a lot of rumors and
thoughts from what it can do what it
can't do and a lot of these guys is
Jerry Marcus and he's heading out the
left from from Hoover but has his own
company as well and he's really down to
earth what is possible and what's not
possible with machine learning and I
think that's some there's some people
some cornerstones and in the in society
that we need that don't try the service
but just bring it down to earth where we
really are and what what is possible
like image recognition
something that we can do natural
language processing as a language
understanding is something that we can
do but we cannot replace doctors by
doing a full analysis from the person or
we cannot do automatic let's say
scientific discovery yet and so there's
let's say different kinds of sources
pick some pairs and then some industry
leaders that you would like to follow
and learn from them and on the other
hand source viewer from compares from
educational sites like simply learn
another type of a site where the terms
of of the educational material available
and just start start by trying out sale
and I feel many times in my career but
if you don't feel you do not learn and I
think especially if you start working
with a diet is trial and error and find
out what works well and what doesn't
work well to to innovate and to move
forward wonderful
one last career related question that I
really want to know your view on machine
consciousness and then you light it up
you know one question that seems to come
in various forms from the audience is
look I'm in data science you know how do
I get into machine learning so you know
someone is doing data science versus
machine learning can you give a little
bit of a bridge between these two roles
and what you think is maybe a good way
for them to progress so that's I think
I'm going to pick the Christina
scientists like if I'm a data scientist
today I'm doing some level of data
analysis some programming already is it
just a matter of learning the algorithms
and getting it as machine learning you
know algorithms or they're a little more
you recommend that they do yeah I think
data preparation without quality data
there's no AI there's no machine
learning so you need to understand how
to prepare your data what we're
discussing already it's let's say
multidisciplinary teams
interdepartmental communication is very
important so and learn and educate
yourself in your communication skills
understand the business without the
business knowledge yeah you
just data you need to understand your
business to provide meaningful insight
and you need to have your analysis
skills your model building skills your
visualization skills and programming
skills but just start and learn by doing
and then see where you what areas you
like really good at it is hard to say
you have to do this business and then
you're the ideal person you have to like
it you have to follow your passion and
find out really good at how you fit in
the team because data science is not a
data scientist to does everything it's a
team sport in the end you want your last
question and I'm really curious since
you're sort of weighted my appetite
there you know if you ever really afraid
to the reality of humanity when you
think of machine consciousness and where
it's headed or your thoughts there yes
if you look to let's say machine taking
over the world
the matrix and all kinds of things that
are thrown in in media if you really
look through all the technologies that
have been developed that can create or
basically tear down to the whole or
globe whether it's the atomic bomb or
any kind of other innovations they're
positive and negative size and maybe
nice example is I spoke to say natty
person from very large UK bank and he's
in fourth analytics and he mentioned
they dedicate so all the the defroster
so the deceased in in this domain they
come up with new developments they use a
I to use machine learning and they have
to catch up within one or two weeks
after something happens so it's a
natural involvement of the Gooch after
death and the best and one hand say they
developed as well a certain direction
and the group's can use the same type of
material and machines and machine
learning and AI to protect themselves so
more as a matter of evolving and
matching the good and the bad this has
happened there the last couple of
thousand years and I think in in society
on the other hand yeah we see machines
evolving and being capable of doing much
many more stuff but on the other hand we
have to be down to earth and like the
scary markers and from from you really
said okay what's possible what's not we
can do image recognition we have natural
language understanding natural language
processing and these are all
capabilities that machinery nai is
capable to but if we looked at the day
in what's not possible there's a lot not
possible and that's the best thing about
Twitter Facebook and and social media
you make a nice movie and people start
believing that that it's true and that
it's possible and so that's I think more
to danger danger of the media and maybe
close to to fake newsstand that is the
danger of a ing many I'm positive and I
believe in the day the the balance
between the good and the bad but on the
other hand I'm not a futurist I cannot
look into the future and don't know
what's really going to happen but if
there are crazy people on the world that
won't want to do strange things and yeah
they can do without a with machine
learning or without or with a with AI I
think wonderful Ronald I want to thank
you personally for the time you spend
here today and you know taking all these
questions for the audience thank you so
much you're wel hand cuz a pleasure
being here and thank for having a
wonderful into the audience I recognize
that we cover probably 80% of the
questions that came through us I do
apologize end of day of we try to cover
as much as we can
if your questions weren't answered feel
free to you know we'll try to see if we
can it'll provide that in some form or
fashion in in some kind of article the
future so stay tuned and thank you very
much for joining us today
goodbye maybe as a last note I'm going
simply learn on YouTube on Twitter you
can also follow my youtube and
LinkedIn and Twitter account to gain
some additional knowledge so I think
that it's worthwhile profile doing that
with those famous last words good night
good morning good day to everybody
worldwide take care thank you
you
