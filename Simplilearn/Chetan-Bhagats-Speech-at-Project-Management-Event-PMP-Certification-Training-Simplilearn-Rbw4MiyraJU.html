she's saying also yeah too much it's
worth it okay well yeah no I think it's
interesting you guys chose to spend a
day here I was telling someone that it's
we all are happy and we normally spend
money shopping for gadgets clothes we
often spend for travel going to
restaurants you know expensive
restaurants drinking outside paying a
lot of money because we feel it makes us
feel good makes us feel happy brings
value but we rarely do it for studies
right we rarely say that let me invest
me or my ask my company to invest in my
education and we feel that once we
finish school or college it's done and
whether that's not the case and that
shouldn't be the case so I think these
these modules that companies like simply
known and all are doing I I like it that
they allow you to give in one day some
new things because I have written
extensively about the education system
and all that but factors you have to
continuously learning never stops so in
that way the initiative is good of
course team is the focus for today but
I'm going to obviously give you a a more
overall kind of approach presentation
because I think the you've been having
technical presentations since morning
but I'm going to talk to you about my
life and how I have done what I've done
and you know a lot of people say that
chitin is very prominent as a writer
there's so many writers right there's so
many go to a book shop crossword has
40,000 titles so there are so many
writers but I'm very lucky my book sell
a lot and also you hear about me a lot
compared to other writers correct fair
fair enough some people say we're Chetan
is everywhere and I am not the best
writer I will be very honest with you
but I am the best-selling writer
you know this difference so that's the
and that's a that's that's I'm being
told I I'm not a bad writer I think but
some may say whatever but I'm definitely
not the best writer would you agree yeah
but I'm not I will let thanks very kind
of you but but compared to what my
talent is I have some talent I have
achieved a little more because I have
tried to have a less ego about learning
about having an attitude that hey I am a
writer now and I am like better than the
world and be because of this thing
called the team because people have
helped me rise and I also helped those
people rise of course team includes some
people now work for me I have three
people who actually work for me so it's
one is of course that team but also I
often in my profession I make teams
which come for a short period of time
for projects and then they go away
especially in movies right and there are
times when I'm working by myself when
I'm writing a book it's totally there is
no team there but during the release of
the book during the marketing of the
book there's a team in water when I'm
doing a movie and if I'm writing a
script for the movie I am just one input
in the movie there's 200 people in the
crew a writer is important but there is
a lot of some would say more important
people like director producer actors
music director production designer
there's so many different people there
it's a team and I have to keep switching
between and I think I do that better
than some of the other writers I think
in terms of people skills I have little
bit better people skills in not and also
that I'm this great guy in terms of
understanding people and I'm I worked in
many many places I've worked in
investment banks have worked as a writer
script writer as a columnist I can tell
you beyond a certain point all the
capabilities talents idea
brilliance IQ all these wonderful things
that your parents and your teacher said
you should have to do well in life are
quite useless
what matters is people and what matters
is how you deal with people once you
have six guys who are equally good and
one of them can be CEO how they going to
decide are they really going to decide
on an IQ test no are they going to
decide on who works harder no they're
all all six are the top six people in
the company they have reached there
because they're all good but the guy
who's chosen often is a the guy who does
the best politics right what is that
politics is nothing but people it's a
negative connotation sometimes but in a
pure sense politics is people you know
politics is about understanding people
in fact lot of people ask me why I write
about politics for me this is very
similar to what I do in stories because
politics is nothing but understanding
people of course there are political
parties and people elections are
separate so organizational politics is
also for people how you then you know
position yourself that people feel don't
being threatened and we make you a
leader make you rise also people and
then yeah maybe little bit it matters
that how when you know your marketing
and how well you know your finance but
everybody knows that and that I have
learnt in life and I didn't know this
because I'm from that IT background I am
background and I thought you know that's
everything studies are everything marks
are everything then that happens I will
do well in life and then I realize now
that that's not the case that often is
not the case and therefore the teams are
important and if you learn this without
ego you know because it needs dropping
of the ego that's where people fumble
actually like I firstly we will fumble
like this is not my job my job is not to
play politics I'll tell you one thing if
you don't learn the politics you will
not succeed now there can be positive
politics and they can be negative
politics but if you don't understand
politics and your inner organization
unless their organization is run by
robos and you're the only guy then it's
okay but as long as there are human
beings present there will be politics is
it possible to have a group of human
beings without politics in every housing
society there are politics in every
multinational there are politics in a
political party there are politics
everywhere other projects and right now
you're seeing what's happening with the
politics of the country anyway all about
people at the end of the day right and
so that's what so I'm gonna give you my
journey and I want to tell you what I
learnt about self versus team through
that and hopefully you will also get
some learnings from it it's an
interesting journey more than anything
else I think the kind of journey I have
had is very different from many other
people who have some of it was planned
some of it was not planned it just
accidentally happened to me so I'll
share that with you but the first team I
had to make I want to start on a little
lighter load so first team I had to make
was to get married that's all so team
know would you agree or not this is a
dream it's very important how you deal
with people the best practice comes from
your spouse yes you know yeah if you can
make a fool of your spouse then you can
make a fool of everybody at work so
practice let me go home and if you can't
if you can't lead your spouse and if you
get dominated by your spouse then how
can you lead in the organization
I'm just joking so how many of you read
my book to States to see many of you
have okay so you why is it called two
states two different states me and my
wife I'm Punjabi my wife is not Punjabi
she's familiar actually any many the
millions here I'm sure some of them okay
and my mother was very upset when I was
trying to put this team together you
know she was like so therefore I was
from a team which was my family and
there was another team I wanted to bring
into my life which was my wife and her
family and my mother was not very happy
about it she was not very happy mainly
because she was not a Punjabi that's
basically why a lot of people and I I
don't know why but India is like that
even today if you open the matrimonial
plays of English newspapers progressive
English newspapers they're organized by
caste and community it's not a
vernacular paper these are all educated
people reading the paper but they prefer
the matrimonials organized and if you
although online matrimonial sites are
also being holy matrimony calm and X Y
Zed matrimony calm it's like it baffles
me but it is the way it is so she was so
I could have married my wife even
without my mother's permission legally
I'm allowed right legally you're allowed
and these days anyway our government
only cares about legal things right and
wrong is not important
prove it that I have stolen proof catch
me catch me running like a robber then I
will agree otherwise yeah I have 300
crores of property but prove it that it
is a bribe I just made it up you know
anyway so I will try not to give
political examples but I get carried
over there so you know I thought well
legally it's okay to me to marry her
there's something more fun when you get
married and it's important that you
convince your parents so that's the
difference you can run away so you can
plan an elopement you can plan a big
fight but the idea was I said no I don't
think this should be the reason to
reject someone you can say that I don't
like her attitude I don't like her
nature whatever that's but to simply say
that she's not Punjabi so not good
enough to be your wife and and same
thing was happening on the other side of
course not tamil not Brahmin which
apparently is something very special I
so know seriously didn't know I mean my
in-laws were worried that if their
daughter marries me will the kids be
even humans and you could have a horse
or a cow come out like Oh what happened
here huh so is not very so I thought I
will convince my mother why she should
let me marry a non vanjani go and
convince her using science because I am
an engineer so first part of my thing is
this is what I use this wine on Punjabi
girls are better than
so now you're wondering where is this
training going what is going on here
today are you attended so many sessions
this relaxed little bit so I thought I
just show her my nan Pacifica so how
many Punjabi border is there in Punjabi
go there to Punjabi once you are on
Punjabi girls I said it's I mean it's
okay if that's what you want to be okay
so let me show you what I showed this is
this first off you know whenever
whenever a first whenever a presenter
comes and shows a graph he comes across
as very intelligent and in India you
have to show growing graph so this is
one I had and the Punjabi diet is very
rich in butter and dairy and things like
that
ant a million diet little Russ some Thai
other things right so you know next one
is shopping expenses Ravi goes really
like to shop so that is the other issue
books read you know I'm a writer so I
want sorry I mean
I mean Femina is not a book you know it
looks like a book
the answer's no now my wife nan Bharat
Natyam for 10-12 years and I don't know
what they keep learning
but when hobbies have three steps that I
will not show Rama but if you remember
the first graph because of the weight
even those become difficult to do over
finally this was the deal clincher
mother-in-law argument frequency and
basically you know to Punjabi girls in
the same house is like two hungry Tigers
one cage doesn't work finally I
convinced her and sold oh don't be so
against interstate marriages and finally
that team was put together and I'd
encourage you to marry here and there so
that you know it helps our country
become become one anywhere that jokes
apart my journey our tell you when I
first wrote my book it was rejected when
I went to the first publisher and that's
what he said he said this Indians don't
read books and that's it was of course
disheartening and he said that if you
win a award abroad then we'll publish it
but otherwise it's not something we can
do we can't help you with the next guy
said this will publish a book if we feel
it will sell thousand copies and yaws
won't so that was the other third guy
said this you're a techie why don't you
write a textbook
and that's that and they stay here
actually and long story short you know
nine different publishers said no to the
book became a lifestyle for me almost
two years I kept going from one guy to
the next and I just kept going and I
today feel this struggle and this
actually finally paid off because I
often tell people is one thing to have
the okay talent to write a book so I did
that but it's quite another when six
times people have said no to you in life
and you try again seventh time you know
that is not something that got anything
to do with writing when people have
rejected you in life people have said no
you can't do it and then you keep trying
that is a different quality and like I
said maybe call it less ego or maybe
call it just stubbornness maybe kind of
whatever you want to call it but you
need this often in life to just keep
trying whatever things you've learnt
today whatever things you try in your
teams they will not work the first time
around they may not work but if you keep
trying they will eventually work and
most people have seen who make it in
life are not people who are brilliant
geniuses they just are a little more
comfortable dealing with some failure
they can deal with it and keep trying
deliver and keep trying and finally you
know one publisher which is still my
publisher rupan company said okay we'll
give it a try and then my first book
came out five point someone sold more
than a million copies and it became a
hundred times the norm of a best-seller
ten thousand used to be bestseller I
became a million so people were
obviously quite shocked I was super
shocked but the whole industry was very
shocked because they had said no to it
and ten thousand was the benchmark
bestseller 1000 is what they said it
should sell thousand minimum books but
this and then of course the movie
version three dates came and that also
broke several records this has been my
work since then five novels in all one
night call center three mistakes two
states revolution and recently I had a
book of columns come out
what young India wants and these books
have to have become movies hello was one
night at a call center three dates was
five point seven and Kai PO che is three
mistakes of my life which will come in
two three months from now quite an
incredible set of events you know in
some ways when you heard that you are
being rejected so much and then you keep
trying and then this happens and it it
just kind of grew from here to here the
idea I always wanted to do was to do
more with it do more with the books
maybe because I never had planned that
the books will be so successful maybe
because I don't tie my identity with the
writer so much that okay I am a writer
that's but ever let me see what else I
can do with it politically I was very
keen to do something for the country
because we all feel it we all everybody
feels the things are not being done
properly at the top and now I had a
stage a stage which is not normally
given to people in the country unless
you're a successful Bollywood star or a
cricketer and they rarely does a writer
get that kind of popularity and very
rarely do you have educated celebrities
nothing to say about the existing
celebrities but it's rare right a
cricketer may be great at his game but
I'm not so sure if they will be the best
at talking about politics or the economy
or thinking like that because they are
not trained in it they're not got the
qualification or the experience for it
nor are they able to understand the
politics whereas a writer who writes
about people right whenever I write a
story there let's say there 10 15 people
in the story I'm moving from one point
of view to the other so what am i
essentially doing this is the world
according to this person this is the
world according to this person and they
may be at conflict so you gain a very
good understanding of people so I
thought let me see what I can do with it
and for that I needed other partners
luckily I got good partners in The Times
of India which carry my columns how many
of you have seen it so you will see one
this Sunday for example on mr.
son-in-law quite a guy huh here's a what
a guy
firstly to get Priyanka was not easy and
now of course I always wonder how the
conversations would be at home no now at
dinner like how when the mother-in-law
would scold him what he would say
I'm sure the Indian line he would says
but he threw inoculating who's she
kidding here
right or his beginning I don't I mean I
can go on and on about this but read it
on Sunday
so and I've 10 try to be bold bring out
the issues on corruption on reforms
needed corruption and education are two
things I've had from very beginning and
now corruption movement has become very
big and education also you often find
people talking about it and and here you
know I had to adapt because like I said
when I write a book I am a star I I am
do I writing and once you have a few
bestsellers nobody says no to you I mean
publisher everybody will say yes yes
whatever you say will be on here it's
different a it's the newspaper so you
have a word limit firstly whatever you
have to say you have to say it in 700 or
800 words secondly it's no longer
fiction and thirdly you have to work
with people who will may agree with you
your editor may agree with you maybe not
agree with you sometimes they chop off
things which are extra spicy mostly they
are very good mostly Sunday Times has
been very good they have never really
held back if I want to take on something
and that takes some adjustment and
people often say people say it for the
movies also do you feel the justified
your book do you feel
and my answer often is my book is my
book
they were used my story to make
something if they made something great
I'm very happy if they've not made
something great it's ok part of life
it's like somebody translates my book
into other languages it is I found that
this is often not the case with other
writers and that is why there have not
been that many adaptations especially of
like say Indian novels which are in
English before hello-hello came before
three years the last mainstream movie
which came based on an English novel was
guide in 1965 so very big hit movie that
the songs famous even today but
apparently RK Narayan hated it he just
didn't like it and he said I'm never
gonna get let any other movie being made
of my books he may have had his reasons
I don't know but fact remains guide is
his most famous work marguerite days of
course Margret is also because it became
a TV series if it had not become a TV
series let's face it it's not so
Bollywood gives me a lot I don't have
the money to advertise for my thing ever
it just doesn't work in books anyway but
Bollywood is in some ways a free
promotion you get you know but I have to
learn to work with them so I can't be
but you have not done justice what I can
do is choose good people and sometimes
I've been able to sometimes I'm not
sometimes people are good in their work
not good and ethics sometimes that it
will keep happening but I have to learn
that there will be some changes I often
feel that is why so many of my books are
getting picked up and being made
otherwise filmmakers prefer to make
books whose authors are dead because we
are dead then it's very difficult to
give suggestions right so they will make
Shakespeare
they'll make Sarat Chandra again and
again again because mr. Sarah Chandler
can't do much if you make daily with
valina having drugs after 50 years of
the author's death anybody can make
their work so you know if they wanted to
make my work that way
they'd have to do something about me and
wait 50 years or I could just be the guy
who gets along I could just be the guy
who says try your best but I understand
you're making a Bollywood movie I can't
sit there and say but this is not how I
saw it because the guy is putting 50
crores of real money behind it the guy
has to recover that money the audience
that comes to see our movies is not the
same as the audience who reads an
English book they're having auto drivers
also coming so in 3d I remember how many
read five point someone okay so who gets
the girl in five point someone who hurry
Alok and Ryan three guys are there know
who has the girlfriend
hurry has the main narrator the cool
guys Ryan which became Rancho but Rancho
didn't have a girl but Rancho was
American how can you have neither one
get Karina
hegemony know that even though I agree
is big star in the South but you know
come on Aamir Khan will get Kareena
now that Madhavan character was the
hurry character in five points among her
he became Farhan similar and that was me
in real life so that girl was my first
girlfriend and they said they're going
to give it to this guy
now how do you work with that team and I
was like oh my god the first thing I
thought was what is my ex-girlfriend
gonna say they said you worried about
the ex-girlfriend this is a hundred
crore movie I said but still how could
you do this to me relax this so but if
you think about it from the audience
point of view they want to see their
star romancing the world if you think
about it it doesn't really matter as
long as the essence of the movie which
was to bring out the messages of the
education system come out it doesn't
matter who sings with the girl it's not
even the romance track is it's not even
relevant at the end of the movie same as
the book I mean it's nice it keeps it
entertaining but it's not so I said you
know either I become a stiff prick and
say no you're not doing this I'm not
going to let anybody make a movie or I
let them make the movie the essence of
the story that lets students let people
live their passion let people figure out
let that reach and this little plot
twist live with it plus five point seven
is a very popular book those who want to
know the original there's many people
who know the original and many people
have seen both and it's it's fine and
I'm not even getting into that this is
obviously a different story from the
controversy that happened later and
those were early days in Bollywood for
me and I wasn't nobody at that time
because in one book out
it's different people have so this is
where our compromise you can call it or
you can call it cooperation you can call
it collaboration and it's not like I
sold out because I knew that the movie
will be good because the makers the
actors are superb and they will keep the
spirit of the movie but certain
adjustments I was okay with and factors
three dates has given me a lot you guys
read books but when I go to small towns
most people know me through three dates
so I'm saying but most writers in the
world would have brought their ego into
it they're like how can you allow this
to happen it was your work your
creativity but it's not like that film
business is a different business there's
money involved the commercials all this
so many we will involve you can't you
can't do it then you might as well not
do it you want to keep it very very pure
then keep it to books that's not what I
wanted same thing happened in these
columns there is a certain policy Times
has I had to work with that if I don't
then I will not be a columnist for Times
of India I can write my own blog but
then Times of India adds to my team and
gives me the reach that I want which is
pan India right so those are things
sometimes I think in life you have to
realize that sometimes you give some and
get some and that is where you value the
team I'm not saying you have to do
things which are violating your
principles but at the same time you have
to realize that the other person also
has to get up I will give you another
example to States right now is becoming
a movie and that film rights have given
to somebody and the casting has rotated
so much I read in the newspaper Shahrukh
is doing it then I read Ranbir Kapoor is
doing it and then I read Saif is doing
it now our latest Arjun Kapoor is doing
it which i think is pretty firm now I
could start panicking what is going on
it's my book
what are you guys doing but I know that
this is part of life there
floated around people talked is that
things so I've learned to just live with
it it's helped me because now all the
books will become movies if I had a
stiff attitude they wouldn't make it it
was like it's a condom garea same with
times they've warned a balance in their
paper of popular writing as well as the
point they can't
it's a popular newspaper so that's the
issue
another thing the Times does is this
cell that space in Bangalore times and
in Bombay times and whatever you know
right so those are you can buy those and
that's not my style I am frankly I don't
like it they do that what they have
started doing now though they write
their advertorial if you notice earlier
they didn't use to write that but now
under Bangalore times it will be written
advertorial because most of the stories
there are paid for it's not ethically I
feel it's kind of icky it's like while
doing this if you put an advertorial
there I am ok with it but if you don't
put advertorial there and then you are
just planting stories there was
something now should I write a column
for a newspaper like that big dilemma
should I make a team like that it is the
biggest newspaper in the country in
English in the world it's the biggest if
you count number of copies and the main
paper I can tell you because I have been
with them for two three years is
untouched main paper even the promoters
and all have no control that's what they
have really gone for some scans they've
really gone for it so the main paper is
absolutely objective about news but the
other was not and it took me a long time
to come to the conclusion and then they
started putting advertorial anyway so it
was a little better but then I'm like
okay I am doing my columns pure they are
not influenced by anybody and the
editorial page is not the main paper is
not so I'm saying those kind of things
also come which again some people are
able to adjust and some are not I also
write for a Hindi newspaper which is
dainik bhaskar this was a different team
partner for me
if I want to bring change in this
country I can't bring it just by keeping
on talking in English I have to reach
the vernacular so I write for this one
Assamese paper also takes the call of
Marathi and this I'm trying to look for
some South paper actually now and this
again people said most English writers
are never caught speaking in Hindi who
is beneath considered like you know not
really your image but I knew I have to
reach if I don't reach it won't happen
and I started doing these talks which
again you know like the one I am doing
today and brings a different set of
partners which has got nothing to do
with the writing business or film
business overall this is what my
organisation structure looks like it's
like a bubble it keeps moving books is
just one of the things I do but these
films this columns the stocks social
networks and the internet a lot of
things and I want to reach as many
Indians as possible that is my
definition of success and it is now four
to five crores from 2004 when I started
where people you know they didn't want
to publish my book and there has been no
advertising right you've never seen a
Chetan Bhagat ah but so much reach by
what simply by collaborations by
leveraging if you can call it the brand
by doing things which means ability to
work with people they get something I
get something filmmakers need content
without story they can't make a film
I need the visibility the filming sales
so there is a tie up there you know a
column you only want to reach people and
tell my views about the country
newspaper need columnist things like
that those are the things that have
driven me those are the reasons I am
still surviving young people read me and
they are the most fickle audience they
are jumping from facebook to twitter
twitter to smartphones they are like new
fads hoga be they were like okay we are
done with it and now in on
she keeps saying when he are we used to
read in months from 2004 to 12 to
survive and be in top of mind when it
comes to books reading is difficult and
that's because I know no matter how
smart I am no matter how clever I come
up with how nice books I write without
my partners I can go and for me the
guiding criteria is each of these guys
must get more out of it than I do
so when they take my story and they make
it into a film hopefully they make a lot
more money then I would that's okay they
got the money but I got the reach I got
the visibility same four times they
don't pay much but they are giving me
every Sunday morning whoever takes the
times gets me on there so things like
that whenever you are in a team make
sure your partners are what are they
looking for you know it's quite common
sensical if you really focus on people
forget that you are HR manager forget
that some Novella person is what this
forget designation forget just come as a
person as a human being
sit on the table and figure out what
they want once you figure out what they
want in life you can figure out how you
can give him does he want more money
does he want more fame that's more glory
in the company does he want to be
recognized is he anxious about getting
this project done does he hate his job
and he needs some friends here every
human being has needs like that
emotional needs and that is what
determines how good a people person you
are it is nothing else to it really I
mean it's not something you need to you
know be a PhD in it's not it's
instinctive and once you have that you
can reach my ultimate team is the entire
country when I take readers I'm hoping
one day I'll tap into them to do
something even bigger but let's see you
know
one theme I want to leave you with is
passion I want to talk to you about
passion because without this it doesn't
happen no matter you can call it
whatever where all the learnings in the
world if you are not really passionate
about anything about yourself your own
dreams or for your team it's not going
to happen so I want to clarify this
concept of passion for you what is
passion is one of the most abused words
passion every organizational seminar you
go to this word is said every CEO will
say have passion every speaker passion
passion but it's one of those Abused
words like love everybody loves
everybody you know our friend which has
become this word because of Facebook is
the most abused word nobody really knows
what a friend means anymore because I
have 300 friends on Facebook I don't
think when I am low and depressed I can
call 300 people one of them is a guy who
was it mean class too and I am never
seen him again and we just use Facebook
to see pictures or who's become fat and
who's not that's not a friend but that's
what life has become fashion is also
like this
I go to people everybody wants fashion
but you ask them what is fashion they
can't define it difficult so what is
fashion because people often say that
you cheat and talk about living your
passion your passion has made it here so
this thing also you can figure out if
you have some passion for your team for
yourself but what is passion I like
keeping things very simple passion is
just this a very strong feeling towards
achieving a goal you know it's a feeling
it's an emotion like anger jealousy
being sad being happy being joyful
passion is also in that category only
now the difference is passion is towards
achieving a goal it is different that
it's a feeling that comes from within
you to get something
that is why it's so important it's the
only feeling that is goal-driven
other feelings yeah I'm angry I'm
jealousy it's one thing but it is
something that is a emotional thing
coming from within you that I've warned
that very badly so it's like having a
motivational speaker inside you and that
is why people say figure out what you
are passionate about and go after that
because that means figure out what
things you get emotional about if you
don't get emotional about something then
you have to beat yourself up every day
we are let's do it we cannot do it so in
a company also whatever you do that
passion has to come in in some form you
can't feel passionate all the time
benefits of having this passion is
because people say okay it's great you
told us what is passion oh why should we
have it why can't I live a life without
passion I just go to office sit around
do my work you know get a review every
year get some promotion go home I don't
have to feel passionate I can do it
without feeling passionate I can do my
job I've been doing it for 20 years
without any passion well this is why
because passionate people and I have
seen many people who are passionate do
have a happier and a more fulfilling
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
