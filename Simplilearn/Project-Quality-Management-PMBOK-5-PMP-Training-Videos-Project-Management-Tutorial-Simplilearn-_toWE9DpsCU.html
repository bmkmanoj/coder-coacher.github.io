course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project Quality
Management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define quality and quality management
differentiate between quality planning
quality assurance and quality control
explain cost of quality and its
categories describe the project quality
management processes explain the seven
basic tools of quality explain Six Sigma
in the next screen let us take a quick
look at the project management process
map there are 47 processes in project
management root into 10 knowledge areas
and mapped to five process groups in
this lesson we will look at the fifth
knowledge area that is project quality
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand what quality is
the project manager is responsible for
quality in a project however it is also
the responsibility of each and everyone
in the project to ensure that whatever
they do meets project quality
expectations quality is defined as the
degree to which a set of inherent
characteristics fulfills requirements a
project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable usable means that the
intended users can use the product
without any problem in the next screen
let us look at some quality related
terms it is important to discuss a few
terms to understand the concept of
quality better customer satisfaction is
defined as conformance to requirements
and fitness for use it is important to
understand the subtle distinction
between quality and grade grade is a
classification based on technical
characteristics low quality is always a
problem but low grade may not be a
problem
rather it would be a matter of choice
similarly it is important to understand
the distinction between precision and
accuracy precision is the granularity of
measurement that is how fine-grained can
you measure the outcome accuracy is how
correct you are that is how close you
are to the desired value in the next
screen let us understand the concept of
optimal level of quality quality comes
at a cost more effort put in quality
will give better results however you
cannot keep on investing on increasing
the quality as there is no limit to how
much a product can be improved
investment in quality is determined by
knowing the optimal level of quality
optimal level of quality as shown in the
diagram is said to be achieved at the
point where the incremental revenue from
improvement equals the incremental cost
to secure it suppose you are the
manufacturer of toys but the toys are
below quality and the sales are low to
improve the quality you invest in
identifying the demands of children
sharing few samples and recording their
feedbacks once all these are captured
and implemented in the products you lure
the parents to buy them as the
investment is increased to manufacture
good quality toys the cost will
therefore increase and it might become
prohibitive for parents to buy optimal
level of quality is reached at a point
where you get maximum number of buyers
for the toys manufactured now that we
are clear on the concept of quality in
the next screen
let us discuss quality management
quality management involves performing
activities like creating standard
policies and procedures and ensuring
that those standard procedures are being
followed properly in the project it aims
to ensure that project meets all the
initial agreed requirements without any
deviation and that the specified
approach to quality is implemented on
the project three broad activities are
done as part of quality management they
are quality planning quality assurance
and quality control quality planning is
the four
first step when quality related
activities of the project are planned
Quality Assurance is the next stage of
implementing those quality plans and
quality control is the last stage when
periodic checks are done to see if
project quality is improving in the next
screen let us look into the differences
between the three aspects of quality
management it is important to understand
the different kinds of activities that
come under quality planning Quality
Assurance and quality control
once the quality planning is done the
quality management plan is ready this
quality management plan has standards
templates policies and procedures to be
followed in the project it contains
information on the level of quality
being aimed and the plan to achieve that
level it is the aim of quality assurance
activities to ensure that the activities
planned under quality planning phase
gets executed for the project it is the
task of Quality Assurance to determine
if the project is complying with the
organizational as well as project
policies and procedures this is ensured
by conducting regular process audits to
identify deviation from what is planned
in the quality management plan these
audits are generally done by quality
department of the organization's Quality
Assurance focuses on the process not on
specific products the role of quality
control is to measure specific project
data or results against standards to
inspect and verify the project's product
defect repair and measure whether
quality indicators are improving quality
control is about the product and data
for example it was planned as part of
quality management that project would
get completed plus or minus 10% within
the cost budget three months back when
the measurement was done project was
over budget by 20% when the measurement
was done a day before it was only 15%
over budget therefore the project has
showed an improvement of 5% in the last
three months and it is quite likely that
over the next three months project may
get within
planned limit of 10% instead of showing
improvement if the data shows cost
increase then corrective and
preventative actions are required to get
the project within the 10 percent limit
this is quality control in the next
screen let us discuss a few quality
management concepts let us look at some
terms that are commonly used in quality
management parlance total quality
management or TQM is a quality
management philosophy that involves
holistic thinking about meeting the
objectives of an organization it places
the responsibility of quality squarely
on the management Kaizen is a Japanese
term that stands for change for better
Kaizen philosophy is one that should
always be looking for small and
continuous improvements in the process
deeming cycle or PDCA cycle that is
plan-do-check-act is a process control
and improvement approach propagated by
the famous quality guru Edward Deming it
means you plan for something execute it
check the output and based on the
lessons you act to bring the deviations
under control Kanban is a pull based
management system that originated in
Japan based on just-in-time
JIT inventory management the idea behind
Kanban is to minimize the work in
progress and achieve a smooth flow in
the process from start to finish because
building up inventory only to paper over
the imperfections in the system tends to
hide the problems in the next screen let
us focus on cost of quality cost of
quality is the cost that needs to be
incurred to make a quality product the
sum of all the costs incurred is
ensuring that project conforms to
requirements is cost of quality cost of
quality can be broken down into two
major categories first is the cost of
conformance or the money spent during
the project to avoid failures this can
further be subdivided into prevention
costs which is the cost to
errors like training the team creating
documents on equipment and in time to do
it right the other subdivision is
appraisal costs or the cost for
assessing quality like testing
destructive testing loss and inspections
the second category is the cost of non
conformance it is the money spent during
and after the project because of
failures this is subdivided into
internal failure costs it is the cost of
failures that occur before the product
is released to customers for example
rework and scrap the second subdivision
is external failure costs it is cost
incurred on failures that occur after it
has been released by the team for
example liabilities warranty work and
lost business concept based questions on
cost of quality can be expected in the
exam so please make a note of the
categories of cost of quality let us
look at the project quality management
processes in the next screen there are
three project quality management
processes of which the first process
plan quality management is done as part
of the planning process group the next
process perform quality assurance is
done as part of the executing process
group and the last process control
quality is done as part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
in the next three screens let us look
into each of these processes in detail
the aim of the planned quality
management process is to identify the
relevant requirements or standards to
execute the project effectively to
achieve the desired quality level
quality planning results in the creation
of the quality management plan aim of
the plan quality process is to identify
the standards a standard is an
agreed-upon process to work or achieve a
result a standard can be set from within
the organization or government once all
the standards for the project are
identified the aim of the quality
planning activities involves determining
what work needs to be done
to meet those standards before adhering
to the standards you should question
their relevance with the project
implementing all possible standards
applicable to the project and random
will have cost and time implications let
us look at the inputs to this process
the project management plan provides the
scope schedule and cost baseline all of
which have an implication on the quality
management plan quality plan has a
direct correlation with these it might
also have an impact on and be impacted
by other subsidiary management plans
such as risk management the stakeholders
of the project may have specific
requirements and Meuse about the quality
parameters of the project and these have
to be considered the risk register gives
an indication about the kind of risks
that are inherent in the project and
also those which must be considered
while planning the activities to ensure
quality the requirements for the project
need to be considered for planning
quality related activities because
quality is all about meeting the
requirements in addition to these
enterprise environmental factors and
organization process assets are also
listed as inputs because the standards
can be either from within the
organization or from government or other
external bodies standards from within
the organizations are usually the best
practices learned over a period while
executing numerous projects an example
of government standards can be standards
to control air pollution by the motor
vehicles which vehicle manufacturers
must adhere to to accomplish quality
planning first analyze the benefits
versus the costs of meeting quality
requirements next identify the cost of
quality and confirm if that kind of
investment in quality is justified in
addition to these two benchmarking helps
and analyzing the quality of activities
of similar projects executed in the past
this helps in identifying the particular
quality of output of the pre
his project which in turn acts as a
basis for the current projects quality
planning design of experiments can also
be used for quality planning this is a
statistical way to determine what
variables will improve quality the most
for example in case of manufacturing
doors it can be determined that
increasing the quality of the wood can
have maximum impact on improving the
quality of the door in addition the
seven basic quality tools also known as
the seven QC tools are used to determine
the plan to achieve the desired level of
quality statistical sampling as a tool
becomes relevant whenever the quality
plan cannot be applied to all the
artifacts produced for example if
destructive testing is a requirement
then it can be carried out only on a
sample not on the entire population
statistical sampling helps in arriving
at a representative sample that can give
useful information other additional
tools such as brainstorming force field
analysis etc may be used to determine
the quality management plan for the
project conducting regular meetings is
another important tool the quality
management plan has to be determined in
a collaborative manner by consulting the
team members and other stakeholders
quality management plan in a key output
of this process checklist is a list of
items to inspect for example many of the
office buildings have housekeeping
checklists to ensure that all floors
cabins etc are cleaned checklists are
created during quality planning and used
in quality control metrics our project
specific data that need to be measured
to check the status of the project the
simplest project metrics can be cost and
schedule metrics are also decided during
quality planning and used in quality
control one of the roles of the project
manager is to not only manage the
project but also improve processes in
the project to do
increase the instances of defect which
in turn saves time and money such
activities are listed in the process
improvement plan which eventually
becomes part of project management plan
as a result of the planning activities
other project documents may also get
updated for example the quality
management plan may result in updates to
the cost or resource requirements there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the plan quality management process
so please ensure you have a fair
understanding of the concept before you
take the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the second quality management
process once the quality planning is
over the next process and project
quality management is quality assurance
which involves determining whether the
standards are being met and the
processes are being followed
therefore the input for this process is
the work that has been completed during
the quality planning stage they are
project documents quality management
plan process improvement plan quality
metrics and quality control measurements
let us look at the tools and techniques
used in this process quality audit is
the process to check whether the project
is complying with the organization
policies standards and procedures and
determine whether these policies
standards and procedures used are
efficient and effective so a good audit
not only looks at this compliance but
also for the new lessons learned from
the current project that can help make
the future projects better process
analysis involves using the lessons
learned from doing the initial few work
to make the remaining work more
efficient for example if the project
involves installing a software package
then the lesson learned from the first
few installations can be used to improve
the process on remaining installations
apart from these all the quality
management and control tools such as the
seven basic quality tools will be
relevant to this process the key output
this process is project documents
updates to ensure that if there is any
deviation from agreed standards it is
corrected also if there are any lessons
learned that can help improve the future
projects the organization process assets
get updated this quality assurance may
result in improvement suggestions change
requests may be generated and the
project management plan may need to be
updated understanding characteristics of
quality assurance tools and techniques
may be useful while answering the exam
so prepared this topic well before you
take the exam in the next screen let us
discuss the last process of quality
management the key focus of the quality
control activities is on the correctness
of the work Quality Control helps answer
questions like is everything ok with the
project does the project plan require
changes to successfully execute the
project will the project succeed etc let
us look at the inputs to this process
the quality metrics measurements are
done continuously to see whether the
project quality is improving the project
deliverables are inspected against the
planned checklists quality control acts
upon the deliverables and work
performance data produced in execution
it also refers to the project management
plan for understanding deviations from
the plan it also considers the approved
change requests information from other
project documents and organizational
process assets there are seven popular
tools and techniques used in doing the
quality control activities they are
collectively known as seven basic tools
of quality other relevant tools are
statistical sampling inspection or
testing and review of the approved
changes quality control activities
result in quality control measurements
the verified deliverables validated
changes information about the work being
performed recommended changes and
updates to the organizational process
assets
project management plan and other
project documents in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer Six Sigma is a highly disciplined
process that focuses on developing and
delivering near-perfect products and
services consistently if large volume of
data is plotted over a period of time
you would most probably have a
bell-shaped graph such graphs are also
called normal distribution graph it's
called as normal distribution because
any large volume of data is plotted with
the intent to track variations would
most probably be in a bell-shaped curve
the line corresponding to the top of the
bell curve is the median of the data
sample standard deviation concept is
used to measure how far an e data is
from the mean standard deviation is also
called Sigma one standard deviation from
the mean covers 68% of the data Six
Sigma means six standard deviations from
the mean this would cover 99.999 6 6
percent of the data we will look at an
example of Six Sigma in the following
screen to understand Six Sigma let us
look at an example a tire manufacturing
company produces 100 thousand tires a
day it is not possible to verify each
and every tire manually to ensure it is
defect free instead random sample of
these manufactured tires are taken and
checked for defects assuming that the
thickness of the tires is a parameter to
measure defect any tire that has a
thickness more than or less than 10
millimeters is considered to be
defective now if you measure the actual
thickness of all 100,000 tires
manufactured daily and plot them on a
graph you get normal distribution graph
one standard deviation from the mean
covers 68% of the data meaning if the
thickness of the 100,000 tires are
plotted
the 8000 of them lie within one standard
deviation above or below the mean now if
a company operates at Six Sigma level
they would ensure that all tires that
are up to six standard deviations from
the mean
are defect-free therefore in such cases
you can expect only three defective
tires out of a million tires
manufactured let us now check your
understanding of the topics covered in
this lesson here is a quick recap of
what was covered in this lesson a
project is said to meet quality
expectations when all the project
requirements agreed in the beginning of
the project are met and the resulting
product is usable Quality Management
includes creating and following policies
and procedures that meet the project's
defined quality needs quality planning
defines the standards templates policies
and procedures Quality Assurance
determines if the project is complying
with the policies and procedures quality
control measures specific project
results against standards plan quality
management perform quality assurance and
control quality are the three project
quality management processes seven basic
quality tools are used to plan and
achieve the desired levels of quality at
Six Sigma level there would be only
three defects out of a million units
manufactured with this we come to the
end of this lesson in the next lesson we
will cover project human resource
management
