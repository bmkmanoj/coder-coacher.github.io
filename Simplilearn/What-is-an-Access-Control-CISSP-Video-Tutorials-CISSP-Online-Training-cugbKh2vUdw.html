topic two access control introduction
hello and welcome back to lesson 2 of
the CISSP certification course by simply
learn this lesson is about access
control access control is the second of
the ten domains of the common body of
knowledge cbk the CISSP certification
exam the access control domain outlines
various information system security
options that control access to an
organization's information and data
processing resources in other words this
domain covers mechanisms like
authentication biometrics etc by which a
system grants or evokes the right to
access data or perform an action on an
information system the term access
control basically means that we want to
ensure that people and other entities
like services and processes must be
identified and authenticated before they
are allowed to access the system or
perform any action on the network in
reality access control is an everyday
phenomenon a lock on a car door is
essentially a form of access control a
pin on an ATM system and a bank is
another means of access control the
possession of access control is of prime
importance when persons seek to secure
important confidential or sensitive
information and equipment objectives the
objectives of ISC 2 for this domain is
that the CISSP candidate should fully
understand access control concepts
methodologies and implementation within
centralized and decentralized
environments across the enterprise's
computer systems access control
techniques detective and corrective
measures should be studied to understand
the potential risks vulnerabilities and
exposures agenda before I drill down
more on the concepts and methodologies
of access control
I will first briefly list out the topics
to
be covered in this lesson we will begin
with the overview and definition of
access control and the relevant terms
associated with access control then we
will understand the various types of
access control models techniques
administration methods accountability
and practices finally we will study the
major threat to access control and
countermeasures at the end of this
lesson you'll be able to meet all the
objectives set by the ISC - for this
domain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
