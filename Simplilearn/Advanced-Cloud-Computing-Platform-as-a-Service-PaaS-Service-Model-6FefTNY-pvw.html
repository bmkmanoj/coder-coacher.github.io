understand how we can use the paas
platform to deploy web applications it
is expected that the user must have
knowledge on programming language in
this example let's assume that the user
is using WordPress to develop a web
application WordPress is a free and open
source CMS content management system
which is used for making interactive and
dynamic websites as well as applications
with ease WordPress is made using PHP
and my SQL WordPress package contains
all the dependencies required to create
and run a web application that it is
essential to install the WordPress
environment the paas environment and to
do so the user needs to click on app
store tab under the control panel
on entering the App Store the user must
type WordPress in the search bar then
the user will be able to view the
wordpress setup which is a 1-click
installation process
the user system will display the
wordpress setup wherein he or she needs
to click on install button in order to
start the installation process
in order to continue the user must enter
the name of the application in the app
name field then the user needs to click
on install app button given on the
screen in this example blog is selected
as the application name
on clicking the install app button the
installation process will be initiated
once the installation is successful the
user will be directed to the
applications menu the user will see all
the details of the app then the user
needs to click on on the URL that is
being generated in this example the
generated link is http colon forward
slash forward slash blog dot staccato
hyphen xr2 e dot local this URL is the
local URL which can be accessed by users
system with staccato vm under execution
upon clicking the link the user will be
redirected to the page where he or she
can configure their web application thus
using this example we've learned to use
the paas platform to deploy the web
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
