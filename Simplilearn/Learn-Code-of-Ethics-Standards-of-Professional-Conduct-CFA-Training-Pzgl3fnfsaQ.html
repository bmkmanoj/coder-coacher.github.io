Professional Conduct program all CFA
Institute members and candidates

to comply with the code and standards
the CFA Institute Board of Governors
maintains oversight and responsibility
for the Professional Conduct Program or
PCP which in conjunction with a
disciplinary review committee or DRC is
responsible for enforcement of the code
and standards the CFA Institute by laws
and rules of procedure for proceedings
related to professional conduct commonly
known as rules of procedure form the
basic structure for enforcing the code
and standards the rules of procedure are
based on two primary principles one fair
process to the member and candidate and
to confidentiality of proceedings
Professional Conduct staff under the
direction of the CFA Institute
designated officer conducts a
professional conduct inquiries several
circumstances can prompt an inquiry
first members and candidates must self
disclose on annual Professional Conduct
statement all matters that question
their professional conduct such as
involvement in civil litigation a
criminal investigation or being the
subject of a written complaint second
written complaints received by
Professional Conduct staff can bring
about an investigation third CFA
Institute staff may become aware of
questionable conduct by a member or
candidate through the media or another
public source fourth the CFA examination
Proctor's may submit a violation report
for any candidate suspected to have
compromised his or her professional
conduct during the examination in the
next slide we will discuss how the whole
process is enforced process of
enforcement when an inquiry is initiated
the professional conduct staff conducts
an investigation that may include
requesting a written explanation from
the member or candidate interviewing the
member or candidate complaining parties
and third parties and collecting
documents and records in support of its
investigation the designated officer
upon reviewing the material obtained
during the investigation may conclude
the inquiry with no disciplinary
sanction issue a cautionary letter or
continue proceedings to discipline the
member or candidate if the designated
officer finds that a violation of the
code and standards occurred the
designated officer proposes a
disciplinary sanction which may be
rejected or accepted by the member or
candidate if the member or candidate
does not accept the proposed sanction
the matter is referred to a hearing
panel composed of DRC members and DFA
Institute member volunteers affiliated
with the DRC the Hearing Panel reviews
materials and presentations from the
designated offer
and from the member or candidate the
hearing panels task is to determine
whether a violation of the code and
standards occurred and if so what
sanctions should be imposed sanctions
imposed by CFA Institute may have
significant consequences they include
public censure suspension of membership
and use of the CFA designation and
revocation of the CFA Charter candidates
enrolled in the CFA program who have
violated the code and standards may be
suspended from further participation in
the CFA program CFA Institute standards

and tears from many different countries
is charged with maintaining and
interpreting the code and standards and
ensuring that they are effective the SPC
draws its membership from a broad
spectrum of organizations in the
securities field including brokers
investment advisors banks and insurance
companies in most instances the SPC
members have important supervisory
responsibilities within their firms the
SPC continually evaluates the code and
standards as well as the guidance in the
handbook to ensure that they are
representative of high standards of

changing nature of the investment
profession globally applicable

specific enforceable and testable for
