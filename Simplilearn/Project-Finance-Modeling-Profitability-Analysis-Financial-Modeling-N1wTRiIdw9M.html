1 be part 1 profitability analysis
introduction hello and welcome to the
lesson on profitability analysis of the
financial modeling course by simply
learn this lesson is about profitability
analysis profitability analysis is a
branch of financial analysis that
consists in putting measures of profit
into perspective saying that a company
has made a profit of 1 million dollars
in year 2011 doesn't tell us much about
how good its performance was which
effort was deployed to achieve this
performance or what level of capital the
company operates with to attain such a
profit level profitability analysis shed
some light on those aspects the
presentation we will go over today
should give you a broad overview of the
important aspects of profitability with
some concrete practical examples now
let's move on to our agenda
agenda beside the need for a relative
measure of profit rather than absolute
at a fundamental level investors need a
sound measure of how good an investment
is compared to another one the concept
of internal rates of return called IRR
is such a measure we will discuss this
measure of profitability and see how it
is calculated with a concrete example of
IRR calculation one of the influencing
factors of profitability is costs cost
impact profit directly and for this
reason a good understanding of cost
structure can help to increase
profitability we will go over the
various types of costs and discuss how
cost analysis can be used to optimize
production through the concept of
break-even analysis profitability of a
particular project is usually a fairly
objective measure when a company already
has several projects on its business the
profitability of a new project can
result from synergies and
diversification with existing projects
this is called relative profitability
and we will provide some insight into
this topic we will then get some insight
into decisions modeling via an example
taken from game theory which is a branch
of mathematics dealing with strategic
decisions finally we'll go over various
aspects of profitability via some
examples of investment cash flow
patterns let us now get started with
this exciting presentation the internal
rate of return IRR the internal rate of
return is yes a rate of return that
simply means that it is no difference
from any type of interest rate as it
represents a relative return on money
invested the IRR is used to compare
several investment propositions it could
be thought of as an overall rate of
return on the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
