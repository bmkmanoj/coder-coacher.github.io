the Lean Six Sigma Greenbelt course
offered by simply learned this lesson
will focus on the improve phase of the
DMACC process the improve phase comes
after the analyze phase in the analyze
phase the data was analyzed and some
patterns were found to identify where
the problem lies in this lesson we will
review the improve phase to understand
how to go about the improvements their
validation etc let us start with the
objectives of this lesson in the next
screen after completing this lesson you
will be able to describe the concepts of
design of experiments do we explain the
uses of residuals analysis and box and
Cox transformation technique discuss the
cause and effect matrix and the 5y tool
in root cause analysis explain the lean
and Kaizen techniques let us proceed to
the first topic of this lesson in the
following screen in this topic we will
discuss design of experiments in detail
let us learn about design of experiments
in the following screen design of
experiments or do ii consists of a
series of planned and scientific
experiments that test various input
variables and their eventual impact on
the output variable design of
experiments can be used as a one-stop
alternative for analyzing all
influencing factors to arrive at a
successful model do e is applicable
where multiple input variables known as
factors affect a single response
variable an output variable is the
variable which may get affected due to
multiple input variables do e is
preferred over one factor at a time or
Oh fat experiments because it does not
miss interactions with techniques like
blocking experimental error can be
eliminated the trials should be
randomized to avoid concluding that a
factor is significant with a time at
which it is measured or the sequence
followed may have influenced the
responses result an example of blocking
is highlighted in the table given on the
screen with techniques like replication
many experiments can be conducted to
ensure a robust model we will understand
the concept of design experiments
through an example in the upcoming
screen to understand do we and the main
effects consider the following example
suppose the objective of the experiment
is to achieve uniform part dimensions at
a particular target value to reduce
variations the inputs X or factors that
affect the output are cycle time mold
temperature holding pressure holding
time and material type the process is
the molding process and the output or
the response of the experiment is the
part hardness the components of the do-e
in this example will be described in the
next screen
output response factors levels and
interactions are the components of the
do-e in the given example click each
component to learn more the response
variable is the part hardness and is
measured as a result of the experiment
and is used to judge the effects of
factors factors of this experimental
setup our cycle time mold temperature
holding pressure holding time and
material type factors can be varied and
are called levels the molding
temperature can be set at 600 degrees
Fahrenheit or 700 degrees Fahrenheit
plastic type can be fellers and no
fillers and the material type has two
levels of nylon or acetyl interactions
refer to the degree to which factors
depend on one another some experiments
evaluate the effect of interactions in
the moulding example the interaction
between cycle time and molding
temperature is critical the best level
for time depends on what temperature is
set if the temperature level is higher
the cycle time may have to be decreased
to achieve the same response from the
experiment let us understand full
factorial experiments through an example
full factorial experimental design
contains all combinations of all levels
of all factors this experimental design
ensures no possible treatment
combinations get omitted hence full
factorial designs are often preferred
over other designs the table shown here
is for a two-way heat treatment
experiment there are two factors oven
time x2 and the temperature x1 at which
the material is drawn out of the oven
the output Y of the experiment is the
hardness of the material each of the
factors has two levels this example
illustrates the concepts of main factor
and interaction effects from the table
it is clear that without repetition the
experiment will have four different
outcomes based on the changes
in levels of factors each experimental
trial here is repeated to give a total
of eight values let us now analyze the
mean effect an analysis of the means
helps in understanding how a change in
temperature at which the material is
drawn creates a difference in the
average part hardness this affects the
output and is called the main effect
analysis of means also tells how a
change in oven time creates a difference
in the average part hardness this is
also the main effect analysis of means
explains how interaction between
temperature and time affects the average
part hardness this is known as the
interaction effect let us next
understand the concept of main effect
for calculating the main effect the
means have to be calculated and to
calculate the main effect of draw
temperature the mean of the hardness
values has to be calculated the values
are populated in the corresponding
columns of draw temperatures the columns
have been labeled a1 and a2 the value of
the mean of a 1 is 91 and of a2 is 82
plotting the data on a graph shows that
changing draw temperatures changes the
average hardness similarly we calculate
the mean of hardness values in b1 and b2
the values are 87 and 86 which are
plotted on a graph it can be seen that
changing the oven time does not affect
the average hardness now let us
understand how the interaction between
temperature and time affects the average
part hardness to check out draw
temperature and oven time interact the
mean values are calculated by taking the
repetition response
hence the cell a1 b1 has the mean of the
values 90 and 87 the cell a2 b1 has the
mean of the values 84 and 87 after the
mean values are calculated
they are plotted on a graph the graph
shows that to reduce interactions low
temperature and high oven time
should be selected to have the desired
output of high hardness also called
Brinell hardness if low hardness is the
desired output the experimental setup
should have high draw temperature and
high oven time the ideal case is
represented by the parallel lines which
give the desired output based on the
main effect without being affected by
the interaction between the factors the
parallel lines are shown as a dotted
line the mean of the factors are also
calculated and shown in the small table
in this we will introduce the concept of
runs in design of experiments the
numbers of experiments in a do a setting
is known as runs a full factorial
experiment without replication on five
factors and two levels is 2 raised to
the power of 5 which equals 32 runs a
full factorial experiment with 1
replication on 5 factors and 2 levels is
32 plus 32 which equals 64 runs a half
fractional factorial experiment without
replication on 5 factors and 2 levels is
2 raised to the power of 5 minus 1 which
equals 16 runs a half factorial
experiment with 1 replication on 5
factors and 2 levels is 16 plus 16 which
equals 32 runs the number of
combinations can be determined using the
formula L to the power of F where L is
the number of levels and F is the number
of factors half fractional factorial is
calculated using the formula L to the
power F minus 1 at three levels five
factors full factorial experiment would
amount to 243 trials and half factorial
experiments would require 81 trials the
difference between full factorial and
half fractional factorial experiments
can be seen from the number of runs let
us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in the following screen in this
topic we will discuss root cause
analysis in detail we will learn about
residuals analysis
in the following screen
while performing the regression analysis
of a linear or nonlinear model you will
get a model with the predicted values
some of the data might fit within that
model whereas others may be scattered
across the model equation predicts one
value for y at level X however the
actual value for y observed at that
level of X is different from the
predicted value this difference between
the observed value of the dependent
variable Y and the predicted value is
called residual the formula to calculate
residual is observed value minus
predicted value residuals are considered
to be errors and each data point has one
residual you can validate the
assumptions on random errors as they are
independent exhibit normal distribution
have a constant various Sigma Square for
all the settings of the independent
variables and finally have a mean as 0
in the next line we will continue to
discuss residuals analysis as discussed
in the previous screen while performing
any regression analysis you will observe
that not all the data fits into the
linear model as the linear regression
model is not always appropriate for the
data therefore you should assess the
appropriateness of the model by defining
residuals and examining the residual
plots Avadh assumptions are satisfied
the residuals should randomly vary
around 0 and the spread of the residuals
should be the same throughout the plot
that is no systematic patterns are
observed
remember in residuals analysis both the
sum and the mean of the residuals are 0
residuals and diagnostic statistics
allow you to identify patterns that
either poorly fit in the model with a
strong influence on the estimated
parameters or have a high leverage it is
helpful to interpret these Diagnostics
together to understand any potential
problems with the model in the next
screen we will learn about data
transformation using the box-cox method
the available data
must be transformed when it does not
exhibit the normal distribution box and
 in the year 1964 developed a
procedure for estimating the best
transformation to normality within the
family of power transformation it works
by taking the current wide data and
raising it to the power known as lambda
the formula for transformation of Y is
represented as Y asterisk equals Y to
the power lambda minus 1 the whole
divided by lambda this formula is used
where the value of lambda is not 0 if
the value of lambda is 0 you can use
natural logarithm to transform Y the
family of power transformations can be
used for the following for converting a
data set so that parametric statistics
can be used here lambda is a parameter
to be defined from the data for any
continuous data greater than 0 this will
not work when the values are less than
or equal to 0
transforming specs note that the use of
the transformation does not guarantee
normality in the next screen we will
continue the discussion on data
transformation using box and Cox the
table on the screen shows how the data
can be transformed using lambda the
first column lists down values of lambda
and the second column shows the
transformed value if the value of lambda
is negative 2 it becomes Y to the power
negative 2 after the transformation
which is 1 divided by Y square similarly
if the value of lambda is negative 1
after transformation it becomes Y to the
power of negative 1 which is 1 divided
by Y and so on note that you will use a
different formula when you have the
value of lambda as 0 wherein you will
take natural log of the value Y
similarly transform values are also
shown on the screen click the example
button to know more let us look at an
example of how data transformation is
done using box-cox the difference
between original data and the data
transformed using box-cox is shown on
the screen
figure
one shows the original data plotted on a
histogram here you can see that this
data is abnormal in Figure two the box
and Cox procedure is applied on the
original data and it is transformed you
can see that the data in the second
figure is more normal than Figure one
let us learn about process input and
output variables in the following screen
process improvement has a few
prerequisites before a process can be
improved it must first be measured to
assess the level of improvement required
the first step is to know the input
variables and output variables and check
for any relationship the SI POC map and
the cause-and-effect matrix are very
helpful there are many ways to measure
the key process variables metrics such
as the percent defective operation costs
elapsed time backlog quantity and
documentation errors can be used
critical variables are best identified
by the process owners once they are
identified cause-and-effect tools are
used to establish the relationship
between variables a cause-and-effect
matrix is shown on the screen the key
process input variables have been listed
vertically and the key process output
variables horizontally for each of the
output variables a prioritization number
is assigned numbers which reflect the
effect of each input variable on the
output variable are entered in the
matrix the process output priority is
multiplied with the input variables to
arrive at the results for each input
variable the values are added to
determine the results for each input
variable for process input variable 1
the output variables are three four and
seven with a prioritisation value of 4 7
and 11 respectively
therefore multiplying the output
variables with their corresponding
prioritization numbers and adding those
gives 117 which is around 33% of the
total effect the process input variables
result
are compared to each other to determine
which input variable has the greatest
effect on the output variables click the
cause-and-effect matrix template button
to view another template a sample of the
cause-effect matrix or seee matrix is
shown here the seee matrix gives the
correlation between input and output
variables in this screen we will discuss
the steps to update this seee matrix the
steps are updating the cause and effect
matrix are lists the input variables
vertically under the column process
inputs lists the output variables
horizontally under the numbers 1 to 15
these output variables are important
from the customers perspective one can
refer to either the qfd or the CTQ tree
to know the key output variables ranked
the output variables based on customer
priority
these numbers can also be taken from the
qfd the input variables with the highest
score become the point of focus in the
project another method to establish the
cause effect relation is the cause and
effect diagram this is explained in
detail in the following screen the cause
and effect diagram is used to find the
root cause and the potential solutions
to a problem a cause and effect diagram
breaks down a problem into bite-sized
pieces and also displays the possible
causes in a graphic manner Eunos also
known as the fishbone the 4m or the
Ishikawa diagram it is commonly used to
examine effects or problems to find out
the possible causes and to indicate the
possible areas to collect data the steps
involved in the cause and effect diagram
are all the possible causes of the
problem or affect selected for analysis
are brainstormed the major causes are
classified under the headings of
materials methods machinery and manpower
the cause and effect diagram is drawn
with the problem at the point of the
central access line and the causes on
the diagram
are written under the classifications
chosen the next screen illustrates the
cause and effect diagram with the help
of an example the diagram shows the
cause and effect diagram for the
possible causes of solder defects on a
reflow soldering line this diagram helps
in collecting data and discovering the
root cause during brainstorming the
group looked at all the major causes and
then grouped them under the main
headings under materials causes like
types of solder paste components and the
components Packaging used are considered
the major causes under methods art
technology and preventive maintenance
similarly operator and schedule are
placed under manpower while tools and
oven are grouped under machinery causes
the next screen will discuss another
root cause analysis tool in detail 5y is
one of the tools used to analyze the
root cause of a problem the
responsibility of the root cause
analysis lies with the 5y analysis team
the technical experts have a great
responsibility as the conclusion will be
drawn from the way the drill-down of the
symptoms is carried out the 5y is a very
simple tool as it poses the why question
to every problem till the root cause is
obtained it is important to know that
the 5y tool does not restrict the
interrogation to 5 questions
Y can be asked as many times as required
till the root cause for the problem is
found it can be used along with the
cause and effect diagram the following
screen will explain the process of the
5y technique the process for the 5y
technique is identify the problem and
emphasize the problem statement arrange
for a brainstorming session with the
team including subject matter experts
process owners and team members explain
the purpose and the problem statement
analyze scenarios working backwards from
the problem ask why for the answers of
tande until the
root cause is found normally reasons
like insufficient resources and time
become the root causes if the drill down
in brainstorming is carried out in the
right direction it is often found that
the root cause is related to the process
therefore the occurrence of a problem is
often due to the process and not an
individual or a team in the next screen
we will understand the concept of the
five wide technique with the help of an
example the process for the five wide
technique is identify the problem and
emphasize the problem statement
arrange for a brainstorming session with
the team including subject matter
experts process owners and team members
explain the purpose and the problem
statement analyze scenarios working
backwards from the problem ask why for
the answers obtained until the root
cause is found
normally reasons like insufficient
resources and time become the root
causes if the drill down in
brainstorming is carried out in the
right direction
it is often found that the root cause is
related to the process therefore the
occurrence of a problem is often due to
the process and not an individual or a
team in the next screen we will
understand the concept of the five live
technique with the help of an example in
this topic we will discuss lean tools in
detail let us learn about lean
techniques in the following screen the
eight lean techniques are Kaizen Boca
yoga 5s just in time
Kanban judoka tack time and heijunka
click each technique to know more Kaizen
or continuous improvement is the
building block of all lean production
methods Kaizen philosophy implies that
all incremental changes routinely
applied and sustained over a long period
of time results in significant
improvements the second technique is
poka-yoke at
is also known as mistake proofing it is
good to do it right the first time and
even better to make it impossible to do
it wrong the first time the prompt
received to save the word document
before closing it without saving is an
example of poka-yoke at 5s is a set of
five Japanese words which translate to
sort said in order sign standardize and
sustain this is a simple and yet
powerful tool of lean the sort principle
refers to sorting items according to a
rule the rule could be frequency of use
or time of use after sorting the objects
are set in order the place for
everything is defined and everything is
placed accordingly cleaning of the area
refers to the shine principle the fourth
step requires formation and circulation
of a set of written standards the last
step refers to sustaining the process by
following the standards set earlier 5s
is useful as a framework to create and
maintain the workplace just-in-time or
JIT is another lien technique this
technique philosophizes about producing
the necessary units in the necessary
quantity at the necessary time with the
required quality as an item is removed
from a shelf of a supermart the system
confirms it and automatically sends a
note for replenishment this kind of
technique can be used in an organization
to prevent accumulation of inventory the
fifth technique is known as Kanban which
means signboard in Japanese Kanban
utilizes visual display cards to signal
movement of material between the steps
of a product process this is one of the
examples of visual control in Lane the
next technique is jidoka
it means automation with human touch and
is sometimes known as autonomy ssin
judoka implements supervisory function
in the production line and stops the
process as soon as a defect is
encountered the
says does not start again till the root
cause of the defect is eliminated tack
time is the maximum time in which the
customer demands need to be met for
example a customer needs 100 products
and the company has 420 minutes of
available production time tax time
equals time available divided by demand
in this case the company has a maximum
of four point two minutes per product
this will be the target for the
production line the final technique is
high genka which means production
leveling and smoothing it is a technique
to reduce waste occurring due to
fluctuating customer demand let us
understand the concept of cycle time
reduction in this screen cycle time
reduction refers to the reduction in the
time taken for a complete process
implementing lean techniques reduces
cycle time and releases resources faster
than any other method low cycle time
increases productivity and throughput
lean techniques release resources early
achieving more production with the same
machinery internal and external waste is
reduced and the operational process is
simplified with a decrease in product
damage all these factors help in
satisfying the customer and staying
ahead in competition
the following screen describes the
concept of cycle time reduction through
an example the changes brought by
implementing lean techniques on an
existing process are illustrated in the
given diagram things to be noticed are
number of operators used work allocation
to the operators path or the movement in
the process and flow of the process
notice the changes brought about by
implementing lean techniques on the old
process first the path followed by the
material in between the process is
considerably reduced this decreases the
cycle time for the entire process second
the number of operators is reduced to
three when compared to five in the old
process operator one can now work on
process
one and process for similarly operator
two can work on process two and process
three hence there is an increased
productivity of the operators and the
remaining skilled operators can be used
in some other process or system the next
screen will introduce the concept of
Kaizen and cayenne blitz Kaizen means
good change in Japanese Kaizen is a
continuous improvement method to improve
the functions of an organization the
improvements could be in process
productivity quality technology and
safety it brings in small incremental
changes to the process Kyi's and blitz
is known as Kaizen event or cayenne
workshop if the event is tightly defined
and the scope is evident for
implementation processes can be easily
changed and improved teams could improve
processes through creative
problem-solving methods in structured
workshops over a short timescale the
next screen will provide the differences
between Kaizen and Caillou's end blitz
the differences between Kaizen and Kyi's
and blitz are Kaizen is a method that
brings continuous improvement in the
organization while Kaizen blitz is a
workshop or an event that brings in
change
Kaizen brings in small incremental
changes in the organization there are no
major changes made within the processes
Kyi's and blitz is applied when a rapid
solution is required the Kaizen method
follows a step-by-step process it
standardizes measures and compares the
process with the requirement before
improving it kaya's and blitz plans for
the event execute sit arrives at a
solution and follows it through all the
people of the organization are involved
in Kaizen whereas Kaizen blitz is led by
the top management and others are
invited to participate the
decision-making lies with the upper
management in Kaizen the process is
standardized and measurements are
regularly collected and compared before
the decision is taken
this relatively delays the process of
decision making in Kyi's and blitz
decisions are taken soon and the process
change is wrapped in three to five days
Kaizen is continuous improvement method
whereas the Kaizen blitz is part of the
improving process
Tyson follows PDCA in essence plan do
and check and act for the improvement
process
Kaizen blitz uses PDCA for execution
where the events are planned conducted
decided implemented and followed up the
following screen will elaborate on the
concepts of Kaizen and caius and blitz
through examples Kaizen and Kyi's and
blitz are practiced in many
organizations across the world the
examples of Kaizen and Caius and blitz
method are shown here click each tab to
know more the Toyota Production system
is known for Kyi's and practices in
Toyota if any issue arises in the
production line a line personnel cease
all the production until the issue is
resolved once the solution is
implemented the team resumes the
production cycle a wood window company
in the state of Iowa US uses the Kaizen
blitz method to redesign their shop
floor and replace expensive non flexible
automation with low-cost highly flexible
cellular applications eliminating scraps
reorganizing work areas and reducing
inventory are some of the examples of
quick implementation through Kyi's and
blitz
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson do e are a series of planned
and scientific experiments that test the
impact of independent variables on
dependent variables
during regression analysis of linear or
non-linear model the value for y at
level X is predicted residuals analysis
helps you understand the accuracy of the
analysis of linear or non-linear model
box and Cox procedure is used for
estimating the best transformation to
normality within the family of power
transform
the 5y tool is used to analyze the root
cause of a problem cycle time reduction
Tyson and Kaizen blitz help in improving
processes with this we have come to the
end of this lesson the next lesson will
focus on the control phase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
