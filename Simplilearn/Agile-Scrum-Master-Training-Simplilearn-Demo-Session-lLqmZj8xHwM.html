as I said this session is about eggs
energized scrum master and we are going
to give you a quick introduction to what
this program is all about what is the
curriculum for the program as well as
what the exam for eggs an ASM looks like
very briefly you are going to talk about
what is agile and what is scrum and then
we are going to run a short simulation
of daily stand-up meeting just to give
you a flavor of how the platform works
as well as how to conduct a daily
stand-up meeting okay so let's talk
about X in ASM so xn is a world leader
in different kind of training programs
and certifications related to the
information and communication technology
the ICT industry is if you like the
target audience for this new program
they have is all professionals who are
looking to gain knowledge in the field
of IT and project management okay so
that's what the eggs in the ASM really
talks about there is no specific the
agile scrum master program from eggs in
although there is a mandatory training
module that you have to go through and
of course simple on training will will
help you fulfill that requirement if you
intend to appear for the certification
remember that X in ASM is not what I
would say a beginner certification a
certain amount of familiarity with scrum
energy is assumed although it is not
mandatory that you should have gone
through the eggs in agile scrum
foundation so eggs in also has a
foundation training if you are a
beginner in agile and scrum then it is
recommended that you first do the eggs
in a desk
foundation because ASM is not a beginner
certification okay so this particular
program is basically meant for covering
the curriculum required for X in agile
scrum master program and there are seven
lessons that we cover as part of this
overall program okay so we start off
with the agile way of thinking which is
basically talking about basics of agile
very quickly the principles and
manifesto and the whole philosophy of
agile around being flexible iterative
development incremental development and
the philosophy of continuous improvement
X in ASM unlike these scrum Alliance
certifications requires you to have a
basic understanding not just about scrum
but also about a number of other
methodologies for development like
waterfall or lean extreme programming
crystal dsdm atern and so on and so
forth so we are going to give an
overview of all these other
methodologies and then we are gonna link
the disciplines of DevOps on the one
hand and IT Service Management on the
other hand with agile devops refers to
the discipline where you have for
example configuration management
continuous build and release management
systems continuous integration systems
automated test systems and basically
devops is meant to accelerate the
transition between development into test
environment and then from test
environment into the production
environment okay then we will talk about
scrum events and artifacts where we will
talk about the scrum lifecycle what are
the difference come time box and the
sprint sprint basically is the iteration
that is the basic time box within the
scrum methodology and then we talk about
different events within scrum including
sprint planning reviews and
retrospectives and so on then we talk
about different roles within the scrum
serology which is developer hole product
owner role as well as the scrum master
room okay and as we go along we talk
about what are the do's and don'ts of
being a scrum master or a product owner
and so on so forth okay and then we will
talk about agile estimation planning
monitoring and controlling okay so this
is where we give background about
stories epics what our story cards how
do you go about planning for an overall
product roadmap planning for a release
and planning for a sprint in the context
of planning we will also talk about
estimation we will talk about two units
of estimation which includes story
points and idea Lauer's we will then
talk about two techniques of estimation
which includes planning poker and
affinity estimation and then we talk
about so you have gone through this
planning process how do you then stay in
control of the project comparing actual
versus planned and so on using
techniques such as use of burndown
charts other charts and so on so forth
let me talk about agile and use of
agility on complex projects one of the
criticisms that is leveled at agile is
that agile works very well for small
projects which are having co-located
team is very mature teams and so on so
forth but they don't really scale very
well if the project is complex now that
is a bit of an unfair critique I
personally used agile in different
environments and different projects and
definitely it is possible to work with
agile in the enterprise scale highly
complex project environments however we
need to have certain mechanisms in place
for coordinating the work potentially of
multiple scrum teams this is where
artifacts like scrum of scrums or
product coordination teams comes in to
pick
we talk about what happens when you have
a distributed team how to make agile and
the different ceremonies of agile work
when you have a distributed team not a
specific agile framework which is called
a scaled agile foundation no Safi as it
is abbreviated stands for a framework
that few of the original thinkers behind
the agile methodology have come up with
in order to scale the concept of agility
from an individual product to a program
to an entire portfolio level so that's
the topic that you use in the agile for
complex projects when we talk about
where to apply agile and where to
perhaps not apply agile or apply agile
with a little bit of caution because
projects must have certain
characteristics for agility to be
successful then we refer to different
kinds of tools that are used in agile
methodologies this includes project
management tools as well as tools that
are used for continuous integration
build systems and so on so then finally
we talk about the adoption of agile how
a team which is currently working on a
different methodology transition over to
in iterative and incremental paradigm
what kind of organizational changes are
required of course the team needs to
change the way it works but the
organization as a whole including things
like HR facilities and so on needs to
support the team and introduce the
culture of agility with inea's Asian
because the whole philosophy of agile is
revolving around the notion of
self-organization and self-organized
teams now this doesn't happen out of
thin air it requires time and effort to
achieve the notion of self-organization
so you need to have a support system in
place before you go to that mode okay
the eggs in
our master is a certification that you
can gain by fulfilling two requirements
the first requirement we talked about
that you need to have gone through a
training program from an accredited
training certificate rating organization
so like simply learn is an accredited
organization where you can receive the
training from an accredited trainer okay
and all these training is required to
have case studies it is mandatory for us
as a training provider to provide case
studies so the idea behind this
certification is that it is not you know
run-of-the-mill training where you will
get a bunch of theory and then you pass
an exam and that said it requires you to
have gone through this training which in
turn requires to have God administered
certain case studies like release
planning case study or an estimation
case study and so on for the examination
xyn recommends that you have studied at
least 120 hours it could be slightly
less or slightly more than that
depending upon how much of an exposure
you have to scrum and agile
methodologies the exam itself has a
duration of 90 minutes and the exam
consists of 40 questions these are all
multiple choice questions either three
or four choices are provided and you
have to pick which of those choices is
the correct answer
only one answer is going to be correct
at any point in time if you choose the
correct answer you get one point if you
do not or if you leave the answers
question blank or you choose the wrong
answer then you do not get any points
for that one no minimum passing score is
26 points so you need to get 26 out of
40 correcting the examination in order
to pass the test and then you can claim
to be X in agile scrum master that's
certification there is a free sample
test if you visit this website you will
be able to get more information about
the certification the examination and so
on and so forth
so if you do sign up for simply learns
eggs in ASM program then you will meet
the mandatory training requirement I
mean the entire course there is a
schedule for courses that is announced
on the simply learned website this is
just a demo session right so this demo
session doesn't fulfill the requirement
the actual training which is of duration
of four sessions of four hours each that
will help you satisfy this requirement
so let's move further on so what is
agile remember this is not an
introductory program so we will not
spend a lot of time defining what
agility is and the principles of agile
and so on but the manifesto of agile
which was signed by 17 thought leaders
in the agile software development
industry is an important facet of
introducing the agile methodologies
because this is the basic philosophy so
the very first module as defined by the
eggs in ESM program or curriculum is the
agile way of thinking so you need to
understand when you are using agile
methodologies what is the way in which
you should think and what are the basic
principles that you should use to guide
your behavior as you're working on these
projects so you might have some of you
may have seen the agile manifesto it's a
document that was signed in February of
2001 that's when the whole the world the
word agile came into existence at the a
as a result of that so agile manifesto
says that we value the items on the left
these items more than the items on the
right which are these items so the items
that are on your screen on the left in
blue font are valued more than the items
on the right side which are in the red
form
now let's elaborate that a little so for
example we when you working software
more than comprehensive documentation
now I put a check mark against working
software and a cross mark against
comprehensive documentation that
slightly fallacious because a giant does
not say do not produce documentation
what agile says is that working software
is more important than documentation all
the documentation that you produce no
matter how good it is is useless until
you have working software so the idea is
focus on the software not on the
documentation doesn't mean you don't
produce any documentation but focus more
on the software sometimes people will
challenge that notion and say oh but my
team is jr. that I have newcomer joining
the team all the time and where will
they learn and so on and so forth so all
these objections are valid
I'm not saying again no documentation
but the point is this the best
documentation you can produce for
software is the code itself if the code
is well written if the code is modular
if the code is well commented then that
is the best documentation you can hand
over to a developer if you give him
reams and reams of documentation then
the developer will be lost they won't
know where to look for information but
core every developer can read it is
unambiguous it executes in exactly the
same way every time so focus on the
software not on the documentation right
that's the idea the next assertion is
that responding to change is more
important than following a plan again it
doesn't mean that you don't have to plan
plan is important you need to have a
plan but if you get hung up about oh no
this was my plan and I'm going to do
only this and nothing and that will lead
you to lack of collaboration with the
customer because
every single project every single
development activity will go through a
process of change I have been working in
the industry for 23 years I have not
worked in a single project where there
was no change maybe some of you have
been lucky but I'm sure many of you
would relate to the fact that change is
inevitable the way you should respond to
change is by welcoming them by
addressing the change by making your
methodology flexible that I can absorb
change frequently during the life cycle
you don't want to create a bureaucratic
change management system where you keep
on pushing back on changes even though
the customer really wants them right so
following a plan is important but if the
customer wants a change see how you can
best respond to that the next assertion
is customer collaboration is more
important than contract negotiation of
course contracts are important every
single word that is written in the
contract must be done there is no way
around it because it's signed document
it's a legally tenable document people
can take you to court if you don't do
what is specified in the contract
however more valuable than a signed
contract is the fact that you are
collaborating with the customer the
customer feels that they are driving the
project and they are in control of the
project that you are responding to their
needs you are delivering what they want
and you are solving their problems if
the customer has that confidence then
you can work out and work through any
kind of issues that you encounter
through the contract but if you're not
collaborating with the customer then you
will be stuck with a contract and it
will not take you much further than that
so the final assertion of the agile
manifesto is that individuals and
interactions are more important than
processes and tools and of course you
need to have a process the jail itself
is a process scrum has a bunch of
processes that are defined and you need
to follow them but the best process
is a team of individuals which is
actively interacting with each other
because at the end of the day
development of a product meet a software
product or any other product he's a
creative activity creativity happens
when individuals interact with each
other without being hamstrung by a
specific rigid process process is
valuable only if individuals using the
process find it valuable and if it
fosters interaction between the team
members all right so this is the agile
manifesto whatever you do in the
methodology you have to make sure that
you are in alliance with the agile
manifesto so now I'm gonna introduce the
life cycle of scrum okay so what is
scrum is one of the ways in which you
can work in the agile methodologies
there are many methodologies which can
call themselves agile if you do extreme
programming you are doing agile if you
are doing
dsdm you're doing agile if you are
following crystal you are following
agile so scrum is one of the
instantiations of the agile methodology
scrum is by far the most popular of the
agile methodologies - it is most
prevalent among all the other
development methodologies today none of
it what is known as a product backlog
what is the product backlog it's
basically a collection of items of work
you can go quirements but it need not
always be a requirement for a feature it
may be a bug fix it may be some activity
that you need to perform as a team let's
say a refactoring activity or even a
documentation activity sometimes
whatever items of work that the team can
perform which will be of value to the
customer he is in the product backlog
from the product backlog you go to the
in a given sprint let's say my sprint is
two weeks in the next two weeks which of
these items can I realistically expect
to complete and in that the team relies
on the fact that the backlog is not just
a random collection of items but it is
in priority order I will take the first
item and in the second and then the
third and I asked the team can you do
the fourth or can you not and if they
say yeah we can do another one and
another one and another one but maybe we
will stop at seven that's all we can do
in a two week time box then that the
list of those seven items becomes your
sprint backlog every day within the
sprint then from the planning process
towards the end of the Sprint you
basically work on converting the backlog
into a working increment of the software
in other words what you had in the
beginning is a requirement which is
stated in black and white and what you
should have at the end is a working in
spencey ation of that requirement it
needs to be in the form of working
software so that's the idea behind a
sprint or time box now every day within
the sprint there is a ritual which is
called the daily scrum or the daily
standup the daily scrum is a mechanism
for the team to look at what is going on
in the project how they are working what
they are working on what are their
issues and resolutions those issues and
so on so forth okay so that's the scrum
lifecycle so next we are going to go to
talk talk about the daily scrum
following which we will do a simulation
of the daily scrum and see how it is
done right so just to get a little bit
of learning of executing at least one of
the scrum ceremonies when you do the
actual course and we go through all the
scum ceremonies but we go through the
daily stand-up after I give you a quick
introduction
go ahead mother you add something
oh okay so what I wanted to ask was how
are these spring dates decided oh who
determines and by what metric is it
decided that this will be the length of
the spring all right excellent question
thanks Molly for asking so we talked
about scrum
being made up of multiple sprints each
sprint being of one to four week
duration so my last question if I
understand him correctly and feel free
to disagree if I don't is hoots who
determines whether it is one week or two
weeks or three weeks or four weeks and
the answer is the team determines it how
do they determine it well you start off
you it can be a wild guess in the
beginning I might say okay maybe two
weeks seems like a reasonable time box I
think we can get something meaningful
done in two weeks and it's a short
enough duration that I can demonstrate
it I can get feedback and before I move
to the next sprint so the whole idea
behind an iterative process is that you
do something you get feedback and then
based on the feedback to take the next
step so if one week is too short a
duration for you to showcase anything to
get feedback then probably it is too
short if you like four weeks then take
four weeks but four weeks is pushing it
a little bit most scrum teams prefer
iterations between two to three weeks
two weeks being by far the most common
if you do a survey of all the thousands
of teams that are doing scrum today two
weeks is the most common but that's not
a cast in stone it's up to the team to
figure out but usually no more than four
weeks because that is too long a
duration to go without feedback and
usually not less than a week because
less than a week is very hard to
showcase anything meaningful at the end
of the day all right all right so now
what we are going to do is I am going to
introduce one of the scrum rituals which
is called the daily scrum or the daily
stand-up how the word scrum itself comes
from the sport of rugby
if any of you played rugby or watched
rugby in action before the play starts
before the ball is kicked and you know
the people start running with the ball
or with behind the ball the teams
basically get together in like a huddle
formation standing in a circle
shoulder-to-shoulder you know muttering
something to each other sometimes
yelling something to each other and that
is the scrum that is called us come so
that daily scrum venues when you talk
about the daily stand-up meeting or the
daily scrum that's the picture that you
should imagine in your mind the entire
team it could be a sports team it could
be a team of software developers really
doesn't matter standing
shoulder-to-shoulder first of all
standing so that's why it's called a
stand-up meeting he's not people who sit
down and then talk at leisure it's a
standing meeting shoulder-to-shoulder
because it's a meeting that is meant
more than anything else to foster the
team environment to be a team it's a
meeting if I were to borrow a definition
of you know of the people for the people
by the people is what a democracy is
that they come he's a meeting of the
team by the team and for the tea now
what happens in the meeting first of all
every member of the team is supposed to
attend it
secondly the meeting happens on every
working day it's a holiday it doesn't
happen you don't have to worry that you
know oh my god scrum is going to eat
into my weekend time King Day is a time
for the daily standard you can pick
whatever time of the day you have which
is convenient to everybody some of the
teams that I know started first thing in
the morning let's say 9:00 a.m. is the
report to work and they start this day
with the daily standup other teams
prefer like 11:00 a.m. so people have
had a chance to come in and have a bit
of a snack have a bit of a quite casual
chat finish up something that they
started working on yesterday but I would
get computers 11 o'clock is when they
prefer it allows Oh
so time for the stragglers were always
late and there might be some in your
team as well some other teams which are
distributed they prefer a time which is
in the afternoon or the evening so that
the remote team members can also attend
so if I have a team in India and the UK
for example 3 p.m. is maybe a good time
because by that time the UK team has
come in and the India team is also
during the working out if you have India
and u.s. becomes a little bit more
challenging but again you pick whatever
time works for you the meeting is
supposed to be 15 minutes or less no
more than 15 minutes and we only talk
about three points only talk about these
three points what did i do yesterday
what will I do today and what are my
blocking issues all of these has to be
in the context of the project now
yesterday maybe I played a football with
my son or I watched the t20 game between
India and Sri Lanka very interesting
information but not relevant for the
project so it should not this is not a
forum for that yes you can have banter
and jokes but 15 minutes the entire team
is in attendance you don't want to waste
everybody's time so focus on only these
three items and nothing other than these
three items okay so that's what the
meeting is about so here is what we are
going to do now we are going to simulate
a daily stand up in other words I am
going to request each one of you to
describe what you did yesterday what you
are going to do today and what are your
blocking okay it need not be related to
a specific project you can say what you
did in your day-to-day work or you can
say what you did and if you were on a
holiday what you did at at home the idea
is to get into the rhythm of quickly
giving you an update which is relevant
to every one of us so let us imagine all
of us are working on a fictitious
project together and I'm going to
describe what I did for the project
let's say our project
is that we are all interested in the
eggs in agile scrum master and
eventually we are going to go in for
this certification and therefore we are
going to say something that points to
that task so let me go first and I'm
going to go through my updates in this
specific sequence so yesterday
I prepared the slide deck for today's
presentation there we're a fluor typos
and I have to correct them my sort of
proof read them and I did a bit of
rehearsal I like to rehearse every slide
that I'm going to talk about today I am
going to be delivering this lecture to
this group of people very interesting
group of people who are going to have a
demo session hopefully some of them will
join the planing program which is
starting on February 27th there are no
blocking issues as of now at this point
the only slight issue that I have is
there I'm new to this
Citrix platform that is being used so
I'm slightly anxious how that is going
to work for me but hopefully it should
not be much of a hindrance at this
moment I'm not blocked as such alright
so that was my update now let me I'm
gonna call out somebody's name in turn
and what I would request you is give an
update doesn't matter whether it's what
exactly it is as long as it is following
this pattern I'll let go ahead
Shashikant you want to provide your
update through the chat box or the
questions window all right so I'm gonna
start reading Shashi Kahn's update as he
striping so yesterday Shashikant went
through the simplement portal where he
found the agile scrum demo schedule so
very quickly let me summarize this
activity so one of the things is that
the daily stand-up meeting is a short
meeting it has to be kept to the point
so we saw for example Shashi Kahn's
update very to the very you know precise
to the point it is very important for
you to go through in exactly this
sequence and cover all these items
sometimes team members hesitate to bring
up blocking issues that is not advisable
because a sprint is a very short time
window two weeks or less to develop
something to test it and bring it was it
where it is near releasable or at least
demo worthy is challenging if you are
blocked for whatever reasons that
something's not working on your machine
is a technical issue you are trying to
solve not able to get pointers to it or
you waiting for somebody else to do
their work or you are dependency that
issue even if it is blocking you for
half a day or a day can be critical make
a difference between completion of the
work for the Sprint or not non
completion of the work so be proactive
and bringing up those issues now when
somebody does bring up a blocking issue
what's supposed to happen then who's
supposed to take action on this who is
primarily responsible for removing the
blocking issues that the team brings up
in the stand up meeting is it the team
member himself or herself is it the
project manager the line manager
customer who's supposed to be solving
these blocking issues grub master is the
one who is primarily responsible for
removing blocking issues now it would be
anything like anybody can bring up any
issue that I may be blocked because I'm
having a medical issue I may be blocked
because of my daycare is not working and
therefore I have to stay at home can't
come come into work or it could be a
technical issue now scrum master is not
a Superman or superwoman that can have
answers to all of these questions well
what the scrum master needs to have is
the interest first of all the motivation
and the resourceful Ness to find out who
can solve these issues so if my issue is
a technical issues now master will go
stalking around the organization who can
solve my technical issue they will
contact the technical gurus the
architects and
and call them up and say can you please
help my team member my team member is
stuck and this is causing a big issue in
our sprint if you would spare five
minutes or 10 minutes of your time I
would be very grateful they will do
whatever it takes to get technical
assistance if your issue was a personal
issue then they will talk to you about
how we can get around a personal issue
they would ask if they can give me a
laptop I can work from home if I have a
daycare issue they will check if I have
internet connection if they can organise
an internet temporary internet
connection for me that I can be
productive while working from home
or if nothing is possible they will ask
the other team members if they can
shoulder some of the workload for the
time being so that the whole team is not
blocked because I am NOT able to come to
work right so the scrum master needs to
be extremely resourceful to have
tremendous amount of soft skills in
order to get around the blocking issues
that said it is not only up to the scrum
master to solve those issues sometimes I
may bring up a technical issue I got
this error while I was working on this
program the error code was one four zero
three I just couldn't understand head or
tail of it I don't understand what is
happening now somebody else in the team
might know what that means and they
might say hold on a minute
I have seen that error code contact me
after the stand-up meeting and I will
work with you and then they will come
back and take me to one side and say
look one four zero three stands for no
records found it's commonly returned in
an Oracle database when you fire a query
which does not fetch any recovered or
when you try to update something and it
does not update a single record so it is
a warning it's not a fatal error if your
query is written such that it doesn't
return anything it may not be a problem
so maybe if it's a technical issue or
it's an issue that somebody else can
solve they should raise their hand and
say okay I can work with you on that but
the discussion about the solution has to
be offline it cannot be in the stand up
why not
because that's an issue then between you
and the person you are trying to help
you
want to waste the time for the whole
team take those issues offline but a
wonderful thing about the daily scrum
and the daily stand-up is that all these
issues that team members are having
become known to everybody else every
single team member is in attendance
everybody knows what everybody else is
doing everybody knows what they did
yesterday what they are doing today and
everybody knows what they are stuck so
as a self-organized self-managed team
which is highly motivated trying to do
the best product development were
possible the expectation is that they
will help each other out they will do
what it takes to unblock their teammates
if nobody else in the scrum master it is
their role to unblock the team members
