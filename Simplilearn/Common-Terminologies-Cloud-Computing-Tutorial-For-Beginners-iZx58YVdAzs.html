some identity related terms to remember
are as follows identity it is the means
by which a user device or code entity is
identified as unique identifier this is
another term related to identity
referring the means by which the
identity is asserted another identity
related term is entity it refers to
types which have an identity to users
devices codes entitlement the process of
managing privileges to identities and
related attributes Federation is the
term used for the connection between two
identity repositories the term persona
is identity plus attributes that provide
context to the environment the entity is
operating within
attributes they are facets of an
identity
in this slide we will get introduced to
identity in cloud environment with
industry scaling from small-scale to
global levels with different types cloud
deployment models identity management
has become a major issue in cloud using
an identity for all entities is
considered as a decision to mitigate
risk and improve the security aspects of
the cloud systems while implementing
identity for cloud deployment some
factors have to be taken into
consideration one factor is the strength
with which an identity can be asserted
another factor is the strength with
which an attribute can be asserted the
third factor is the instances during
which a transient identity is sufficient
last factor is the instances where
pseudo anonymity is needed in the next
slide we will learn about identity
architecture for cloud cloud environment
allows great flexibility in an
organization whether it is deployed as a
private cloud or external public cloud
within an organization in a cloud
environment identity varies depending
upon the type of deployment for instance
if it is internal or parameterize it has
the ability to accept multiple sources
of identity and attributes access
management depending on the business
security requirements and type of cloud
model should govern access to the
network layer system layer application
layer process layer and data layer in
the next slide we will understand
identity federation Federation is
basically the use of saml or security
assertion markup language for offering
portability to varied security domains
by means of a federated gateway
organizations extend their des
environment to saml assertions there are
other organizations which consume saml
assertions from an identity service
federation standards are widely used in
SAS for the purpose of identity
federation and access control however
there are no equivalent standards for is
or pass organizations that use
privileged identity management
pil tools tools for managing identity of
privileged users within an organization
or outside should explore their usage in
cloud environments as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
