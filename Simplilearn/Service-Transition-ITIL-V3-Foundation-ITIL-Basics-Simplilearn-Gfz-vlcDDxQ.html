or changed to services which are ready
for customer release meet functional and
technical criteria the purpose of
service transition is to ensure new or
modified services meet the business
expectations documented in the service
strategy and service design stages of
the lifecycle service transition also
helps move services from design to
operation without affecting ongoing
services objectives the objective of
service transition is to plan and manage
changes in service changes effectively
manage risk associated with new or
modified services deploy service
releases into supported environments
successfully set the correct
expectations on performance and use of
new or changed services and provide
quality information on services and
service assets effective service
transition can significantly improve a
service providers ability to handle
effectively high volumes of change and
releases across its customer base other
benefits include increased success rate
of changes and releases accurate
estimations of service levels and
warranties and less variation of costs
and other resources against those
estimated in budgets scope the scope of
service transition includes the
development and improvement of
capabilities for the transition of new
and modified services into supported
environments and service retirement and
transfer of services from one service
provider to another value to business
effective service transition ensures
that the new or change services are
better aligned with the customer's
business operation service transition
adds value to the business in the
following ways the business develops the
capacity to respond quickly and
adequately to changes in the market
changes in the business are well-managed
the business experiences higher number
of successful changes and releases there
is better compliance to business and
governing rules there is less deviation
between planned budgets and actual costs
there is better insight into risks that
may occur during and after the input of
a service in the next screen we will
discuss configuration item or CI a
configuration item or CI is any
component that has to be managed for
delivering an IT service information
about each CI is recorded in a
configuration record within the
configuration management system or CMS
the record is maintained throughout its
lifecycle with configuration management
the record should include a unique
identifier and the location of the CI C
is can be IT services hardware software
buildings people or formal documentation
such as processed documentation and
service level agreements CIS are
controlled by configuration management
and are subject to formal change control
in the next screen we will focus on the
configuration management system or CMS a
CMS is a set of tools and databases that
are used to manage the configuration
data of an IT service provider the CMS
stores information about all
configuration items the CI maybe an
entire service or any component stored
in one or more configuration management
databases the CMS includes information
about incidents problems no errors
changes and releases and data on
employees suppliers locations business
units customers and users the CMS stores
attributes or any other required
information about the CI it also stores
the relationships between CIS sea-ice
and incident and to change records the
CMS has multiple layers including data
sources and tools information
integration knowledge processing tools
such as scorecards dashboards and
presentations the tools included in the
C
mess help to collect store manage update
and present data about all configuration
items and their relationships the CMS is
maintained by configuration management
and is used by all ITSM processes CMS
comprises physical data stores which can
be integrated together let us consider a
server to be a CI the CMS will have data
related to that server including
incidents problems owner supplier
location business processes the server
supports and so on hi there if you liked
