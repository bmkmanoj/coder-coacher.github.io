analysis test design and test
implementation these processes are used
to create and implement the tests needed
to be executed to meet the test
objectives let us take a closer look at
what activities are carried out in each
phase of test development process test
analysis involves defining the test
approach identifying the right test
techniques to be used to develop the
test cases these tasks should be
conducted keeping in mind the test
objectives and the risk associated in
testing once we define test conditions
we should be able to link them back to
their sources in the test basis and this
is called traceability we also need to
come up with test approach which best
suits our testable items we also need to
identify test techniques in order to
select the test data combination that we
can test however effective the test
technique is there is always a risk
associated when few test cases or test
combination are not tested one needs to
be aware of the risk associated in
eliminating those test condition or test
case test design involves creation of
test cases and test data test conditions
on their own can be rather vague
covering quite a large range of
possibilities
as mentioned earlier test conditions
just mentioned want to test these do not
include how to test however test cases
are more specific as we need detailed
specific inputs and detailed expected
results test cases define how to test
will be executed and therefore how to
test condition
we'll be tested note that one test case
can be used to execute a number of test
conditions test cases can be documented
as described in the I Triple E eight to
nine standard this standard is a good
starting point for learning how to
document test cases the standard
contains test case specification
identifier test items input
specifications output specifications
environmental needs special procedure
requirements and insert case
dependencies one of the most important
aspects of a test is that it assesses
that the system does what it is supposed
to do in order to know what the system
should do we need to have a source of
information about the correct behavior
of the system this source is often
called an Oracle or test Oracle this has
nothing to do with databases or
companies that make them it comes from
the ancient Greek Oracle at Delphi who
supposedly could predict the future with
unerring accuracy test implementation is
about defining test procedures which is
to group the test cases in a sensible
way for executing them and to specify
the sequential steps that need to be
done to run the test some test cases may
need to be run in a particular sequence
writing the test procedure is another
opportunity to prioritize the tests to
ensure that the best testing is done in
the time available a good rule of thumb
is to find the scary stuff first however
the definition of what is scary
depends on the business system or
project test implementation also
involves preparing test execution
schedule which define want tests are to
be carried out at what point of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
