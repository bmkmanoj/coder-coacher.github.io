attending like to take and thank you for
taking some time to listen to me speak
and think you has simply learned for
inviting me to speak to this audience
today I value the opportunity so I'd
like share a few things with you just
about myself by way of introduction
first I come from a long line of farmers
my father my father's father my mother
my her father we're all farmers my
family grew soybeans in the state of
Kansas in the United States back at a
time when nobody in the United States
even knew what a soybean was I'm
practically it wasn't a big staple or
food supply at that time and even though
I haven't exactly stayed precisely with
that tradition I have spent a lot of my
time recently in the seeding weeding
gardening and growing of agile teams a
little more than 10 years of the of my
recent time and have all of the all of
the scars to show it recent a scrum
master I trained as a scrum master you
often find yourself at the end of a
smoking barrel the other gun is held by
management and I I appreciate his
sentiment after having done this for
many years so as it says up here I've
him right now principal consultant with
thought works and also we've been with
scrum alliance for quite a few years and
doing a lot of training of scrum masters
product owners the sort of thing and a
lot of coaching in the industry and I've
even though I've worked with anything
from very very small teams to very very
large teams distributed across many
countries and many continents many time
zones I've recently developed a
particular expertise in bringing these
lightweight governance ideas and
execution of management techniques in
two very large enterprise heavily
regulated heavily compliance driven
environments and while that is just as
difficult as it sounds it is also very
rewarding to help bring things like
financial promise and national security
and
saving medical devices to millions and
millions of people at faster paces with
better results and better better track
records over time so there are
definitely many challenges working in
the in those large realms but I've found
it very very helpful and though I may
not to be a farmer anymore or my family
where my family was I certainly study at
the feet now of my wife of 24 years when
it comes to matters of growing plants
and creating your beautiful landscapes
but i would like to hope that i can
share some thoughts on growing
self-organizing teams this afternoon
that you might find valuable and that's
my that's my hope so let me let me give
it a try so first I'd like to talk about
the overall backdrop I'm an agile team
and a self-organizing scrum team does
not exist by itself it's part of an
entire ecosystem at can't doesn't
survive just in a vacuum so let's start
at the at the lower left-hand corner
here of this chart which I basically
lifted from a talk that Esther Derby
gave many years ago she's a co-founder
of scrum alliance we have you know bae
act we all act and behave in certain
ways we have certain behaviors we show
up at certain times at our jobs we work
at a certain level of dedication you
know we take so many tea breaks per day
and and we leave at a certain time and
based on this behavior and these actions
that we take our organizations will put
together structures in the systems to
try and you know mold that behavior into
something useful and valuable to our
customers and our consumers and from
those systems and structures our
employees and team members they learn
what do we really value and what do we
really believe when your first day you
show up on your new job they hand you
that little placard that says here's our
values and here's our beliefs and this
is what was important to us what do you
do with that thing when you first get to
your desk you throw it in the bottom of
the door you don't look at it again
until your last day at that company when
you're getting digging it back out and
packing yourself to go to your next job
right that's not where you learn what's
important to accompany the place where
you learn what's important to your
organization is by observing who gets
rewarded who gets punished who gets sent
on a cruise to the Caribbean and who
gets taken out behind the woodshed and
beaten with a stick that that's what
really teaches you um you know what's
important here how do I thrive here how
do I get by here
and I very very often see organizations
they say well if we could just get those
darn people to act differently then then
we'd be agile then it would be good
around here you know then then we be
able to get something done if we could
just get those people to act right when
really you have to stand this entire
proposition on its head to make any
difference in your organization's you
have to say if these are the things that
we value and these are the things that
we truly believe then we will put
together these alternate structures and
systems that are not like the structures
and systems we had before and then
everyone will start to behave
differently so we cannot expect to have
the same metrics the same measurements
the same kind of backdrop that we had
before and expect everyone to just
automatically self-organize and in come
together and do the things that we'd
like them to do so that's one of the
challenges that we have to overcome in
addition to the the scrum master
training and product owner training that
I offer and I also often do executive
leadership summits and one of my main
message is there is that you have to
practice leadership on a cloudy day and
what I mean by that is the first time
you're agile team exhibits some
ownership and they take a decision on
their own and it goes fantastically well
and you say good job that's what I want
you to do they forget that in 15 seconds
but the first time that they make a
decision and take ownership over
something and do it on their own and
it's an absolute steaming disaster
that's when they pay attention that's
the day when they learn what's really
important to you what's not important to
you and what kind of an organization or
they really affiliated with on that day
it is extremely important to tell the
team excellent i'm glad you took
ownership of that decision that's what i
want you to do we need to work together
to achieve better outcomes but you're on
the right path and i want you to stay on
this path and give them encouragement
that's the day they'll remember what you
really believe and what's really
important to you you come back that day
and say everybody has to work 80 hours
and be here Saturday and Sunday and fix
this idiot to fix this terrible mess or
you congratulate them for taking the
decision regrettably it didn't work out
the way we wanted to let's work towards
better outcomes next time that's the
right type of messaging that we would
like to see from from leadership teams
and without that we can't really expect
the teams to change or do anything
differently or or really begin to
self-organize hmm so I'll frame this up
in terms of scrum a bit because that's
mostly
my background what I've been recently
doing I see a lot of a new scrum masters
that hope that believe that their job is
to control that their job is to lead and
they step into a traditional leadership
role and they assume authority on behalf
of the team and they presume that you're
they're the ones who need to exhibit you
know a strong traditional leadership
role when nothing could really be
further from the truth I see a common
phenomenon where new either agile
project managers or scrum masters will
step in exert traditional leadership
style and then wonder why is my team not
self-organizing they're telling him the
step left step right step left upright
and then being upset that the team
doesn't self-organize and doesn't mature
and doesn't exhibit ownership over
itself even though they're being told in
lockstep you know what to do every step
of the way and those folks who are well
served to remember the old saying that
responsibility is taken not given and as
long as the scrum master continues to
take responsibility for the team then
the team's not going to take
responsibility for itself so if if
leadership is not really that role them
then what is it they're not there to to
lead and to point the way to the team
they're really there much more to create
the right environment to make sure that
all of these success indicators are
there to remove obstacles you think of
themselves as clearing the way you know
straightening the path ahead of a team
out in front they're kind of out in the
in the jungle you know clearing the path
and removing the stones and chopping
down the the large trees making sure the
team has a smooth and easy path ahead of
them and and in this way these are much
more of the functionality that that that
rule should take on it's not about your
leading it's not about I'm telling the
team exactly where to go in which
direction to go it's about making sure
that they have the ability to go the
direction that they would like to go and
encouraging them to do so mmm so it is
pretty often that people forget the the
principle that an agile leader needs to
be a servant leader that you need to be
willing to step into the breach off
and take the sticks and stones you know
from from management or from senior
leadership that of that are that are
coming down and make sure you create the
conditions that the team needs to
succeed if you're the one who takes
responsibility if you're the one who
takes accountability if you're the one
who exercises authority you just removed
all of that from the team you've just
taken away their own sense of self
responsibility and their own sense of
self accountability and remove their own
you sense of authority over themselves
there's there they exist in this very
strong sort of a parent-child
relationship between team members and
project managers or managers or you
would scrum masters in many cases where
that's not what we want you know our
team members are in the habit of
routinely running to mommy daddy project
manager running to mommy daddy scrum
master you mean whenever there's a
problem and we just kind of hand out all
the answers I said oh no it's okay go
this way goes this way go this way I'm
another your common thing that I say
very often is the four most important
words you can remember as a leader or a
leadership position within an agile
adoption effort is what do you think I
mean even when you know the answer even
when you know in your mind you know in
your heart of hearts with the direction
is that they need to take um it's really
important not to necessarily get in the
habit of just giving out the answer
every time that you want to cultivate an
attitude of problem-solving of you know
encouraging them to utilize their own
capabilities to come up with the correct
answers in the correct path even when
you know you know like I said in your
heart of hearts what the right answer is
if you just start handing out the answer
is right and left every time they come
running to mommy daddy leader you know
then they'll continue to come running to
mommy daddy leader and they won't
continue to grow and they won't start to
self-organize and they'll continue to
expect you to have responsibility
accountability and authority and they
want and they won't take those things
for their own over their own you know
destiny so to speak so there's a very
old saying that if you can explain to me
and tell me how you're going to measure
me that I will predict perfectly exactly
how I'm going to behave and then if I
know exactly what by what by what time
ettrick I'll be measured then i can
predict exactly what i'm going to do
it's a pretty often that we think that
collecting more data is harmless but we
have to remember
or that by everything that we measure we
are also sending a value statement every
time we take a metric or take a
measurement or to collect a sample of
data we are sending the message to all
of the people in that environment this
is the thing that I value this is the
thing which is important to me and I
thought works about eighty percent of
our business is hard delivery projects
and about twenty is coaching consulting
training type stuff when I'm in pure
consulting mode and I'm not exaggerating
i spend about fifty percent of my time
identifying and talking people out of
measuring things that actually provides
incentive to bad behaviors or things
that i don't want that the teams to do
because of unintended consequences
because of the unintended consequences
of measurement everybody will try and
game a metric in some way or another
everybody wants that the gold star right
so we'll we'll try and do what we can to
look good in terms of whatever
measurement is put out there and when we
do that we end up behaving in ways that
were not anticipated by the metrics I've
only come up with with one that actually
gets you to behave the way I would like
you to when you're trying to game the
metric in the first place hmmm that's a
slightly different story so there's a
couple of stories of unintended
consequences I like to share briefly
when I'm with you you may have run into
this first one if you've had read didn't
done much reading of any of the scrum
literature this was a story from Canon
in their photocopier business when they
noticed that their field repair times
we're taking much much longer than the
book said they should take if field tech
would take four hours to do a repair
when the book said it should take one
hour and they try to optimize that yeah
there was a very highly executive Lee
sponsored drive to get these two numbers
into alignment to get these things to
come together so they put together
promotions they put together incentives
and they particular unit reward packages
to get these numbers in the perfect
alignment and regional managers and
district managers and managers and field
techs were all rewarded for for doing
this and in the time of about six months
they were wildly successful the numbers
came perfectly together exactly as they
should have and their costs also
exploded absolutely through the roof and
that gave them an opportunity to step
back scratch their heads and think wow
what just happened here so when they
didn't further analysis they found out
that their field techs were extremely
tremely knowledgeable about these
machines they knew them inside and out
so they would show up to a bow
functioning machine pull out an assembly
break down at the four or five sub
assemblies get down to the one little
roller bearing that was malfunctioning
they replaced that one little tiny piece
that was malfunctioning reassemble the
sub assemblies but the whole simply back
together put it in block the Machine up
and go away the way the books were
written where that you should show up
unlock the machine Chuck the entire
assembly put in a new and locked machine
back together grand go so that's what
they started doing and you can imagine
the ramifications on their warehousing
on their logistics on the fulfillment
the whole supply chain just bloated the
cost of all of that excess inventory and
the excess shipping not to mention that
the energy wasted was much much higher
than the cost of those few extra hours
on behalf of the two field technicians
so they were attempting to optimize the
wrong thing and I think we're very often
guilty of that in our organizations
today how the similar story comes from
it's very very fancy a very upscale
neighborhood in Dade County in Florida
I'm not not my part of that of the
United States but this is a very very
rich very very wealthy neighborhood
where you routinely see you know
Ferraris Jaguars Maseratis driving
around in the street and the people that
live in these multi-billion dollar homes
and drive these multi-million dollar
cars were very upset that the garbage
trucks were still on the street after
eleven o'clock in the morning if you're
driving around in a Maserati convertible
you don't want to go behind a garbage
truck either probably but I don't know
from personal experience um but they had
this so they lobbied the City Council
they lobbied to local you know waste
collection departments and they got a
reality hey gotta fix this problem this
is terrible this is terrible and we also
don't want them starting at midnight and
interrupting or late night parties so we
don't want them on the streets and they
afternoon either so we've gotta figure
out way to do this so they put together
similarly incentive package they started
to measure performance they tried to
incentives and the teams to to get their
job done faster they also were very
successful they got the collection done
and got the garbage trucks off the
street by 11am at the same time the
incidence of traffic
accidents involving commuter vehicles
and trash trucks went up 35% so the same
people driving around their Ferraris and
Maseratis complaining about the trash
trucks we're now getting hit by the
trash trucks as they ran stop signs as
they sped as they cut corners as they
were hurrying her incurring you know to
get where they were supposed to go to
meet the productivity goals that have
been put out there for them so just a
couple of cautionary tales here about
how we should be very very careful what
we measure I encourage everyone think
once think twice think three times
before you even a cert that you want to
collect a piece of data that you want to
collect a measurement that you're going
to gain something from from this bit of
information because what you what you
indeed gain from that might be far less
valuable than what you lose or the type
of behaviors that you're actually
providing an incentive for so be very
cautious in determining what you're
going to measure so one example that
comes very quickly and kind of clearly
time out to my mind is the issue within
scrum of the daily burn down chart which
I've started referring to as the burnout
chart because of what a lot of an
experienced or green people will will do
with them so every now and then you can
use this kind of day-to-day analysis of
time spent to preempt or find
performance issues find bottlenecks
there's really only one type of lesson
you learn from this type of analysis and
it usually is that your two single
threaded on one particular skill set
within the team but it does require that
you ask the team members to essentially
re estimate how much work is remaining
on every single task they're performing
every single day you're kind of like the
little impatient kid in the back of a
car saying are we there yet are we there
yet are we there yet are we there yet
and that's not the role that we're
supposed to play either we're not to be
like that you're the little dogs nipping
at their heels or the angry kid in that
and the backseat either but just reading
the literature and from introductory
training the the notion of ideal
developer days ideal developer hours the
sort of thing can lead a lot of people
new to this role to assume that by job
is to micromanage my job is to find out
every single day exactly how many hours
are left on every single task and so I
can draw this chart in a nice smooth
fashion but it actually has a very
negative impact on team members in my
I don't believe that they then feel like
their commitment is being honored I
don't feel like they're they feel
respected they don't feel trusted in
this kind of an environment and I think
that we are much much better served by
asking ourselves what are we delivering
as opposed to what is our overall
activity it's it's easy to get wound
around the axle so to speak measuring
activity how many times time was spent
how many hours were burnt how long was
early in the office where were the cars
in the parking lot at 6am or they still
there at 6pm people look at all kinds of
silly things when they're trying to
optimize activity when we really should
be looking at delivery I've taken to not
even asking the question how much time
is left anymore and I simply measure
state transitions in my workflow as what
I work moves as required to move through
the overall system and never ask anyone
to re-estimate anything and I find that
I have teams that are maturing and
growing and taking responsibility faster
in that kind of an environment than they
are when I'm very tightly managing and
measuring and looking at every new last
little hour at every last little detail
so if we build an organization that
tries to optimize itself on utilization
then we end up with teams that are very
highly utilized where everyone is busy
busy busy all the time and they may or
may not ever deliver anything but
they're all really busy all the time and
they work a lot of hours if we put
together our vision run and diagnostic
taxonomy zand regimes based on delivery
rather than activity then we build teams
which deliver and they're not
necessarily busy busy busy all the time
they're not necessarily 100% utilized
but they get high value track records of
delivering on your real value to our
customers on a very regular basis so the
tail end of my story here is that even
though we really want leadership to
exhibit your ship more on the cloudy
days then on the sunny days we've got to
remember that when we prepare the ground
successfully for change when we send the
right statements about the values that
we have and we change our own hearts and
our own minds about the value of the
team and we send the message not just
the words that we say but through the
metrics that we collect through the data
that we analyze about
is important to us that the thing
important to us is that as a team that
you grow that you mature that you take
more responsibility for yourselves it's
not just do we get more widgets faster
it's do we get a team which is more
capable of determining how to build the
widget faster and steer themselves in
the right direction without a bunch of
micromanagement when we stop measuring
the wrong things and we stop
micromanaging and we stop distrusting
then the teams know that the thing we
truly honestly value it's their own
growth in their own self organization
and only at that time can we really
expect them to grow and mature and take
more responsibility and more authority
over themselves as long as we continue
to measure the wrong things we send the
wrong messages and then wonder why are
those darn people not acting right well
they're not acting right because we're
giving them all the wrong message is
very very often when we do that and stop
the micromanagement stop the distrusting
stop the the over analysis of the wrong
things then we can expect our teams to
begin to come together to grow up and to
start acting like adults and taking
responsibility for the things that we
want them to do instead of instead of
continuing to just go lockstep and do
what mommy daddy leader told them to do
that's not everything that I had
prepared today does anybody have any
comments or any questions or any any
concerns about anything that I've that
I've mentioned in my talk this afternoon
sure what do we got here thank you for
the microphone uh hi I'm prio from Bosch
nice to meet you um I just have one
question when it comes to agile and for
building self motivating teams it does
it also work with new college graduates
especially in a country like India where
ncg could be as young as 22 years old
sure how how do we build in this kind of
self-organization you know that
sentiment of self-organization into such
a young person sure that's an excellent
question I mean it does come up fairly
often it's a valid criticism of scrum
and agile I think that it does require a
certain level of seniority among the
team members that you cannot throw a
bunch of bright-eyed freshers into a
scrum team and say hey self-organized
come up with numbers and architecture
come up with an inversion database
architecture do you do your best thing
right
and expect anything good to come of that
it absolutely will not but by the same
token if you build a team out of
wall-to-wall a player rock stars then
mostly what they're going to do is sit
around and have theoretical arguments
with each other all day and they also
will not deliver anything so the
important thing really when constructing
teams is that you build them organically
that you have a couple of senior people
that can exhibit a little bit of
leadership and show the way I'm a couple
of mid-level kind of laymen who know
their way around but not necessarily
senior and each of them will both lead
by example and demonstrate to the new
team and step into those roles and how
they go about it the first time that
that I was asked to come and work at a
global development center of a client of
ours it was in it was a Mumbai and we
had been talking to them about how do
you practice continuous integration how
do you do the extreme programming
techniques all of this sort of thing and
talking talking talking on the phone and
the message was not getting through we
spent a several of our Indian team
members over here and they had a very
difficult time they couldn't get through
building security they had their
computers taken away from them they put
one guy and literally in a broom closet
in the front of the place i said well
the way you can coach the team is we'll
send them out to talk to you one at a
time and you can just sit there so i
ended up coming for a month literally
just to be the guy from the West knew
the important guy when I showed up the
security doors were open the laptops
came back and we got access to the teams
and it was it was yessir yes sir so I
felt kind of silly having to do that but
if it was what needed to be done we went
out of our way to set up situations in
which some of my my younger colleagues
from tall works in India would
specifically over overrule me and
override me I've said no Greg Smith you
were wrong about that adheres why but do
it in a respectful way do it in a
reasonable way and I would demonstrate
how to respond to that and say ahh I see
I understand thank you for pointing out
my error to me we went out of our way to
create these little role plays that
would demonstrate to them how to
effectively you push back on leadership
when they're wrong and how to you know
in a respectful manner point out when
there is an error we often have to do
that in an asthma alignment we have to
learn to say begging the captain's
pardon sir but did you want me to steer
the ship directly under the rocks the
big terrible rocks that are going to rip
out our hole and make us all drown just
askin no I'm just asking
even asking that question what you
labeled as a pessimist as a not a team
player and that's that's where bravery
comes back into the picture I'm sorry
that was very long answer to a very
short question but build ballots teams
is really the answer um you can't expect
it throw up What's her first using the
team together and say hey self-organized
do your thing and expect anything good
to happen you'll get that you get a
horrible horrible mess if you get
anything at all and that's a valid
criticism you need a level of seniority
to build healthy on scrum and agile
teams anyone else got anything on their
minds over here yeah a little bit good
attributes of a self-organizing team you
know maybe if I would then attributes
that you think should be I think one of
the one of the highest one that comes to
mind for me is the lack of willingness
to accept constraints that when they see
something wrong they don't just accept
well that's just the way it is it just
takes me 40 hours to get my password
reset every time it goes wrong it just
takes me you know six and a half months
to get access to a performance
environment that's just the way it is
around here and that's just the way it
always was necessary it always will be
they have to have a willingness to
challenge those constraints and to enter
to raise up those issues there are
things that leadership has to lead with
in an agile adoption but there are also
things that the team has to lead with or
things that they're close to the work
and they're the ones experiencing the
sand in the gears and the grit in their
face you know there's the ones up
against all these institutional
headwinds and we need them to be not
just brute I'll say brave enough for now
but hold that thought for a second to be
brave enough to raise the flags and tell
us when they're when they're a big
problems when things are taking too long
when things are too institutionalized
and when I say brave I don't mean that
to say that they're not and encouraged
to pejorative of a word but anytime I
see someone kind of behaving in sort of
a cowardly way the first thing I do is
look around for the bullies and trying
to figure out who the bullies are
otherwise there would be these kind of
cowardly behavior as I try and shut down
the police when I see teams unwilling to
raise issues unwilling to talk about
problems on the first thing my first
suspicion is that this is a team that's
been pushed down and beat back for you
know a long time and they're afraid to
speak up they're afraid to raise any
issues so I think that the the number
one thing that really comes to mind is a
unwillingness to accept that you're
given constraints and a perfect
willingness to challenge its constraints
and say look we can do better than this
it's ridiculous that it takes us
to get these little things done I think
we're willing to accept a lot of
impediments because we've learned that
it's business as usual it's just the way
things go and agile teams I think really
need to learn that they should not do
that that part of their job is to not
necessarily you know scream and holler
and yell about things and not to be
problematic about it but to make sure
they're creating visibility into the
issue to make sure that they're giving
you know management and leadership
inside they need as to what kind of
issues they're facing on the ground I
think that's really it and you have to
cultivate that attitude you have to
demonstrate that it's okay for them to
do that you have to let them know that
that's what you want where they're not
going to do it you have to act and when
you see someone behaving it that way you
have to call them out and reward them
for it where others won't do it and
that's a behavior that's all too
uncommon guys and get our organizations
today we don't cultivate that we tell
everyone know self-organized raised
problems you tell us what's wrong and
then then we you know push them around
and kind of punish them when they when
they do point out institutional issues
that they're struggling with that's my
number ones that I would look for good
yes yeah I managed from Bosch I am also
a certified scrum master so I had some
experience working aboard yeah thanks
actually I had a real I wanna share an
example with you like we had a customer
who had a team in UK who were following
scrum and at India Development Center we
were not falling scrum but we were you
know synchronizing their milestones with
up in our project plan so what was
happening is that that the customer end
you know they were always saying they
were always not able to meet up there to
ask at the end of every sprint and I
adding keep on adding in the Sprint
backlog next sprint backlog and when we
asked this it or we are agile you know
we don't measure so it's okay if we add
to this prince aikka so you know and it
was becoming really difficult for us to
synchronize with them because we had our
milestone which were dependent on their
sprint completion so this is a one
common problem i have seen that you know
that like you said that if you have
measured something you know then that
should add some value you should not
measure and that's the same answer they
were giving that we don't we don't
measure you know because you get rich
height
so what should we do in these kind of
cases and you know how to tackle these
cases where the team is not
understanding the importance of
completing the spring nor they are
trying to replant the next prince in a
maybe a longer manner or a better manner
they just tend to be you know a bit
casual because because of the sprint
methodology how do you give mean that
the customers or they're the consumers
keep adding more things in or the team
is oh nothing nothing was that since it
was happening that they were not
completing that task at the end of a
crisp rinse cycle mmm yeah so I sat in a
in a session with a Kennish waiver and
just Jeff Sutherland about three or four
years ago when they were in a scrum
gathering and they asked the the whole
audience say how many people out there
were CSM's 300 people raise their hands
and they said how many are currently you
know leading teams that are practicing
and working inside spreads maybe 50
hands went down they said how many of
those teams are routinely delivering
valuable software to a documented
definition of done every sprint anybody
want to guess how many hands stayed up
three so there's not a great track
record out they were doing this and
doing this well and this was before they
had rolled out on the CSD program which
is the certified scrum developer program
they haven't done a good job of
emphasizing the importance of the
engineering tasks of engineering rigor
that you also need in order to lower the
cost of responding to technical change
and if you don't have if you're not
doing things like continuous integration
test first development refactoring
simplest design those things build
automation automatic deployment then
your team's is going to struggle another
thing that I might ask is a is there a
firm definition of done through the end
of the spread do you have a documented
definition of what it means for
everything to be completed and as the
team continually reminded that we have
to get all of these things all the way
to this definition of done and that is
very much a delivery grade metric that
is not an activity grade metric you have
a documented objectively verifiable
definition of done with points on it
like what environment must have run it
and what type of testing must have be
subjected to what type of security audit
must had survived and continually remind
the teams as they're estimating as
they're committing as they're executing
that we've got this definition of done
we have to meet
and so I would first be suspicious maybe
there was a weak definition of done now
or maybe a lacking definition of done
and that the second one is that the team
is not keeping that in mind as they're
executing and just because we're not
measuring things doesn't mean that you
can be all over the map and they may or
may not and then I would look at the
strength of the engineering practices
that may be a real barrier that they
don't even know is there on that they
don't realize what they're doing without
and because they haven't seen what it
looks like necessarily to work in a
continuously integrated continuously
deployed your automated testing
environment so I would love it I don't I
don't know your environment for sure but
I would guess maybe look in those couple
directions and you might find the answer
I've got a hand here you're gonna get
the microphone to her yep thank you this
is not really related to the teams but I
still had a question relating to on
their child what's the shortest sprint
that is that you've seen in your
experience that is possible I'm bringing
this question out because a couple of
project that I worked as a scrum master
we felt at that point of time the two
weeks was a good sprint duration because
we had a very good definition of done
hmm there's a series of tests to be done
and to be able to achieve that we felt
from the india team that two weeks was a
good enough i was a right time but from
the on show we had the pressure that
tried three days as a spring duration
which we felt was very short and the
property the project manager Don show
said i have worked across different
organizations have done this for 10
years it works so i haven't seen an
example where 3d is feasible what I was
just trying to say this I think the
example that was given to us was that
facebook does it but since I'm not I'm
not averse I just want to check with you
do you think three days sprint as
practical and have you seen it work so
the UM I don't know there's about 170
nor hundred and eighteen certified scrum
trainers out there and I don't know all
of them but I know about 95 of them I
met everyone that I know is currently
recommending a two-week sprint length or
a shorter so um that nobody is really
recommend
by the book you know for week 30 day
length anymore everybody said go to go
straight for two weeks that at least
that I know of so that's really common
I've seen like very small kind of quick
moving web based teams that are doing
like you know social networking apps and
things like that get down to it weekly
weekly links where they do very quick
planning great quick reviews and they
are using a CI CD so continuous
integration continuous deployment to get
things all the way out the new out to
the production and their definition of
done actually includes the this feature
of deployed our production servers and
customers are using it in those
environments I can name three or four
organizations and they're doing that
though when you get down below that kind
of a sprint boundary window I think
you're really not doing scrum anymore
either when you get up to like six weeks
that's not a sprint that's a stroll on
the beach when you get down to two or
three days you're not really doing scrum
either you're really bored getting into
a pure con mom mode and that's really
what i recommend if you really want that
kind of frequency and that kind of rapid
turnaround you can give up a lot of the
things that are that are in scrum i
start to look at pure con bond or
there's a hybrid between con bond and
scrum called cleverly enough scrum bond
there's one paper out there written by a
guy named Coriolanus la-dee-da s about
the hybridization of con bond and scrum
and that might help you get down to the
shorter and shorter links i mean there
are a few key differences one of them
being that you don't have a fixed
schedule for your front reviews you wait
until enough a certain amount of
features are done and then you call a
sprint review so there's a lot of
compromises in there like that that he
recommends it's an interesting paper as
a free ebook you can download any way
that that might point you in towards a
compromise that gets you to a shorter
window personally as I mentioned I've
mostly worked with big very large
enterprise adoptions and they struggle
struggle struggle to get into two weeks
oh yeah you know it said that's a not
not even within their vision to imagine
three days so I haven't had a lot of
personal experience with that I'll into
a few companies that are doing it in my
mind you're moving much closer to a pure
con bond system when you get that tight
you might be close enough
sure so the question was on agile
project can you share resources across
project or across teams that's a couple
things come to mind their one of them is
a chart that Mike cones sometimes Ross
that shows the number of tasks your
assigned to and the amount of time you
spend on task if you have zero things to
work on you spend zero time on task if
you have one thing to work on you spend
fifty maybe sixty percent of your time
on task because occasionally that thing
becomes blocked you're waiting for
feedback you know something happens when
you get up around to 2.2 you get close
to eighty or ninety percent and then the
line almost drops they're straight off
it almost completely flat lines because
you spend all of your time context
switching and you're changing back and
forth from what you're doing to what
you're doing next so I get often upset
with resource managers that think you
know twenty and twenty-five percent
assignments and I've seen seven percent
assignments into teams and that they
think that's meaningful fifty percent
okay twenty-five percent you're starting
to lose me when you get down to the
single digits forget it there's no such
thing as a seven percent assignment but
I will I will back away from that just a
little bit by saying there's two classes
of work that are routinely a team won't
need all of or they won't need 40 hours
a week of a person and that's usually
around DBA or a database administration
and technical writing or pubs so very
commonly tech writing or pubs folks are
more centralized and they just drop in
two teams as needed one important thing
to do there is track them as added
capacity to the team don't just let them
bump up the numbers I make it look like
we had a better print when those drop in
but I would I like to see teams mostly
with full-time assigned members so for
example it's very easy the path of least
resistance is for me to go to team a's
daily scrum and say well i was really
busy with Team B yesterday I didn't get
anything done for you and you go team b
stand up but you say well I was really
really busy with team C yesterday I
didn't do anything done for you and then
so on so forth right you see where I'm
going I don't want to cast bad you know
its burdens on anyone but that is the
path of least resistance and when no
single group of people has visibility
into your whole body of work it makes it
easy for you to do that and so you
actually build much stronger teams when
people are one hundred percent assigned
if somebody's on one or two teams that
doesn't bother me that
much if they're on three or four then I
started to get pretty nervous I think
he'll I would do better and I always
argue for I would rather have a team of
four one hundred percent assigned people
than six people that are half time
because of fewer communication channels
there's less overhead and I think a four
percent dedicated team can outperform a
team of a dozen half timers even though
the FTE math doesn't look like they
should so yeah you can do it to a degree
I think people could be on one or two
teams at the risk of going to teammate
sitting I was busy with team via going
to teen being say I was busy with
teammate but when you get into your
three or four I think you're probably
across the line they'll answer your
question yeah so my position today is
that a team that's doing mixed support
and development work like they're
working on new features plus they're
doing some support what they typically
do is they set aside a time bucket for
all that support stuff coming in they
say well thirty-five or forty percent or
twenty percent of our time is set aside
for operational issues and we don't know
what they're going to be we just know on
average we spent about that much of our
time doing it whenever that bucket gets
bigger than fifty percent i start to get
itchy to go to the pier con bond so i
start to back away from scrum at the
point where the backlog is more than
fifty percent operational not a sprint
to sprint basis not because it doesn't
work i mean it works it works for why
you're fairly well but there's not that
much benefit out of sitting aside a
seventy or eighty percent you know
unidentified bucket of time and trying
to run that as a sprint you really get
just as much benefit out of an even
lighter weight system which is moving to
pure con bond so I think if more than
fifty or sixty percent of that teams
workload is operational i would consider
going 3-2 count mom doing okay on time
can i take you to the question or are
there any more good i think reading
lately okay sorry guys I I have tendency
to go on you can you can get
verification for my poor wife of 20 or
four years if you don't believe before
how long I've been at one stage thank
you very much for your time and spirit
pleasure speaking with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
