the objective of this introductory
lesson is to educate you on the
courseware that simply learn offers help

ensure that you are aware of all the
topics and subtopics covered in this
course let us move on to recap on ITIL
basics in the next slide ITIL is the
most widely adopted approach for IT
Service Management in the world it
provides a practical no-nonsense
framework for identifying planning
delivering and supporting IT services to
the business adopting ITIL can offer
users a huge range of benefits that
include improved IT services reduce
costs improved customer satisfaction
through a more professional approach to
service delivery improved productivity
improved use of skills and experience
and improved delivery of third-party
service we will study more about ITIL
under the topic foundation basics at the
end of this lesson let us now understand
ITIL intermediate which is the next
level in ITIL certification ITIL 2011
intermediate level is a next level after
ITIL foundation ITIL intermediate level
has a modular structure with each module
focusing on different aspects of ITIL
they are service lifecycle and service
capability the intermediate modules
focus more on detail oriented study than
the foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification while
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course the
thoughts on how one can become an ITIL
expert must have crossed your mind let's
get the answer to this in the next slide
let us have a brief look at the ITIL
certification part the diagram in the
slide is the graphical depiction of the
ITIL certification path ITIL
certification path is based on credit
point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage till expert ITIL foundation is the
first if ocation which gives you two
credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from two streams one life cycle and two
capability the life cycle modules have
all the standard five life cycle phases
as exams which provide three credits
each capability modules are more focused
towards implementation content and have
four exams which provide four credits
each you can choose any one of the
modules from either streams or make a
combination on the basis of your
experience in the industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 points plus
two of foundation that is 17 credit
points makes you eligible for third
level that is ma LC which provides you
five credit points once you are
certified mal see your final score
credit becomes 22 to become an ITIL
expert there is no separate exam you
need to accumulate 22 credits to become
an ITIL expert imma sure we are clear on
the certification path let us understand
the service lifecycle and its modules in
the next line
the service lifecycle modules are for
candidates who aspire to handle a
management or team lead role which
requires a broad management focus on
ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas the different modules and the
service lifecycle are one service
strategy SS - service design sd-3
service transition st for service
operation so5 continual service
improvement CSI similarly let us
understand service capability in the
next slide service capability modules
are for the candidates hew aspire to
specialise in process level knowledge in
one or more processes which focuses more
on day-to-day execution the different
modules and the service capability are
one service offerings and agreements SOA
to release control and validation RC v3
operations support and analysis osa for
planning protection and optimization PPO
as we have an understanding of both the
streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide here is a difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you will see that lifecycle is mainly
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also lifecycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn more about the
differences on this slide
once you're done move on to learn about
mal see
managing across the lifecycle is the
last step in achieving the ITIL expert
certification therefore it is mainly
focused on individuals who want to
become ITIL experts on completing mal
see an individual can apply it the ITIL
knowledge and it will provide skills
that can be used in the workplace in a
tangible way we already discussed on the
credit system in the certification Park
slide however just to mention the mal C
simplification gives you five credit
points now let us proceed to look at the
accreditation Institute for ITIL in the
next slide the governing body for ITIL
2011 Foundation and intermediate is the
Cabinet Office UK simply learn is
accredited by APM G and tuv as an ITIL
foundation an intermediate training
provider also simply learn is an
