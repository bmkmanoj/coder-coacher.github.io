how to manage security incidents offer a
create differentiator with enhanced
credibility and marketability considered
essential to ongoing education career
progression and value delivery to
enterprises and provide access to
valuable resources such as peer
networking and idea exchange let's now
look at the value of CISM to
organization
today many of the large and mature
organizations seek out professionals
with proven experience and knowledge to
meet the challenges and threats posed
from use of information security many
organizations give value to
international certifications in fact in
many of the organizations possessing

many organizations as they have the

significant value from information
systems and their compliance
requirements are met in the next slide

the CISM exam is a paper-based exam and
questions are prepared with the intent
of measuring and testing practical
knowledge in information security
management it is a rigorous four hour
exam with over 200 multiple choice
questions covering four practice areas
all questions are multiple choices of
four and are designed for one best
answer the candidate is to choose the
correct or the best answer from the
choices the candidate scores are
reported as a scaled score which is a
conversion of a candidate's raw score on
an exam to a common scale ISACA uses and
reports scores on a common scale from
200 to 800 a candidate must receive a
score of 450 or higher to pass the exam
let's now look at the question pattern
CISM exams are multiple-choice exam that
cover CISM domains in some instances a
question may represent a scenario or a
problem description or a description of
a situation based on this scenario or
problem description or a description of
a situation there may be two or more
questions there is no penalty for wrong
answers no negative marking and all
questions can be answered it is
important to identify keywords most best
first etc before selecting and recording
the answer so far we have discussed
about the syllabus value of this
certification to professionals and
organizations requirements exam format
and question paper pattern let's proceed
to understand about this tutorial

being the zero one the other four

materials for each domain which are

make you well prepared for the CISM exam
in our course we have provided questions
after each key chapters and a set of
practice questions at the end of each
domain these practice questions are to
indicate how CI SM questions could be
presented in the exam and should not be
used as a source of knowledge practice

questions that will appear on the actual

considered as a measurement of the
candidates ability to answer questions
correctly on the exam for that area and
the actual exam questions will test the
