and supply analysis consumer demand
volume one study session for reading 14
hello candidate welcome to the 15th
lesson or the simply learn cfa level 1
tutorial before going further let's
review what we learned in the last
session we discuss the functioning of
the market and forces driving the market
that is demand and supply we learn how
the demand function and supply function
work and how the grass the same are
drawn we also discuss the factors
influencing the demand and supply
functions in the last lesson we
discovered how prices and market
equilibrium evolves on the basis of
demand and supply functions agenda today
we will discuss the topic demand and
supply analysis consumer demand in the
last lesson we learned about the demand
and supply functions now in this lesson
we will learn how the consumer affects
demand and what are the constraints and
factors in determining consumer demand
this chapter includes the study of the
consumer theory that is from preferences
of consumer till the demand functions
moving further with a study of consumer
theory who will study the utility theory
in which modeling of preferences and
tastes will be studied that will include
the axioms of the theory of consumer
choice we will learn about the utility
function and graphical portrayal of the
utility function that is indifference
curves maps and concepts related to it
next we will study the demand and
utility functions in light of changes in
the incomes of consumers and prices of
goods here we will define normal and
inferior Goods and how the demand
functions differ from them as per the
learning outcome statement after this
lesson the candidate should be able to
describe consumer choice theory and
utility theory describe the use of
indifference curves opportunity set and
budget constraint in decision-making
calculate and interpret a budget
constraint determine a consumers
equilibrium bundle of goods based on
utility analysis compare substitution
and income effects distinguish between
normal goods and inferior goods and
explain Giffen Goods and Liebling goods
in this context what is consumer theory
consumer theory is the study of how
people use their limited means to make
purposeful choices consumer demand is
dependent upon two factors his
preferences and his budget constraints
budget constraints defined what the
consumer can afford and his or her
consumption possibilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
