you Matt welcome and thank you so much
for joining us thank you Dan appreciate
it and glad to be here yeah getting into
especially social media and looking at
all the options that are available for
marketing and for getting your brand
name out market now are faced with a
significant number of decisions and
opportunities and it's not getting any
easier and so I just want to walk
through a little bit of a framework as
far as what's available to us today
what are some of the implications of
that as well as maybe some
recommendations but also some
observations about the current state of
social marketing and what we need to do
as brands to maintain and gain
visibility whether using existing
networks or piggybacking through
relationships that we can build through
these social channels okay
now from a big-picture point of view
when we're talking about the trends of
social media and the things that we need
to be aware of the number one thing that
is pushing companies towards paid
placement is that organic Reach is
getting smaller and smaller every week
more and more of these social networks
realized they need to monetize and so
they're going to monetize through paid
sponsorships and paid opportunities and
so the organic Reach is going to
significantly decline and it's going to
continue to decline simply because the
social networks I think especially
Facebook uh if they showed you
everything in your stream that was
targeted to you or within all the people
that you would be following be about
15,000 posts per day that you would see
just on Facebook in reality Facebook
limits that now to a few hundred simply
because it would be overwhelming and
also based on monetization they've come
up with a formula that will expose you
to a certain amount of ads so that they
can continue to monetize themselves now
the second part and probably one of the
most fury aiding parts to many
businesses
it's the metrics it's measuring
everything to be sure that you're
getting a good return on investment that
you results for a campaign metrics are
infuriating because many social networks
are just not providing the data
necessary to know if you've developed
a good campaign then again when we also
bring in influencer marketing through
social media the ability to measure gets
even more difficult because now we're
looking more soft measurements we're
looking at specific campaigns through a
third party and we can't always control
all of the measurements and the tactics
that are being used across multiple
media so metrics especially within
social media has always been a little
difficult but then in getting to a
return on investment that is a
significant obstacle if everyone can
make sure just double-check your
microphones make sure they're muted cuz
I am getting some noise in the
background here and I would appreciate
that thank you
the third thing to consider is our goals
what is it that you want out of these
campaigns how is it being measured and
again this comes back on the metrics
aspect you see in most companies where
I've worked with them or where we've
gone in and done some auditing of
campaigns the one thing that really
sticks out is a lack of centered goals
for campaign what are you trying to
drive how are you trying to drive it and
what do you want out of it basically
asking some essential questions at the
onset of the campaign rather than
wondering how we can justify it
afterwards
I've just seen too many companies that
really approach social media with the
sense of we want to get more visibility
but really not coming apart with some
tangible measurable goals so when we
look at the big picture of social Reach
has it said our organic postings are
going to get smaller and smaller and the
only way you're going to get the largest
audience possible is through doing paid
promoted social posting that will give
you the biggest audience possible the
next audience that you will get
is more of the organic social which is
significantly smaller than what you'll
get from a paid promoted post the last
level which is really the smallest
target I find to be one of the most
intriguing targets to go after in paid
social and that is what we call maybe
dark social or it's also social that you
can purchase through a programmatic
approach and that is through a series of
data targets and this can be through
retargeting or doing some very isolated
targeting techniques in order to get the
right message in front of a known user
through their social network that is
what we call dark social or programmatic
social where I can put a specific
message in front of a lead or a buyer or
a customer and I can provide a very
personalized or timely message based on
an event behavior something where I know
that I've got a strong chance of
converting them with a very specific
message so those are the three areas
that I can develop some targeting and
understand the reach of the audience
that I'm going to reach around that I'm
going to get in front of in each of
these campaigns now also on the metrics
side just a few Hartigan's from the
rough few months that Facebook has been
having is again when we are looking at
marketing through a third party
we are tied in we are tied into the
metrics they report the problem is are
they reporting metrics the right way and
so Facebook has gone through a
significant problem in over reporting
under reporting over estimating video
view time one of the things that you
know you might remember is as you're
going to your Facebook newsfeed and if
someone posts a bid
and the video starts playing that is
technically not considered a V until you
click on it and you can hear the video
what was happening is as soon as the
video would start playing Facebook
considered that of view and it was
charging advertisers based on that then
also different areas of Facebook live
we're having a problem with misreporting
likes and so if you were basing any of
these campaigns off of video views likes
or engagement statistics uh really what
came out is those are undependable and
depending upon what format they were
taking place in it was a problem and so
Facebook right now is brought in in an
audit group to look at how they are
measuring and reporting but ultimately
most social media channels have had to
go through this problem it's a growing
up process but also when you are looking
at different methodologies within a
specific channel so you've got a paid
aspect social aspect maybe you've got
some other things like Facebook live and
Facebook canvas so you've got other
means of communicating within that
channel they each are going to affect
different levels of measurement and it
becomes much more complicated ultimately
what we need to know is we are locked in
to their measurements now we can provide
some of our structure and our
measurements based on where we drive
people and what we're asking them to do
ultimately if we are driving them to one
of our own properties then we can get
some level of measurement that we can
stack up and compare against that third
party or that social measurement you see
the main problem is understanding whose
audience we are targeting you see
whenever we use Facebook snapchat
Twitter any of these in partnership
really what we're looking at is a second
party platform you see we are we're
with them to reach their audience even
though our audience may like us or
follow us they're not always going to
see everything we post that is the
limitation of the organic side and the
only way to get our message in front of
most of them is to pay for it that's a
second party relationship that means the
audience technically belongs to that
social media it's their platform it's
their audience their metrics and they're
the ones who are monetizing that
audience and so even though they may
follow us like us you know engage with
us it's not technically our audience
we're renting that audience because
we're utilizing and reaching them on a
second party platform so it's that
cooperative approach and so when we
start to view the audience in those
terms that will help us now understand
that you know we need to then drive that
audience into more of a first party
relationship when we have that first
party relationship then we can
communicate to them on our terms on our
platform in the way that we want until
that happens we can only rent the space
and we can only reach them and we don't
know who they all are so they
technically belong to that social media
platform and we have to work
cooperatively and understand that
principle of ownership once you do it
will change how you approach your social
campaigns you see what we're trying to
do altom Utley is drive users into that
first party relationship utilizing these
second party relationships through posts
social tiles sponsored posts and we can
utilize infographics and things like
that but what we're trying to do is
develop assets develop content assets
that essentially we can sell to those
second party relationships to
or audiences there and we drive
audiences to that content asset whether
it's a YouTube video or a white paper or
an online demo or an application you see
the blog posts the white paper the
online demo those are our properties and
so any where the user comes to our
property we can measure it because it's
on our platform however if all they're
engaging with is our blog post to our
YouTube video or a social tile then we
have to rely on the measurements of that
second party platform so as users go
through that decision funnel where they
discover they learn they try by what
we're trying to do is push people
through a consistent campaign to
interact with our content asset which
ultimately drives them to a decision
point and that's where we gain our lead
and once we get the lead then they go
into our nurturing system and so looking
at social media looking at all these
platforms as a way to cooperatively talk
to a second party audience and drive
them to a first party relationship now
also when we start talking about driving
engagement looking at these audiences we
need to understand how people engage and
based on what type of site they're on it
will largely determine the type of
behavior that they exhibit now this is
the engagement pyramid and this is
something that over what I would say I
started working on this probably about
1213 years ago and looking at thousands
of websites in their analytics I found
that there is a consistency of behavior
based on how people find your website
now at the top of the pyramid as you can
see our blogs and editorial content
articles new
things like that and what that means is
that people who are on those types of
sites blogs editorial sites news if they
come to your site from there they're
going to stay longer they're gonna do
more and read more they're going to be
much more engaged coming from that type
of site then if they come from any other
source now the main reason for that is
if they are reading articles about cars
and looking at maybe comparisons or news
about that and then they click and go to
your site you see the context was
already there they were already on a
page about that content and so finding a
link on that page or seeing a link there
is naturally going to be in their stream
of thinking and so when they click on it
it's just a natural process and as I
said they'll tend to stay longer read
more do more and convert at a higher
rate because of the high context of
content now also there is a lack of
competition at the top of the pyramid
meaning if you're on a blog or if you're
on a new site or an article there are
not a lot of links in the editorial
content there may be some ads but those
are limited and so because the content
is more editorial in nature there is
less competition for the reader's
attention and so the links are limited
so when they do click on a link
it's a highly contextual link and
there's not a lot of competition for
their attention as I said it's a natural
stream-of-consciousness behavior now the
next level here is video when someone is
on YouTube they are or any other video
marketing type of site it's high context
they're within a certain subject matter
or within a specific user there's less
competition for their attention more
competition than if it were a blog or an
editorial site
then we get into forums and and I put
Pinterest into here as well mainly
because of the high contextual nature in
forums people are sharing information it
is typically a forum dedicated to a
specific content matter or subject
matter and the same thing in Pinterest
where the content is grouped into
specific subject matter and so again
there's a little more competition but
it's contextually very similar search
tends to be in the middle and it's very
interesting here because when people
search for content they determine the
context based on the word or words that
they use the competition for the
searchers attention is about the same
every time it's about 15 to 20 links on
the page based on the results or if
there are video results or local results
the competition is usually about the
same but how people respond to a search
is that if they don't see what they want
on your site they know all they have to
do is click their back button and
they've got about 10 to 13 more options
now at the bottom of the pyramid we
start getting into less and less
engagement based on the source of the
visitor so at the very bottom we see
Twitter snapchat Instagram and
Facebook's just above their Facebook's a
little more engaging because the amount
of time people spend there and then
underneath that the Twitter snapchat and
Instagram when you think about being on
any of these platforms there is very
little context meaning if you're on a
news article it's about a specific
subject however if you're paging through
your newsfeed on Facebook or if you're
looking at a Twitter stream or or an
Instagram stream from one to the other
there's not a lot of context in fact the
context is really scattered unless
you're following a specific person but
even then
based on their stream of consciousness
which is what Twitter snapchat and
Instagram seems to be more you're not
going to get a consistent stream of
contextually related information because
of that when people click on a link it's
mainly because something grabs their
attention but also what's driving this
factor here at the bottom of the pyramid
is there is a lot of competition for
their attention
think about your newsfeed on Facebook
it's very easy to go from one to the
other and and see so many things in your
in your stream there's a lot of
competition for your attention yes that
ad may look great but it's also mixed in
with personal updates from friends or
your network and so when you consider a
lot of competition for your attention a
low context of subject matter when it
results in is a lot of single page
two-second visits that is typical of
visitors that come from Twitter snapchat
Instagram or even Facebook they click on
it because it's interesting but their
time on site their engagement and their
chances of conversion are all very low
and so based on how people find your
information how they find your ad your
link whatever whatever type of site it
is will largely determine the type of
behavior that they will exhibit and so
when we think about how we want to
engage people and what type of message
we want to get across we also need to
put it in terms of how we are going to
be reaching them and what networks or
what mediums may be more effective in
communicating certain messages in order
to develop the type of engagement that
we want out of the campaign so we need
to come up with a plan and that strategy
will help us understand how we can best
engage with people what channels would
provide the best exposure and visibility
for a specific
message what medium will help us
communicate that message more
effectively or also what mediums are
going to give us the broadest audience
what mediums or channels are going to
provide the best brand control and how
we can reach people at scale with the
message that we have in order to
maximize the amount of return but then
also questions of measurement who is
going to measure what measurements are
we going to rely on and what ultimately
will be measured so this is the big
picture we need to understand that in
order to understand all of the questions
and ask the right questions about how we
are going to apply this campaign and
develop a proper set of expectations of
what it will bring now let's get into
some of the pros and cons the actual
content and really the title of the
webinar here and we're going to get into
some of these here now pros and cons
number one is that the costs of paid
social placement are relatively low
starting at the basic level but they are
increasing very quickly let me explain
that just to get into some sponsored
posts or even some paid tweets the costs
are really kind of low to do that
however the con of that is that it is
increasing quickly but if the really how
inexpensive it is just to get a few blog
posts sponsored blog posts or even get
into the paid social sponsorships or or
the paid posts those are so inexpensive
really it's nothing to boost a campaign
on Facebook and increase the visibility
but one thing we've noticed when you
look at the rate of growth over the past
few years it is increasing and so it may
be interesting to see how quickly the
costs rise now a couple of the things
that will will help this is the more
targeting that you do the less of a cost
that it will provide
so if you're targeting locally or
regionally it will cost less because
you're reaching a smaller group of
target people so if you're trying to do
something very broad and it's more of a
national or a national type of campaign
you're going to be competing with other
people that are trying to reach that
same group of people so again you can
keep the cost low by developing more
targeting techniques but ultimately
right now it's a very affordable way at
scale to get your message across to a
large group of people the next is the
exposure so again we can utilize both
the organic and the paid in order to
present different messages for different
purposes so for example if all we're
doing is looking for some feedback when
the examples here is from the Ford f-150
Facebook what was really just a question
of what do you think about the concept
and from an organic standpoint a
fantastic response about 3000 responses
almost 500 shares so it was a great way
to engage the existing audience of
followers of the f-150 page
and you can do this on any platform and
that's probably what we're most familiar
with is you know providing a good
engaging picture as well as a good
question inviting people's feedback now
from a paid standpoint you know you can
utilize some sponsored posts and that
will increase the engagement and
ultimately we want to try and drive
something so I love the example here
where we're going to engage them with a
video but the call to action is to take
a test drive and so you know depending
upon the creative or depending upon the
ad campaign you know you're creative if
you're developing a video those costs
will be separate and it may vary
depending upon resources and budgets
that you've got but really if you're
looking
to put a sponsored post on Facebook it
can be anywhere from a thousand to four
thousand dollars depending upon the
exposure you want or you know even more
than that now on the dark social side or
the the paid that's more where I love
using this more for a conversion
technique but if I know someone has been
to the site or I know someone has
exhibited the behavior of a buyer then I
can provide a very personalized targeted
message to them such as you know at left
for the example here a rebate message in
order to get them to click through and
act on that and that's to drive
conversions to drive leads so the nice
thing is is I can't rely completely on
paid I can't rely completely on organic
it takes a mix of all of these in order
to increase that exposure so I think
it's a good thing I don't think it's a
bad thing because again we're talking
about second party platforms and those
are methods that we've got to rely on in
order to get that because obviously it's
not a it's not a our platform it's their
platform alright the next thing is more
and more integration is happening where
we can develop ads that take place
within the platform so rather than just
the typical campaign that drives people
to a landing page especially with
Facebook canvas people can now work
within the ad without ever leaving
Facebook and so it gives people the
ability to engage to learn and find out
more about your brand or about that
campaign without going to a specific
landing page now again there's some pros
and cons with that the pro is they're
engaging they're learning more the con
is
it's not on my platform I can't measure
that I have to rely now on Facebook
canvas to give me the metrics and show
me what's happening so it's it's nice it
forces us to be a little more creative
if we're going to utilize that but the
downside is we are driving them to third
party platforms third party metrics now
the same with Twitter cards it's a way
to get your business more visibility
through Twitter one nice thing is is
Instagram obviously is building in and
and Facebook as well
some additional call-to-action buttons
that are more focused so rather than
click here now we're getting something
that's a little more we can utilize
based on the type of campaign so if it's
a watch more downloads sign up shop now
those are some more custom messages now
we're not to the point yet where we can
determine the type of message that we
want other than in the ad copy but
that's something that they may be
developing over time is being able to
customize that a little more so that the
call to action is much more specific
about what we want people to do now the
downside of some of the social
advertising is this what is what makes
your creative agency insane is that all
of the different display sizes based on
what you're trying to do on different ad
on different social networks and even
Facebook even though you may use it an
ad that's one size when after it has
been engaged with or receiving likes
Facebook may resize it and so you've got
to plan on that potential resizing of
the ad on Facebook based on how people
are interacting with it that even though
you load a specific size it may only be
displayed at a different size and being
school
is doubt in that case is your brand
going to be visible is your message
going to be communicated when it gets
squeezed and also just because you're
developing an ad on Facebook doesn't
mean it's going to translate well to
Instagram you've got to develop again
making sure your brand your messaging is
clear and then it's not lost when it's
translated to a different network and a
different ad size and so there is very
little consistency in ad sizes across
multiple social networks probably the
only social network that adheres to any
standard is LinkedIn with the rectangle
leaderboard and skyscraper ads YouTube
is also a little more focused on the IAB
ad sizes and so but again it's gonna be
a little differently depending upon what
they offer in terms of inventory rather
than just us you know a specific set of
guidelines as you can see YouTube offers
two different sizes of display ads two
different sizes of overlay ads one of
each
you could probably utilize within
LinkedIn but then when it comes to
Twitter Facebook and Instagram you'll
need to resize all of those ads in each
of the network's so there's a lot of
inconsistency and especially when it
comes to adhering to any type of brand
guidelines is ensuring that your message
and your branding is clear in each of
the ad sizes now what of the I would say
my favorite pros of social targeting and
social placement is the ability to
target an audience this to me is one of
the biggest upsides of paying for social
placement see especially when I'm
targeting a sponsored ad or sponsored
post I can utilize demographics or socio
graphics I i can even on LinkedIn I can
if I'm going after a business audience
or more professional audience I can go
through LinkedIn and I can target by job
title I can target by region
I can target by age I can target by all
kinds of things and then I can also
target by location whether I want to go
for a specific local area regional area
national I can focus those and again the
more I target the more I can extend my
budget because I'm going after a smaller
group of people and maybe I can boost my
budget to increase my visibility among
that small targeted group of people
therefore ensuring that I can blanket
the group that I want now I can also get
into day parting which is a lot of fun
because you can develop different
messages for day time different messages
at nighttime one of my favorite
campaigns was targeting entrepreneurs
and sea level executives decision makers
and targeting them one way during the
day and then at night targeting them
with an ad campaign because chances are
if they're online at night they're
working and so it was more of a message
of what are you still doing working you
could be saving time and becoming much
more efficient and so doing a day
parting campaign where we knew they
would see one ad during the day and then
following it up at night which was a
more targeted personalized presentation
really helped to target that audience
but then also some of the social
networks were allow you to relate your
ad to specific interests or affinities
meaning based on the behavior of what
that person reads or clicks on or who
they follow may help target that a
little bit more in terms of behavior in
terms of understanding what they're
interested in which will increase the
likelihood of them clicking on your ad
so again the more targeting you add the
bitter demographic the better affinity
the better locally that you target these
ads you not only target it to a smaller
audience but one that is
targeted more likely to click on those
ads and respond now from the
programmatic standpoint I can buy social
ads through the programmatic buying and
through programmatic buying I can
develop a retargeting campaign and by
social space and this is more of that
dark social where I can retarget someone
through their social network to give a
very specific call to action based on
what they've done what they've looked at
and get now then to move more towards
being a lead
I can also target them based on their
behavior of what kind of sites they
visited what content they visited so if
they have looked at other brand names if
they've looked at other brand names then
I can target a campaign specifically to
them that based on that behavior now
they'll start seeing my ads because
they're looking at competitor sites I
can also utilize some third-party data
and that will enable a higher level of
targeting and a more intelligent buy to
a specific group of people so I can't
say enough about this I love the
targeting aspect of being able to
utilize social networks for very high
efficient purchasing to drive people to
a specific decision point that I know
fit the criteria and the target of the
audience that I want to reach now some
people see this as a pro some see it as
a con because now when you do an organic
post typically the performance level of
an organic post is going to be about 5%
or less now you can pay to boost it
based on some of the performance and
here's the way I tend to look at that
system of boosting an organic post based
on the performance I look back in the
days of direct mail and direct marketing
that if you had a list of about a
hundred thousand or two hundred thousand
names
you would test your message you would
send a direct mail piece or two
different versions to 2 to 3 percent of
your list and you would measure the
response and based on that you would
modify the campaign and send out the
winner of your a/b test well we do the
same thing in email if we have a list of
about a hundred thousand or two hundred
thousand you can do an a/b test of two
different kinds of email to about two to
three percent of your list measure the
response and the winner gets sent to the
entire list this is how I look at
boosting an organic post based on a
performance is it's similar to that
direct mail or email testing then if I
put something out there but gets a
better-than-average response and I'm
looking at about maybe three to five
percent of my audience I can look at the
engagement I can look at the you know
you know how many people have seen it
then I can promote it and so based off
the response that's how I'm viewing how
I can test a message in organic and if
it performs well then I can pay to get
that additional visibility based on
comparing past performances of organic
posts
now here comes I would say the big con
and that is measurement measurement as I
said is probably the number one issue
that brands face when it comes to both
social marketing and then also just
really trying to figure out what's going
on in campaigns now if we start looking
at some of the ways that you can
interact with this you know with this ad
and this is one thing I like to ask
people is because what you can do is you
know I can click on the owner I can
click on the brand name and I can go to
their page I can also click on the
creative and go to the landing page I
can click on the learn more and go to
the landing page
but I can also click the like I can also
comment and I can also share now
depending upon the definition of the
campaign all of those are considered
engagement if someone clicks through to
the brand page if someone that you know
they can also appear they can like the
brand but not necessarily the post and
so all of this is considered engagement
now as we know not all engagements are
the same however if I'm having someone
reporting engagement to me the thing I
need to remember is I need to define
what that engagement is because if
someone comments or shares that is a
different kind of engagement than if
someone just simply likes it
also it's a different kind of engagement
if someone wants to learn more you see
learning more is the point of the
campaign that's where I'm trying to
drive people however if they comment or
share that is very different than just a
like a like is a good engagement but if
someone makes a good comment and they
share it with their network now it's
going out across their network it's
being republished I'm getting some
earned media views because with a like
it or share it they are recommending it
to their network so in terms of
engagement I need to value different
engagements at different levels simply
going in and clicking on the sponsor
page here that's going to be a lot less
so what engagement do I value more than
others if I'm fine with wrapping all of
this into one measurement of engagement
then I'm taking the cost of the campaign
I'm dividing it by all of the engagement
factors and that will give me my cost
per engagement now if I only want to say
I'm only going to define
engagement by comments shares likes and
learn more than I need to define that so
that I can be sure that we the brand the
agency we're all speaking the same
language and all these terms mean the
same thing now the same thing if I'm
looking at the cost of the campaign in
terms of conversion you see if I'm
looking to measure my cost per click the
like and comment and share those are
great those are engagements if I'm
measuring conversion clicks then I'm
looking at people that click the image
or click learn more because that is what
drives people to the landing page once
they come to the landing page now that's
on my network and I can measure that but
I can take the cost of the campaign
divide that by the amount of clicks on
the ad and that gives me my cost per
click in terms of measuring the campaign
finally if I'm going to look
specifically at lead generation then
again I'm looking at those people that
clicked on the creative and a call to
action go to the landing page and not
only that but complete the landing page
and get to the Thank You page because
now they're a lead see at this point all
I'm doing is looking at the click and so
being able then to measure appropriately
helps me also understand where any
problems might be you see if I'm not
getting good exposure I'm not getting
good impressions in my ad then maybe I'm
not spending enough or Target loops
maybe I'm not spending enough or
targeting appropriately in order to get
the amount of impressions that I need if
I'm not getting enough clicks then the
problem is the creative the creative
isn't driving people to do what I want
them to do it also if I'm getting less
engage
changement that could be because of the
creative as well so it's also knowing
where to analyze and assess problems in
the campaign when we see that it may not
be performing and then again if I'm not
getting the leads that I think I should
be getting the problem is in the landing
page and so again understanding how to
diagnose where each of the measurements
comes into play and making sure that
everyone is defining the terms and the
measurements in the same way so then I
can get to my cost per lead based on the
campaign in terms of measurement now
paid editorial exposure this is one of
those things where I'll tell you what
publishers love it brands love it but
unfortunately it also gets to the con of
this as well and that's that users
consumers aren't as excited about native
advertising or paid editorials as brands
and publishers are now the IAB here's
their statement is that regardless of
context a reasonable consumer should be
able to distinguish between what is paid
advertising and what is publisher
editorial content now this is big
because when we're seeing things like
native advertising it also goes under
the name of content syndication you know
this because if you've never seen
anything that says related articles or
sponsored articles that's a key that we
are in native advertising if you don't
know what native advertising is its ads
that are meant to look like the content
it's advertising that is made to look
like regular ad editorial content
whether by use of this same font the
same image sizes uh it's it's sometimes
very indistinguishable what is an ad and
what is regular editorial
content that means that the ad looks
like the native content and consumers
don't like it because they think they're
being fooled even if they click on a
sponsored story that answers their
question when they find out that it is a
brand written story about a brand and it
was paid for for that placement they're
not as excited about it
publishers love it because people click
on it which makes them money brands love
it because they can control everything
and they get good response off of it now
we see this in advertorials and and also
in an odd way the BuzzFeed model which
is brands publishing social content now
that's a little less blurring the lines
because you do have the brand next to it
and the brand has its own page in that
BuzzFeed model but I would tell you my
background is in journalism and every
time I talk about native advertising my
mind is on my journalism professor going
on and on about how advertising and
editorial are two different worlds and
they should never mix and I know my my
journalism professor is probably 80
years old right now
and I can just imagine the heart attack
they have when they see these models
coming together it's such a fascinating
world I want to give you an example of
what this looks like so this is the
downside of paid advertise
Wired magazine and here we have the
infographic of the day um and then over
to the side here we have it really kind
of a defining what the infographic of
the day is it's interesting and topical
stories in a fresh visual way check back
daily now this infographic is about ups
and their supply chain survey the
problem is it looks like wired content
it looks like an
that you would find in Wired in fact
wire does a lot of this type of
advertising where brands will pay for
specific articles they will pay for
content that looks like it is native to
Wired what consumers have a problem with
and maybe you've seen it maybe you
haven't is right there in middle now
that I've highlighted it you can
probably see it but it is a very very
small word in a non bold presentation
that says advertisement this goes back
to the IAB which is a reasonable
consumer should be able to distinguish
between what is paid and what is
editorial and so I will leave this up to
you is this obvious is it clear is it
straightforward the difference between
what is paid and what is advertising so
this is the line that native advertising
advertorial that type of world lives in
and as I said brands lÃ©vesque
publishers love it consumers though
aren't as excited about it simply from a
credibility standpoint now working with
influencers this kind of follows a
similar respect in that it's native
content because it's developed by an
influencer it's developed by a
personality or a publisher that has a
large following and brands develop a
relationship with that influencer again
kind of that second party aspect that
we're going to partner with them and the
result will be that some of their
followers become our followers so really
it's kind of like renting a list in
order to combine efforts and boost your
own followers now a great example
this you may have heard about this was
howdy partnering with the onion and they
created snapchats that were going out
during the Superbowl so rather than
buying a Super Bowl ad they created more
of a guerrilla campaign behind the
scenes and with just funny updates
related to the game as you can see this
one dog doesn't care who wins
and so this was driving this was
utilizing onion putting out the content
and of course if you know anything about
the onion it's it's really they they
were the original fake mousse but they
knew they were fake news and it was
funny but it was stories too ridiculous
to to be true and so I really more of an
entertainment site so outie allowed the
onion to create the content and the
content was during the Super Bowl and it
drove people to OD now for the cost of
the campaign uh it drove about fifty
five hundred new followers more than a
hundred thousand views and twenty four
hundred campaign mentions on Twitter
with about thirty seven thousand
impressions it added about twenty five
hundred new Twitter followers and nine
thousand new Facebook fan so now they
did not disclose the cost of the
campaign but I can give you a pretty
good guess when we get into the next
slide of what that ran and so utilizing
influencers again it's like a rented
list
it's like utilizing the best of what
that influencer does and associating
your brand to it in order to gain more
followers now this happened here with
logan paul who is a again more of a
snapchat personality developing videos
and he developed a a prank campaign and
that was done with the sour patch
kids so as you can see there it's a
candy and they've got a couple of
candies going on and they would run
around New York pranking people and they
took these videos they put him on
snapchat now this was about a week long
campaign and it generated four Sour
Patch 120,000 new followers about six
point eight thousand snapchat
impressions generated just over five
hundred a thousand on the first day
about twenty six thousand screenshots
and about 1900 Twitter mentions so this
is the pro influencers will increase
your reach partnering with an influencer
they are receiving payment to promote
you to their network that is the upside
of influence or marketing the downside
is it's pricey so this this campaign
that was done specifically with Logan
Paul uh it lasted about a week and it
cost about $100,000 that sour patch paid
Logan Paul to develop this campaign to
develop this so when we start getting
into the pricing of working with an
influencer the more popular the
influencer this is where the costs are
driving up significantly and they seem
to be increasing by about ten to thirty
percent every year because these
influencers are in demand and they know
it and so really just to get a single
tweet from an influencer you know not
bad between 50 and $100 however if you
want a high visibility blog or vlogger
video bloggers like a logan paul like a
pewdiepie like uh one that i know my
kids love is is good mythical morning it
if you want them to promote your product
and talk about it on their program
you're looking at about $100,000 to make
that happen a single review from a
popular blogger can run as much as
$10,000 or more an example is a popular
video blogger Honda paid $10,000 for a
two-minute video that they produced
influencer costs are pricey depending
upon the scale at which you want to
reach and who you are utilizing and as I
said the costs of these campaigns with
influencers is increasing dramatically
because they've got that networks and
they're in demand and really you're
looking at it shir in terms of sheer
audience and so again you may be
competing with a sour patch brand you
may also be competing with many other
brands to get this influencers audience
now the problem is is this also leads to
another problem and that is the
influencer marketing is very new and it
is as I slot as I love to say it's the
latest shiny thing because it's you can
always just by looking at the headlines
and and reading media headlines you can
always see what the shiniest thing is
right now in influencer marketing is all
the rage what's funny it's the if you
look at all the articles about the power
of influence or marketing they tend to
be written by influencers which kind of
serves their ability to up the prices
but there's a lot of problems
underneath influencer marketing one of
which going on right now there is a
legal battle going on between a brand
and a blogger because that blogger had
inflated their user numbers now this was
found out when Facebook was trying to
purge a lot of bought accounts from
Facebook and once they did that this
bloggers Facebook numbers went down
dramatically about 50% and now the brand
was claiming that the the bloggers
purported to have many more followers
than they did and once the Facebook
purged the bots now we're looking at
half and some it's a misrepresentation
what was interesting is it didn't take
long for that blogger to boost those
numbers right back up there are services
out there where you can buy followers
and likes on any social network
I had the ad with me but it's it's it's
well known within the community that you
can buy followers and likes and so when
they publish their numbers you've got to
look at some way of verifying it but
there's no way of knowing how many of
their followers are bought accounts or
purchased accounts that like them or
follow them also which also hits to some
of the credibility aspect is many times
influencers if they're paid to post or
paid to review their audiences don't
always go along with it sometimes
because when they are doing something
that's paid and when they are promoting
something the voice is completely
different and as many users will call
them out for being a shill for a brand
when it's kind of contradictory to their
personality and so there are questions
about the depth of influence of many of
these influencers and the other downside
as many are very new to this market and
they're unfamiliar with contracts
they're unfamiliar with how to conduct
themselves when dealing with a brand and
the expectations and so again then that
gets to return on investment the ability
to measure
as you're dealing with more and more
people and now if you're developing if
you're using an influencer you can track
what comes to you but ultimately you are
subject to their measurements and all of
these things
so while influencer marketing can be
very powerful
it can develop followers and and really
even the best campaigns are really
sending I would say probably thousands
of new followers to you but I'm still
looking for many of those campaigns
which are providing tangible leads from
influencer marketing and actually those
campaigns are very difficult to find I I
see them taking place more on a smaller
scale targeted to more smaller more
defined audiences and those are the ones
that tend to generate more tangible
measurements and returns on investment
um also now this is the pro at that very
top we looked at some of the numbers
that influencer marketing can cost you
depending upon the type of influencer
however you don't have to go all out and
hit there you can look at multiple
methods of buying social placement and
it's at any range at the very bottom are
sponsored tweets then you can do some
sponsored posts with bloggers that costs
a few hundred you can buy social ads and
boost things you can do integrated ads
you can do programmatic buys which are
somewhere in the middle and again the
more you target them the less it costs
or the more you can put on the campaign
when you start looking at videos there's
production costs that go in there
however paid video right now is probably
one of the most effective means of
reaching an audience a study just came
out last week where pre-roll video
provides the highest brand recall of any
media as well it is seen as the least
intrusive of
advertising media so right now pre-roll
video is probably one of the most
effective means of reaching people
through social channels and the nice
thing is if you're doing it through
YouTube it reaches out it can go all on
people's Facebook it can go on blogs
other sites pre-roll hits people where
they are so depending upon your budget
depending upon the type of campaign you
want to run there are multiple price
points based on many factors determining
on how you want to reach the audience
you've got now the last one and then we
can open this up for questions
discussion whatever you want to do the
last thing is brand protection and
control when we're looking at social
placement one of the things that has
come out recently especially with the
rise of fake news when you are looking
at publishing content especially
sponsored content you know can you
control where that content shows up
online and may it show up next to a
promoted post of or promoted article
that is considered fake news and then
also when ads are going out when you are
programmatically trying to its target up
the users what if those users are on
hate sites or on pornography sites
places where you don't want your ad to
show but then also if you are partnering
with an influencer there have been cases
where influencers have asked for free
reign to develop the campaign and
ultimately what they create does not
match brand guidelines and it it really
takes the brand out of the brand
guidelines and and the control and so
there have been a few campaigns where
the brand has had to pull out and still
pay for the campaign but pull out of the
campaign and cancel it because the
influencer was in total control
of the messaging total control of the
campaign and total control to the point
where the brand felt it could not
publish ultimately what was created
because it didn't fit the voice it
didn't fit the control of the brand and
so a lot of factors that we've got to
control in social placement is you know
the personality the influencer and what
they want to do and how much control
they have also with fake news and hate
sites these are very and can I say very
explosive touch points right now in the
public mind and so being aware of where
your ads appear what they appear next to
can affect the public perception of your
brand and so more than ever
marketers need to be aware of where
their ads are showing up how they're
being perceived as well as maintaining
creative control of the message and the
brand positioning great and I want to
