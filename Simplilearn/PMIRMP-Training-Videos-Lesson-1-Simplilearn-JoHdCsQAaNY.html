certification course is based on two
books authored by PMI first is titled
project management body of knowledge
popularly called as PMBOK and the second
is titled practice standard for project
risk management
this lesson will introduce us to the
course let us look into the objectives
of this lesson in the next screen after
completing this lesson you will be able
to describe the PMI RMP certification
exam outline explain the eligibility
criteria for PMI RMP exam explain the
application processing timeline and the
exam syllabus lists the domains and
processes in project risk management let
us discuss the course overview in the
next screen as indicated in the first
screen this is an introductory lesson
and it introduces PMI and RMP there are
a few terms you will frequently
encounter in conversation with certified
professionals or people preparing for
this exam you will begin by

and 8 respectively lesson 9 deals with
plan risk responses and the last lesson
is on how to control risks once you are
through with all these lessons you can
go ahead and take out our outline
simulation tests let us start with some
information related to PMI RMP and PMI
and the next screen in this screen there
are terms and information related to PMI
RMP and BMI BMI stands for project
management institute it is a leading
organization based in US which actively
promotes the disciplines of program and
project management along with
supplementary specializations such as
agile risk and scheduling management so
it can be said that while PMI is an
organization PMI RMP is a certification
offered by PMI PMI RMP stands for
project management institute risk
management professional it is one among
the several certifications that PMI
offers for those who wish to specialize
in the area of managing risks in the
context of projects PMI RMP examination
is conducted by PMI through
testing centers across the world after
the certification one may have questions
out maintaining your credential the
certification is valid for three years
and you are required to earn and report
30 professional development units PDUs
within this three-year cycle to renew
the certification after this period to
renew your RMP credentials you need to
submit proof that you have acquired at
least 30 PDUs in the last three years
and have paid the PMI certificate
renewal fee once it is done the
certificate gets renewed for another
three years one can easily renew the
certificate online at WWE
