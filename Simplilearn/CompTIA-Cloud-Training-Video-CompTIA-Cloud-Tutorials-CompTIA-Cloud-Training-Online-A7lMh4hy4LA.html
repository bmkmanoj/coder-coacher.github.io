that are to be considered for the
enterprise's they are as mentioned below
reinvest the cost saved by using cloud
into security controls of the provider
and ordered to ensure the security and
compliance requirements are met as parts
of due diligence service providers have
to be provided with clear information of
the security procedures or the
governance structure currently in place
at the consumer end likewise the
providers governance processes should be
assessed for consistency with users
security management processes this helps
in designing risk mechanisms best
suitable for the organization
collaborative governance structure
between customer and providers must be
mandatory as part of the service risk
management protocol security department
should be involved during the
implementation of SLA s and signing of
agreements to ensure all security
requirements are enforceable under the
contract metrics and standards for
security management have to be in place
before migrating to cloud environments
enterprise's should understand their
current metrics and document how it will
change after migrating to cloud in cloud
the consumer does not have any physical
control over the infrastructure the
control of infrastructure management
rests with the cloud provider and risk
management here is done through SLA s
contractual agreements and documentation
between consumer and cloud provider due
to aspects such as multi-tenancy and
on-demand provisioning in cloud only
limited services are allowed to be
performed by the customer for example
audit processes are modified by the
providers to restrict the availability
of audit logs and active monitoring to
the customers
it is better if the customers have read
through the policies if the customers
internal processes demand complete
transparency then the customers are left
to choose different ways of assessments
or choose a different service provider
suitable for the enterprise and its
policies a risk management plan is an
essential part of corporate governance a
risk management approach has to be
designed after the identification and
valuation of assets threats or
vulnerability and its impact on assets
and the scenarios where risk management
is needed outcome of the risk management
plan should be incorporated in their
service agreement to ensure safety let
us continue with recommendations in the
next slide as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
