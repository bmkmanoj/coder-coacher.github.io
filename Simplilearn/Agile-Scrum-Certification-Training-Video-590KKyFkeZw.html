seven scrum planning welcome that lesson
seven of simply learns agile scrum
training program in this lesson we take
a long hard look at planning of scrum
project which will cover release
planning as well as sprint planning we
shall look at the levels of planning the
principles of planning as well as the
best practices that help us do a good
job at planning in the next slide we
will first look into the agenda
agender let us now look at the detailed
agenda for this lesson we start off by
setting up some first principles that
guide us through the planning of scrum
projects we look at the multiple levels
at which planning takes place and how
plans get progressively elaborated then
we look at release planning and sprint
planning with the help of some examples
and illustrations let us now talk about
the principles behind agile planning
principles behind agile planning
planning in agile in itself is an ITA
t'v activity unlike conventional
projects where plans are considered
watertight and concepts like baselining
of plans are prevalent agile recognises
the fact that plans are speculative
remember the agile manifesto which says
we value responding to change over
following a plan here are some of the
things to be kept in mind while starting
out on planning planning is speculative
you start out with a reasonable forecast
based on available information and
refine the plan as you go along the plan
is elaborated and becomes more and more
clear over a period of time planning is
based upon the principle of timeboxing
you start out by fixing the time and
resources available and then figure out
what can and what cannot be accomplished
with this the plan has to be necessarily
flexible and responsive to changes
planning is an ongoing activity one
should try not to panic too much into
plans the goal is not to be aggressive
with planning it is to be predictable
changes are inevitable in any project
and more so in agile because we want to
show working demos to customers and they
are guaranteed to want some changes
after seeing working software if your
plan is too tight you will not be
responsive enough to these changes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
