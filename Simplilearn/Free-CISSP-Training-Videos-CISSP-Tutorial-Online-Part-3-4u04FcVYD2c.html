security architecture and design of the
CISSP certification course offered by
simply learn security architecture and
design is one of the ten domains of
common body of knowledge or cbk for the
CISSP certification exam the first part
of this domain covers the logical models
required to keep the system secure the
second part covers evaluation models
which quantifies how secure the actual
system is and the third part covers the
hardware and the software required to
achieve a secure computer system the
objectives of this domain will be
discussed in the following screen
after completing this domain you will be
able to describe the architecture
frameworks describe the security models
list the types of evaluation criteria
describe the enterprise and system
security architecture list the types of
distributed systems recognized security
threats and identify countermeasures in
the first topic we will look at
architecture frameworks
Kevin Butler is a security administrator
in the network firewalls vision at nutri
Worldwide Inc he is preparing for his
CISSP exam as a part of his preparation
Kevin read the internal case study on
security architecture and design the
case study talks about the following in
the last financial year nutri Worldwide
Inc expected a large increase in IT
infrastructure requirements the
management felt the need to implement
best practices for IT Service Management
Hilda Jacob general manager of IT
security was assigned a task for
selecting best framework to help the
organization identify plan deliver and
support IT services to the business it
is important to know the different
security architecture and designs to
identify the right framework for such
requirements
Hilda had decided that the framework
would be ITIL Kevin understands that he
needs to learn the different security
architecture and designs to be well
prepared for his examination
let us start with our first topic
architecture framework which deals with
the creation and maintenance of a good
security architecture in this topic we
will define architecture frameworks and
list their uses we will also discuss the
common architecture frameworks
in this screen we will look at the
definition of architecture framework in
detail iso 4 2 0 1 0 defines
architecture framework as an
architecture framework establishes a
common practice for creating
interpreting analyzing and using
architecture descriptions within a
particular domain of application or
stakeholder community the role of the
security architect is to translate
business requirements in the security
solutions for key assets designs are
created using standardized methodologies
to maintain consistency between
different architects to ease the
acceptance of their designs security
architects can take advantage of common
architecture frameworks used across
multiple industries and disciplines an
architecture framework provides a
structure used for developing a broad
range of security designs the common
features of an architecture framework
are it describes a method for designing
a target state as an integrated set of
systems or system components it provides
a set of tools to ease architecture
development it provides a common
vocabulary it also frequently includes a
set of recommended standards and
operational practices it may also
include information on compliant vendor
products modules or components that can
be used as design elements within the
framework in the subsequent screen we
will talk about the common architecture
frameworks
in this stream we will discuss the
iso/iec 27001 and 2005 security
standards an information security
management system is ms is defined as
the governance structure supporting an
information security program iso/iec
27001 2005 is focused on the
standardization and certification of an
organization's is ms iso/iec - seven
zero zero 1 2005 provides instructions
on how to apply the is ms concept and to
construct run sustain and advance
information security management the
iso/iec 27001
2005 standard is focused on five key
areas they are general requirements of
the is ms management responsibility
internal is ms audits management review
of the is ms is ms improvement in the
next screen we will discuss ISO and IEC
27,000 - code of practice for
information security management
iso/iec two seven zero zero two provides
a code of practice for information
security management which lists security
control objectives and recommends a
range of specific security controls
according to the industry best practice
iso/iec two seven zero zero two includes
the following eleven focus areas
security policy provides management
guidance and support for information
security organization and information
security provides a formal and defined
security mechanism within an
organization that includes information
processing facilities and information
assets assessed or maintained by third
parties asset management protects the
organization's assets by ensuring
valuable data assets are identified and
receive appropriate protection Human
Resources security minimizes the risks
of human error theft and misuse of
resources it provides information
security threats and concerns to users
and disseminate information to support
the corporate security policy physical
and environmental security prevents
unauthorized physical access damage and
interference to facilities and data
communications and operations management
ensures the proper and secure operation
of data processing facilities by
protecting software communications data
and the supporting infrastructure as
well as ensuring proper data exchange
between organizations access control
limits access to data mobile
communications telecommunications and
network services as well as detect
unauthorized activities information
systems acquisitions development and
maintenance implement security controls
into operations and development systems
to ensure the security of application
systems software and data information
security incident management implements
procedures to detect and respond to
information security incidents business
continuity management mitigates an
incidents impact on critical business
systems compliance ensures adherence to
criminal and civil laws and statutory
regulatory or contractual obligations it
also complies with organizational
security policies in
and provides a comprehensive audit
process
the next topic is security models
security models are the rules to be
implemented to support and enforce
security policy in this topic we will
define security models discuss common
security models and look at a few
examples of security models
a security model is a specification that
describes the rules to be implemented to
support and enforce the security policy
a formal security model describes and
verifies the ability to enforce security
policy in mathematical terms formally
given the demands of formal verification
most models are focused on system level
security architecture at the component
level in most cases it would be too
difficult or time-consuming to formally
verify all aspects of large-scale
security architectures a cissp candidate
is expected to understand the general
types of security models as well as some
specific examples it is essential to
remember the ultimate goal addressed by
the model and how each new model builds
on the information provided by earlier
models in the next screen we will look
at the common security models
in the next few screens we will discuss
examples of security models let us start
with Bell lahpet Ola confidentiality
model Bella paddle a confidentiality
model is focused on maintaining the
confidentiality of objects its primary
goal is to prevent disclosure as the
model system moves from one state one
point of time to another Bell lahpet Ola
includes the following rules and
properties the simple security rule
states that a subject cannot read data
at a higher security level than they are
cleared for a subject can read all
documents at or below the level of
specified security
however the subject cannot read any
documents above the specified level of
security this is called a no read up or
in are you the rule prevents subjects
from learning secrets at a higher level
than their own for example a diplomat
can read documents intended for common
citizens however cannot read documents
intended for the president the star
property rule states that a subject
cannot write data to an object at a
lower security level the subjects can
write create or modify documents at or
above their level of security however it
cannot write documents below their level
this is called no write down or nwd this
rule prevents subjects from accidentally
leaking secrets at their level into a
document at a lower level for example a
diplomat can write documents intended
for the president however cannot write
documents for common citizens out of
concern that the diplomat may
accidentally leak sensitive information
to the common citizens the strong star
property rule states that a subject can
perform read and write functions only to
the objects at its same security level
some of the limitations of this model
are the following it only considers
confidentiality and does not mention
other properties such as integrity and
availability or more sophisticated modes
of access it does not address important
confidentiality goals such as
need-to-know and the ability to restrict
access to individual objects based on a
subject need to access them it does not
provide a mechanism for a one-to-one
mapping of individual subjects and
objects
talk about another example Biba
integrity model in this screen Biba
integrity model protects the integrity
of the information within a system and
the activities that take place it
addresses the first goal of integrity
Biba is often considered as the first
formal integrity model as it prevents
modifications of data by unauthorized
persons it is also known as data
integrity model Biba addresses the
shortcoming in the bill lopata model
where a subject at a lower security
level is able to overwrite and
potentially destroy secret information
at a higher level using the invocation
property Biba also addresses the problem
of one subject getting a more privileged
subject to work on their behalf the
following are the axioms of Biba
integrity model the simple integrity
axiom states that a subject cannot read
data at a lower integrity level the
subjects cannot read documents below
their level this is called no read down
or NRD for example a diplomat can read
documents written by the president but
cannot read documents written by common
citizens the star integrity axiom states
that a subject cannot modify an object
at a higher integrity level this is
called no write up or nwu for example a
diplomat can write procedures to be read
by common citizens but cannot write
procedures to be read by the president
in this screen we will discuss another
example of security models Clark Wilson
integrity model the clark wilson model
addresses the shortcomings in the Biba
model by focusing on integrity at the
transaction level in addressing three
major goals of integrity and a
commercial environment the Clark Wilson
integrity model provides a foundation
for specifying and analyzing an
integrity policy for a computing system
the model is primarily concerned with
formalizing the notion of information
integrity information integrity is
maintained by preventing corruption of
data items in a system due to either
error or malicious intent an integrity
policy describes how the data items in
the system should be kept valid from one
state of the system to the next and
specifies the capabilities of various
principles in the system the model
defines enforcement rules and
certification rules it addresses three
goals of integrity which are subjects
can access objects only to authorized
programs or access triple separation of
duties enforce and auditing is required
we will talk about the last examples of
security models Bruer nash graham
dinning and Harrison Russell Ullman
models in the next screen
following our other important security
models the Breuer and Nash model was
constructed to provide information
security access controls that can change
dynamically this security model is also
known as the Chinese wall model it was
designed to provide controls that
mitigate conflict of interest in
commercial organizations the Breuer and
Nash model is built upon an information
flow model in this model no information
can flow between the subjects and
objects in a way that would create a
conflict of interest the Graham dinning
model is a computer security model that
shows how subjects and objects should be
securely created deleted assigned rights
or privileges and how ownership of
objects is managed
it also addresses how to assign specific
access rights
this model is mainly used in access
control mechanisms or distributed
systems the Harrison Russo Ulman model
is similar to the Graham Deni model this
model is composed of a set of generic
rights and a finite set of commands it
is also concerned with situations where
a subject should be prevented from ever
gaining particular privileges to do so
subjects are prevented from accessing
programs or subroutines that can execute
a particular command for example to
grant read access
Kevin Butler the security administrator
at nutri Worldwide Inc wants to set up
different accesses to a set of folders
on network the access should be such
that some of his colleagues will have
read and write access while others are
allowed read-only access to the files in
the folder Kevin starts the process of
selecting a security model which
security model should Kevin Butler
implement in the given scenario the
one-to-one relationship among subjects
and objects is the focus of matrix based
model Kevin should choose the matrix
based model
let us move on to our next topic that is
evaluation criteria which are
established for the purpose of
objectively evaluating the security of a
system in this topic we will describe
evaluation criteria and its uses list
the types of evaluation criteria and
discuss certification and accreditation
we will also look at SEI cmmi
in this topic as well
in this screen we will talk about
evaluation criteria in its uses
evaluation methods and criteria are
designed to gauge the real world
security of systems and products the
following are the uses of evaluation
criteria evaluation methods and criteria
are designed to measure the real world
security of products and systems it
provides a common mechanism to evaluate
vendor products by certified third-party
evaluation labs the products are tested
against the set of security requirements
and the findings rating are published
the primary use of evaluation criteria
is it gives a level of security
assurance attached to the product
customers can select products based on
the evaluation rating let us look into
the various types of evaluation criteria
the following are the various types of
evaluation criteria trusted computer
system evaluation criteria or TC SEC
also called the orange book is the
oldest of the evaluation models
developed by the u.s. department of
defense in the 1980s
information technology security
evaluation criteria or IT sec is
european standard for security
evaluations IT SEC addresses
confidentiality integrity and
availability
whereas TC SEC evaluates only
confidentiality the International Common
Criteria represent an internationally
agreed-upon standard for describing and
testing the security of IT products the
payment card industry data security
standard PCI DSS was created by the
payment card industry security standards
council PCI SSC we will be looking into
each of these criteria in the subsequent
slides
the trusted computer system evaluation
criteria or TC SEC sets the basic
standard for the implementation of
security protections and computing
systems it was strongly focused on
enforcing confidentiality with no focus
on other aspects of security such as
integrity or availability TC SEC was
used to evaluate classify and select
computer systems being considered for
the processing storage and retrieval
of sensitive or classified information
on military and government systems to
assist with the evaluation of secure
products TC SEC introduced the idea of
trusted computing base TCB into product
evaluation the TCB comprises all the
protection mechanisms within a system
software hardware and firmware all of
these mechanisms need to work in an
orchestrated way to enforce all of the
requirements of a security policy when
evaluated these mechanisms are tested
their designs are inspected and their
supporting documentation is reviewed and
evaluated each of the TCS a sea-levels
describes a different set of fundamental
functions that must be in place to be
certified to that level the assurance
ratings defined are used to rate
products the main ratings are displayed
on the screen importantly it is the move
from DAC to m.a.c between the sea level
and B levels most commercial
general-purpose computing systems were
never intended for M AC and could only
achieve a c2 rating the more rigid
requirements for the higher B and a
levels also had the effect of limiting
the size and scope of the systems being
evaluated and made it highly impractical
for them to be used in the development
of highly complex distributed systems
the trusted network interpretation T&amp;amp;I
brings TC SEC concepts into the network
systems it is often called the red book
due to the color of its cover note that
TC SEC orange book does not address
network issues
in the next screen we will discuss the
information technology security
evaluation criteria
information technology security
evaluation criteria or IT sec addresses
confidentiality integrity and
availability
whereas TCS EC evaluates only
confidentiality security requirements
are not prescribed in IT SEC the
consumer or the vendor has the ability
to define a set of requirements from a
menu of possible requirements into a
security target or st and vendors
develop products the target of
evaluation or T OE and have them
evaluated against the target it provides
two sets of levels they are functional
levels and assurance levels which are
evaluated separately by IT SEC
functionality implies whether the system
does what it says and assurance implies
the confidence the organization has in
their security methods and the
capability to perform consistently
tested by examining development
practices documentation configuration
management and testing let us discuss
the common criteria for information
technology security evaluation in the
next screen
one of the most important evaluation
criteria is Common Criteria CC for
information technology security
evaluation it is the official name for
the international standard iso/iec
15,000 408 the International Common
Criteria represent an international set
of specifications and guidelines
developed for evaluation of information
security products especially to ensure
that the agreed-upon security standard
for government deployments are met the
thorough evaluation of computer security
product is assured by rigorous
evaluation of process of implementation
specification and testing of computer
security products this standard is
designed to avoid requirements beyond
the current state of the art it presents
a hierarchy of requirements for a range
of classifications and systems the
common criteria are the result of the
second major international information
security criteria effort following IT
SCC they use IT SEC terms such as target
of evaluation and security target CC
supersedes TC SEC and IT SEC let us look
into the evaluation process of Common
Criteria
the Common Criteria used the following
specific terms when defining specific
portions of the testing process
protection profile PP it is an
independent set of security requirements
and objectives for a specific category
of products or systems such as firewalls
and intrusion detection systems target
of evaluation t OE it is the system or
product which is being evaluated
security target s t it is the
documentation describing the target of
evaluation t OE including security
requirements and operational environment
evaluation assurance level ei L it is
the evaluation score of the tested
product or system in the next slide we
will discuss the common criteria levels
target of evaluation or t OE is
evaluated against one of seven
evaluation assurance levels ei ELLs
the ei L level is intended to provide
the consumer or the vendor with some
idea of how confident they should be in
the result of the evaluation based on
how much information was available to
the evaluation lab and how carefully was
the system examined the ei LS are as
follows ei l1 functionally tested ei l2
structurally tested ei l3 methodically
tested and checked ei l4 methodically
designed tested and reviewed ei l5 semi
formally designed and tested ei l6 semi
formally verified designed and tested ei
l7 formally verified designed and tested
ei ELLs are frequently misunderstood to
provide a simple means to compare
security products with similar levels
even if assigned the same ei L products
may be different since the functionality
may have little in common we have
covered three types of evaluation
criteria so far let us now discuss the
last type that is the payment card
industry data security standard
the payment card industry data security
standard or PCI DSS was created by the
payment card industry security standards
Council or PCI SSC PCI SSC is made up of
american express discover mastercard
visa and others it is intended to help
organizations proactively protect
customer account data it seeks to
protect credit cards by requiring
vendors using them to take specific
security precautions PCI DSS includes
requirements for security management
policies procedures network architecture
software design and other critical
protective measures with this we have
covered all the four types of evaluation
criteria let us now move on to the
certification and accreditation process
to evaluate the system
certification and accreditation or CNA
is the process used to evaluate and
approve a system for use these
activities are usually found in
government and military environments and
in highly regulated industries such as
pharmaceuticals into aeronautics
certification and accreditation is a
two-step process certification it is the
process of evaluation of a systems
architecture design and controls
according to the established evaluation
criteria accreditation it is the formal
management decision to approve the use
of a certified system the following are
the standards for certification and
accreditation FIS ma stands for federal
Information Security Management Act of
2002 it is a law that requires all
United States federal information
systems to conform to security standards
in processes used to evaluate them di
TSCA P stands for department of defense
information technology security
certification and accreditation process
it is the process used to certify and
accredit information systems used by the
United States military
dia CA P stands for the Department of
Defense information assurance
certification and accreditation process
it is the successor to the Department of
Defense information technology security
certification and accreditation process
and is used to certify and accredit
military information systems
NIAC AP stands for national information
assurance certification and
accreditation process it is the process
used to certify and accredit systems
that handle US national security
information DC ID 6x3
stands for Director of Central
Intelligence directive 6x3 it is the
process for protecting sensitive
compartmented information within
information systems at the United States
Central Intelligence Agency or CIA this
directive defined security standards
classification levels and the siene
process for certifying and accrediting
information systems
the product release reports for the last
year indicated a lag in product releases
in comparison to the product releases
done by nutri worldwide competitors in
the respective categories the management
felt the need to use SEI cmmi process
improvement model to improve engineering
and project management processes hilda
jacobs IT manager at nutri worldwide led
this initiative and Kevin volunteered to
be a part of this so that he could apply
what he had learned about SEI cmmi
process in real time Kevin worked with
the team that listed the engineering
process areas they were requirements
development product integration
technical solution requirements
management verification and validation
they also selected project planning
control and monitoring Hilda identify
the processes from the list of processes
which require continuous improvement and
important to the organization's business
objectives how many levels of process
improvement would have been followed by
the team led by Hilda there are five
levels defined by SEI cmmi for process
improvement
let us move to the next topic enterprise
security architecture this topic
describes how to ensure business
strategy and IT security are aligned in
this topic we will define enterprise
security architecture ESA and list the
common security services in ESA we will
also discuss the Sherwood applied
business security architecture framework
and si BS a matrix
enterprise security architecture or ESA
implements the building blocks of
information security infrastructure
across the entire organization the
primary purpose of creating enterprise
security architecture is to ensure that
business strategy and IT security are
aligned it focuses on a strategic design
for a set of security services that can
be leveraged by multiple applications
systems or business processes goals and
objectives of enterprise security
architecture our long-term view of
control a good architecture must be
comprehensive and simple to ensure the
organization gets the right level of
control to address the most common risks
it must also avoid unnecessary
duplication of services or complexities
that could compromise the business
benefits of the security services it
must be able to address control
requirements as they evolve over time
unified vision for common security
controls by providing this common
services model the architecture looks at
security controls from a holistic view
identifying potential gaps in those
controls and providing a long-term plan
for improvement existing technology
investment by focusing on what the
organization has already deployed the
architecture can take full advantage of
the internal skill sets and minimize the
need for training or staff augmentation
flexible approach the implementation of
the architecture should be flexible
enough to provide safeguards and
countermeasures for current and emerging
threats let us look at some common
security services in ESA in the next
screen
there are a number of security functions
that are suitable as foundations for
common security services in the
enterprise the following is a sample
classification of common security
services that may be used as building
blocks in enterprise security
architecture or ESA boundary control
services these services are concerned
with whether information is allowed to
flow from one set of systems to another
or from one state to another access
control services these services focus on
the identification authentication and
authorization of subject entities
whether human or machine as they are
deployed and employed to access to
organization's assets integrity services
integrity services focus on the
maintenance of high integrity systems
and data through automated checking to
detect and correct corruption
cryptographic services cryptographic
services focus on common services that
can be deployed and be used by a variety
of systems like public key
infrastructure or PKI audit and
monitoring services these services will
focus on the secure collection storage
and analysis of audited events through
centralized logging as well as the
events themselves through intrusion
detection systems and similar services
in the next screen we will look at
Sherwood apply to business security
architecture framework or ese BSA
sure would apply the business security
architecture framework or sa BSA is
intended to follow the same basic
outline provided by Zachman sa BSA is a
model and methodology for developing
risk driven enterprise information
security architectures and for
delivering security infrastructure
solutions that support critical business
initiatives the primary characteristic
of the sa BSA model is that everything
must be derived from an analysis of the
business requirements for security the
process analyzes the business
requirements at the outset and creates a
chain of traceability through the
strategy and concept design
implementation and ongoing manage and
measure phases of the life cycle to
ensure that the business mandate is
preserved framework tools are created
from practical experience to support the
whole methodology we will continue our
discussion on sa BS a framework in the
next screen
the model is layered with the top layer
being the business requirements
definition stage at each lower layer a
new level of abstraction and detailed is
developed from top to bottom the layers
define the conceptual architecture
logical architecture physical
architecture the selection of
technologies and products component
architecture and finally at the lowest
layer service management architecture
the s Absa model is generic and can be
the starting point for any organization
however by going through the process of
analysis and decision making implied by
its structure it becomes specific to the
enterprise and is highly customized to a
unique business model it becomes in
reality the enterprise security
architecture and it is central to the
success of a strategic program of
information security management within
the organization the S Absa matrix the
primary characteristic of the S Absa
model is that everything must be derived
from an analysis of the business
requirements for security and risk
management especially those in which
security has an enabling function
through which new business opportunities
can be developed and exploited the risk
management focus of s Absa embraces both
the notion of opportunity and threat and
the balance that must exist between
these two concepts the model is layered
with the top layer being the business
requirements definition stage at each
lower layer a new level of abstraction
is developed from top to bottom the
layers define the conceptual
architecture logical architecture
physical architecture the selection of
technologies and products component
architecture and finally at the lowest
layer service management architecture in
other words the shopping list in the
building trade known as the Bill of
Materials in addition the whole area of
security service Management
administration and operations is
addressed to the operational or service
management architecture in the figure
each of the six horizontal layers of
abstraction of the architecture model
contextual conceptual logical physical
component and service management has
been depicted
each of the sections has a series of
vertical cuts through each of the
horizontal layers answering the
questions what are you trying to do at
this layer the assets to be protected by
your security architecture why are you
doing it the motivation for wanting to
apply security expressed in the terms of
risk how are you trying to do it the
processes and functions needed to
achieve security who is involved the
people and organizational aspects of
security where are you doing it the
locations where you apply your security
when are you doing it
the time-related aspects of security
these six vertical architectural
elements are now summarized for all six
horizontal layers this gives a 6x6
matrix of cells which represents the
whole model for the enterprise security
architecture it is called the S ABS a
matrix C chart if you can address the
issues raised by each of these cells
then you will have covered the entire
range of questions to be answered and
you can have a high level of confidence
that your security architecture will be
complete the S ABS a process of
developing enterprise security
architecture is a process of populating
all these 36 cells the S abs a matrix
also provides two-way traceability
completeness has every business
requirement been met the layers and
matrix allow you to trace every
requirement through to the components
that provide a solution business
justification is every component of the
architecture needed when someone
questions why are we doing it this way
the rationale is planed by tracing the
business requirements that drive the
specific solution
Hilda Jacobs general manager IT security
is developing enterprise security
architecture for nutri Worldwide Inc the
organization has offices located across
many countries they wanted to implement
a uniform security control system
throughout the enterprise with the
business mandate to be preserved by a
chain of traceability Hilda is looking
for reference architecture to begin her
work Kevin had been a great contributor
in her last project she assigned this
task to Kevin which enterprise security
architecture ESA framework should Kevin
suggest in this scenario s a BSA
framework will help develop ESA for new
tree Worldwide Inc
we will start the next topic system
security architecture which is designing
security services within individual
computing systems in this topic we will
define systems security architecture
list the types of computing platforms
and also identify the system components
system security architecture is focused
on designing security services within
individual computing systems security
components can consume considerable
resources control is frequently
sacrificed in favour of improved
functionality usability or performance
there is a wide variety of computing
platforms available and each platform
will take a different approach to
providing security services the
architecture of these platforms is
fundamental to the ways that they
approach security requirements most
computing platforms will offer a wide
variety of security controls to help
protect sensitive assets being generated
transmitted or stored by the system the
CISSP candidate should understand that
basic building blocks that make up
modern computing systems as well as some
characteristics that distinguish types
of systems from each other most
importantly they should be aware of the
different ways security can be
implemented at the system level and be
able to choose which mechanisms would be
most appropriate in a given scenario
we will move on to the next topic
distributed systems which is a software
system in this topic we will define
distributed system and list the various
types of distributed systems let us
start with the definition of distributed
systems in the next screen
distributed systems can be defined as a
software system in which components
distributed on network computers pass
messages to communicate and coordinate
their actions servers personal computers
workstations etc can be part of a
distributed system the goal is to make
distributed network components work as a
single computer in the next screen we
will look at the different types of
distributed systems
Hilda Jacobs general manager IT security
is under the pressure of bringing the IT
infrastructure cost under control due to
the increased cost of operations and
reduced budgets she takes a decision
that networking components storage
hardware and servers that are used to
support operations will be out sourced
Hilda Jacobs requests quotations from
various vendors to provide the services
required by nutri Worldwide Inc she
assigned the task of selecting the best
service model that would suit this
requirement to Kevin this is a great
opportunity for Kevin to apply his
understanding of the different service
models which service model should Kevin
select based on the requirements of
Nucci Worldwide Inc platform as a
service would be the model Kevin should
choose this service model provides the
network's servers storage and other
services that are required to host the
consumers application
the last topic of this lesson is
security threats and countermeasures
which describes the security
architecture and design vulnerabilities
and countermeasures to reduce the
associated risk in this topic we will
discuss the system vulnerabilities and
threats and also list the best practices
let us start with system vulnerabilities
and threats in the next screen
let us first discuss covert channels
covert channel it is an authorized
hidden channel of communications that
exists within a legitimate
communications channel it can be
difficult to detect a covert Channel
there are two types of covert channels a
covert storage channel involves a
storage location used by a target system
the location may be a memory location a
disk sector or a file the unauthorized
third party may be able to directly or
indirectly read the storage location and
gain some level of knowledge about the
information stored there
a covert timing channel uses observable
timings seen in an information system to
determine what is happening in the
system backdoors a backdoor is a
shortcut in a system which allows a user
to bypass security checks such as
username password authentication to log
in attackers will often install a
backdoor after compromising a system
maintenance hookups are a type of
backdoor they are shortcuts installed by
system designers and programmers to
allow developers to bypass normal system
checks during development eg requiring
users to authenticate maintenance hooks
become a security issue if they are left
in production systems TOC tto you race
conditions a time of check to time of
use or TOC tto you bug it's a defect in
software or hardware that can result in
a malfunction or security violation in a
system also known as a race condition a
TOC tto you bug is one where changes in
a system occur between the checking of a
condition and the use that results from
the check here is an example to users
wish to open a file for exclusive use
the program that each user is running
first check to see if the file is in use
the program for each user reports that
the file is not opened by anyone due to
that both users programs open the file
expecting that they each have exclusive
use of the file malicious code malware
malicious code or malware is the generic
term for any type of software that
attacks an application or system there
are many types of malicious code that
can cause damage to targeted systems
among them viruses worms Trojans and
logic bombs zero-day exploits are
malicious code a threat for which there
is no vendor supplied patch meaning that
there is an unpatched vulnerability
computer viruses worms and trojans
computer viruses are malware that does
not spread automatically they require a
carrier usually human and are frequently
spread via floppy disk and more recently
portable USB Universal Serial bus memory
types of viruses include macro a virus
written in macro language eg Microsoft
Office or Microsoft Excel macros boot
sector a virus that infects the boot
sector of a PC which ensures that the
virus loads upon system startup stealth
a virus that hides itself from the OS
and other protective software such as
antivirus software polymorphic a virus
that changes its signature upon
infection of a new system attempting to
evade signature based antivirus software
multi-part a virus that spreads via
multiple sectors
worms are malware that self propagates
ie spreads independently a Trojan also
called a Trojan horse is malware that
performs two functions one benign such
as a game and one malicious rootkits a
rootkit is a malware that replaces
portions of the kernel and/or operating
system a user mode rootkit operates in
ring 3 on most systems replacing
operating system components in user land
a kernel-mode rootkit replaces the
kernel or loads malicious loadable
kernel modules kernel-mode rootkits
operate in ring 0 on most operating
systems logic bombs a logic bomb is a
malicious program that is triggered when
a logical condition is met such as after
a
of transactions have been processed or
on a specific date a time bomb in this
case now where such as worms often
contain logic bombs behaving in one
manner and then changing tactics on a
specific date and at a specific time XML
extensible markup language XML is
designed as a standard way to encode
documents and data it is similar to HTML
and is used on the web however not tied
to it
XML can be used to store application
configuration to output from auditing
tools and for many other tasks
extensible means the users may use XML
to define their own data formats
security assertion markup language saml
is an XML based framework for exchanging
security information including
authentication of data some forms of
single sign-on SSO use saml to exchange
data applets applets are small pieces of
mobile code that are embedded in other
software such as web browsers unlike
HTML hypertext markup language which
provides a way to display content
applets are executable applets can be
written in a variety of programming
languages two prominent applet languages
are Java by Oracle Sun Microsystems and
ActiveX by Microsoft
the term applet is used for Java control
for ActiveX however they are
functionally similar
in this screen we will discuss the best
practices which can be used to control
the system vulnerabilities and threats
the best practices are process isolation
data hiding abstraction cryptographic
protections process isolation is a
logical control that attempts to prevent
one process from interfering with
another this is a common feature among
multi-user operating systems such as
linux unix or recent market soft Windows
systems data hiding maintains activities
at different security levels to separate
these levels from each other this assist
in preventing data at one security level
from being seen by processes operating
at other security levels abstraction
hides unnecessary detail from the user
the computer is a complex machine and
the more complex of processes the less
secure it is abstraction provides a way
to manage complexity cryptographic
protection can be used in a variety of
ways to protect sensitive system
functions and data by encrypting
sensitive information and limiting the
availability of key material data can be
hidden from less privileged parts of the
system
let us summarize the topics covered in
this domain an architecture framework
provides a structure used for developing
a broad range of security designs
security models are the rules to be
implemented to support and enforce
security policy the various types of
evaluation criteria are trusted computer
system evaluation criteria information
technology security evaluation criteria
common criteria and payment card
industry data security standard
enterprise security architecture
implements the building blocks of
information security infrastructure
across the entire organization system
security architecture is focused on
designing security services within
individual computing systems the various
types of distributed systems are
virtualization hypervisor cloud
computing grid computing and
peer-to-peer the best practices which
can be used to control system
vulnerabilities and threats are process
isolation data hiding abstraction and
cryptographic protections
in the next domain we will learn about
physical security in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
