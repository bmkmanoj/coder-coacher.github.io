hello and welcome to the introduction to
cloud security course based on CCS K
syllabus offered by simply learn this
introductory domain will give us a brief
account on the certificate of cloud
security knowledge and its objectives we
will begin by looking into the agenda of
this domain in the next slide in this
domain we will discuss what exactly is
certificate of cloud security knowledge
cloud security alliance ccs k
examination the objectives of this
certification
and the question pattern for this
certification exam in addition we will
also take into account what the tutorial
will cover with respect to the exam list
of practice questions for professionals
domain mapping and other reference
materials that are available for the
preparation moving on let us understand
what certificate of cloud security
knowledge also known as CCS k is in the
next slide
the certificate of cloud security
knowledge is the industry's first user
certification for secure cloud computing
CCS k is designed to ensure that a broad
range of professionals were the
responsibility related to cloud
computing have a demonstrated awareness
of the security threats and best
practices for securing the cloud
although it is not mandatory it is
recommended that the candidate should
work for at least six months in an
environment that markets or relies on IT
related services before appearing for
this exam
we will find out more about cloud
security Alliance in the following slide
Security Alliance CSA is a nonprofit
organization with a mission to promote
the use of best practices for providing
security assurance within cloud
computing and to provide education on
the uses of cloud computing to help
secure all other forms of computing
our security alliance is led by a broad
coalition of Industry practitioners
corporations associations and other key
stakeholders
the issues and opportunities of cloud
computing gained considerable notice in
2008 within the information security
community
at the is si si is zero forum in Las
Vegas in November of 2008 the concept of
the cloud security alliance was born
following a presentation of emerging
trends by Jim Rivas that included a call
for action for securing cloud computing
Rivas and Nils poolman outlined the
initial mission and strategy of the CSA
a series of organizational meetings with
industry leaders in early December 2008
formalized the founding of the CSA
outreach of the CSA to the information
security community to create initial
work product for the 2009 RSA Conference
resulted in dozens of volunteers to
research author edit and review the
first white paper
in the next slide we will discuss the
various objectives of CCS k
the exam comprises a total of 60
questions to be answered within the
duration of 90 minutes the passing score
is 80 percent and the exam is offered in
English although it is not mandatory a
minimum of six months experience in an
IT services related organization is
recommended we will now look into the
CCS K exam question pattern the CCS K
exam consists of multiple choice
questions which covers all the cloud
security domains
in few instances the question may
represent a scenario or a problem
description or a description of a
situation there may be two or more
questions based on the scenario or
problem description or a description of
a situation there is no penalty for
wrong answers no negative marking all
questions can be answered
not passed the test in first attempt
test participants received two
opportunities to pass the test while the
participants may take their second
attempt as soon as they wish
we highly recommend studying the source
material again prior to taking the test
because of question randomization one
may see a very different exam with
mostly different questions let us
understand more about this tutorial in
the following slide
this tutorial comprises a total of 14
domains of which this is the
introductory one
to see CSK we have the domains such as
cloud architecture governance and
enterprise risk management legal issues
such as contracts and electronic
discovery compliance and audit
management information management and
data security interoperability and
portability traditional security
business continuity and disaster
recovery data center operations and also
Incident Response
some more important information about
this tutorial is discussed in the next
slide
in addition to the domains mentioned
earlier we will also look into
application security encryption and key
management identity entitlement and
access management virtualization and
lastly security as a service there are
quizzes at the end of each domain we
also provide three set of test papers to
make one we're prepared for the exam
let us find out more about the practice
questions provided by simply learn
in our course we have provided questions
after each key chapters and a set of
practice questions at the end of each
domain
the practice questions are to indicate
how questions could be presented in the
exam and should not be used as a source
of knowledge
practice questions may or may not be
similar to questions that will appear on
the actual exam practice questions
should not be considered as a
measurement of a candidate's ability to
answer questions correctly in the exam
for that area
actual exam questions will test the
candidates practical application of the
knowledge we will move on to domain
mapping now
domaine one architecture
in this domain we will understand the
definition of cloud computing essential
characteristics of cloud cloud service
and deployment models available
additionally understand about
multi-tenancy csa reference cloud
reference model jericho cloud cube model
cloud security reference model cloud
service brokers and service level
agreements
domaine to governance and enterprise
risk management
here we will learn about the contractual
security requirements enterprise and
information risk management third-party
management recommendations examining the
supply chain and use of cost savings for
cloud
in the next slide we will discuss
mapping domain 3 &amp;amp; 4
domaine three legal issues contracts and
electronic discovery in this domain we
will look into these several
considerations of cloud related issues
in three dimensions they are a discovery
considerations jurisdictions and data
locations liability for activities of
subcontractors and due diligence
responsibility also Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure and electronically
stored information metadata and
litigation hold domain for compliance
and audit management in this domain we
will define compliance the right to
audit cap rights impact on cloud
contracts audit and compliance scope
compliance analysis requirements and
also auditor requirements let us look
into the remaining domains
domaine five information management and
data security
in this domain we will look into the six
phases of the data security lifecycle
and their key elements such as volume
storage object storage logical versus
physical locations of data three valid
options for protecting data data loss
prevention detection data migration to
the cloud we will also look into
encryption in IaaS paas and SaaS
database activity monitoring and file
activity monitoring data backup data
