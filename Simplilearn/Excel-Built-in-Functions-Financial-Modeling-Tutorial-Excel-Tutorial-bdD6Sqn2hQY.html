module to be part 2 using Excel built-in
functions introduction hello and welcome
to the lesson on using Excel built-in
functions or the financial modelling
course by simply learn this lesson
continues with our financial modeling
but now we have established how to
manipulate our data we will move on to
more complex Excel built-in functions
for analyzing our data now let's move on
to our agenda agenda in this section
we'll be making use of Excel statistical
functions such as mean and standard
deviation calculations statistical
analysis provides an understanding of
our data using statistics we can
determine an average value a variation
of the data from this average a range of
data values and subsequently show how
these can be used for option pricing and
other interesting applications many
investment products and financial assets
have different terms for example when
calculating the price of bonds under a
30 day / month we will need to use some
excel day counting functions we will
show you how to do this later lastly we
will show how to manage text data in
spreadsheets with the large tables of
data that are needed in financial models
text strings can be an issue we may need
to look up on a certain value within a
text string to do this we can break the
string down extract text or combine text
now let's get started with this section
call functions in mathematics and
statistics the mean is another name for
the average the mean is calculated by
adding all of the values together then
dividing by the number of original
values in Excel the average function
will automatically calculate a mean for
a given data set if we look at our Excel
worksheet we have a list of assets in a
fund and their return to date using the
average function equals average open
brackets range or range underscore name
close brackets we can calculate the mean
return for the fund as a whole another
important value standard deviation is a
square root of the variance which
measures the difference between the mean
of the data set and the individual
values the parameter for this function
is also just the range of data for which
we are calculating the standard
deviation equals stdev open brackets
range or range underscore name close
bracket standard deviation is applied to
the annual rate of return of an
investment to measure the investment
volatility the higher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
