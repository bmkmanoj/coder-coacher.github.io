kms is the complete set of integrated
repositories or databases that are used
to manage knowledge and information the

management system as well as other tools
and databases There s km s stores
manages updates and presents all
information that an IT service provider
needs to manage the full lifecycle of
its services the main purpose of the s

the CMS is maintained by service asset
and configuration management and is used
by all IT service management processes
two major components of CMS are CMDB or
configuration management database
it stores configuration details of the
IT infrastructure ke DB or known error
database the database is created by
problem management and is used by
incident and problem management however
the s km s is a broader concept that
covers a much wider base of knowledge
for example the experience of staff
records of peripheral matters for
example user numbers and behavior
organization's performance figures
suppliers and partners requirements
abilities and expectations typical and
anticipated user skill levels and so on
this brings us to the end of Service

service transition module we will
discuss release and deployment
