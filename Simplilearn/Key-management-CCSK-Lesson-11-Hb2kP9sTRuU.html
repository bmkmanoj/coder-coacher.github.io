used for encryption or decryption
management's of keys in a public cloud
environment can be a very complicated
process as discussed earlier in the
domain the multi-tenancy model can
create issues
encryption engines encrypt the data on
their way out of cloud and decrypt on
their way in and the encryption keys are
maintained within enterprise
the process gets complicated if the same
key is used for multiple processes such
as to decrypt and encrypt in cloud using
the same key therefore instead of
sharing the same key for applications
batch process etc enterprises can use a
cryptographic engine for each user or
entity could be a user code a device
organization this way specific keys that
remove complexities are used in key
management likewise if an entity needs
to share data within a group setting
then group level keys can be maintained
another problem with public cloud
environment is to ensure that all data
is removed from public cloud
environments while exiting especially
information such as PII or SPI or any
data subject to regulatory compliance
a--'s has to be removed from cloud
backup etc again maintaining Keys
locally is the solution removing or
deleting the stored key from the system
can ensure that the data will not be
decrypted
the provider must have a clear
segregation of duties such as access to
servers or having encrypted data in
servers this is cause for concern both
service providers and end-users should
take vigorous measures in managing keys
to mitigate these issues measures have
to be taken while designing the
architecture itself having inbuilt
controls that protect the keys storing
keys of the key servers etc are
architectural solutions which will
ensure efficient management of keys also
end-users maintaining keys from their
end should avoid storing them on devices
which do not have the same level of
control as an encryption</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
