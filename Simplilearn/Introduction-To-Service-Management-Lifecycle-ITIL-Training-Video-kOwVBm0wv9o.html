2011 foundation certification course
offered by simply learn this unit
includes 2 lessons and provides an
overview of the service management
lifecycle it will help you to provide
appropriate service solutions to
businesses customers and users let us
move on to the first lesson principles
of IT Service Management in the next
screen
this lesson covers the key concepts
related to service management we will
also focus on stakeholders associated
with service management let us look at
the objectives of this lesson in the
next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to explain the concept of best
practices and identify the stakeholders
in service management in addition you
will be able to describe service
management roles and responsibilities
you will also be able to explain the
types of service providers in the next
screen we will discuss the best
practices in IT Service Management
IT Service Management is the
implementation and management of quality
IT services that meet the needs of a
business it is performed by IT service
providers through an appropriate mix of
people process and information
technology IT service management
includes best practices or processes
that have been successfully followed by
many organizations apart from the fact
that they have evolved from successful
innovations best practices and open
standards are widely accepted best
practices are derived from several
sources few such sources are existing
public standards such as those published
by the international standards
organization or ISO industry practices
that are shared among industry
practitioners academic research and
internal experiences or an
organization's past experiences in
providing similar services best
practices are sometimes called public
practices in the next screen we will
look at the reasons to choose best
practices as opposed to proprietary
practices
there are a number of reasons for
preferring public practices over
proprietary practices public practices
are widely distributed among a large
community of professionals through
publicly available training and
certification whereas proprietary
practices are deeply embedded in
organizations therefore it is difficult
to replicate the same environment public
practices are applied across many
technologies and businesses these
practices are reviewed by peers and used
by different parties but proprietary
practices are highly customized to
support specific business needs
they are also hard to adapt or we use
public practices are available for free
and it is easier for organizations to
hire people with the knowledge of such
practices
whereas proprietary practice is owned by
someone who will charge for the
evolution of proprietary practices
depends on the owner and cannot be
guaranteed for example you are in the
midst of an online training for a
technical course and you find out that
the course is not up to date the
organization that developed the course
is out of business so you will be stuck
paying for the course and receiving
outdated knowledge now let us do a quick
recall of the concepts covered
service is a means of delivering value
to customers by facilitating outcomes
the customer wants to achieve without
the ownership of specific costs or risks
let us take an example to understand
this further suppose an online bookstore
is looking for a repository or database
to store all the data related to their
online book selling business such as
book details customer details and so on
the required outcome is online sale of
books one of the activities facilitating
the outcome is storage of data the book
store is not specialized in managing
storage as an IT service and therefore
does not want to manage the associated
costs and risks which may arise due to
infrastructure staff facilities and so
on
however there are organizations in the
market that are willing to handle the
risk for a cost these organizations are
called service providers they have the
specialized knowledge and experience as
well as the confidence to control the
associated costs and risks so the
bookstore agrees to pay for the database
service provided by the service provider
under specific terms and conditions thus
the service provider provides value to
the customer that is the online book
store by managing their database and the
costs and risks in the next screen we
will focus on service management
service management is the effective
process driven management of
transforming IT resources into valuable
IT services the image shows the link
that has to be preserved between the
desired business outcomes and the
services that service management is
responsible for let us understand the
terms used in the image two types of
assets are used by both organisations
and customers these are capabilities and
resources capabilities are the functions
use to manage services capabilities are
intangible assets of an organization and
cannot be purchased but have to be
developed and matured over time they
include people knowledge processes
organization and management resources is
a generic term that includes people
information applications IT
infrastructure and financial capital
that help to deliver an IT service
resources other tangible assets of an
organization the resources and
capabilities used by the service
provider to offer services to customers
are called service assets let us take
the example of an organization providing
email as a service this organization
needs to have hardware such as servers
routers and switches to relay emails
they should also have software such as
Gmail to let users read their emails the
hardware and software mentioned here are
examples of assets such an organization
also needs a capable team to manage
these assets and the money required to
procure these assets if the customers of
the organization do not know how to get
the email service all these assets go
waste so some of the critical underlying
elements of getting an email service are
how to get an email account how to
maintain it and where to go for support
if issues occur the capabilities and
resources used by the customer to
achieve business outcomes are called
customer assets there are certain
methods or processes to ensure that the
delivery of services is effective this
helps to maintain a link between the
desired business outcomes and the
services that service management is
responsible for now let us understand
two more terms which are performance and
value
performance is a measure of what is
achieved or delivered by a system person
team process or IT service considering
the example of email as a service
effective use by all users the number of
mails delivered to the intended
recipients and so on are some of the
performance measures of the service now
let us define value the value is a
measure of the return on investment or
benefit to a business for example the
invention of email has led to faster
flow of information and quick
decision-making by businesses unlike the
postal service the result is a growth in
business outcome or revenue next we will
focus on service management practice
there is no single best management
practice that fits every company there
are several sources of service
management practices that fulfill the
objectives of a business the image shows
some of the services of service
management practices there are certain
enablers that define how these sources
may be used the enablers help to
determine the practice that can serve
the purpose of any business or
organization the employees play a key
role in the organization the use of
technology may facilitate service
management in addition to the sources
and enablers there are several drivers
and scenarios that help decide which
service management practice should be
chosen laws such as sarbanes-oxley
influence the way businesses operate
competition may also shape the way of
business functions that is because the
business needs to stay competitive for
its survival in the market the customers
of the business will want the
organization's to operate in alignment
with their needs
thus public frameworks and standards
should not be ignored the organization
should cultivate their proprietary
knowledge based on public standards and
frameworks coordination and
collaboration across organizations
become easier based on shared practices
and standards in the next screen we will
focus on the challenges in service
management
the challenges and service management
are firstly the nature of output in
service management is intangible
secondly the output is hard to control
measure and validate thirdly customers
assets such as applications processes
transactions and documents arrive based
on the demand and these stimulate
service production so demand is
associated with customers assets
fourthly there is hardly any buffer
between the creation of the service and
its consumption by the customer finally
service capacity and output are of
perishable nature this means that
service providers need to ensure there
is a steady source of supply to satisfy
the customers demands the supply should
have consistent quality in the next
screen we will discuss the benefits of
IT Service Management
the benefits of IT Service Management
our service provision is of high quality
because people associated with it are
aware of their responsibilities the
service quality is cost-effective the
services satisfied the demands of
customer user and business the processes
used are centralized and integrated with
each other next we will focus on the
stakeholders in service management
there are two types of customers for any
organization customers who work in the
same organization as the IT service
provider are termed as internal
customers for example the marketing
department in an IT company is their
internal customer because it uses IT
services if the organization charges the
department for the IT services the
payment made is considered as an
internal transaction in the
organization's accounting system the
payment is not considered as revenue
earned by the organization customers who
are in a legally binding contract with
the service provider and purchase
services from the latter are termed as
external customers they are not employed
by the organization for example an
online bookseller getting IT services
from an IT service provider is an
external customer in the next screen we
will discuss internal and external
services
services delivered to business units
within the same organization are called
internal services whereas services
delivered to an external organization
are called external services the concept
of internal and external services are
explained further with an image shown on
the screen in this image the IT
department is providing services to
business units which belong to the same
organization such services are known as
internal services for example the sales
department is an internal customer using
the CRM services provided by the IT
department the same IT department is
providing services to the customers who
are external to the organization these
services are considered as external
services let us further understand the
facts related to internal and external
services internal services support
activities within an organization but
external services result in business
outcomes it is vital to link the
internal services to the external
services which is helpful in measuring
the business outcomes this also enables
you to measure the ROI or return on
investment next we will focus on what a
process is and how it is related to
providing quality services
a process is a set of activities
designed to accomplish a specific
objective it takes defined inputs and
turns them into defined outputs a
process may include roles
responsibilities tools and management
controls required to deliver the outputs
let us take a look at the image that
describes a process a process or an
activity within a process is initiated
by a trigger a trigger may be the
arrival of an input or any other event
for example the failure of a server may
trigger event management and incident
management processes the central box in
the image indicates the elements of a
process as mentioned earlier a process
is a set of activities with established
procedures and work instructions so it
has to be measured and then improved
with the help of metrics a process may
include roles and responsibilities to
carry out the activities involved in it
the process control section shows
various entities to control the process
the process owner governs and controls
the process he is accountable for the
effectiveness and efficiency of the
process processes once defined should be
documented and controlled a process is
organized around a set of objectives
with process controls the lowermost
section in the image indicates the
process enablers which are the
requisites for a process resources and
capabilities are required to deliver
control and manage the process
activities they also help to produce the
required process outputs a process
produces various outputs including
process reports and reviews in the next
screen we will focus on process
characteristics
all processes have the following common
characteristics firstly processes are
measurable managers want to measure cost
quality and other variables
while the doers of the process are
concerned with duration and productivity
secondly processes help to deliver
specific results the primary output of a
process is delivered to customers and
stakeholders finally a process responds
to specific events known as triggers
in the screen we will discuss functions
in ITIL terminology function includes a
team of people and the tools they need
to carry out one or more processes or
activities functions are the units of an
organization which specialized in
performing certain types of work they
are responsible for specific outcomes
ITIL 2011 delivers various functions
which are shown on the screen the
service desk of an IT organization is
the single point of contact where a
business sense
operational requests requests for
changes such as relocations and
installation orders are sent to the
service desk users also make support
requests and service requests such as
questions on internal training or
documentation IT operations is an
independent function in an IT
organization IT operations management
includes continuous activities related
to IT service delivery it also includes
the control and maintenance of IT
infrastructure this ensures that IT
services are delivered based on the
service level agreement or SLA IT
operations management has two roles such
as operations control and facility
management operations control includes
job scheduling procedures for backup and
restore processing of console management
and so on facility management is related
to managing the physical IT environment
this includes Network rooms data center
rooms power supply and so on technical
management is aimed at designing
cost-effective technological
infrastructures that can support
business processes the technical
management team is involved in designing
testing and optimizing IT services it
provides resources that support the ITSM
lifecycle the application management
function helps to manage applications
for their entire lifecycle it provides
the resources for the ITSM lifecycle
application management also plays a key
role in designing testing and improving
applications in the next screen we will
discuss how processes and functions
operate
a process-oriented organization
successfully aligns processes across
functions this allows the functions to
maintain their effectiveness while the
efficiency of the organization improves
with the result of increased customer
satisfaction in the image shown on the
screen the various functions like
operations development etc and their sub
functions follow a single process that
is indicated by a dotted line while the
functions concentrate on managing
resources the process focuses on service
delivery one of the techniques used to
map the functions and departments to
processes is the RACI model next we will
focus on the roles in service management
two key roles in service management of
the service owner and the process owner
the service owner is the person who is
accountable for the delivery of a
specific IT service they are responsible
for continual improvement and management
of change affecting services under their
care the service owner is accountable
for a specific service within an
organization regardless of where the
underpinning technology components
processes or professional capabilities
reside service ownership is as critical
to service management as establishing
ownership for processes which cross
multiple vertical departments an example
of service owner is the owner of a
payroll service for a global MNC this
service may be delivered to employees
across the globe through a website that
may be hosted in a data center in
Ireland and supported by teams in India
irrespective of the underlying
technology mechanisms and geography the
owner is accountable for the effective
delivery of the service this ensures
that each employee of the MNC gets their
pay on a predefined date every month now
let us define a process owner a process
owner is responsible for ensuring that a
process is being performed as agreed and
documented click the images to know more
about the responsibilities of service
owners and process owners the service
owner is the key person to be contacted
for service inquiries and issues he
makes sure that customer needs are met
through consistent support and delivery
services the service owner also
identifies opportunities for service
requirements in addition the service
owner maintains liaison with the process
owners during the service management
life cycle the service owner also
solicits the reports statistics and
other data required for analysis finally
he ensures effective service monitoring
and performance
let us understand the responsibilities
of the process owner the process owner
performs tasks such as documenting and
publishing the process defining the key
performance indicators or KPIs to
evaluate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the process engaging in
process design and being responsible for
it
reviewing any proposed enhancement to
the process addressing any issue related
to the way the process runs making sure
that the staff has the required training
in the process and are aware of their
roles in it ensuring that processes
roles responsibilities and documents are
regularly reviewed and audited and
interfacing with the line management and
ensuring that the process receives the
needed staff resources sometimes the
process owner may have to perform the
role of a process manager the
responsibilities of the process manager
include planning and coordination of all
activities required to carry out monitor
and report on the process there may be
several process manages for one process
for example regional change managers or
IT service continuity managers for each
data center
however in larger organizations the
roles of the process manager and the
process owner may be separate in the
next screen we will focus on the RACI
the RACI model is used to identify the
roles and responsibilities in a process
RACI stands for responsible accountable
consulted and informed responsible
refers to the people or person
responsible for carrying out various
tasks the tasks imply the actual work to
be performed accountable refers to the
person accountable for various
activities it implies taking ownership
of the activities included in the
process only one person can be
accountable for each activity consulted
refers to the people whose opinions are
sought after designing implementing or
improving an activity these people are
expected to have an influence on the
activities in the process informed
refers to the people who are informed
while executing or improving an activity
there can be only one person accountable
but multiple people responsible for an
activity in the next screen we will
focus on an example related to the RACI
model
the table given here shows the RACI
model based on the roles and
responsibilities related to activities
in a process it lists some activities
and shows whether the service owner
process owner security manager and so on
are responsible or accountable for a
certain activity it also lists the
activities they are consulted for or
informed about next we will focus on the
types of service providers
we will first explain what a supplier is
and follow up with the definition of a
contract ITIL defines the term supplier
as a third party responsible for
supplying goods or services that are
required to deliver IT services
commodity software and hardware vendors
outsourcing organizations and telecom
and network providers are suppliers now
let us define an underpinning contract
an underpinning contract is a legal
agreement between the service provider
and the supplier the agreement between
the business organization and the IT
service provider is called service level
agreement now let us do a quick recall
of the concepts related to roles in
service management
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson
best practices are successful
innovations that have been accepted and
followed by organizations service
management helps to transform IT
resources into valuable IT services
stakeholders are interested in the
target resources activities and outcome
of a service or a project the service
owner is responsible for providing a
specific service within an organization
the process owner ensures that a process
is performed as decided and documented
next we will focus on the second lesson
the service lifecycle
this lesson gives an overview of how the
different components or phases of
service management lifecycle interact
let us explore the objectives of this
lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to identify the components or
phases of service management lifecycle
in addition you will be able to explain
the relationship between governance and
IT Service Management in the next screen
we will focus on the components or
phases of service management lifecycle
the image illustrates how the service
lifecycle is initiated from a change in
the requirements of a business these
requirements are identified and agreed
in the service strategy stage within a
service level package or SLP and a
defined set of business outcomes this
passes to the service design stage where
a service solution is produced together
with a service design package or SDP the
service design package includes
everything necessary to take this
service through the remaining stages of
the lifecycle the SDP passes to the
service transition stage where the
services evaluated tested and validated
in this stage the service knowledge
management system or s kms is updated
the service is also transitioned into
the live environment where it enters the
service operation stage the continual
service improvement identifies
opportunities for the improvement of
weaknesses or failures within any stage
of the lifecycle in the next screen we
will focus on the relationship between
governance and ITSM the image shown on
this slide demonstrates how corporate
governance is related to IT Service
Management corporate governance deals
with establishing corporate policies
strategic directions and objectives it
also includes the identification of
critical success factors and key result
areas for an organization corporate
governance ensures that strategies and
business plans are in place corporate
compliance assures the governance of all
legal industrial and regulatory rules
being followed while executing the
corporate strategy IT governance
establishes enables and executes the IT
strategy it establishes operations to
ensure that high quality compliant IT
services are provided such governance
also ensures that the IT organization
meets
key result areas IT compliance is a part
of corporate compliance it provides
assurance to IT governance that all the
IT policies directions processes
controls and rules are being complied
with IT Service Management aids in
implementing and managing quality IT
services that meet the needs of the
business which is under the control of
governance
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson the five components of
service management lifecycle our service
strategy service design service
transition service operation and
continual service improvement continual
service improvement identifies
opportunities for improving the failures
within any stage of the service
lifecycle corporate governance deals
with setting up corporate policies
strategic directions etc and identifying
critical success factors for an
organization IT Service Management helps
to implement quality IT services that
meet the needs of a business next we
will look at a few questions based on
this unit
hello and welcome to unit 2 of the ITIL
2011 foundation certification course
offered by simply learn this unit
includes three lessons in this unit you
will be introduced to the first phase of
the IT Service Management lifecycle
which is service strategy let us move on
to the first lesson introduction to
service strategy in the next screen
this lesson helps you understand what
service strategy is its importance and
how it adds value to business this
lesson also focuses on classification of
services based on the customers
requirement let us look at the
objectives of this lesson in the next
screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to describe the purpose objective
scope and value of service strategy
identify the four processes in service
strategy and explain the different types
of services provided in the next screen
we will discuss the purpose objective
scope and value of service strategy
the processes and service strategy
include demand management service
portfolio management financial
management and business relationship
management demand management is the
process of understanding the demands for
services service portfolio management
refers to the complete set of services
offered by a service provider Financial
Management provides an understanding of
opportunities associated with services
in financial terms business relationship
management ensures that the service
provider understands the changing needs
of the customer these processes are
explained in detail later in this unit
next we will focus on different types of
services
services are classified based on the
customers requirement and the service
providers capabilities broadly the
services are classified into core
services enabling services and enhancing
services core services provide the basic
results that a customer requires they
signify the value that a customer wants
and for which they are keen to invest
core services anchor the value
proposition for the customer and provide
the basis for their continued
utilization and satisfaction enabling
services are required to deliver a core
service they serve as basic factors
enabling the customer to receive the
core service customers do not perceive
an enabling service as a service in its
own right also the service may not be
seen by the customers enhancing services
are the services added to a core service
to make it more appealing to the
customers they are not vital to the core
service delivery and are added to it as
excitement factors which will encourage
customers to use the core service often
let us take an example to understand
these services suppose the service
providers core service is to provide
word processing service for users to use
cool word processing service efficiently
certain enabling services such as
download and installation of updates are
required to delight the customer service
provider can strategize to provide
professional print access to publish the
document now let us consider another
example suppose the employees of a
company can monitor the status of their
benefit that is health insurance the
company can come up with a portal that
provides front and access to the
benefits tracking service this is an
enabling service if the company can help
the employees create and manage a
fitness or weight loss program then such
a facility is considered as an enhancing
service next we will focus on customers
and users
customers are the ones who pay for
services they negotiate and agree to
service level targets with service
providers sometimes the customers also
can be users users are the ones who use
the services on a day to day basis now
let us do a quick recall of the concepts
related to service strategy
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson
the service strategy phase provides a
defined solution to a business problem
demand management service portfolio
management financial management and
business relationship management are the
processes in service strategy services
are classified into core services
enabling services and enhancing services
next we will focus on the second lesson
service strategy concepts
this lesson introduces you to the key
concepts in service strategy this lesson
also focuses on the classification of
services based on the customers
requirement let us define the objectives
of this lesson in the next screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to describe the basics of value
creation through services explained
business case in the next screen let us
understand utility and warranty
one of the key concepts in service
strategy is to determine how to create
service value the two key elements that
combine to provide service value are
utility and warranty service utility is
the functionality offered by the product
or service from the customer perspective
warranty is a promise that the product
or service will meet agreed requirements
utility is what the customer gets
whereas warranty is how service is
delivered utility should meet the
customer needs that is it should fit for
purpose warranty is the ability of the
service to operate reliably that is it
should fit for use there are three
characteristics of warranty firstly
warranty should be provided in terms of
availability capacity of services
secondly warranty makes sure that
customer assets continue to receive
utility even if degraded through major
disruptions finally warranty ensures
security for value creating potential of
customer assets utility increases
performance average whereas warranty
reduces performance variation describing
both service utility and service
warranty enables the service providers
to establish the value of the service
and differentiate themselves from the
competitors it also helps to attach a
meaningful price tag that a potential
customer would be willing to pay for in
the next screen let us understand the
concept of utility and warranty more
elaborately
the image illustrates how the two key
elements combine to create value in IT
services utility is perceived by the
customer from the attributes of the
service that have a positive effect on
the performance of tasks associated with
desired results removal or relaxation of
constraints on performance is also
perceived as a positive effect it means
that if you are able to support the
performance of a customer services or
remove the challenges at the customer
end the service utility is on the higher
side warranty is determined by four
parameters they are availability
capacity continuity and security these
parameters determine if the service is
fit for use for a customer to achieve
business outcomes suppose a customer
wants to use email as a service in this
case utility refers to the ability of
the service to allow the customer to
send and receive email warranty is
derived from the positive effect of
being available when needed in
sufficient capacity or magnitude and
dependable in terms of continuity and
security for example if the email
service is available 24/7
the warranty in this case should be to
provide security so that nobody hacks
your account in the next screen we will
focus on service assets
utility of a service is delivered
through service assets service assets
include resources and capabilities both
are equally important and a service
provider cannot exist without them
resources are the tangible assets of an
organization that can be purchased to
deliver the service capabilities on the
other hand are the intangible assets of
an organization and cannot be purchased
but have to be developed and maintained
over a time span resources are the
direct inputs for the production of
goods capabilities have the ability to
coordinate control and deploy resources
to create services resources include the
IT infrastructure people and
applications capabilities are basically
driven by experience based on
information knowledge intensive and
nested within an organization's
management people and processes the nine
types of assets are shown on the screen
let us do a quick recall of service
utility and warranty
values are defined by the customers the
customer will select a service or
product that represents the best mix of
features at the price they are willing
to pay value changes over time in
circumstances the service needs and
values change as the customer faces new
challenges to adapt to their changing
environment value needs to be defined in
terms of three areas business outcomes
customers preferences and customers
perception in the next screen we will
further discuss value creation
perceptions are influenced by service
features present or past experiences
with similar features and relative
competency self-image peers and position
in the market in the next screen we will
further discuss customer perception of
value
to understand the value of IT the
following questions need to be answered
what service does IT provide service
from the IT perspective should be linked
to specific business activities and
outcome of customers what did the
services achieve the customers will
identify what they were able to do with
the service and how important was the
service to them and their organization
what is the cost of a particular service
when a customer compares the service
cost with the service that enabled them
to achieve the desired outcomes they
will be able to determine how valuable
the service is in the next screen let us
discuss the factors that influence
customer perception of value
perceptions are influenced by service
features present or past experiences
with similar features and relative
competency self-image peers and position
in the market in the next screen we will
further discuss customer perception of
value
customer point is the reference value
and is based on do-it-yourself or DIY
strategy the positive difference is
based on the perceived additional
benefits and gains provided by the
service provider the negative difference
is what the customer would lose by
investing in the service the net
difference is the actual perception that
the customer has of the service offered
after ignoring the negative difference
the economic value is the sum of
reference value and net difference next
we will focus on how service management
enables business outcomes
service management uses its service
assets to deliver a service that meets
the business outcomes of the customer
service management is a set of
organizational capabilities specialized
in providing value to customers in the
form of services the capabilities
interact with each other to function as
a system for creating value service
management acts as an operating system
for service assets in effectively
deploying them to provide services
service assets are the source of value
and customer assets are the recipients
service management enables the service
assets to perform according to customer
requirements while identifying and
reducing the impact of constraints on
the service assets IT Service Management
does this by managing IT capabilities
and resources this is done either
internally or through the support of
external service providers and
technology vendors service management
enables the service assets to achieve
desired business outcomes from a
business point of view IT service
management enables the delivery of
services which are used to achieve
business outcomes in the next screen we
will focus on the relationship between a
service provider business unit and
business outcomes of the customer
organizations are becoming less focused
on the IT infrastructure and more on how
to automate end-to-end business
processes and deliver business services
the challenge is to understand the
operational objectives of the business
process and translate that into
activities that can be provided by the
IT infrastructure overcoming this
problem is the objective of the
processes the given image illustrates
the relationship between the service
provider the business unit and the
customers business outcomes in this
image an IT service provider delivers
services to an internal business unit
which enables it to achieve its desired
business outcomes in this image the
nature of the business outcomes
determines what customer assets the
business unit will need the service
provider uses the service assets to
deliver a service that meets the needs
of the business unit in order to achieve
the outcomes the business unit needs a
minimum level of service the performance
potential of the service indicates what
utility and warranty the service will
have this will indicate in business unit
terms the performance that the service
will be capable of the business unit can
then determine whether that will be
suitable to enable its customer assets
to produce the desired level of outcomes
the more the utility and warranty the
higher the performance potential next we
will focus on service packages
a service package provides a detailed
description of a package of bundled
services available to be delivered to
customers it defines the level of
utility and warranty provided by the
service package the service package
includes the core services provided any
supporting services provided or enabling
service packages any enhancing service
packages which are often the excitment
factors used as differentiators and
service level packages the service level
packages can be at various levels as
shown on the screen next we will focus
on business case
a business case is a documented
justification which demonstrates that by
adding a new service the service
provider can attract many new customers
who are willing to invest in the new
service a business case is prepared to
evaluate the business viability of
providing a new service it uses
qualitative and quantitative terms and
links business impact or benefits to the
defined business objectives a business
case is used as a decision support and
planning tool that projects the likely
consequences of a business action
justification for a significant item of
expenditure report that includes
information about costs benefits options
issues risks and possible problems in
the next screen we will focus on
business case structure
a business case structure includes an
introduction that addresses the business
objectives methods and assumptions which
define the boundaries of the business
case business impacts in terms of
financial and non-financial impacts and
recommendations in terms of any specific
actions risks and contingencies that can
impact the objectives in the next screen
we will focus on risk
risk is defined as uncertainty that can
have a positive or negative outcome if
the outcome of a risk is positive it
helps to fulfill the business objectives
of an organization such risks are called
opportunities if the outcome of a risk
is negative it is called a threat
managing risk requires identification
and control of the exposures to risk
which may have an impact on achieving
business objectives there are two
distinct phases of risk which are risk
analysis and risk management risk
analysis involves gathering information
about risk exposure so that the
organization can make timely decisions
and manage risk appropriately a risk is
a possible event that could cause harm
or loss or affect the ability to achieve
objectives the technique used to manage
a risk is called risk management
managing risk involves risk assessment
and risk analysis the aim of risk
management is to reduce the impact of a
negative outcome and increase the impact
of a positive outcome next we will focus
on service management technology and
automation
Automation can have significant impact
on the performance of service assets
such as management organization people
process knowledge and information
automation is considered to improve the
utility and warranty of services
automation provides real-time and
historical data for analysis correlates
data from multiple devices analyzes
service impact for prioritization of
incidents problems and change tickets
and optimizes service performance for
example by adjusting capacity based on
demand in the next screen we will focus
on automation benefits
the automation of service processes
helps improve the quality of service
reduce costs and reduce risks by
reducing complexity and uncertainty and
by efficiently resolving trade-offs some
of the areas with service management can
benefit from automation our design and
modeling typically a what-if analysis
pattern recognition and analysis of
service issues detection and monitoring
of events and alerts an online Service
Catalog and optimization of services and
underlying technology classification
prioritization and routing of incident
problem and change tickets in the next
screen we will discuss service
management tools
the service management tools include the
following service desk self-help which
is a web front-end offering a menu
driven range of self-help and service
requests with a direct interface into
the backend process handling software a
workflow or process engine which allows
responsibilities activities timescales
escalation path and alerting to be
predefined and then automatically
managed it is usually a part of the
ticketing tools used for service
management an integrated configuration
management system or CMS where
configuration items relationships
records related to incidents problems
known errors and change are stored in
discovery and deployment tool CMS data
is populated and can be verified it also
assists and license management and
deployment of new software at target
locations another tool is remote control
or commonly known as remote desktops
which allows relevant support groups to
take control of the user desktops
diagnostic scripts utilities reporting
and dashboards are also examples of
automation and abling service management
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson utility and warranty are the
two components of service value service
assets deliver utility of a service and
include resources and capabilities a
service package provides a detailed
description of a package of bundled
services available for customers a
business case is used as a decision
support and planning tool that projects
the likely consequences of a business
action next we will focus on the third
lesson service strategy processes
this lesson will help you to understand
what service strategy is it's important
and how it adds value to business this
lesson also focuses on classification of
services based on the customers
requirement let us explore the
objectives of this lesson in the next
screen
after completing this lesson you will be
able to describe the purpose and
objective of the different processes in
service strategy describe the activities
involved in service portfolio management
SPM and financial management for IT
services identify the responsibilities
of the business relationship manager in
the next screen we will begin with an
overview of demand management
the primary source of demand for IT
services comes from the execution of
business process within the
organization's patterns of business
activity influence the demand pattern
service providers need to understand how
the customers business activity operates
this will help them improve the way in
which capacity is planned and produced
for any supporting services this is
achieved with the support of the
capacity management plan which helps in
the delivery schedule maintaining the
service belt a service belt is the
concept which describes the ability of
the business to increase its performance
to be in the service industry over time
demand management should be able to
build a profile of business processes
and the patterns of business activity in
such a way that seasonal variations as
well as specific events such as adding
new employees can be anticipated in
terms of associated demand analyzing and
tracking the activity patterns of the
business process makes it possible to
predict demand for services in the
catalog that support the process it is
also possible to predict demand for
underlying service assets that support
those services every additional unit of
demand generated by business activity is
allocated to a unit of service capacity
in the next screen we will discuss PBA
and yupi
pba and yupi play a vital role in
designing the service strategy user
profiles represent different groups of
users for a given service they are also
based on the roles responsibilities
interactions schedules work environments
and social context of related users
patterns of business activity represent
how users and different user profiles
access a service over a course of a
given time period
let us continue our discussion on PBA
and you P in the next screen
business activities drive demand for
services customer assets such as people
processes and applications generate PBA
PBA defines dynamics of a business and
include interactions with customers
suppliers partners and other
stakeholders services often directly
support PBA this patterns of business
activity can change over time with
changes and improvements in business
process people organization applications
and infrastructure PBA's are placed
under change control UPS are based on
roles and responsibilities within an
organization functions and operations of
processes and applications the image
illustrates an example of U P and P ba
an Internet service provider provides
cheaper download rates for users in the
age group of 16 to 20 years during night
this group of 16 to 20 year olds belongs
to one user profile and the pattern
Annalise is users downloading data
during night hours PBA and u P ensure a
systematic approach to understand and
manage demand of the customers service
providers should gather necessary
information to serve the demand of the
customers with appropriately matched
services service levels and service
assets this leads to improved value for
both customers and service providers by
eliminating waste and poor performance
next we will focus on service portfolio
management
service portfolio management refers to
the complete set of services offered by
a service provider under management
across all customers and market spaces
the image depicts the grouping between
customers and the service portfolio
supported by an understanding of the
market space market space is a
combination of PBA and u P which is
correlated to a customer or a group of
customers in other words service
portfolio is services catering to a
specific market space changes to
portfolios are governed by policies and
procedures the service improvement plan
is for the third-party services to gain
more customers as per their market space
or the line of service in the next
screen let us discuss purpose objective
and scope of SPM
the components of service portfolio our
service pipeline service catalog and
retired services the service portfolio
represents all the resources presently
engaged or being released in various
phases of the service lifecycle each
phase requires resources for completion
of projects initiatives and contracts
the portfolio should have the right mix
of services in the pipeline and catalog
to secure the financial viability of the
service provider as seen in the image
the service pipeline consists of
services under development for a given
market space or customer these services
are to be phased into operation by
service transition after completion of
design development and testing the
design development and testing are done
as part of the service design phase of
IT Service Management service pipeline
is basically the services to be launched
by the service provider service catalog
as defined in ITIL is a database or
structured document with information
about all live IT services including
those available for deployment the
service catalog is the subset of the
service portfolio visible to customers
and the service catalog is the only part
of the portfolio that recovers costs or
earns profits a subset of the service
catalog may be third-party or outsourced
services these are the services
presently being offered by the service
provider the last component of the
service portfolio is retired services
once the services reach the end of their
contracts they are phased out or retired
these are the services that the service
provider is not willing to offer in
future because of various reasons
one such reason can be that the service
is no longer required by its customer or
the service might not be financially
viable the arrows in the image indicate
the movement from one stage to the other
third-party catalog represents the
third-party services like maintenance
procurement and so on in the next screen
let us focus on process activities of a
service portfolio management
SPM consists of four main phases of
activity it is a dynamic and ongoing
process set it includes the following
activities as shown on the screen
define this step involves activities
like making inventory services and
ensuring business cases are documented
to understand the opportunities and
threats this step also involves
validating portfolio data the next step
is analyze analyze this step involves
maximizing portfolio value it is vital
to align prioritize and balance supply
and demand if the organization does not
understand what analysis it will perform
it is unlikely to know the right data to
collect data collection exercises are
disruptive and should be as streamlined
as possible this is where strategic
intent is crafted begin with a set of
top-down questions what are the long
term goals of the service organization
what services are required to meet those
goals the third step is approved approve
this step includes finalizing the
proposed portfolio and authorizing
services and resources the previous
phases have led to a well understood
future state to be this is where
deliberate approvals or disapproval of
that future state take place with
approvals comes the corresponding
authorization for new services and
resources the last step is charter
charter this step involves communicating
decisions allocating resources and
chattering services this phase begins
with a list of decisions and action
items these decisions should be
correlated to budgetary decisions and
financial plans budget allocations
should enforce the allocation of
resources next we will focus on the
purpose objective and scope of financial
management
in this screen we will discuss the
benefits of financial management
financial management is a
well-established and well understood
part of any organization the benefits
include enhanced decision-making and
increased speed of change which means
the business is able to respond faster
to opportunities improved SPM and
operation control financial compliance
and control required with financial
regulatory requirements such as
sarbanes-oxley Act of us for financial
organizations a greater insight and
communication of the value created by IT
services increased visibility of IT
leading to increased perception of IT
now let us do a quick recall of the
financial management concepts discussed
here

now let us do a quick recall of the
financial management concepts discussed
here
the two main activities of BRM are being
the voice of the service provider to the
customer being the voice of the customer
to the service provider in case of
external service providers business
relationship management is executed by a
separate and dedicated function of BRMS
or account managers each one dedicated
to a customer or a group of smaller
customers the emphasis here is on
maximizing contract value through
customer satisfaction business
relationship management is executed
between a senior representative from IT
and senior managers from the business
units for internal service providers
here the emphasis is on aligning the
objectives of the business with the
activity of the service provider in the
next screen we will focus on the
responsibilities of the business
relationship manager
as someone playing a key role in the
process the business relationship
manager maintains the relationship with
one or more customers understanding the
customers business outcomes and acting
as a representative for the customer and
the service provider works with other
service management processes and
functions for information gathering
assist the service level manager in
creating a seamless conduit from
customer to service provider
capabilities used to ensure value
documents customer complaints and
instigates corrective action if required
let us summarize what we have learned in
this lesson
demand management helps to understand
the demands for services and manage them
to help customers achieve their business
objectives service portfolio management
refers to the complete set of services
offered by a service provider under
management across all customers and
market spaces financial management
provides an understanding of
opportunities associated with services
in financial terms the business
relationship manager documents customer
complaints and instigates corrective
action next we will look at a few
questions based on this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
