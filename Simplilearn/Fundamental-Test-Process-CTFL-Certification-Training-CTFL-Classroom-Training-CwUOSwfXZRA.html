implementation and execution we take the
test conditions designed and set them up
as tests we also set up the test
environment before we execute these
tests implementation includes
prioritizing our test cases using the
techniques test approach and create test
Suites from the test cases for efficient
test execution we make sure the test
environment has been set up correctly
possibly even by running specific tests
on it execution is running the test
Suites and individual test cases
following our test procedures already
defined in above phases we might do this
manually or by using test execution
tools according to the planned sequence
at the end of the execution of each test
case we log the outcome of test
execution and record the identities and
versions of the software under test test
tools and test where we need to know
what tests we used against which version
of the software we must report defects
against specific versions and a test log
we keep provide for an audit trail we
then compare actual results what
happened when we ran the tests with
expected results what we anticipated
would happen where there are differences
between actual and expected results
report discrepancies as incident once
the discrepancies have been fixed we
need to repeat test activity to verify
if the fix has resolved the discrepancy
we need to re-execute tests that
previously failed in order to confirm a
fix is working this is also called as
confirmation test or retesting we also
need to test the fixed did not introduce
defects in unchanged areas of the
software and that fixing a defect did
not uncover other defects this
is called regression testing after the
end of execution phase we move into the
evaluate phase in this phase we gauge
the results of test execution against
test objective and broadcast the test
summary report to stakeholders we might
go back to test execution if the test
objectives have not been met and we need
to conduct some more testing test
summary report is a document summarizing
test activities and results it also
contains an evaluation of the
corresponding test items against exit
criteria when the testing is deemed
complete we move into the test closure
phase in this phase we perform a check
that all deliverables have been accepted
and signed off archive the test we're
closed the environment and analyze
lessons learned and use the information
for improving the test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
