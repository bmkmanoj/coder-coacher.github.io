guide and help students structure their
efforts for preparation of the exam at
the core of the guidance study material
is the aim statement which lists all the
readings that a student is required to
go through along with the expected aim
of each reading the next is a study
guide which sets forth primary topics
and subtopics covered in the frm exam
the study guide also contains a full
listing of all of the readings that are
recommended as preparation for the frm

preparation handbook to candidates to
assist them in their preparation for the

slide the part one exam is four hours
long with 100 multiple-choice questions
it is important to note that there are
no negative marks for the wrong answers
hence you may answer even the questions
you are not able to solve a very
important point to be noted is that you
can use calculators in the exam some
questions have lengthy calculations and
could only be solved using a calculator
however g arp prescribes the calculator
that you can take into the exam room and
no other types of calculator will be
allowed if you bring in any other type
of calculator it is considered a
violation of the code exam results a
pass or fail and are released via email
approximately 6 weeks after the exam is
administered with quartile results that
enable them to see how they scored on
specific areas related to other
candidates
