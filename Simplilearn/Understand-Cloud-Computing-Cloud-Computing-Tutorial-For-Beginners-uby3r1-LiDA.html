these four parts are understand patterns
implement and practice in the first part
titled understand we will look at the

computing service and the interactions
between them it is essential to
understand this relationship to gain a
strong understanding of the topic the
cloud computing landscape is varied and
volatile the field is ever growing and
newer dimensions are being added on a
daily basis to make sense of all of this
sense it is absolutely necessary for

understanding of cloud computing
services and mature as a cloud
practitioner let's start with the first
part titled understand
