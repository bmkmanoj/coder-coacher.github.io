financial risk management frm par one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use operational risk
welcome to the 52nd session in your
preparation for frm part 1 we will begin
with a new session today on operational
risk we have already learned a lot about
financial risk but operational risk is
the risk of business operations failing
due to human error who will go through
the concept of operational risk in
detail and analyze its outcomes let us
start this session
agenda we will begin with the
introduction of the concept of
operational risk and then learned the
operational risk capital requirements
for risk assessment and management
technologies we will go through various
approaches and operational risk
categories and also understand the
severity of loss suffered due to such
risks we will go through different
controlling techniques and indicators to
measure and manage operational risk
operational risk operational risk is the
risk that is not inherent in financial
systemic or market wide risk it is the
risk remaining after determining
financing and systemic risk and includes
risks resulting from breakdowns in
internal procedures people and systems
it changes from industry to industry
industries with lower human interaction
are likely to have lower operational
risk it is an important consideration to
make when looking at potential
investment decisions the Basel Committee
has proposed three approaches for
determining the operational risk capital
requirement that is the amounts of
capital needed to protect against the
possibility of operational risk losses
the first approach is the basic
indicator approach where the operational
risk is based on 15% of the bank's
annual gross income over a three-year
period the second approach is a
standardized approach wherein the bank
uses eight business lines with different
Pizza factors to calculate the capital
charge with this approach the beta
factor of each business line is
multiplied by the annual gross income
amount over a three-year period the
third approach is the advanced
measurement approach who'll be
discussing this approach in the next
line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
