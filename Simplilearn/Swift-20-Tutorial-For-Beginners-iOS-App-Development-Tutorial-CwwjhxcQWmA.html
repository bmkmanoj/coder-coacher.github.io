iPad app development lesson 1 Swift 2.0
programming Basics by the end of this
lesson you'll be able to create a
playground in Xcode you'll understand
the basic Swift syntax you'll be able to
create variables and constants you'll be
able to understand and used three number
types in Swift and you'll be able to
create a rich text playground okay in
this video we're going to be talking
about the Swift to programming basics so
specifically the Swift syntax with
constants variables and comments and at
this point you should have already
downloaded Xcode from the App Store if
you haven't please pause the video and
go do that now because we'll need Xcode
to continue but right now it's time for
your tech info bite
these are little info snippets before we
begin a lesson especially while we're
learning Swift and this is on Swift
constants variables and comments
constants and variables are properties
that store values of any type a constant
is best used when the value is not
expected to change a variable is best
used when the value is expected to
change later in the program it's
important to keep in mind that once
declared the value type of a constant or
variable cannot be changed comments are
for humans to read and generally explain
what's happening within the code and
comments should be used sparingly only
when it's not clear what's happening so
let's jump into a playground look at
these in depth so when you first open
Xcode you're presented with this screen
and from here there's a few places you
could go you could get started with the
playground which is what we're going to
do in a second you could create a new
project which is when you're creating an
application you could check out an
existing project from a repository this
populates recent projects over here once
you've created a couple or you could use
this button here to open another project
entirely
now if this isn't showing you can do the
same thing from the file menu just click
file new and playground that's what
we're going to do essentially by
clicking this here and I'm just going to
move this into place and we're going to
name this playground intro and you
should have already a folder to store
these playgrounds in so I'm going to
click Next and I have a folder here
called playgrounds that I'm going to
keep it in so I'm just going to click
create and that's going to create our
playground for us so the first thing you
notice about the playground is it's
divided into two sections left and right
and the right side is basically what the
code compiler has worked out for you and
the left side is where you put all your
code so I'm just going to make this a
little bit bigger here and on the left
hand side if we look at this year real
quick we'll see that they're starting
off with a comment because comments
start off with two forward slashes now
the fact this has a colon after it means
that this is a rich text comment and
we'll get into that in a couple of
videos but basically everything after
those two slashes on that line will not
be evaluated by the compiler that is for
a human to read only now this line 3
import UIKit is importing a framework
that we don't really need right now but
I'm just going to leave it there and on
line 5 we're creating a variable called
STR and we're signing it the value of
hello playground which is a string and
you can tell it's a string because it's
in between two quotes so you may already
have a couple questions about this and
the first question might be where are my
line numbers because line numbers I
don't believe are by default activated
so if you go to Xcode and then
preferences and you go to text editing
it's the first section that says line
numbers just make sure that's selected
now the question might have is your
theme looks different than mine that's
okay
you can use whatever theme you'd like
I'm just using this theme so that it's
easily read but you could select any of
the other themes if you like I'm just
going to stick with presentation for
right now and I'm just going to close
the Preferences pane for the moment so
getting back to the code whenever you
see double quotes you know that you're
dealing with a string and the string is
nothing more than a bunch of characters
in between double quotes so basically a
paragraph or a sentence or a word so
what we're doing here is we're saying
var which is a keyword which means
you're about to declare a variable and
then we name the key word the key that
we name the variable in this case it's
STR and then the equal sign is an
assignment operator so then after we is
set the assignment operator we go ahead
and we put our string in and that is a
bona fide string so if we wanted to
create another string as a variable then
we would say var we name it in this case
I'm going to say name and set it equal
to my name now my right hand side has
scrunched up so I'll just open that a
little bit you'll see that what it does
it evaluates what the variable actually
is and it prints that out to the
right-hand side of it now a couple
things you may be wondering is that I'm
not actually saying that this is a
string and if I were to say that this is
a string it would look something like
this you put our semicolon in and then
we would say string equals but since
it's brutally obvious that it's a string
the compiler will actually infer that
this is a string then it's actually poor
form
to have the type declaration there so we
would just keep that out because it's
brutally obvious that that's a string
and it's brutally obvious that the one
above it's a string so if I go on to
another line I create a variable called
number one and I set that equal to one
which is an integer and an integer is
nothing more than a whole number
negative or positive then this will be
inferred as an integer there's no need
for me to put a type declaration on that
either okay
so now a couple things to keep in mind
is that now that I have declared STR a
string by setting it equal to a string I
can't come down here later and say that
STR equals six because that's now an
integer that's going to give me an error
because I can't assign a value to
something that already has a type with a
different type okay so once STR has been
assigned as a string it must always
remain a string and the same thing go
for name and number one here okay so I'm
just going to erase this I'm not sure
why it didn't give me an error
there's my error okay so you may also be
wondering where the semicolons are
because in a lot of languages the line
ends with a semicolon and in fact I
could put a semicolon at the end of each
of these lines and it would still work
however since you don't need it and the
compiler detects the end of line
character when you hit return or when a
line ends then why bother using it so
you save yourself a keystroke it's
basically a period at the end of a
sentence but now it is using return okay
also what comes to mind is does
whitespace matter and if we move this
over and I put a ton of whitespace in
there you'll see that it has no
difference on the compiler on the right
hand side so this is not like Python
where we use a hierarchy
or anything this is just whitespace does
not matter except for one case and
that's when we're using this assignment
operator here the equal sign so if we
have a space on the front of it we need
to have a space on the back of it or we
need to have no space at all however
you'll see that that's quite unreadable
so it's recommended that you use a space
the assignment operator and then your
value okay
so white space does not matter
semicolons are not needed as you see
Swift is becoming a very easy language
to learn so as you see the variable name
has been declared and I've assigned it
the value of jason Rybka but if I wanted
to change that now later in the code I
would just say name equals and I would
reset this to whatever I wanted to say
so let's say I just want to go by Jason
instead of Jason ripka and I just go
ahead and assign that to Jason and
reality if I'm assigning a name to
something I should probably use the let
keyword which makes it a constant
instead of a variable which means it
can't be changed
so if I make a variable or a constant
called my name and I set that equal to
Jason then later in the code I can't say
my name equals Tom because I've declared
it as a constant so it must always
remain the same value that I originally
set it to which was Jason now there is a
slight performance enhancement when
you're using let keyword over the VAR
keyword because Swift uses something
called automated reference counting and
it basically knows that once it's
assigned Jason it doesn't need to worry
about changing that later in the code so
it doesn't need to allocate any memory
for it now also because of this you
don't need to worry about garbage
collection or
anything like that you don't need to go
cleaning up after your variables and
disintegrating them or anything
they just are there when needed and when
they're not they're destroyed basically
by the compiler now in a playground the
compiler is running over and over and
over this way it constantly evaluates
what's going on so it's little doesn't
really matter in a playground but in
your program always try to use the let
keyword which then creates a constant
whenever you can okay so if you have
something's not expected to change use
let and if you have something that may
change use var okay
another thing I want to point out about
declaring variables and constants is the
naming convention so if you look when I
declared my name I started out with
lowercase letters and for the second
word I used an uppercase letter to start
it and then lowercase letters so that is
the proper naming convention that's
called camelcase and basically it means
if I made a variable called my dog name
it would look like this
my and it would capitalize the D and the
N and I would just set that to whatever
value it's supposed to be and also
another thing to keep in mind when
you're naming variables is to name them
something that makes sense to what the
value is going to be so I wouldn't say
my dog name and then put my dog's age in
there it should be very clear that my
dog name is gonna be a string and it's
gonna be you know whatever the value is
obviously in this case it's gonna be my
key okay so keep that in mind your
strings and whenever you're naming your
variables to try to make them always use
camel case that's the proper form and
the variable name should clearly reflect
what the value is going to be I want to
introduce you to something this is
called string interpolation so if I say
var another string so clearly I'm going
to be making a string here and I set
that equal to an empty string what I can
do is I can pull variables
to here and the syntax we use for that
is the backslash and then parentheses
and then within here I can pull out
whatever variable
I need like my name and then I would say
and and then I would put another set of
those parentheses in and I would say my
dog name and you'll see on the
right-hand side what that does is that
sets the value of another string to be
the value of my name the string and and
my dog name it's also worth noting that
this also turns the value into a string
as it does that and I'll show you how
that works because if I say var the
number and I set that equal to a string
and I put the number one variable in
here then you'll see that that comes up
in the compiler on the right hand side
as a string version of the number one
and the last thing I want to touch on in
this video are comments comments have
two purposes number one they can comment
out code that you don't want to run so
if I didn't want to reassign this I
could just put two forward slashes in
front of it and I will comment it out
and you'll see the evalu the compiler no
longer evaluates it now there's also a
quick way to do this if you have
multiple lines and you just want to
quickly comment them out to test
something out if you highlight them and
press command question it will comment
them out that way and command question
will uncomment that as well now you can
also use a multi-line comment that
starts with a forward slash and an
asterisk and you'll see that that
comments out everything but let's say I
only wanted to comment out to here
I'll put an asterisk and then a forward
slash and then everything else is
recompiled again okay now I'm getting an
error because I commented out number so
I'm going to take these comment sections
out
but comments should only be used to
comment out code and to leave important
notes to yourself or someone else who's
going to view your code so they can
understand it better we're going to get
much more in the comments in a later
video where we talk about rich text
comments and things like that and for
right now I think we're done what you
should do before you move on is play
around creating couple variables put a
couple variables together to create
another variable and just kind of get
your head wrapped around the syntax a
little bit and then we'll move on to the
next video where we talk about numbers a
little more in depth we're going to
continue our discussion on Swift to
programming basics this time turning our
attention to number types type safety
and type conversion so it as you guessed
it it's time for the tech info byte on
number types type safety and type
conversion there are three number types
in Swift you have integers doubles and
floats integers are any whole number
negative or positive doubles are a
decimal value number accurate to 16
decimal places floats are a decimal
value number accurate to 6 or 7 decimal
places it's also important to realize
that floats were developed for 32-bit
systems while doubles were developed for
64-bit systems keep in mind that doubles
are the default inferred decimal number
type therefore you must declare type
when creating a float value type safety
and type strict both mean that once a
value has been assigned a value type it
cannot be changed type conversion is the
process by which a value is converted
from one type to another and we'll look
at all these concepts in a little more
detail in the playground here so since
we're talking about numbers I've gone
ahead and created a playground and I
just called it numbers and you should do
the same so when we're talking about
Swift code like this and we start a new
topic like numbers here we're going to
just create a new playground each time
this way we can
to that particular topic if we need to
and also all the playgrounds that I
create are going to be available in the
source code download so you can access
those at any time as well so since we're
talking about numbers would make sense
to create a few of them so we'll create
a variable called a and we'll set that
equal to three and I'm just going to put
a comment here that this is inferred as
an integer okay we're going to make it
variable B and we're going to set that
equal to twelve point one and this is
also going to be inferred by the
compiler but this time has a double and
then we're going to create a variable
called C and we're going to make that
twelve point three but we're going to
declare the type back here as a float
this way we know that this is a float
instead of a double so what is the big
difference between a float and a double
well a float is accurate to about six
decimal places where a double is
accurate to about 16 decimal places so
why do we even use floats might be a
question that comes up and the answer is
that we've developed so many things that
deal with floats that we're still
referring to floats so we still need to
kind of keep those in our programming
logic at the moment now you can convert
a float to a double and vice versa so
that you can interact with them because
as you'll see if we try to do
mathematics on these and I try to add a
and B so if I say variable D is equal to
a plus B then you'll see that I actually
will get an error here because I can't
add an integer to a double
what I need to do is I need to cast one
of these as the other so what I'll do is
I'll say I want to take the double
version of a which I do by just saying
double and encapsulating it and then I
want to add that to B and that will get
me the result that I want and that will
be a double as a value type so it may be
useful you to actually see the
difference between a float and a double
so we'll create a variable here called
double value and we're going to set that
equal to 12 point two divided by three
point one and you'll see the result pop
up on the right and you see how many
digits there are after the decimal place
but if I make a float value and I say
that that's going to be a float and I
set that equal to the same thing twelve
point two divided by three point one
then you'll see the difference in the
accuracy on the right hand side where a
float value only goes one two three four
five six decimal places where double
value goes many more another thing to
keep in mind when we're dealing with
numbers is that if we go ahead and
create a variable and we'll just say
this is some and we set that equal to 5
plus 3 times 4 then you'll notice that
the result is 17 but keep in mind that
during regular mathematics 3 times 4
would occur first and then it would add
the 5 so if we actually wanted to do 5
plus 3 and then multiply by 4 we would
encapsulate this and it would change our
result from 17 to 32 because now we're
taking 5 plus 3 which is 8 and then
multiplying it by 4 so it doesn't matter
the order in which you do things and if
you follow the standard mathematic rules
division and multiplication take place
first
then addition and subtraction unless
they are encapsulated in parentheses
then that takes which place first and
then the rest of the calculation will
take place now the thing that you'll
find kind of interesting is if we take
two integers so I'm going to create two
of them and I'm going to make one equal
six and then I'll make y equal nine if
we go ahead and we perform some
mathematics on these and I'm just going
to change this to a ten so it's not a
very even mathematical number so if we
do some mathematics on these you'll see
that if I say if I set a variable and I
say that that's Z and that equals x / y
you'll notice that I get zero where you
might be expecting that I would get some
other type of number but let me change
this around so it actually gives us a
result so if we do Y divided by X then
it goes in one time and that's because
six can literally only go into ten one
time if we want to get the remainder we
need to create a different variable so
I'm just going to create a remainder R
and then we would say Y modulo which is
the percent symbol X and how to give us
the remainder so really you can see that
Y goes into X Z times which is one with
the our leftover which is four so that's
basically your remainder operator so as
you know type safety or type strict
means that once you set a variable it
can only be that same type so in other
words we set X to six which is an
integer which means the X must always be
an integer and Y we set to an integer
which means Y must always be an integer
that's type safety and type strict type
conversion however
is when we need to use it as a different
type of value so if we wanted Z to have
a more specific result we could cast
both y and X as doubles by saying double
and encapsulating it now you'll notice I
get an error until I do the other one
because I can't go ahead and take a
double and divide it with an integer
that's just going to give me an error so
I need to cast this as a double also and
so when I do that you'll see that I get
a double as a result on the right-hand
side so that's the more accurate result
okay so we're going to leave you here at
numbers I suggest you play around with
numbers typecasting them a little bit
you know seeing that they only interact
with one another if they're the same
type looking at the difference in values
so on and so forth so go ahead and do
that and then move on to the next video
and I'll see you there this video we're
going to talk about rich-text
playgrounds so we're going to jump right
into our tech info byte rich text
playgrounds are Xcode playgrounds with
formatting markup in certain areas rich
text playgrounds are perfect for
teaching explaining code and
presentations but in practice rich text
playgrounds are not used all that often
with that said let's go take a look at
how to create one and what one actually
looks like so this is an example of a
rich text playground in Xcode and
basically this kind of reads like a
tutorial I wrote it that way you know
for your benefit now this is included in
the source code it is called rich text
dot playground and the way we do this is
if we hit editor and then show raw
markup then we can see this not
formatted so we can see how to actually
do the formatting so as I said this is
in your source code files and I'm not
going to go through this but basically
what it is is when you say that you're
going to do a rich text comment then
basically you can use any type of
formatting
that is formatted with markdown so
markdown is a formatting language and
it's really simple to use and it allows
you to make all sorts of headlines links
you can even put pictures in your
playgrounds bold text italics and
basically if you look through this the
regular comments are used to explain
what follows throughout the playground
so you can kind of teach yourself
markdown if you go through this
playground and markdown is what you use
to go ahead and mark these up basically
so I'm not really going to dwell on rich
text playgrounds because it's something
you can kind of do on your own just look
at it in the code view editor show raw
markup and you'll see exactly what I say
about each section and then how to
actually format that so go ahead and do
that I'm going to switch this back over
to rendered markup so when you open it
up it'll be rendered and if you have any
questions on rich text playgrounds post
them in the forums and we'll get them
answered
welcome to iOS 9 I phone and iPad app
development lesson to swift 2.0 control
flow in this lesson we're going to learn
about control flow and by the end of the
lesson you'll be able to understand how
control flow impacts your code and
specifically what control flow is you'll
be able to properly use an if-else
statement a switch statement and the
ternary operator and you'll understand
how loops work so over the next few
videos we're going to cover this in
detail and I'll see you there ok so
we're going to be talking about control
flow in this section and control flow is
just as it sounds it's how you control
the flow of your code within your
program so we're going to be talking
specifically about if-else statements
and that brings us right to our tech
info bite on FL statements if else
statements are the most common type of
control flow in Swift
most other programming languages if-else
statements evaluated condition if the
result is true then the code in the
first code block runs otherwise the else
statement code block is rung if-else
statements are not limited to two
results you can use the else ifs in text
to make endless possibilities so let's
take a look at if-else statements in a
little more detail right now so we're
talking about control flow and
specifically the if-else statement so
probably the best way to conquer this
would be to go ahead right into an
example of how the syntax is so first
I'm going to create a variable and I'm
going to call this the condition and I'm
going to make that a boolean and set
that equal to true or false
okay now mind you I did write that in
poor form because as I said it as false
it's clearly a boolean because the
bullying can only be true or false so I
didn't have to say that that's a boy but
I wanted to show you how to declare one
anyhow so moving on to if else statement
what we're going to do is we're going to
say if the condition is equal to C the
double equal sign they're true then
we're going to open a code block and
we're going to run some code here if
true run some code and then otherwise
and we open another code block and then
if false run some code okay so basically
if the condition or the value of the
condition is true then the code in the
first code block will run and when I say
code block I mean from here to here is a
code block
otherwise this code in here will run so
let's look at a real world example of
this so I'm going to create a variable
called temp which is going to be the
temperature in Fahrenheit
and I set that equal to 32 degrees so
that's going to be just be inferred as
an integer I'm going to create another
variable called is freezing and I'm
going to set that equal to false
actually I'll set it equal to true since
it's 32 at the moment and what we're
going to do is we're going to write an
if statement that's going to check the
temperature and depending on if the
temperature is 32 or below it's going to
set it to is freezing and if it's not
it's going to set it to false is
freezing so we're gonna say if temp is
less than or equal to 32 then we're
going to set is freezing equal to true
otherwise now note you don't actually
have to have an else statement if you
don't want to but in most cases it makes
sense and in this case it does we're
gonna set is reasoning into false okay
so now if we mess around with this a
little bit I'm gonna make this 35 then
you'll see that is freezing down here it
becomes false and you can see that
because this is highlighted over here in
the compiler instead of just because we
didn't do any print line statements or
anything to confirm any of this so what
happens with an if-else statement if you
need to evaluate more than two
conditions so in other words we'll need
something more than just true or false
well what we'll do is we'll create a
variable called the number and we'll set
that equal to three and then we're going
to write an if statement and we're going
to create a little room and we can say
if
the number is equal to two or we'll say
1 then we'll use the print command which
is you just type in print and then
whatever you want to print in here you
would print and here we would say the
number is and we'll just pull out what
the number is by saying in here the
number okay and then in order to
evaluate for 2 we would say else if the
number is equal to 2 then we can do the
same thing we can print the number is
and then we'll do an else if the number
is equal to three we'll do the same
thing and then what we can do is just
write an else statement to catch any
other values so otherwise we're just
going to do the same thing print the
number is the number so now this shows
you that the number is three so
automatically through our else--if
statement
it's evaluating that the number is three
and I want to point out this forward
slash and the end here all this is a
newline character and this appears in
some version of Xcode some versions and
it doesn't appear in other versions of
Xcode so if you're getting the /n don't
worry about it
in an actual Xcode project this won't be
an issue it's just an issue right now
and some of the playgrounds depending on
what Xcode version you have so it's just
a newline character it doesn't really
mean anything you can just imagine
that's not there all right so we change
this to one then you'll see that it says
the numbers one and if we changed it to
111 then our else statement would catch
it and it would say the number is 111
okay so now we can also do things
instead of just saying the number is
equal to we can also do other things so
if I add another variable here and I say
is valid and I set that equal to true
then what we can do is we can use the
and operator so we could say and is
valid is equal to true then nothing will
happen if either those conditions are
incorrect so if I make this false then
you'll see that technically if we were
doing any of the other than a print line
statement then nothing would happen over
here okay
nothing would actually happen in your
console and that's because we're using
the and statement that means this must
be true and this must be true or we
could use the or operator which is a
double pipes and the pipe is used by
using the shift button and pressing the
key above the enter button so two pipes
that means or that means whether number
one is one or is valid is true if either
of those is false then it will print out
on the right hand side otherwise it'll
skip and do nothing actually ours
doesn't skip and do nothing because no
matter what happens we're gonna print
the number in this particular coding
environment the way we wrote it it's
also worth pointing out that when we're
comparing a boolean we don't actually
need to say if it equals true if that's
what we're looking for so if we're
looking to see if is valid is equal to
true and then run some code then we
don't actually need to put is true here
so we can take this out because
automatically we know that we're
checking to see if is valid is true and
if it is then we're going to run some
code and otherwise we're going to do
something else here okay
so basically that's just with boolean x'
but you can write it out the long way if
you like
so if you're checking to see if it's
false or if it's not true and you say is
not by saying exclamation point equals
so if isvalid
is not true that's the same as saying if
is valid is false obviously then you run
the first section of code otherwise you
run the second section of code and
really that's it on if-else statements
you will be using if-else statements a
lot in your programming one thing you'll
be doing is something like checking for
an error so we'll create a variable
called error and we'll make that an NS
error I can't do that because they
didn't have a framework in here but we
make an error and we just set that to
true then one thing that you will be
doing quite a bit is you check for an
error that come to have a value so you
would say if error is not equal nil and
then you run your code and otherwise
generally you would go ahead and print
your error and it's giving me an error
because error is a reserved word I
believe well it's because it's a boolean
so we can't really say nil since we
didn't declare it as an optional we
didn't get into that so I'm not going to
do that but I'll say does not equal true
okay so that's really all we're going to
talk about on if-else statements
go ahead play around with them try to
get your code to do different things
based on the condition of a variable
before we move on make sure you
understand control flow if-else
statements okay so we're still talking
about control flow but we're going to
switch gears a little bit and we're
gonna talk about switch statements so
that brings up our tech info byte for
switch statements
switch statements perform
basically the same function as an
if-else statement but perhaps in a more
succinct and better format switch
statements must be exhaustive or uses
default clause which I'll explain in a
second and switch statements are used
with enumerations and error throwing
functions to power swift 2.0 s new error
handling quite nicely so let's take a
closer look at switch statements right
now so we're still talking about control
flow switch statements is the topic and
switch statements are very similar to
if-else statements in that they allow
you to evaluate the value of a property
and do different things based on that
value so to demonstrate this I'm going
to create a variable called name I'm
going to set that equal to the string of
Jason and then what we're going to do is
want to switch on name so in order to do
that we say switch and then we say what
we're going to switch on in this case
name and we open a code block for our
switch statement and inside our switch
statement we write cases so the first
case is going to be Jason so in the case
that the name is Jason then what we're
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and print a line that says jason is a
programmer okay and then we can add
additional cases so I'll say in the case
that it is kristina then we do our colon
and we're going to do a print line on
this case as well and we'll say kristina
is a kitchen designer
and then we can add as many cases as we
like so I'll just add one more and we'll
say case Lenny and in the case that it's
Lenny we're gonna print a different
string and we're gonna say Lenny still
needs a good job and then you'll see
that we're still getting an error and
that's because we haven't covered all
possibilities for the variable name and
covering all possibilities for the
variable name would be almost impossible
so what we do is we add what's called a
default case using the default keyword
and in there all we're gonna do is break
and break just means to go ahead and get
out of the switch statement so now
you'll see if I switch this to Lenny
then that's a valid option and it says
Lenny still needs a good job okay now if
we switch it to someone else's name like
if I said Leo then that wouldn't
evaluate it would just break out of the
switch statement and it wouldn't do
anything for us now it is interesting to
note the way this formats because really
it should look like this and sometimes
Xcode does this perfectly and other
times Xcode doesn't and that's just for
readability sake okay so at this point
you know the basic workings of a switch
statement so I want to give you another
example so we're going to create a
variable called score and we're going to
set that equal to 88 so this would be
like a test score or something and we're
going to switch on that score and open
our code block for our switch statement
and in here we can make a case for a
range so if the range is zero and then
our range operator is dot dot dot
through 59 then we can say
print line here and we can say you
scored and F okay then we can make
another case statement for 60 through 69
and in that case we would print you
score daddy so I just wanted to show you
how you can do ranges here so in the
case for 70 to 79 then we would print
you score to see I mean and so on
I'm not going to go through all of them
so we're not going to get to have a beer
an a but in the case that it's 100
exactly we will do a different print
line and we'll say you had a perfect
score and then we'll put a default case
in here to catch anything that slips
through like the A's and B's
so we'll do a print line on this and
we'll just say you scored well okay so
now we have our default we don't have an
error any longer and that's just showing
you that you can do the range operator
now there is another range operator and
that is the dot dot less than operator
so if I use dot less than 59 then that
will give me a range from 0 to 58
because I'm not including 59 with this
type of range operator so I'm going to
switch that back so it still evaluates
our scores correctly and we're not
missing something for 59 so right now
we're capturing values
zero through 79 anything from eighty to
ninety nine is uncaught and will be
caught in a default case in addition to
anything over 100 or a negative score if
that's possible and in the case that
it's 100 we're gonna write out that you
had a perfect score so let's just verify
this is working we'll make it a hundred
and it says you have a perfect score on
the right hand side so you see that's
working just as well so really I'm not
going to spend too much time on switch
statements because we are going to
revisit them when we talk about error
handling so do yourself a favor get
familiar with switch statements play
around a little bit with them and then
we'll see you in the next video so we're
still talking about control flow this
time we're going to switch over to the
ternary operator
and if you're not familiar with what the
turnaround reader is and don't worry
you'll be familiar in a second it's time
for our tech info byte on swift ternary
operator ternary operator and swift is a
shorthand way to write an if-else
statement that has only two options the
ternary operator is widely used but it's
recommended only when the condition to
evaluate is simple and straightforward
and always keep in mind that you should
always prefer readability over compact
code so your decision to use the ternary
operator or not is completely up to you
but let's take a look at it so as we
mentioned the ternary operator is a
compact way to write an if-else
statement that has either one or two
options or actually that has two options
period so let's go ahead and we'll write
out an if-else statement that we can
work off of so we create our variable
for temp again I'm going to set that to
28 and then we're going to create a
variable for is freezing and we're going
to make that a boolean and I'm not going
to give that a value at this point but
then what we're going to do is we're
going to do an if statement that's going
to set the value of is freezing based on
the temperature so we're going to say if
the temp is less than or equal to 32
then what we're going to do is we're
going to set is freezing to true and
otherwise we'll open a code block
we'll set is freezing equal to false
okay so now that's your basic if-else
statement but there's a way to write
this in one line so we can check in one
line what the value is for freezing and
what the value is for temperature and
set is freezing based on that so if we
just say is freezing and we set that
equal to temp if it's less than or equal
to 32 then we're going to say true
otherwise we're gonna say false so if
you see the syntax there it's actually
pretty easy to follow this is saying
we're going to set the variable for is
freezing and if the temperature is less
than 32 or equal to 32 then we indicate
with a question mark we're going to set
that value to true and otherwise which
we set with a colon we're going to set
that value to false okay so you see
that's a nice compact way to do it but
are you going to know what that says a
couple years down the road
in this case probably you will but in
more complicated code examples you may
not so it may be worth still doing the
if-else statement rather than using the
ternary operator but I do want to show
you one other thing with the ternary
operator which is pretty cool is if we
declare a variable so we're going to
declare a variable called statement and
we need to say that that's going to be a
string and we're going to set that equal
to is freezing
if that equals true then we're going to
set it to its freezing because we said
it was going to be a string and
otherwise we're just going to set it to
not freezing so you see that evaluate
here in a second and it says it is
freezing because the temperature is 28
but notice if I change this to 33 then
you'll say that everything changes to
false and our statement reverts to not
freezing so that is kind of like a
property observer which we'll get into
later but that's kind of why that's a
neat little line of code here and you'll
see that we can use one line instead of
using five lines up here
okay so ternary operator can be a
valuable tool it can save you some time
it can save you some space whether or
not you're going to use it or not very
much is really up to you you may decide
to adopt it or you may decide to not use
it at all but just be aware you will see
it from time to time and other people's
code so you should be aware of it either
way and that's going to be it on the
ternary operator we'll see in the next
video so we're still talking about
control flow but we're going to switch
to loops and specifically the 4 and the
4 in loop so it's time for your tech
info byte on loops for loops allow us to
iterate over ranges or indexes quickly
to perform repetitive tasks standard for
loop allows you to set 3 attributes as
you format it and those are to create a
variable to evaluate and set its value
set the condition under which the loop
will run and increment or decrement the
evaluation variable and a 4 in loop
allows us to iterate through collections
like arrays and dictionaries so let's
take a closer look at loops
so four and four in loops we'll start
with the basic for loop and if you're
coming from another programming language
then you probably recognize this syntax
a little bit so the way it starts is we
say four and we create a variable and
I'm going to create this as I and I'm
going to set that equal to one and then
we put a semicolon and that sets the
variable up and sets its initial value
and then we want to set the condition
that we want this to run so we're going
to say whenever I is less than or equal
to ten we want this to run and we put
another semicolon and then we want to
increment I so we say I plus plus and
that plus plus syntax is just basically
the same as I plus one but since we're
lazy programmers we came up with a way
to say plus one quicker which is plus
plus now if you wanted to decrement it
you could say minus minus but at the end
of that syntax we open up our for loop
code and in here this is what's going to
happen when the loop runs so what we're
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and print a line that says the value of
I is and then we'll dynamically
pull out the value of I and you'll see
on the right-hand side that it says it's
doing this ten times and if we look at
it you'll see it gives us the last value
at least so this is done ten times it
says the value is one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten but it's
only showing us that the value of I is
ten because that's the last time it ran
but rest assured it's doing the other
nine times as well okay and it's doing
it very quickly
all right so let's move on and we're
going to take a look at a four in loop
so in order to utilize a for in loop we
need something like an array
so I'm going to create an array of names
I'm going to say names equals any cliff
deck declare an array with square
brackets and inside you put your values
separated by commas so I'm just going to
create a couple empty strings in here
and I'm gonna fill these strings in with
some dog names so Mikey latte Bianca and
Cassidy and those are our names now what
we want to do is loop through those
names so what we could say is for name
which is just something what we're
making up in names then what we want to
do is go ahead and print our name and
you'll see that does it four times and
if we look at it it's just going to pull
out one of those the last one which is
Cassidy so you see that it loops through
and it prints out the name four times
and if we look at the console you'll see
that it does them all and the same thing
with the value okay so let me close that
console down because there's one more
example I want to show you and that's
how we loop through a dictionary okay
because we loop through a dictionary in
a slightly different way because the
dictionaries format is slightly
different so let's create a dictionary
so I'm going to create a variable called
inventory and I'm going to set that
equal to a dictionary so for the key of
one an ox willing dictionaries in more
depth later we're going to say that
that's a television and then for the key
of two we're going to say that that is a
computer
and for the key of three we're gonna say
that is a console so now we have a basic
dictionary setup it's an integer string
dictionary as you can see and what we're
going to do is we're going to loop
through this so the way you loop through
this is using what's called a tuple so
you say four and then you put a tuple
here so four key and value in inventory
and we open our loop so that we can do
whatever we'd like in here and in here
what we're going to do is we're going to
go ahead and print and what we're going
to do is make it a string but we're
going to print the key and then the
value so we'll print the key and then
we'll print the value and you'll see on
the right-hand side that's done that
three times and let's see what that
output looks like so it says one
television and the reason we're not
getting it to show the last one is
because dictionaries don't return
themselves in any particular order so
right here it's showing us the first one
but this is actually the one that's
being returned at the very end and
you'll understand that a little bit more
once we go over dictionaries but those
are four and four in loops and that's
basically how they work so they are good
for getting small tasks done relatively
quickly or extremely quickly actually so
keep in mind the way you could use these
with arrays and dictionaries and also
ranges okay and that's going to be it on
four and four in loops we'll see you in
the next video in this video we're going
to continue talking about loops we're
going to move on to the while loop and
the repeat while loop so it's time for
your tech info bite on loops a repeat
while
allows us to iterate over ranges or
collections but because the way the code
is formatted it's guaranteed to run the
code at least once before it even
evaluates the condition so that is a
repeat while loop a standard while loop
will run the code and evaluate the
condition at the same time and repeat
while loops replace the do-while loop
syntax in Swift so let's take a closer
look at these loops so understanding
while loops and repeat while loops is
actually pretty simple the first thing
for a loop to work and the first thing
we're going to work with is a while loop
is that it needs a variable to go off of
so we're going to create a variable
called X and set that equal to one right
here and then the while loop basically
says while X is less than or equal to a
value
we'll say 10 then in here what we want
to do is go ahead and print the value of
X and we also need to increment X as
well otherwise it's going to do it over
and over and over and over because it's
always going to remain 1 if we increment
X then it will do it 10 times 1 through
10 and you'll see that it will just
print out the value of x each time and
it's a graph of it but this is well it's
not showing me the X but you see that
just increasing one each time okay so
that's a basic while loop so they're
fairly simple they just go off a
variable and they evaluate that variable
and if that variable is less than or
equal to whatever you set it to then you
can do whatever code you want in here
but you need to make sure that you
increment X this way it eventually stops
otherwise you'll have a loop that keeps
running and the loop that keeps running
will run until your memory on the device
runs out and then it will crash and
it'll do the same thing on your computer
in the playground actually it will run
until the memory runs out and then cry
okay so a repeat loop is very similar
with one exception and I'll show you so
I'm going to create a variable called Y
and set that equal to one and then what
we're going to do is we're going to say
repeat now this replace the do the
do-while loop
this is now a repeat while loop so we
say repeat and we immediately open up a
code block and in this code block we do
whatever we'd like to do so in this case
we're just going to go ahead and print
out that Y is equal to and we'll just
pull out the value for Y and then what
we need to do after this is say while
and then set a value or a condition to
be met so while Y is less than or equal
to 100 so now you'll see that we have a
loop that's continually going and that's
because I didn't increment the loop and
that should be done right here where we
do y plus plus so if my playground can
recover from that then you'll see a
working while loop okay there we go so
it stops at 100 times and it just prints
out Y is equal to whatever the value at
the time during the loop is so there's
our graph and can we get values it says
y is equal to 100 but it's off the
screen for you so basically it's doing
what we want it to every time don't
forget to put your incrementer there and
then your condition here so if you
notice this is always going to print
this at least one time because it
doesn't actually evaluate a condition
until after it does that initial run
through so it says repeat we do what's
in here and then we evaluate the
condition all right and really that's
all that there is
say about while and repeat while loops
they're pretty straightforward and
they're actually very useful in your
code
