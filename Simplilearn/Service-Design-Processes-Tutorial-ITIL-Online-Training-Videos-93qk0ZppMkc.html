structure of the service portfolio and
also the relationship between service
portfolio and Service Catalog a service
portfolio represents the complete set of
services that is managed by a service
provider it is used to manage the entire
lifecycle of all services and it is part
of the overall service knowledge
management system it has three parts
namely pipeline service catalog and
retired services pipeline represents
services that are under consideration or
in development stage service catalog
represents services that are live and
currently available for customers and
those that are available for deployment
and retired services are the ones that
have been decommissioned and not
available for customers the service
catalog is a subset of the service
portfolio and is the only part of the
portfolio that is visible to customers
it consists of services presently active
in service operation and offered to
current or prospective customers service
details can enter the service catalog
only after due diligence has been
performed on related costs and risks
required resources are engaged to fully
support active services while they are
offered to and utilized by the customers
in the next slide we will learn the
definition of service catalog
before we proceed further let us try to
understand what exactly a service
catalog is a service catalog is a
database or structured document with
information about all live IT services
including those available for deployment
while it is essential that all live IT
services should find a place in service
catalog it is also necessary that
customers and users should have
visibility of new services or changed
services that will be available in the
near future
hence services available for deployment
into life environment are also generally
included in the Service Catalog service
portfolio consists of three parts
pipeline services service catalog and
retired services the service catalog is
the only part of the service portfolio
that is published to customers and is
used to support the scale and delivery
of IT services hence it is important
that it is designed and presented in a
way that is easily accessible and
understood by the customers apart from
the disk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
