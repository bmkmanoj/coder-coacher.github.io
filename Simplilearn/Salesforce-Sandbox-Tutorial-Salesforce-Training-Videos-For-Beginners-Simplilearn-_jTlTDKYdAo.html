administrator at nutreve Worldwide Inc
last month we wanted to test system
configurations but every time we tried
to do that we ended up disrupting users
testing the configurations is crucial
for smooth running of business
operations I wonder if there is any way
in which we can safely test these
configurations without our users getting
affected I think you should create a
Salesforce sandbox creating a Salesforce
sandbox allows administrators to test
out ideas for changes create workflow
rules and enable other features without
disturbing users the sandbox provides a
copy of the actual live environment
called production which is stored on a
completely separate server using
sandboxes for development keep in mind
the following points regarding sandboxes
they provide a copy of the configuration
in code and in some cases data of the
production org application development
should start in the sandbox and be
tested prior to deployment the sandbox
is an isolated environment for
application builders to make changes and
test out ideas so in general the sandbox
is used as a testing and staging area
for customizations and code that you
desire to deploy to production so the
deployment can take place using change
sets or eclipse or even through a
package but the bottom line is is that
sandbox is essentially a carbon copy of
your production org and matches all the
configuration and any code that you have
in production now there are some limited
sand boxes that like the full copy
sandbox and partial copy that will copy
over code for certain objects so if you
want data brought over use the full copy
sandbox and then all the data from
production will be brought into the
sandbox you may ask why that's useful
with a full copy sandbox you have the
benefit of testing out your code in
customizations
on live data whereas the developer and
developer pro sandbox is
those don't actually bring over any data
so if you want to build out code on
accounts for example and you want to
test out and see if your code works
properly you're going to need to create
some test records now creating a test
record isn't a big deal however if you
want to exactly mimic the production
environment you probably should recreate
an exact record from production that way
your testing with the same record that's
going to end up using that code in
production so let's go into Salesforce
and check out the sandbox area
so I'm logged into Salesforce in the
setup area as I scroll down here I can
see that I've got several different
sandbox options I have the developer
where I have 24 available and one in use
I have developer Pro I also have partial
copy and full now the difference here is
that with the full version if I have a
full sandbox copy license available what
I can do is create that sandbox and see
all of the records in the sandbox that
originally existed in production now I
have some options here for the sandbox
that I've created I can delete it and
just totally start over I can refresh it
which will as the name implies refresh
the sandbox with any customizations or
changes done in production or I can
choose to log in now at this point I'm
going to choose to log in and click on
this log in link now you can see here
that the user name is appended with dot
test so with the sandbox anytime you
want to log in you need to go to test
salesforce.com or as you can see here my
instance number has already been
populated so at this point I can click
login to the sandbox and actually login
so now I'm logged in to my sandbox for
my production org you can see in the top
right hand corner it says sandbox test
because again that's the name of the
sandbox now let's check out the users in
the sandbox and see what's going on with
the actual users and the user names
now if I come over here you can see that
I actually have a dot test at the end of
all of these different users so anytime
you want to login to the sandbox
you need to append your username with
the dot test or whatever you choose to
name your sandbox accordingly some
companies will choose to name it
sandbox others will name it after the
application being developed for example
if you're developing a human resources
application you might call up the human
resource of sandbox all one word so then
you would append your username with dot
Human Resources so just keep in mind
that it can be a little bit unwieldly to
log in with these different usernames
but when you're naming the sandboxes but
ultimately it tells Salesforce that you
want to log into the sandbox using your
sandbox username rather than your
production username hi there if you like
