course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project time
management there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to 5 process
groups in this lesson we will look at
the third knowledge area that is project
time management and its processes let us
begin with the first topic of this
lesson project time management the
purpose of project time management is to
ensure that the projects get completed
on time this knowledge area is primarily
concerned with developing a project
schedule and ensuring that project goes
as per the agreed schedule if there is a
need to change the project schedule the
change should happen by following a
proper change control procedure another
term used in the PMP examination is
schedule management plan schedule
management plan is part of the project
management plan and has information on
the planned project schedule and its
management and control let us discuss
the key activities of projects time
management in the next screen the key
activities that are part of the project
time management include identifying
activities estimating time and resources
and sequencing activities it is
important to identify a list of
activities that would be a part of the
project next an estimation of time and
resources required for completing the
identified activities are done finally
these activities need to be sequenced as
per the dependencies in the next screen
let us discuss project schedule project
schedule represents the time dimension
of the project plan and has information
like when the project would start when
each of the project activities would
happen in what order the project
activities would happen when project
would be completed etc usually software
system is used to develop the project
schedule the project team can enter the
list of activities in the software as
well as their dependencies and the
software can produce the project
schedule as the output Microsoft Project
is the most popular tool used for
project scheduled development generally
projects schedule is considered similar
to project management plan project
management plan is different from
project schedule project management plan
not only has information about the
project schedule but also other
important project related plans like
risk management plan cost management
plan etc let us focus on Gantt chart in
the next screen Gantt chart is a type of
bar chart that illustrates a project
schedule it shows the dependencies
between the project activities as well
as their percent completion a sample
Gantt chart is shown on the screen to
summary elements of the work breakdown
structure are depicted to complete those
elements there are a number of
activities under them some of these
activities have dependencies for example
activity B and C have a dependency
activity C can start only when activity
B is completed the chart gives you an
idea about when specific activities are
planned to finish and when the overall
WBS elements will get delivered create
tasks and work with the Gantt chart this
will make answering Gantt chart based
questions easy and fun in the next
screen let us understand the
relationships that exist among project
activities network diagram is
extensively used in the project time
management knowledge area to plot the
activity dependencies this is a
graphical representation of the project
activities in the form of a network
there are two ways to draw a network
diagram in precedence diagramming model
PDM or activity on node Aon boxes
activities and the arrows indicate the
dependency this type of network can have
all four types of relationships between
the activities in arrow diagramming
model a DM or activity on arrow
AOA the arrows represent activities the
relationships and sequences can be
inferred from the direction of the
arrows and linkages between the
activities in such types of network only
finished to start relationships can be
shown such diagrams may need to make use
of dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the network diagram so create and
work with the diagram this will make
answering network diagram based
questions easy and fun in the next
screen let us look at a network diagram
a simple network diagram is shown on the
screen
activities a and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both a and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on arrow network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
reporting purposes in the next screen
let us look at a few important terms in
time management when a successor
activity can start before the
predecessor activity can complete it is
considered lead for example you can
start preparing the test environment two
weeks before the development activity
finishes when the successor activity has
to wait for a few days after the
predecessor activity has been completed
it is considered lag for example one
needs to wait for two days for the
foundation to settle before work on the
pillars for the next floor starts
rolling wave planning is an iterative
planning technique in which the work to
be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail while the work in the
future is planned at a higher level it
is a form of progressive elaborate
in the context of estimating techniques
analogous estimating is based on the
previous project data therefore if the
last five similar projects took six
months to complete the next one will
also take six months this technique
employs expert judgment another
estimating technique is parametric
estimating this technique uses a
mathematical model to calculate
projected time for an activity based on
the historical records from previous
projects and other information a few
common parameters are identified based
on the previous project data and that
parameter is used to predict the time
required to complete the next activity
or project for example you can normally
complete 10 kilometres of highway
construction lanes a week effort is the
total amount of work required to
complete the activity duration is the
amount of time it takes in terms of
elapsed or calendar days if you have an
activity that requires 10 people to work
for 5 days the total effort is 50 person
days but the duration is only 5 days
