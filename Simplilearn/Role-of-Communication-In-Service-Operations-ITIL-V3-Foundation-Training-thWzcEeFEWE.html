balance a lot of conflicting priorities
while trying to attain its objectives
such as the conflict of external view of
IT versus an internal view of IT what
this means is managing uses experience
of the services of the external view
versus managing the technological
components delivering that service
experience all the internal view and the
conflict of stability versus response
which means that business won a faster
response from IT to business changes
when IT has to balance the stability of
current services while managing those
changes or putting it in another way how
to change a service without disrupting
current services another conflicting
priority is achieving an optimal balance
between cost and quality which means IT
has to continually improve services
while reducing or at least by not
increasing costs another conflicting
priority service operations has to
manage is that of being proactive versus
being reactive reactive means the IT
does nothing till something goes wrong
for example not adding additional
storage to the current one is
continuously running at a hundred
percent seriously impacting the
performance of the service while being
proactive means continuously monitoring
the story space and adding additional
storage space before the performance
becomes impacted so managing these
conflicting priorities and teams and
technology in service operation
highlights the importance of
communications the importance of
communications also lies in the fact
that issues that could be between users
partners customers or internal teams can
often be mitigated or avoided through
good communication an important
principle is that all communication must
have an intended purpose or a resultant
action
information should not be communicated
unless there is a clear audience in
addition that audience should have been
actively involved in determining the
need for that communication and what
they will do with the information so the
idea is not to send emails to people who
have no idea why they got it and what to
do with it
some examples of communications in
service operations are routine
operational communication for example
this incident ticket was resolved in
time and to use a satisfaction a
communication between service desk and
user or technical teams communication
between shifts
for example shift handovers reports
performance reporting communication
related to emergencies for example
outage or service downtime notification
to users and customers training on new
or customized processes and service
designs now that we have understood the
key concepts in service operations let's
understand some key terms and their
definitions these terms are part of
different processes and functions of
service operations but understanding
them now aids in our understanding
processes and functions and their inter
linkages as we go through them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
