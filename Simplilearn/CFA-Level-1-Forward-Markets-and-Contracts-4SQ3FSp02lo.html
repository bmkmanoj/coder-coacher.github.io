delivery settlement termination the
settlement of a forward contract can
take place in multiple ways we'll
discuss these briefly in this slide the
settlement can be done by making
delivery of the underlying in the
forward contract for example if the
contract is to deliver 100 bags of
cotton after three months then on the
expiry date the party which is short on
the contract has to make delivery of the
underlying to the party which is long
after receiving the contract amount
agreed at the time of contract
initiation another settlement method in
which no delivery takes place is the
cash settlement in this process the
parties exchange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
