so with that said that's all you want to
hear for me return your seats in your
tray tables to a full and upright
position please observe the no-smoking
sign no flash photography I'm gonna turn
this over to mr. Brad Geddes how are you
sir hey Thank You chip and I'm in DC a
little chilly but I'm looking or looking
into the woods six deer at the moment
which I will show was that course hit in
a moment so these are my favorite topics
and I'm gonna get into why in just a
moment
so you know for an official agenda
standpoint we're gonna talk about tools
time management project management
collaboration which is probably not
talked about quite enough in paid search
automation right so a lot a lot of
things going on here then of course a
quick recap so you know it should
introduce me in this
why I'm a time management person right
and when you look at what I do every
week I am them you know faculty for
first simply learn a PPC the covert
about houses of fun are CK I'm a PVC
consultant I'm an MX workshop leader
irate about six to eight articles a
month I wrote a book I'm on the board of
two companies and more so to manage to
get that done and not how everyone think
you're really lazy not replying to them
you have to be a time management crazy
person right so look every PPC er on a
little bit of a control freak and if
your PPC you probably are too I love
math ad writing it comes from writing
all the time right and this is why this
is important when you think about
running your agency you're running your
in-house teams and how you manage to get
everything so this is really question
one now I asked about 150 people this
one day at a conference there was a
clear answer so what day would you start
building an account someone said hey we
have a new client onboarding and you
look at your calendar you say ok Monday
there's no big time blocks Tuesday well
I've got the afternoon free but we have
an off-site there's no way I'm coming
back and working because no one ever
does Oh Thursday so you've already
pushed you know this new client
onboarding for days before you ever
start now here's the real secret of
calendar right the actual committed
working time is identical every day but
in paid search right we're no no we're
all makers people who actually need to
create stuff now makers live in big
blocks of time right this is a calendar
of we use a call your manager someone
who lives by their calendar because they
live by twenty five an hour long you
know minute meetings and so this is what
we're gonna talk about is how to really
manage your schedule and time properly
because we let get tools all right there
are many many paid source tools out
there it's not a lack of tools that's a
problem on paid search if you need to
get something
there's probably a tool out there that
will help you out the problem is right
it's not about like what tool to use
it's about knowing when to use them
right this is a very important point so
go back to right so your calendar your
project management system tells you when
you have time and what needs to get done
right a tool is only a job as something
to help you when you have time to
actually use it and so when you look
about work there's a three important
facts that kind of think of the average
person in an office environment spends a
minute and 15 seconds before being
interrupted now we've all been talking
longer than that so far so thank you
chip for non-rock me and our 50 and a
minute 15 seconds in here now it takes
an average of 25 minutes to fully
concentrate on what you want to get done
those two numbers don't work well
together and multitasking no it's a
terrible terrible idea if you have an IQ
of 120 so you know slightly into the
above-average range and your
multitasking you're accused 105 which is
basically right at the median all right
you lost that that ability you have and
so multitasking isn't useful either and
usually when you look at how long it
takes to get involved in something and
how often we get interrupted
multitasking happens and then none of
the work gets done as well as it should
so when you look at how productive
people are during the day time right and
you can you can actually use this URL
and look at this chart for yourself but
so so in the mornings okay it's 6:00 in
the morning everyone's drinking coffee
no one's actually awake it got that then
you've got that time block right from
like 7:00 to to about 10 11 o'clock for
some people that they're really
productive Oh lunch time happens what
happens when we kiss near lunchtime
right your song starts growling you're
looking at the clock like alright what
do you want
watch then then you eat you get that
that that time back in the afternoon we
have this problem right you want to get
work done right you're motivated to get
work done but it's afternoon you're now
at their 7:00 to 8:00 hour being in the
office and you don't have the energy and
the focus to get the work done
that's why afternoons are such a crazy
time for people because they want to get
it done they don't have the motivation
to get it done and they often some
afternoons what am I actually doing
right have you ever sat there at the
computer looking at like some
spreadsheet for 15 minutes like I think
I wrote a formula where did it go and
then highest motivation of the day going
home a highest motivation aronia has in
the day right it's actually oh the
commute back home so so when you think
about structuring and this is actually
my day right are I get up about 5:30 in
the morning today it was 425 it's only
not quite that early no no alarm have
some coffee and I read you know check
the news hoots going on right then I'll
check email to see did something burned
down basically if something didn't burn
down
I put email aside then this is arc sort
of company mantra it does that to me at
7:00 if you come in the office at 8:00
it's fine make it at 8:00 or 9:00 right
every day someone gets something done
email is not an answer the morning is
our highest productivity day it's our
highest focus of the day it's our
highest energy of the day the morning we
get something done because we bring our
own energy right to the task to make it
happen
and so every day we're gonna company can
say hey yeah I did this today now all
right lunch once time is for me it's
usually Netflix Plus launch do not eat
at your desk take a break
let the work simmer let it let that's
what will you have the shower moments
right where you're taking a shower like
that's the answer
great let your brain relax a lunchtime
now afternoons you have the motivation
to do something
may not have the energy to do it so this
is a great time to borrow energy from
somebody else right so this is a great
time for client meetings because you
know what they have the motivation to
understand their reports rate that
that's it's higher from that moment in
time so that way you're borrowing their
energy but you still have that the
motivation actually want to do a good
job right and so it's a great time the
afternoon to do those calls those
meetings webinars what do you think mark
on webinar start at 12:30 for me I know
it's early in the morning for chip and
then by 3:00 I'm done now this is not
always true right there are times that
hey we do a lot with you know Australia
we do a lot in Asia so every once awhile
sure right I managed just like four days
a week I managed it not five but that
makes a huge difference because hey
sometimes by 3:00 I'm done sometimes
it's a little bit later but that's
that's the breaking up of the schedule
right into your calendar rate so walk
off that morning time to get stuff done
and then use it afternoon for other
things no again every day you can't do
this if I'm East Coast are on the East
Coast u.s. so in my morning they're
still actually still my office in London
so we can actually do phone calls in the
morning so yeah what's a a week it
messes that up so you know first up is
your counter second is your office now
again I have a nice office and we'll
have cubicles whatever it is right but
what's what's important is a I didn't
have to clean this desk to take this
screen shot this is actually what my
desk looks like right now except there's
also a presenter on it because I'm
holding it as I'm doing this right now
but it's one monitor and you know two is
useful if the second one holds reference
data but I can't count the no times I
walk into an office everyone's got dual
monitors looks really good and the
second monitor is that email that's
popping up and keeps their attention or
worse it's Facebook or Twitter even more
distracting
that point in time right I've got a huge
library I use three books these days
Kindles are awesome you know what there
are certain things an actual book is
better for and it's usually add writing
because the book that paper it helps to
create a spirit and so if you're doing a
lot of ADD writing you know it actually
flipping through with dictionary is way
easier on addition calm way simpler and
it's actually quicker to jump between
pages and see stuff so when you think
about it right it is where is your focus
if your focus point is cluttered I'm
sure you hear this all the time right
you get distracted if it includes
multiple monitors that you know have a
Twitter feed or email going you lose
focus in fact everyone on our company
uses the same desktop a first thing to
note there's not a single icon on the
desktop because if they're on the
desktop they don't follow any things
like Dropbox you'll try to be shared and
backed up automatically
they actually slow your computer down
having too many icons your desktop
because your computer keeps your desktop
icons in memory you can actually slow
your computer clean desktops are
actually really really useful second hey
there's a reminder of how we manage
things right okay is this actual note
maybe needs to be in a reference is it
Oh a long thing that this needs to go
into a task management system great I
mean is it something that's gonna be
just real fast so that way you look your
email you got 20 emails 10 take all over
30 seconds use to reply boom five
minutes half mark on your emails less
now and the others need to be in project
management or on the calendar or you
know a reply to it now Multi screens can
be useful if your second screen is your
project management or like a note based
system so that's where all the time I
may have a split screen of here's
Adwords
here's Excel right or here's Excel and
here's live writer for writing blog
posts
so reference data can be useful on a
screen but what you don't want are two
completely different things sitting
there that just cause you to distract
yourself back and forth all the time so
paid search there's way too much news as
I'm sure all of you know there's just
too many announcements that come out so
this is I love feedly but you need some
kind of a reader system right I find
that email news is distracting because
why do I want that coming in my inbox
and if I make a rule to shove it into
another folder the odds of me checking
my news folder I do have one but it's
it's pretty low rate so the way even my
feedly is structure this is like a
Google Reader if you don't know it right
I've got I lucked my tech news so that's
why when a tech is kind of like this is
the stuff to read in the morning when
your brains still turning on then right
I've got my one mark read these are
things like add age your stuff that they
write a lot and if I don't get to it it
doesn't matter right that kind of bored
moments and then here is the recaps of
the things you should actually know and
marketing day in search cat both from my
third row media fantastic for this and
then you can get into the other things
whether it's all the PPC stuff or you're
lurch or whatnot if you don't or a lot
of places don't have RSS feeds any works
really knowing there are things like
email to RSS that will take your that
email automatically make an RSS feed for
it so that way you can even read your
email in a feed reader to sort of keep
that out of your inbox this here's my
email system it's I know I love Google
inbox I find inbox is actually really
really useful it is rare for me to have
more than 10 emails in my inbox at any
one time and at the other day it's not
always in buck zero I think that's a
concept that just says hey archive all
your email or don't get back to people
so yeah there's usually three to five
emails you know something sitting in my
inbox but
machine learning rate that a lot of AI
that people are talking on these days
it's actually really useful for quick
replies to email right you can just say
hate done what do you think and it
learns so that way you can say oh you
usually say this to share usually say
this to join so here you go this is what
you normally say if you do like a
one-word reply and so even emails can
start to be automated in in some cases
now our craziness doesn't stop there we
I'm not gonna go through these but we
even have meeting rules
III years ago I went on vacation
actually one of my honeymoon for a
couple weeks and I came back to more
than 30,000 new emails and went huh
that's never gonna happen and then I
went how do I have this many emails and
I took a look at you know the list we
had in the company company was only uh
one hundred and forty two hundred and
forty-three people at the time so
there's no way they should be there at
that many emails I'm like I'm on a
hundred and seventy six distribution
lists maybe that's just too many
distribution lists to be on and inside
that said hey let's make some meeting
rules things like meetings to only be 25
minutes for 50 so people can actually
make their meeting on time and and go to
the bathroom when meetings start we
actually lock the door or if it's
virtual we don't let people join because
meeting should be something people want
to attend I know that's on so
counterintuitive right like you should
want to because you're shaping direction
of something in and we go so far as to
say if you call a meeting
you must have an agenda everyone must
have the agenda in advance the outcome
of the meeting can't be we know you know
their meetings have discussed this
meeting it missed me this is what each
person needs to actually do and if you
don't accomplish those as a few more
sets of wolves you actually lose meeting
privileges for a week right so the first
week I did this i watch our CEO out of
the out of our actual meeting room he
was never late again yelled at me
for once I explained the I explain why
and he never it's never late again and
and I'm sure most of you know hey you're
CEO if they show up 20 minutes late you
let him in and they you all you spend in
the next 20 minutes rehash in the first
20 minutes listing everybody's time and
so circling back to tools great tools
help us get things done right that's
that's what's important about him so we
did a survey you know seven six years
ago now how many PPC tools do you use
and and you know it vary but of course
it's a linear progression based on how
many keywords you have under management
did it again about a year and a half ago
and said you know what's the number and
there is significant growth at certain
levels and what huh why do you really
need this many tools a manage a paid
service account like the numbers just
seem too high like who really needs
eleven different tools nothing is that
the new tools were not like people were
using Moran and Kent you know quiz you
the tools people now listed as being
paid search tools for things like
Dropbox Google Drive um
Trello or team work p.m. collaboration
based tools slack was considered a paid
search tool and so the difference is not
the tool growth by how many tools you
need to manage an account it's that
teams are becoming more efficient in
sharing information because that saves
huge amounts of time if you're an
in-house company or your agency and most
of people deal with an account how often
have you had to wait what you say hey
can I have the 250 by 250 blue image
banner for this new account and okay so
they sent it to you know analysts a
who's on vacation so I have to email the
company again right and that's just a
waste of time
so using you know box go to our Dropbox
pick your favor all right they're all
good they're a little bit different but
they're all good and you know just as
important or consist
naming conventions we've talked a lot in
the past about how you know account
structure is important and labeling your
campaigns well is useful that way you
can see oh this is through a marketing
campaign only for Los Angeles or this is
the DSA campaign with audiences for the
United States right you can glance at
the campaign name and know what it is
the amount of times I see some of the
shared you know they have a shared asset
system and it's called image one image
to image 327 instead of blue theme 250
by 250 download call to action all right
now you can easily sort them find
exactly what you look for same for
reports right if you go on vacation and
another analyst has to step in and find
your you know report from July of 2017
that hasn't happened yet July of 2016
then they could easily see if there's
good naming convention so it's not just
the collaboration of the information is
actually having good naming convention
so anybody can glance at it and find
that information in fact we often I
often write I just a text document at
the top level of shared saying this is a
naming conventions for these files
someone could pop it up and go boom boom
boom okay I know how to find everything
now same with you know when you think of
project management you know Trello Jireh
Basecamp odious wydo teamwork p.m. right
they're all good systems there's no best
project management that doesn't exist
there's project management your team
will actually use because it helps them
feel like it's getting their job done
now that's important some systems make
people feel that they're just entering
data over and over again for no good
purpose that will be abandon that's not
going to be embraced and this is a
personal thing or a corporate thing
so like the old Basecamp I loved the new
base camp I can't stand it I come across
you all term like yeah we love the new
base camp it's amazing right
neither one of us all right or wrong
it's just a different way that we want
to see information given to us and
illustrated sim four note systems
all right Evernote Google key Microsoft
OneNote Google Docs they all have the
ability to you know take quick notes
share notes everything so which one it
is for best if you're an office 365
company you're probably using OneNote if
you're a Google Docs company you're
probably using Google Keeper Google Docs
so it's really more about which one does
the team want to embrace over hey let's
go find the new coolest shiniest thing
today now if you're a solo practitioner
write calendars are great this is what
you actually need to get done right if
you're in a team environment then
project management's better there's
nothing wrong with a calendar right
because that way you can just say oh
okay to say is negative keyword day and
Wednesday is big day whatever they
happen to be so we think about it tools
help you get things done right you don't
have to have a tool right tools are
optional tools are there to accomplish a
task but if you don't know what the task
is your tools are useless all right
that's a very important thing I see
people all the time ago what tools do we
need I'm like well what are you trying
to do may look at me like I'm crazy and
I'm like no like what are you trying to
do right if you're trying to do
competitive research then you probably
want to look at spyfu and semrush if
you're doing keyword research you want
volume data then you the Google Keyword
tool is way better than SEMRush for
absolute volume and budget projection so
both give you keywords will give you
budget projection and useful in very
very different ways so it's useful to
start with like the big picture right
your project management or calendars
what do you do and we've done a workshop
on this in the past month so at the
moment I'm going to walk through this in
about three slides and if you're really
interested then you can see our entire
workshop video on this and the past
right so what do you actually do and
this is a set of questions which really
really tell you
to organize your PM system or your
counter based system if you do this in
five minutes you did not think about
this exercise so number one make a list
right what do you have to do right now
that's an important thing have to do
things that are optional they should
never be on the list right this must
must be done or we're gonna run into
problems now this list should be things
that need to be done over the next year
right it's not what has to be done this
week or next month right it's it needs
to be done so this should not include
like hey we want to try the the new
priced extension it only shows up on
mobile devices and it shows up instead
of our site links so we should we should
put in our to-do list yeah that's on
your to-do list of experiments but it's
not something that really really has to
be right front and center in this kind
of exercise right so question next
question is how often do you have to do
it oh yeah okay we we want to do our
negative queries over the week or hey we
we still do manual bidding by hand we
need to change bids twice a week or hey
we're using CPA bidding and we're happy
with that we need to audit our results
every three weeks right big difference
there and just a different bid system
then when you do it right okay well we
need to do this twice a week on Tuesdays
and Thursdays we need to do this every
month and the client likes a finalized
monthly report so we should do this the
first week of the next month and this is
where it's really useful to pull up a
calendar when you do this just to make
sure you don't have a TAS in one day and
zero another one and then put your p.m.
system and if you want to see we did a
whole I'm 50 minute video right on on
this exact process which I went through
in like four minutes so there's a lot
more on things you can do here that's
they'll get you started but you know put
on a calendar you can visualize what it
looks like now experiments are different
this is where Corp
structure can determine the success or
failure of how your accounts go before
you ever start right so this company if
you ignore that dark green box this is
the company that they're paid search
team is about 14 people there they're
decent sized company and and they were
like ok we're not getting into enough
experiments these days there's all this
new stuff and we see the shiny objects
and we're just not getting it done
how do we do this so they initially
wanted a hire you know someone junior
getting a lower salary
prior to experiments and so they hired
and they put another person runs
workflow now here's the problem with big
organizations you don't do your job you
don't do what you're hired for you do
the job based upon how your boss gets
their bonus great that's the job you
actually do so what happened to this
person they hired and workflow they
added keywords and negative keywords and
created keywords and they never ran an
experiment in first six months so okay
that doesn't that's not where it goes so
let's put this under testing because
it's something new and different well it
turns out that all the experiments then
turn into landing page experiments
because we have dedicated ad testing
person and when it came to trying new
channels or Gmail promotions or
something never got done it was okay if
we put experiments reports to the online
manager and not a sub person they'll
actually get it done right and so it
took them like nine months to make a
pretty obvious right decision because
you don't do your job right you do your
bosses bonus job and and that's where
you know if you're on your own then hey
Friday afternoons or even Friday you
know mornings great time to try
experiments your by Friday our brain is
full you're thinking about what movie
are we gonna see this weekend or what'll
actually gets a good home or will the
boss notice not two hours early so
Friday's
in saying you know what Friday mornings
were to get back the really really you
know need to get stuff done first and
then hey let's use Friday mid-morning
still got some energy left as something
new because now you're gonna get
motivation and creativity from something
brand-new your brains got to work again
it's great so if you're a solo person
right or you're in a smaller team
Friday's like mid-morning great time to
get think hey you know Google um oh
there are the reporting system Oh what's
a shoot they just launched when it's
really great their data warehouse
reporting system and they launched it
with five free reports today unlimited
reports you can make all kinds of crazy
crazy reports and save them have them
Auto updated that's a good Friday
project when you're thinking about how
to how to get more things done now if
you're at a team putting a project
management system know next track time
this is not for billing purposes we I
mean if you're obviously billing you
know Tia now in town materials and
you'll do it for billing for billing
purposes to the reason to track time is
to find inconsistencies in processes or
to realize too much time is spent on a
task and you need a tool for it right
because if summer if you go to your boss
and say hey we want this new tool we
heard it's really cool but it's 500
bucks a month your bosses would say well
what's your business case and you can
either say it's gonna make us one of
five how's month because that's an easy
win then or right you could say hey look
this process takes us thirteen hours a
month so 500 bucks thirteen hours what
do you think that's a way to win a
business case to a boss of yours and in
this time I was working in an agency and
went why does this process take
you know sainty four and a half hours
and carrot under two and a half hours
actually Mike was doing almost two hours
I'm like that's a really really huge
time difference for for this particular
process right bye-bye analyst and went
this is for an alpha-beta campaign right
well you've got your your modified broad
matched in one campaign you look at
what's doing really really well
from a query standpoint you add
negatives there and you make a managed
campaign where you're only using like
most keywords turned out that process of
queries meeting goals that will process
right there was the problem because
people go what's a goal did we meet our
goals this word has 20 impressions and 5
conversions do we add it but it's 20
impressions which means it may be low
volume so we can't make it a negative
and that little process that thought
process was just you know Mike was just
saying that looks good looks good looks
good right and insane he was thinking
about it a lot so all they had to say
was you add a query as an exact match
keyword if the query has 35 impressions
and 2 conversions for 3 consecutive
months then they went oh we defined that
oh we can write a script for that Oh
we'll just add these automatically and
come back later to see if we need to add
the negative keywords and all this time
gone it now is about 30 minutes while
they are to the process for each
person's to double-check everything but
this one from 4 hours to about 30
minutes because they defined it which
means you can automate it now don't
forget to optimize customer support -
right it doesn't stop it at the PPC side
right support calls and agencies can eat
up your time so a lot of people think of
supporters you know freshdesk or
salesforce or something so at and and
and analysis we use freshdesk and i'm
like we're just
we'd have someone ask us a question and
someone else asked the same question i'm
like why are we answer them twice or
their asses a question they get a great
reply six months later that asked the
same question i'm like it's a better way
to do this so we actually started making
videos of how to enter questions so that
way when still wanna ask us a question
we had a video for we could go here you
go
and all of a sudden that support time
dropped to almost nothing because if
someone said how do you do this again
here you go
where do I find my reports again here
you go right so I actually think a go-to
meeting like we're using the good
webinar right now it's a support tool
for us it actually falls under our
support budget not our marketing budget
because that's actually where it saves
us the most time so again we've talked
to this event a lot of these are for
right building on automation it's
important to build automation but only
only great if it's a a repeatable and
consistent process because you can't
automate it depends right it's the most
common PVC answer it depends can't
automate that right so when you really
think about it so we want automation or
what do you need we don't know right
things okay this takes us too much time
all right we got that so do you always
make the same decision no can't automate
it now maybe you can do alert right but
you can't automate it do you always make
this could you make the same decision Oh
interesting question we could if we if
we raised our benchmarks a little bit so
that we're not on the low part great so
if you raise your benchmarks now you can
automate it right so let's try that out
and so that's important automation it's
not just you should automate right it's
really more about is it report is it
repeatable and consistent and is it
really saving that much time spending 20
hours making automation tool to save you
5 minutes a month is not worthwhile
great spending you know 20 hours my
combination tool that's gonna save you
20 hours a week really worthwhile so you
know circle back to tools when we think
about tools right you can sort of look
at your how to account hand campaigns
work so you start with you got your
keyword your ad your landing pages right
set a tool one is obviously building
accounts - we need to test our data get
metrics right we take that and then we
can use negative keywords and negative
placements in set bids a lot of people
jumped you
process they say what did management
system do we need well are you tracking
conversions yet because if not you can't
really set bids yet right so it's really
start by determining a process what to
do how long it takes then you look and
say okay we just need actually we expand
our campaigns all the time we need
builder tools but Google CPA works great
we don't need bid tools or hey we're
trying test everything but it's just too
much so we need an ad testing tool now
you have something specific to go look
for to see what fits your actual needs
because you actually know what the needs
are as opposed to asking that more
general question which no one can really
answer alright so for to recap here so
we can get to so I'm sure good questions
right step one start by determining how
you work right some people and I'm
actually not a morning person I get up
early that doesn't mean I'm ready to go
in the morning as happen to get early
because I have kids right so it's a
quiet time in the morning so Tony hi you
work there for an evening person great
but structure your day around when
you've got your own motivation and
energy right structure your office you
kid work all your working environment
with minimal distractions right
calendars your creative people if you're
in paid search you want big blocks of
time you don't say I got fifteen minutes
of meeting i'ma do some pure research
no one's ever uttered that statements
right so structure calendar with those
large blocks of crater time then use
project management counter to know what
to do once you know what you're doing
then determine your process now once you
have a process to find you can use tools
make those processes flow much faster
and be much more accurate with them with
that I'm going to turn over to to chip
to see if we have good questions and
take a sip of water I love this stuff
this is a life lesson moment for me my
friend
this could not have come at a better
time
I don't do
see of course on a day-to-day basis but
man I am juggling so many different
projects myself right now between
personal projects and client projects
I'm desperate for some workers so this
is this is good yes we do have some
questions in the system before we get to
it though I am going to launch a quick
screen take over what I call my
contractually obligated screen takeover
and thank you very much
GoToWebinar for cutting off my my little
title there but the reason for this is
to just give you a quick idea about what
it is that we do here at market motives
slash simply learn if you're here that
you know this is a free webinar you
probably heard about it if you're a
member you heard about it through the
member notifications and if you're not a
member you may have heard about it on
social maybe a friend told you to be
here what have you and that's fantastic
we'd love to have you here that's why we
do this this is our way of giving back
to the community with the insights of
our subject matter experts but it's just
important for you to know that webinars
is just a little piece of what we do
it's a perk for the community and for
our members we do a bunch of these every
month we do a bunch of them across the
two companies market motive of course as
the sister company have simply learned
and we do them around digital media
marketing and we also do them around a
lot of other kinds of professional
training and skill sets like project
management and so forth but the core
service that we offer is that we're a
training publisher here at market motive
we build web-based digital marketing
training curricula that's used by higher
education institutions it's licensed by
agencies and professional organizations
in-house Enterprise teams use these
trainings as an onboarding tool to get
new hires more productive more quickly
and these are structured courses with
streaming videos downloadable workbooks
quizzes tests get access to
you can interact with the faculty with
other students can ask questions about
the materials and at the end of the day
you will end up with some refined skill
sets or some new skill sets and better
able to communicate across silos and up
and down the management chain and really
make a great case for the campaign's
that you want to build and the the
projects that you want to undertake if
you're interested in knowing more go
ahead and click the appropriate box
we'll have somebody get in touch with
you there's no obligation and we'll give
you a backstage tour and help you pick
out the right course and figure out if
this is actually the right training for
you at all and maybe it's not that's
okay just keep coming back for these
free webinars so with that said oh and
by the way we will be contacting you of
course by email if you want to
fast-track it and you want to drop your
phone number into the question module
feel free and it'll be attached to your
data here on GoToWebinar and we'll have
them call you instead of emailing you
all right that's it I'm going to close
that and we will get back to the
questions so thanks for your indulgence
and there we go we're back to seeing
your screen Brad all right let's see
we've got Fay is asking if you use
Facebook Ads do you place Facebook ads
on a different day in Google Ads on
another day in other words do you feel
like it's appropriate or is there a best
practice for organizing the kinds of
platforms you're pursuing on specific
days and times what a great question so
this is going to be a personal
preference right I want to state that
here I find that Facebook Ads you're
talking to people more than search so I
might do Facebook ads the same day I do
ads for Google Display Network
especially if like remarketing or
something but I generally would not do
Facebook than jump to Adwords I'd
actually want something in between what
my mindset just reset that creativity
for a different audience type that's me
if you get creative and you're just
going go for it right but that's that's
I think that's more a personal
preference of how different your
messages are to audience type and if
it's kind of like having that you know
sorbet in the middle of a meal right
cleansing power from one before you move
on to to the next piece that's how I am
but I know everyone's not that way so
that would be more about how your best
workflow really goes perfect question
cleanse the palate yeah exactly
she resonates with that
let's see Vladimir is asking doesn't
reading a bunch of RSS news in the
morning kind of put a lot of information
in your brain and just kind of load you
up do you find you need to kind of detox
from that before you can start focusing
so actually for me no right and this is
weird it's different for everyone
probably some ages in the afternoon I
get up and I'm not a morning person I
until I've had my second cup of coffee I
do I will not speak to a human it's it's
best for everyone involved
and so to me reading the news in the
morning kind of jumps hurts my brain
creativity oh my god that's something
new maybe we'll add that to the to-do
list of things or hey look there's a new
Android update coming out for this right
and so to me it actually gets me going
but I some people are the opposite right
but what I don't do in the morning is
ritu Facebook feed or whatever else is
doing I'd rather you know do stuff
myself there
that's so again that's that structure
today based upon how you know you work
where your brain starts moving in the
morning if you're a morning like my wife
can get up and just start working I do
not have that ability that's an
interesting observation you wake up and
you start looking at Facebook right away
you're really looking at how productive
other people are being that always makes
me feel bad there are studies that
actually talk about the correlation
between how much time you spend reading
Facebook and depression
levels because you're reading and not
doing stuff in facebook for me I feel
like I'm you know a little ADHD or
something and I find it so easy to to
keep distracting myself and that metric
you had earlier when you talked about
you know staying on task for a minute
and a half and then it takes 25 minutes
to get back in at market motive when
when we used to have our developers
working right here in the Scotts Valley
office our co-founder John Marshall
finally had us put a sign on the door
for the development team that you know
you couldn't go in unless the building
was on fire and you know for those kinds
of people who and and again you're doing
PPC research whatever where your brain
is just really needs to be kind of in
the zone on a particular task he would
liken it to interrupting a chess game
he'd say you know you're in the middle
of the game and you're thinking five
moves ahead and you're thinking about
you know you've been observing your
opponent and how they work and you're
kind of getting a sense of who you're up
against and then somebody interrupts the
game they are fine you answer the stupid
question about is there popcorn in the
kitchen or not and then you have to look
back at the board and you have to
remember where were we in the game was
it my turn or was his turn and what was
I thinking about five moves and blah
blah blah so his analogy was
interrupting a chess game and I always
felt like that was really relevant and
I'm glad to hear that it applies to
people like me not just to people like
the PPC team and the development team
and I like him to sports right like I
mean I'm a big football fan but you you
see teams do completely different the
second half in the first half right who
can who can process it take a break and
then come back out with the new
information
focus again but with that you know
that's why you really see first and
second half teams where they process
information and the changes where if the
game like if you're watching a baseball
game is a two hour rain delay some teams
can't come back from that I get there at
the concentration like others they
needed it right
that's interesting yeah yeah exactly
exactly by the way Dan says that data
studio might be the tool that you were
looking for with regard to Google and
the free report thing you are correct
dan thank you so data studio a really
really cool tool we showed off your a
few weeks ago from Google that lets you
basically build reports connect to other
systems and stuff and then an auto
updates your information for you it came
out free for five reports they announced
this morning that it is now free for
unlimited reports which is just cool
that's cool
take a look at it it's funny I said data
and you said data I'm gonna get all
geeky for a minute here I saw a thing
the other day that's completely
unrelated to anything but I'm gonna do
it because I'm in charge I just saw this
great video where with brent Spiner who
played data on Star Trek and he was
talking about how all through the table
reads as they were developing the show
everybody called him data until the very
first read with Captain Picard actually
present and he read his very first line
and he said data and from there on
that's the way everybody said the name
of the character and he said the same
happened for every weird alien or
unusual character name whoever on the
cast had the first line and got to say
that name first that set the stone for
how everybody had to pronounce the name
for the rest of the series all right now
that I've completely wasted everybody's
time with that I can't help it that's
just how I am sometimes with the sci-fi
geekery Facebook and instant messages
distract us every few minutes what do
you think about browser plug-ins that we
can use to block access to certain sites
if we don't have any self control there
are things like focal filter block sites
stay focused do you depend on the people
on your team to just be self managing or
do you allow them to have plug-ins that
will help keep them focused so are we
hire people who were self managing in
that so if they needed a plug-in go for
it right I mean I
personally don't but if someone really
wanted one sure I don't really have a
problem with it if that's what you know
is required but what so with I am right
here's our our IM rule because I'm a
crazy person right it's that if someone
I am is you a question
and you look at it and you roll your
eyes you wait five minutes to answer and
after five minutes right you get it's
okay to ping them back assuming you saw
it right because often I don't see them
right away and if their answer was I
already figured it out they know they
shouldn't have Iams you you know they
shouldn't have Iams you and that they
actually learned something by you
waiting five minutes and it's it's the
whole you know teach someone to fish not
not hand them a fish type of thing so we
actually if it's a question that you
roll your eye if it's real question go
for it right but if it's one you roll
your eyes that we actually have an
internal rule wait five minutes to
answer the 'yes you already get a hold
of the dome where the questions become
yeah I find so often that you're right
people are just asking the question
because they don't want to take the
minute to figure out how to do the thing
or find the thing so yeah that's great
actions yeah it would be nice if there
was an IM feature where you could say
delay all my Iams by five minutes like
when people send it it has to sit in a
queue for five minutes
before it even displays to me miss the
old ICQ because it had all those crazy
rules although it really gave myself you
know what i secure you know and and one
note on meetings right so i'm demeaning
crazy person however i don't count
brainstorming sessions in that sometimes
when we'll get together and say okay
what is our next thing what are we gonna
build next that is not really a meeting
with an agenda and a purpose and this
and that right so it's okay to have like
those creative like we just need to take
a big look at this and it's not like a
super structure to thing those are those
are different than you know a business
oriented type of meeting yeah we used to
call those whiteboard wars
we're just gonna you know hey everybody
grab a cup of coffee or a beer come in
here we're gonna have a whiteboard war
exactly yeah those are my favorite kind
of meetings but I like the idea of
separating those two kinds of things
like knowing going in you know okay this
is a meeting because a lot of times what
happens that frustrates the heck out of
me aside from the no agenda thing and no
action steps at the end which just makes
me crazy is the meeting that turns into
a whiteboard war right so it's like
you're having a business meeting and
then somebody brings up a task or a
project or what-have-you and instead of
saying all right well we're gonna tackle
that in another meeting suddenly
everybody's standing up and drawing and
making flowcharts and bla bla bla
yeah in fact if we do like a webinar or
we do like a go to meetings we you know
we're virtual and most of our meetings
are virtual
if people are on time I think them right
I'm like thank you for being on time
okay it's actually just a habit now I
think it's a good habit
cuz it's just so calm and you're like
you're five minutes late are you showing
up rates can I end this or do I have to
spend other five minutes waiting for you
right and it's that whole limbo time
that's just and you're and you're
building animosity towards you for even
join the meeting in the first place
absolutely absolutely on that note by
the way we had some people join the
webinar late would you mind recapping
the first 20 minutes so that we can say
says
Feifei gist is expressing surprise that
you don't check Kim Kardashian posts
first thing in the morning that's the
first thing I do I honestly don't think
I have logged into Facebook this year
I'm gonna grant until February right but
I don't know if I even logged in this
year now I do check Twitter once a week
or eight and and I was on you know
Twitter a little bit earlier today but I
I'm not a facebook person because it's
just it's distracting and rather than
everything done so hey you know like
when the kids come home we can go relax
and get things done and have a better
transition than be like no I got two
more things today because I looked at
Facebook for an hour yeah yeah I I'm
impressed by that and it explains why
you haven't liked any of my memes
but never seen them I spend a lot of
time on Facebook and part of it is that
I'm just easily distracted but part of
it also is that a lot of the other work
that I do has to do with you know I'm
writing and publishing and I'm building
an audience and so I have a professional
page and I'm you know interacting with
people and sharing and doing a lot of
that kind of stuff I don't have to be
there and it's it's really hard to stay
focused while you're there and that's
very important right like we I deal with
the some authors from the author
Association quite a bit and Facebook is
their number one lead gen tool so
they're on Facebook sometimes three or
four hours a day but it's it's work it's
not they're like they're just looking at
people's posts and stuff right they're
engaging because they're building their
audience totally different right like
Facebook is a great you know
communication tool and a great way to
build a community I'm not dissing
Facebook you know it's a great business
case for it and if you want to catch up
on everything great it's wonderful but
it's it's the people who emailing on
Facebook and don't understand wait and
reply and you're like I don't know right
like you have my email address why'd you
send me something a potful not login -
that's exactly right
Facebook trolling around all the time I
know you're Theresa says shows no any
questions but just wanted to say thank
you for the call the great ideas in the
mental structure for thinking about
workflow and tool usage I'm sure that's
Thank You Theresa
I'm sure that shared sentiment across
everybody here
I personally I'm gonna get off of this
meeting and start organizing myself a
little better I promise
I love Trello by the way it's what I
used to use last year and I kind of fell
out of the habit of doing it I'm gonna
get back there gyro company
we do a lot of software development and
they just bought Trello so Trello is I
was our business case and Jireh was or
software case and they acquired the
Atlantis enquired them so I want to see
how trolla grows out they're actually
acquired for a company with two million
dollars in revenues acquired for 45
million dollars right so we'll have to
see what that business case
- yeah that's interesting that's
interesting were they buying users how
many users did Trello have yeah I guess
well it's got a free option exactly
interesting one last question
we do have shared assets process on
Google Drive and some other tools for
communication and so forth onboarding is
our challenge sometimes we find that
people get it here and are here a while
and then we discover they still don't
know where to find certain things so do
you have any insight on onboarding to
get people up to speed on shared
documents and assets and tools and so
forth you live walktroughs yeah so so
two options very one and none of those
word is never used anymore but internal
wiki's can be really useful for your
internal information the problem with
like slack is that it's all transient
based data and it's not it's not sitting
there all the time so a wiki of internal
processes is great someone gonna search
it or just keep a document at the top
level right like this is what you need
to know to use these Doc's you can
update it anyone can see it and update
it
this is where you find all the docs in a
spreadsheet in that way your top level
of Google Drive says here's how we name
stuff here's how to read it and if you
need to find a certain folder this is
the information the other thing that's
great to add to that if you're gonna do
it in Drive is a spreadsheet that lists
everyone's name email address and what
their role is and why why you should go
to them right so like oh we need a blog
post approved because this client wants
to his Facebook thing all set but I know
we have a community manager who is that
right great to also have that shared
information cuz the amount of emails we
get that are like who in our company
does this and so like personally I make
introductions from one Google or to
another Google or almost every week and
I'm like why don't you know this and
they've gotten way better at this like
internally for them but like that just
top level process great because then
it's a also defined process you know
what to do if you're trying to build
those out lucidchart
really really useful site and it'll
automatically backup your charts into
Google Drive so you can say okay here's
our onboarding process for you actually
made it a workflow for it we put it in
Google Drive then we can open it up and
see here's how a client goes so that can
be another way to kind of visualize some
of that that way that that new clients
get on board or new individuals get on
board as well and then link it to here's
the documents you need yeah
perfect yeah excuse me having those
documents that are kind of pinned to the
top so to speak it's a huge thing my my
experience I've worked on a few film
sets over the years and I love working
on movie sets and one of the reasons I
love it is because it feels very
military in the way that communication
channels are set up okay if you're not
part of this Union you don't touch that
light stand you know and if if you want
to move that light stand you know you
don't move it you go talk to the person
who's in charge of the light stand if
you want to talk to the director nobody
talks directly to the director you talk
to the first assistant director and
they're just a super super clear
organizational charts and some people
find it off-putting but wow man there is
no more efficient place you know for
physical work then then a movie set and
it's because everybody knows that
communication flow and that hierarchy
and who you're allowed to talk to and
who do you report to and what are your
tasks and what are you responsible for
also because there's like 20 unions
involved in making yeah exactly
yeah that's crazy yeah yeah but even
even on a non-union shoot and a lot of
the ones I've worked on have been
non-union they emulate that same kind of
hierarchy because it is just it's just
wickedly efficient and so knowing who to
report to and and what your
communication channels are huge in in
every industry all right I have shared
some links into the chat module for
those of you that are left with us
thanks for sticking with us all the way
to the end here
I've shared some links one of them is
the market mode of YouTube channel one
of them is a playlist on that YouTube
channel that is not publicly facing for
some reason I don't know why but it's
not under a password either you just
need to know where it is and that's the
playlist that has the old webinars so
previous webinars that have been pressed
produced and posted are there on that on
that playlist there's a link there to
analysis which is Brad's company and
then there are three links out of Brad's
presentation for today the meeting rules
the productive hours blog from Trello
and the the calendar recommendations so
take a look at those and get them open
in your browser now while you can before
we shut down and that's it we've gone
over time it's 10:35 on my time thank
you sir great hanging out with you thank
you tip for running everything great
chatting with you absolutely I'm super
inspired now so I'm gonna go get really
really organized and then look out world
man I'm I'm gonna take things over thank
you everybody else for being here taking
time out of your day or your evening or
what have you to join us and as usual we
invite you to join us again here next
time go check out the upcoming webinars
oh oh that's the last thing I'm gonna do
sorry that's the last thing I'm going to
do is give two more links here to the
courses for those of you that are
interested and want to learn a little
more these are the PPC courses over on
both market motive and simply learn and
I'm clicking sent and nothing's
happening and I don't know why well in
