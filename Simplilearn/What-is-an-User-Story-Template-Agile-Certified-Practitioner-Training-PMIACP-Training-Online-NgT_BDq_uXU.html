that the team works on in an agile
project as the name suggests the story
describes how the user interacts with
the system in order to get his work done
the three all iterated components of the
user story the three C's are card
conversation and confirmation card is
meant to indicate that the story is
typically written by hand on an index
card about four by six inches in
dimension the idea behind writing the
story on the card is to try and limit
the size of each story when you have to
express it in this way the author of the
story has to take efforts to make it
less verbose and clearer to the team
conversation means that the story should
be the starting point of a conversation
between the team and the product owner
who typically would write the story the
story should leave the implementation
details to the team and have potential
to innovate in trying to implement it
conformation means that typically you
also need to provide acceptance criteria
for the story acceptance tests are
usually written on the back of the card
and helps the team understand how they
would know that the work done satisfies
the requirement another acronym often
used to describe desirable attributes of
a story is invest here I stands for
independent the stories should be as far
as possible
independent of each other and
deliverable as a unit n stands for
negotiable it should leave room for
negotiation about the nature of
implementation V stands for valuable ie
it should result in some value for the
customer e stands for estimable meaning
it should be clear enough that the team
can come
with a reasonably accurate estimate for
the work S stands for small the story
should not be so big that it cannot be
done within an iteration of work scrum
for instance requires that a story
should require no more than 40 man-hours
of effort T stands for testable meaning
it should be possible to test the story
for correctness based on the description
and success criteria provided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
