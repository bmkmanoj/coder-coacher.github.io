the PG MP certification course offered
by simply learn in this lesson we will
cover program benefits management which
is the second of the five performance
domains that will be covered as part of
this PG MP certification course let us
begin with the objectives of this lesson
in the following screen after completing
this lesson you will be able to
understand how the lifecycle of the
program overlaps with the benefits
management activities discuss the five
primary activities within benefits
management explain how to identify the
benefits that will be delivered by the
program classify the responsibilities
during the benefits analysis and
planning and the benefits delivery
activities identify the tasks to ensure
transition of benefits to the receiving
organization let us find out what
benefit is in the next slide before we
start discussing benefits management let
us define benefit benefit is that which
provides a value utility or a positive
change of some kind to an intended
recipient a benefit could be tangible or
intangible tangible benefits can be seen
perceived and easily explained
intangible benefits are harder to track
as they can only be felt
also the payoff from intangible benefits
occurs in a different time frame now
let's see how the benefits that a
program may be able to deliver can be
categorised first they could result in
the creation of new products product
suites or a service secondly they could
result in the creation of an alternative
for example if only Road transportation
is available for a certain destination
the construction of a railway line to
that place would mean that an
alternative means of transportation has
become available
third they could lead to improvement in
some financial parameters such as
producing a certain revenue figure or
creating a certain profit margin fourth
they could be saving a valuable or
scarce resource in a drought prone area
any program that can achieve reduction
in water consumption is able to provide
a critical
to the region a benefit could also be
assistance in recovery from a calamity
disaster etc relief programs that help
in earthquake or flood prone areas to
recover from the disaster would be an
example of such a value there could be
many more such categories that you can
probably come up with the key point to
understand is that the program manager
must be open to the possibility of
providing benefits to the organization
in line with the strategy in the next
slide we will look at some examples of
benefits examples of benefits could be a
20% improvement in profit margin which
is a financial benefit or improvement in
customer satisfaction which is somewhat
of an intangible benefit note that an
intangible benefit can be of critical
importance because satisfied customers
lead to business results even
improvement in team morale is intangible
but we all know that a team with high
morale can potentially achieve great
results the other point to remember is
that the benefits from some programs are
not realized until the very end of the
program when the outputs of all
components come together and are
integrated for example there is no value
from a bridge or a railway line until
all the pillars roadworks signaling
systems etc are completed and some other
programs it may be possible to realize
some value sooner for example if you are
making a software product you can
probably release the first version of
the product which may not contain some
of the fancy features but can still
unlock some value for the customers in
the next slide we will understand the
relationship between program lifecycle
and program benefits management in this
slide we will map the benefits
management activities to the program
lifecycle in the subsequent slides we
will discuss each of these activities in
detail during the program definition
stage the first step is benefits
identification benefits identification
is about identifying and qualifying the
benefits that the program intense or is
expected to deliver as seen before the
benefits could be tangible or
tangible that is anything that is or is
perceived to be valuable by the
organization it is very important to
clearly understand the expectations
regarding benefits at an early stage the
next step is benefits analysis and
planning once we know what benefits we
intend to deliver as a program we need
to establish how those benefits will be
achieved this has to be tied to the
components of the programs and specific
activities within those components that
will help realize the benefits therefore
the program manager has to define and
prioritize the components in line with
the contribution of the components to
the planned benefits at the planning
stage the program manager also has to
define appropriate metrics that will
help derive the benefits the program
manager establishes a benefits
realization plan which specifies how
when and what quantities the benefits
will be delivered and how they will be
monitored the program manager needs to
map the benefits to the overall program
management plan the next step is the
benefits delivery phase you might notice
arrows that indicate that delivery and
planning activities are cyclical as we
start delivering the benefits we may
need to revise the plan this is natural
because the expectations may not always
be realized and therefore there is an
iterative process which is activated to
fine-tune expectations with reality and
benefits delivery the program manager is
expected to monitor the components to
ensure that they are contributing to the
benefits the program manager will
maintain a benefits register and report
on the benefits being delivered after
the benefits are delivered the program
manager must arrange for benefits
transition benefits transition is all
about consolidating the coordinated
benefits and transferring the ongoing
responsibilities of the benefits to a
receiving organization during and after
the transition the program must make
arrangements for continued benefits
sustainment the program manager must
make arrangements for active monitoring
and measurement
the performance of benefits on a
long-term basis the infrastructure
needed for continuous realization of
benefits over a long term must be set up
by the program itself as you can see
benefits management is a very pervasive
theme with touch points at all stages of
the program life cycle a program
managers whole purpose is to deliver
benefits and therefore this is a domain
that a program will spend a lot of time
on let us understand how a program goes
through the activities that we mentioned
at a high level the next slide deals
with benefits identification benefits
identification is the starting point of
the benefits management lifecycle the
more thorough the program manager is
with the identification of the benefits
the better will be the experience of
managing the benefits lifecycle as we
discussed earlier benefits
identification is all about identifying
and qualifying the benefits that the
program stakeholders are expecting the
program to realize the important
activities that are included under
benefits identification are as follows
first we need to define the high level
objectives and the critical success
factors CSF for the program without
understanding the overall objectives we
cannot come up with the expected
benefits second we have to identify
specific business benefits and quantify
them we need to understand how the
objectives translate into benefits and
in what quantities we need to deliver
them to baseline the expectations
regarding benefits realization we must
develop meaningful metrics and key
performance indicators KPI specific
processes need to be established for
each of the identified benefits at an
early stage also processes to track and
communicate around the planned and
realized benefits are created a good
place to start benefits identification
is the business case which contains the
list of benefits that the program is
trying to realize once the benefits are
identified they must be captured in an
artifact called the benefits register
we will look into the contents of the
benefits register in the following slide
benefits register is a document that
collects and lists the planned benefits
from a program it is a very useful
artifact for program manager because the
success or failure of a program is
determined primarily by the benefits
that were planned and actually delivered
the benefits register is created during
the benefits identification stage and
subsequently updated and further refined
it is used for measurements and
communication the benefits register
should include the following first and
foremost it should contain a list of the
plans benefits the more comprehensive
the list the more complete will be the
overall benefits management activity
within the program secondly it must
contain the key performance indicators
that will tell you if the benefits have
been realized you can also add
thresholds for the benefits by setting
the thresholds we can answer questions
such as what is the bare minimum
expectation with regard to a certain
benefit the benefits register must also
specify how a benefit may be measured
this may be relatively straightforward
for some of the tangible benefits for
example we can set financial measures
for financial benefits however for
intangible benefits it is not easy to
come up with the right set of metrics to
track the benefit this is where the
program managers skill in coming up with
the right KPIs and metrics comes into
picture the benefits register can also
map the planned benefits to program
components that is it is able to trace
which components and which specific
activities within the components of a
program are responsible for realizing a
benefit this clarifies the ownership for
the benefits within the overall program
the benefits register should have a
status or progress indicator that will
show how we are doing as a program with
regard to delivering that particular
benefit the status indicator will be
updated throughout the program the
benefits register should also contain
significant milestones for the
achievement of the benefits
that is when a benefit will start to
accumulate when it will be actually
delivered and so on
finally the benefits register should
ideally identify the stakeholders who
are responsible for delivering the
benefits
let us discuss benefits analysis and
planning in the next slide
after benefits identification an
important step in benefits management is
the benefits analysis and planning this
is where the benefits realization plan
is established and the metrics and
measurement framework for tracking the
benefits is created the typical
activities under benefits analysis and
planning are as follows benefits
analysis and planning essentially
establishes the plan to realize the
benefits to create the benefits
realization plan one has to identify the
program components that will lead to or
produce the benefits according to the
expectations regarding the extent and
timelines for benefits delivery the
program manager will need to define and
establish priorities for the components
tied to the benefits delivery the next
activity is to define the KPIs and
establish the process for measurement of
the benefits the program must examine
the feasibility of realizing the
expected benefits and through discussion
with the stakeholders establish a
performance baseline with regard to the
benefits the program will establish a
connection between the benefits
realization plan and the roadmap of the
program that is at what point in the
roadmap the benefits will be realized it
also needs to establish a link between
the benefits and the plans of the
various components as the work of the
components is completed they should
contribute to the realization of the
benefits finally an important part of
this step is to create a plan for
transition and sustainment of benefits
over a long term in the next slide we
will focus on the benefits realization
plan an important output of the benefits
analysis and planning process is the
benefits realization plan in this slide
we would look at the
the benefits realization plan generally
the benefits realization plan formally
documents the activities necessary to
achieve the planned benefits from the
program the plan should achieve the
following purposes first it should
define the benefits and how the benefits
will be achieved second it should link
the outputs of specific components
clearly to the program outcomes then it
should define the metrics for
measurement of the benefits next it
should define the roles and
responsibilities for the overall
benefits management process soon after
that it should define how the benefits
will be transitioned and sustained that
is who will receive them and how they
will be sustained at last it should
establish a process to monitor the
extent to which a program is able to
meet the desired benefits in the
following slide we will see a typical
design of cost and benefits the purpose
of this slide is to show a typical
pattern of how costs are incurred in a
program and how the benefits delivery
varies over a period of time there could
be variations in this depending on the
industry and the nature of the program
typically the benefits of the program
start to be realized during the benefits
delivery phase till then the program
starts off and incurs some costs the
costs peaked during the benefits
delivery phase and then start to reduce
as the work of the program starts to
conclude towards the end of the benefits
delivery phase and into the closure
phase the costs fall rapidly the
benefits should start increasing over a
period of time after they begin to set
in and as the program closes the
responsibility for maintaining the
benefits is transitioned to another
organization
let us discuss benefits delivery in the
following slide after the analysis and
planning is done the program needs to
deliver the benefits typical activities
during the benefits delivery stage are
as follows the program monitors the
external and internal environment of an
organization and maps it to the
program's objective
and benefits the program initiates
performs transitions and closes the
components in line with the program
management plan and manages the
interdependencies between the components
the timetable for initiating performing
transitioning and closing has to also
map to the benefits timetable for the
program the program will evaluate
program risks to the realization of the
benefits and the key performance
indicators with regard to the benefits
the program will record the progress of
the benefits realization and the
benefits register and report to the
stakeholders in line with the
communication plan the program will
initiate components and integrate the
output of the components to realize the
benefits as per the benefits realization
plan the program will monitor and ensure
that the accumulated and attainable
benefits are in line with the
expectations and overall strategy of the
organization let us move on to tracking
benefits delivery a balanced scorecard
in the next slide and benefits
transition the program needs to ensure
that the benefits produced in the
program are transitioned smoothly the
recipient of the benefits from the
program is typically an operational unit
such as sales or service the key
consideration and transitioning is to
ensure that the benefits realization
will be sustained the process of
transition should start before the
program closes and continue even after
the program closes during transition the
program should evaluate the actual
versus planned benefits to see how
successful the program has been in
benefits realization if the realization
and transition of benefits require
integration of output of various
components then the work must be
completed successfully before the
transition the program should make sure
that if the transition requires changes
to be made in the operational unit there
is enthusiasm and willingness to make
those changes the program should assess
the readiness and approval of the
receiving person or organization in
terms of availability of resources
capabilities and infrastructure
the benefits sustainment responsibility
during transition the program will
gradually release the resources it is
possible that some of these resources
will also be transferred to the
receiving organization during transition
in the next slide we will look into
benefits sustainment moving beyond
transition the benefits sustainment step
refers to ensuring the sustenance of
benefits long after the program is
closed it is important to understand
that it is the responsibility of the
program to ensure that provisions for
long term sustenance are made the
responsibility for monitoring the
ongoing benefits sustenance then
transfers over to the receiving
organization this provision includes a
plan for the changes necessary to the
operations any financing and behavioral
changes necessary to continue
performance monitoring including
training and enablement are made the
program should provide the resources for
example people supply of spares etc and
budget necessary for sustaining the
benefits the program should provide the
framework to monitor the performance of
the outcome against the plan it should
also monitor the continued suitability
of the product or service as the
business environment changes if the
changes required at the receiving
organization for benefits sustenance
need new components to be put in place
then such components must be initiated
during this stage to deal with changes
let us now take a look at a business
scenario program let's save has been
approved for building a rural hospital
Rachael Cruz has been assigned the
program manager for this multi-million
dollar initiative the steering committee
considered several names for this role
however based on her track record of the
several program she has managed a
decision was made to assign Rachel
Rachel is excited about her assignment
she is required to present to the
steering committee a high-level roadmap
of how and when the program can be
accomplished she has started working on
the creation of a benefit realization
plan the next slide has a question based
on this case we will now continue
with the scenario Mary Anderson is the
head of operations of program
let's save during the quarterly review
Peter Howe was approved as the benefit
transition owner for transition into
operations this program has been running
for four years now and is nearing
completion Mary along with the program
team is now looking to close the program
all benefits have been delivered as
expected
and although Rachel had some
difficulties with some of the
neighboring stakeholders the program has
been regarded overall as a success as
part of the benefit transition process
some of the program team members will be
staying on for another month to support
the transition of the hospital into
operational mode the next slide contains
the second scenario-based question let
us quickly review what we have learned
in this lesson benefit is a value
utility or positive change that a
program brings about for the
stakeholders there are five stages and
benefits management benefits
identification benefits analysis and
planning benefits delivery benefits
transition and benefits sustainment the
program manager plays a key role in
benefits management with functions
including identifying benefits and
linking them to the program roadmap and
all its components and activities
integrating the output of the components
and helping the organization to realize
the benefits measuring tracking and
reporting the benefits and ensuring a
smooth transition and long term
sustainment of the benefits by enabling
the receiving operations to take them
over with this we conclude the
discussion on benefits management in the
next lesson we will discuss program
stakeholder engagement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
