lesson the four is about using the s AP
business workplace and finally lesson
five deals with master data and
transactions let us now understand the
objectives of this unit
in this unit we will be able to learn
the basics of s AP system learn to
navigate search and get help run and
print reports use the s AP business
workplace and work with master data and
transactions let us now begin with the
first lesson that is s AP system basics
welcome to the lesson on s AP system
basics this is the first lesson of the
unit wherein we will learn the basic
concepts of s AP system ERP and its uses
before we begin let us understand the
objectives of this lesson in this lesson
we will understand the history of s AP
describe erp and its uses classify s AP
modules explain s AP system landscape
differentiate between customization and
configuration and list the benefits of s
ap let us now begin with a brief
introduction about s AP
sa P refers to systems applications and
products in data processing and was
established in 1972 in Waldorf Germany
through the years it has grown and
emerged as the world's leading provider
of client-server business solutions for
which it is so popular today the s AP
solution comprises of a complex
combination of different modules or
applications each being a significant
part of the basic business process si P
is the market leader in providing
software related services to enterprises
according to their business requirements
and also in terms of profits based on
market capitalization si P is the
world's third largest independent
software manufacturer we will look into
some si P company facts in the next
slide following are some of the
company's facts and the figures si P has
more than one hundred and ninety seven
thousand customers in more than 120
countries it has more than 55,000 765
employees and is located in more than
130 countries it has a 40 year legacy of
innovation and growth as a true industry
leader it has an annual revenue i F RS
of sixteen point two two billion euro
and is listed under the symbol Si P on
stock exchanges including the Frankfurt
exchange and the NYC
let us begin with understanding the
concept of s AP s ap develops enterprise
resource planning ERP software products
that can be used by the companies to
manage their enterprise the most
significant feature of sa P which makes
it stand out compared to other ERP
vendors is the way s AP integrates
complex activities such as operations
logistics manufacturing finances HR and
creates a seamless system these
applications update and process
transactions in real time thus are easy
to use and at the same time
sophisticated enough to handle the
required operations for any kind of
enterprise s ap solutions and services
facilitate more than one hundred and
ninety seven thousand customers to
generate profitable revenue constantly
adapt to ever-changing technology and
market and at the same time maintain
growth next let us learn about ERP ERP
refers to the enterprise resource
planning
it is a business management software
system that serves all departments
within an enterprise an ERP management
information system integrates areas such
as manufacturing distribution marketing
sales purchasing inventory finance and
Human Resources let us now learn more
about ERP planning and execution
the diagram shows the process of
planning and execution using si P the SI
P system is a fully integrated system
where activities in one area generate
activities in another area an ERP
management information system integrates
areas such as manufacturing distribution
marketing finance sales purchasing
inventory and human resources we will
now find out the uses of ERP
ERP has various implications across
several business areas such as ERP can
be used for overall control of an
organization it is used to have a better
financial control it helps to have a
better inventory control it provides a
better way of operating an organization
and its systems it provides a better
reporting system it helps in manpower
assessment it also helps in the optimum
utilization of resources such as people
machines and materials it ensures
accountability throughout the
organization and it provides an improved
quality of life let us now have a look
at the various ERP the various vendors
of ERP
include Oracle fan ASAP PeopleSoft
Siebel
JD Edwards we will now move on to the
different si P modules
sa P can be divided into four modules
which are functional technical in
three specific and new dimensional let's
look into these one-by-one
si P technical modules si pr3 uses a
three-tiered model and is a
client-server based application in this
model a presentation layer or client
interfaces with the user the application
layer includes all the business specific
logic and the database layer records and
stores all the information about the
system including transactional and
configuration data ASAP technical
modules can be divided as follows the s
AP retail system consists of a retail
pricing sheet which can be used to
determine the retail price for articles
the retail pricing sheet estimates a
retail price which can either be
accepted or can be modified there are a
number of different methods in the S AP
system to calculate the proposed retail
price the proposed retail price is
always based on the purchase net or net
price this purchased net or net price is
made from the purchasing pricing
elements or condition types defined to
be included in the purchase net or net
price a planned markup is applied to the
purchased net or net price to calculate
the proposed retail price
for example is retail is oil and gas is
utilities is banking let us now learn
more about the new dimensional modules
in the next slide
apart from the basic ERP solutions si
pr3 has developed many advanced products
for an organization which continuously
thrive to upgrade their enterprise-wide
processes after the core modules have
been implemented and when the confidence
and knowledge in Si P has seen a
substantial jump organizations start
searching for tools that can help them
to not only run the day-to-day
transactions efficiently but also
proactively it is specifically for this
reason that the role of decision support
tools gets justified and reviewed in the
form of new dimensional modules of si P
for example BI BW business intelligence
business warehouse SEM supply chain
management CRM customer relationship
management HCM human capital management
a chess environment health and safety
PLM product lifecycle management
apo advanced planning optimization PS
project system pii process integration
vo Business Objects SEM strategic
Enterprise Management SRM supplier
relationship management FS CM financial
supply chain management GRC global trade
services B PC business planning and
consolidation next we'll move on to the
SI P system landscape the architecture
in this slide shows the SI P system
landscape for an organization an
enterprise organization can have servers
to install si P these servers can be
divided into many clients the system
landscape consists of all the si P
systems that have been installed it can
consist of several system groups in
which the si P systems are linked by
transport routes when it is decided
which clients are required and which
roles are needed how to allocate them
amongst the different si P systems needs
to be decided multiple clients can be
created independent of one another in a
single sa P system however when the data
is configured it must be ensured that
the cross clients customizing settings
and repository objects are the same for
all clients in a single sa P system
changes made in one client apply
immediately to all clients in the system
let us learn about s AP servers
sa P system can be divided into three
servers development and customizing
Quality Assurance and production
development and customizing in this
server configuration can be done based
on customers requirements Quality
Assurance in this server after the
completion of configuration the testing
and verification of functionality can be
done
production in this server live business
data for clients activities can be found
a3 system landscape in which each of the
central clients has its own sa P system
is recommended this comprises of a
development system or TeV a quality
assurance system or QA s and a
production system or PRD the development
system encloses the customizing client
or C UST the quality assurance system
encloses the quality assurance client or
q TST and the production system encloses
the production client or PR OD all the
modifications are made to the
customizing data and the repository
objects in the customizing client when
the corresponding change requests are
issued they are transported into the
quality assurance client this means that
the modifications to cross client data
only display in the quality assurance
client after the transfer in the quality
assurance client it can be tested
whether the transferred data are
complete or whether any associated
modifications are lost and are still as
unreleased change requests if the test
is successful the change requests are
transferred into the production client
the production client is completely
distinct from the other client with
respect to the cross client data there
are many versions of Si P let us find
out about them
child shows the evolution of sa P across
time the different versions of sa p and
their release date are sa pr3 release
1.0 a release date 6th of July 1992 sa
pr3 release 2.0 2.1 released 1993

sa pr3 release 4.6 C release date April
2001
sa pr3 Enterprise release 4.70
release date March to December 2003 sa
pr3 Enterprise Edition 4.7
sa pr3 enterprise central component by
point zero sa pr3 enterprise central
component 6.0 and sa p ER p 6.0
enhancement packages one two three four
five six next we will look into the
difference between customization and
configuration
friends between customization and
configuration is customization in
customization the system can be
customized or modified to the business
requirements which is the process of
integrating si P to the business process
aggression in configuration the system
can be configured to meet the
requirements of the business by using
the existing data let's now learn about
s APEC c ec c stands for erp essential
component sa P is the ERP enterprise
resource planning software and ECC is
the version of s ap like 4.6 4.6 c and
4.7 the latest version is ET c6
it is known as enterprise core component
moving on next we'll understand the
benefits of s AP
sa P has revolutionized the way an
organization is managed it has
tremendous benefits for the
organizations some of which are listed
here sa P provides real-time processing
with an integrated suite of client and
server applications it provides fully
integrated business process including
maximum flexibility and scalability it
is multilingual multicultural and
increases profit provides increased
productivity of all resources including
people material and money provides
transparency in operations resulting in
better communication provides better
managerial control provides efficiency
and unification within a business
organization provides real-time
information about the business processes
within a company and provides easy
tracking of the business process updates
as well as any changes accomplished
with this we've come to the end of this
lesson we will summarize what we have
learnt so far in the next slide here is
a quick recap of what was covered we
learned about the history of SI p ER p
and its benefits the different modules
in SI p SI p system landscape the
difference between customization and
configuration and the benefits of SI p
