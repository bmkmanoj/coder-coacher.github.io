where you're located from somewhere
around the world welcome and thank you
for joining us for this webinar with mr.
Tim Pearson the dark web and the need
for ethical hacking the dark web
encompasses that little-known senior
part of the internet and it can be a
villainous kind of underground web where
you can buy and sell just about anything
it makes up about 70% of the other than
Internet you and I on a day to day basis
with Google or really only seeing about
30% of it so today we're going to just
take a little look at what it means
inside this part of the internet a
little about its relationship to the
concept of ethical hacking and why large
organizations prefer certified ethical
hacking pros who understand the nature
of the dark web we'll be working here
today with mr. Tim Pearson if you're not
familiar with him he is a technical
trainer for the past 27 years one of the
world's leading trainers in technology
networks virtualization and application
security he has written a number of
popular manuals for global corporations
like easy to count ec-council and mile
two and in addition to teaching of
course he conducts high-level security
evals virtualization consulting and
deliver seminars &amp;amp; keynotes at
professional conventions before we get
rolling though I just want to make sure
that y'all are familiar with your
dashboard and how GoToWebinar works so
Tim is going to give his presentation
I'm not sure exactly how long it'll run
but let's guess around 30 minutes or so
during the course of the presentation
you can type your questions into the
question module so let's make sure
that's working when you go ahead and
type a little note in there let me know
where you're joining us from what's the
weather like is it beautiful there are
you hiding under a blanket let me know
where you're going from Texas Adams in
Texas and says it's beautiful today I
don't doubt that this is a beautiful
time of year in Texas Illinois and it's
raining well I'm glad you're inside
there Michael Tennessee and it's warm
fantastic we've got folks from all over
the place and and thank you for taking
the time out of your day to curl up with
us New Delhi India
fantastic oh it's the it's the evening
there thank you for taking time away
from your your evening activities and
the Canadian Rockies Wow
I love it alright so that question
module that you're using there that's
going to be your best friend as we are
going through the presentation you go
ahead and type any questions in there
you can ask Tim you know tough to give a
little extra detail on a point or go
back and revisit a previous slide at the
end of his presentation and we'll do
that we'll do all the QA all at once at
the end of the presentation we'll get
through as many questions as we possibly
can if you want to share what you're
learning on social if he says something
super awesome and insightful which I'm
sure will happen and you want to share
it with your audience go ahead and live
tweet or post it on LinkedIn or Facebook
or what-have-you and if you want to you
can use the hashtag SL webinars I think
that's it
you know how the dashboard works now so
we're getting a little bit of a late
start if we need to we'll go a few
minutes late on there on our end time to
make up for it so Tim my friend it's a
pleasure to have you joining us here Oh
turn this over to you okay my microphone
will toast me and I'm ready to start I
guess everyone can see my screen right
now and so let me kind of give you a
little bit of an idea who I am my name
is Tim Peterson I'm from Dallas Texas I
consider myself a researcher and a
consultant
I get asked by a lot of large
corporations to come in and survey their
security stands they want to know what
other people can know about them uh I
was recently interviewed on Fox News
dividing I was the contributing author
to a book vmware vsphere and virtual
security and also i've been on the CBS
national news in the Early Show
with the evidence of Wi-Fi hacking and
we had kind of set up a sting operation
at a local hotel and and that's live on
YouTube if you'd like to carry search
for a name and Wi-Fi you probably find
it uh I also want to mention that I was
TIME's Person of the Year in 2006 and if
you know much about that
in reality so we used so time named the
person of the year you and so I was the
person of the year and actually so were
you so as we move forward here okay so
it's not telling me when I need to be
told it is it okay so as I move forward
here there are only two types of
companies and they've been hacked those
that have been hacked and those that
will be hat what we need to understand
is that we will be hacked what we need
to understand is what will be the thing
we need to do after we've been attacked
nobody really has that plan B they all
they all have the plan a which basically
says I am only going to work on the
premise that I am NOT going to be
attacked not necessarily that they ever
would be attacked but really we need to
have that plan B I guess probably the
most interesting situation was and the
way I kind of justify what I do is I was
asked by my mom who's that about 86
years old right now she know I chose I
teach in with computers but doesn't know
exactly what I teach I told her MP I'm
basically teaching about how to hack
into computers and I got the response
you'd expect from an 86 year old woman
good god what are you doing that for my
answer to her was how could you possibly
understand how to protect your home
unless the first the burglar shows you
and that's B first show you how the
burglars gonna break into it and when
you think about it yeah that's true
that's absolutely true and that's the
premise behind the whole reason we teach
the world to hack for good because we
have to understand how we're going to be
attacked in order for us to possibly
stop it from happening
we go onto the next slide here I get
this to move here uh the average
individual consumes consumer carries
about twenty five dollars less than
sixty dollars under 25 carries about
sixty dollars in cash the rest they
actually use with credit cards
near-field communication which simply
means and I take my credit card and hold
it near a pay terminal is going to be
over one hundred and thirty billion by
2020 so the possibility of me being able
to or someone being able to intercept my
data and charging through my card is is
very prevalent this confidence actually
is going to affect a lot of people so if
I take the regulations and compliance
that doesn't seem to be really a whole
lot of oversight so we have to do a lot
of that ourselves take Ashley Madison
for example I'm so I'm sure a lot of
people have heard about Ashley Madison
and it was in the news a couple of years
ago where they advertised life is too
short we have an affair and naturally
when their system was hacked they
released a lot of these well he receives
all the information to the world and
people that actually had paid Ashley
Madison to be taken off of their list
because they may have had a moment of
indiscretion at some point in time we're
actually still on there so they accepted
the money but never really took them off
list so it it really gets the point of
who do you trust and really the the
thing that I can tell you is the only
person you're really gonna be able to
trust is yourself so you're gonna have
to take things into your own hands where
you're going to need to understand how
things work and how you can be hacked
and try and protect yourself so if you
look at the evolution of Finance for
example in 1970s we're in the local
community then we move into the 80s
where we have branches where credit
checks are done and that kind of thing
then moving on to online
day trading in the 1990s I was really
popular to make money then moving into
the new millennium the chain starts to
begin where now we have things where we
can pay you almost immediately
near-field communications Envy Apple pay
PayPal all of these things release
amount of metadata of what we're doing
alright so here in 2015 2016 we're in
where this change is actually beginning
so the hackers it's really hard to
believe how fast the world is changing
if you look at Tesla hasn't as an
example where the autonomous vehicle is
actually starting to drive itself ah
it's kind of scary in a lot of ways all
of these individuals right here were
pieces of things that have been hacked
now we're talking about things that we
know about but let's dive in and that's
scary enough let us dive in a little bit
deeper if I dive in to what's known as
the dark web or hackers are actually
buying and selling data the dark net and
the dark web is used I'm gonna explain
what that is here just a second now
where markets used by hackers to buy
this software so you could pay
individuals that don't have a lot of
ethics per se into buying and selling
this particular software that grabs the
information money laundering ghost
markets bitcoins Bitcoin is very popular
because there's no tracking it then we
have fraud and counterfeit loss of
property all of these things can be part
of the dark net now let's take a look at
the levels of it argument the first
level is what we refer to as the common
web
all right that's really level zero
that's where we are right now we
typically go into
zero level one which is surface web
where we get reporting from things like
Reddit Digg temporary email services all
that kind of thing
level twos where it starts to get a
little bit mystifying all right
the burry whip Google locked results
honey pots news groups FTP services
things of that nature then we're moving
to level four which is the Charter web
hacking groups shelling networks
artificial intelligence theorists band
media activists communications all of
these types of things are what we call
in level four of the dark web level five
is the big level what we consider to be
the dark web now at level five we have
what we refer to as onion sites now let
me explain to you what an onion site is
there is a a utility called tor it
stands for The Onion Router and it's
like bits of an onion where we peel back
layers of that onion to get access to
material where they wouldn't know who we
are and you can buy this illegal
material uh possibly human trafficking
bounty hunters rare animal trade
different types of exploits black
markets drugs all of those types of
things are available on the dark web I
think this next slide will actually be
kind of interesting to you what we
typically see is the visible web that's
what you're gonna get from Google that's
what you're going to get from the
communications at Google the deep web or
the hidden net is like an iceberg where
you only see the very top of it but
underneath there's a whole lot more and
actually we could see as I talked about
earlier you could download this piece of
software or you could download an entire
operating system that's built with this
piece of software which is typically the
the best way of doing this
and you would get access to sites that
are referred to as onion sites all right
and you can see I just did a Google
search for tor hidden wiki normally they
start with dot onion the URLs sometimes
you can get access to this normally you
have to be almost invited in to this
realm of piracy if you would moving
further in here here's some things that
have been easily seen that you can buy
for example if you want to buy $50 US
bills okay they're produced for regular
cotton paper the same thing that the US
Treasury produces they pass the pen test
you know where you've seen when you hand
a teller or anyone who's taking your
money a bill and they'll take a marker
and the mark on the bill and it'll turn
purple if it's counterfeit it's not on
this cotton based paper but it will just
stay yellow if it's not and they passed
this test you know UVI is incorporated
so it passes that test as well they
actually have been used and we sent
these as a test we sent these into I
believe it was 20 banks European banks
and only one caught the bills and these
were actually at banks themselves so
it'd be very very difficult to detect us
all right and we had the permission from
the banks to do this we wanted to see
how easy it was to detect something like
this
things like PayPal accounts now why
would you ever want to buy someone's
PayPal account
well PayPal accounts it has $100 on it
are worth about 26 Bitcoin okay which is
at the time of this writing was less
than $100 about maybe $20 so you're
buying $100 for $20 all right well yeah
I could see where that might be
advantageous but they're actually buying
this so they could purchase services
on the Internet they will be actually
drawn back to someone else 100 obey
accounts where you're sent material okay
by just changing who it sent to an
intermediary who ships it off to someone
else
a hundred credit card numbers with the
CV two numbers on them
okay credit card numbers are actually
not very expensive at all because they
can be turned off instantly
but someone's identity which is also
sold here with a credit card with their
social security number their full legal
name and their location or their your
full legal address are three things that
are needed to steal someone's identity
very very easily done let's look at some
things it might be done here's an
example of our PayPal sir uh the various
balances and the prices they're offering
for these so here's one for 700 ollars
okay their price is $85 and you can buy
this add it to your cart and we did have
$700 in that account when you got to
maybe it would maybe have more maybe
would have less but they've just simply
stolen the credentials from this
individual and more than likely this
would be done to harness evil deeds
let's see what kind of other things that
I can do let's just go ahead and see if
I can I'll pull up one live if I
possibly can in here I'm going to show
you one of the most powerful hacking
tools on the internet right now I'm not
sure why this square is here uh I'm
gonna type in site colon peace bin calm
and what that means is in Google I'm
going to allocate everything I search
for has to be as part of pastebin.com
and I'm going to type in maybe
MasterCard okay it has to have the word
MasterCard in there and you can see that
we've got a number of places and I'm
going to look at goo
cashed account where I can find stolen
credit card numbers exactly what I've
seen before now am I really concerned
about showing you this not really
because more than likely these credit
cards have already been turned off I
wanted to show you how easy it was for
the individual to be able to get access
to this information
so we're send them a code from pastebin
but they don't necessarily erase that
from paceman and Google indexes it so
this is part of our issue part of our
problem I could find a number of
different things on here let's just if
you try and find something else okay
let's just look for someone social
security number and unfortunately you
can see very easily that this person I
won't put his name up here well actually
there is his name his date of birth
social security number these things are
readily and easily available on the
internet that person that you just saw
one here is unfortunately and had his
credit stolen okay because it's very
easy for somebody to do something like
that
now the black market on the dark web
they change these various addresses okay
often and you really have to be invited
by someone to get into this and most
people think of the dark web well it's
just about buying drugs well that is
part of it all right but there's a lot
more to it than that
there's different types of con artists
that can be purchased crime guns even
people as you're going to see here in
just a couple of moments here some
various goods whether these were stolen
from Louis Vuitton or when they were
legitimately purchased more than likely
this is something stolen off of one of
their stores or truck something like
that they're buying it
for one point whatever Bitcoin and you'd
have to figure out exactly you know what
that's worth it's definitely gonna be
worth a lot more excuse me a lot less
than you would pay for it at no effect
on some social engineering skills that
are often fine you can hire somebody to
do virtually anything all right so this
person says that they have very good
written and spoken English and and
German if I can't hack something
technically I'll make phone calls or
write emails to the target to get the
information needed I've had people make
things you wouldn't really often believe
a lot of experience with security
practices big inside corporations a a
friend of mine had done this one 60
minutes where he changed his phone
number which is easily done to reflect
that they were calling from inside the
corporation called the corporation's
helpdesk and said I'm trying to get to
this website and I'm for some reason
there's it's not working correctly and
I've got this project that I better do
could you help me get there and he named
the website the person that's helpdesk
who generally has a lot of information
or a lot of escalated security can go in
and get access to this they were then
able to just click on something and they
gave them access to the inside of that
corporate network very easily done this
person right here says I'll do anything
for money I'm not and the word I'm sure
that was put out there he's not some
kind of a escort service or whatever if
you want me to destroy someone's
business or person's life I'll do it
some examples might be simply hacking
something technically causing a lot of
technical trouble on websites Network
disrupt their services with DDoS getting
private information from someone
actually ruining your opponent's
business or private persons you don't
even like I can ruin them financially
get them arrested have them change their
information where they're on the child
porn list no problem at all here's a
for doing it it's it's really quite
amazing let's talk about stealing your
credit card just as an example okay a
victim would be easily not safe from
chip-and-pin
if you were able to grab that chip and
pin from some kind of a skimmer device
financial experts actually are able to
actually see the starter package of 50
credits they cost about $59 sending a
message cost like five credits and
replies are free if a message is marked
priority the site deduct an additional
five credits basically what they're
doing right here is is they are giving
you the information from a skimmer that
they have attached to an ATM machine you
see these in bars you seen these in
hotel rooms hotel lobbies things that
look like they're part of the part of
the machine but they're really not you
can buy from this place called skimmer
manufacturer and here's the software and
the various bezels and that type of
stuff to make the Machine look like it's
legitimate show you how to be careful
when you're using these types of
machines Street ATMs gas station arc
anytime pills I'm going to say probably
the safest ATMs are going to be at a
bank if you try and use the ATM at some
of these other places are named right
here it's possible that you could have
your card skin meaning that they grabbed
your card details and a grab your PIN
number where all of your information
could be actually taken and all of your
money out of your account and if they
know your PIN details there's a lot of
countries that are not going to put that
money back in so here is kind of the
fight against cybercrime you have your
bank account credentials and data
digital real-estate all these are
victims okay and we have criminal
organizations and their affiliates a lot
of partnerships okay
crime where producers being able to
create this type of crime kind of tell
you a real quick story my wife is a
professional photographer and she uses a
Mac because according to her the Mac's
are vulnerable to hackers which I've
tried to tell her it's it's not in use
okay she got a pop-up on her screen that
said you have a virus would you like us
to clean it well she cleaned it and
locked up all of the photos since she'd
been working well over 200 hours alone
on on Photoshop of a wedding that she
had just taken the pictures for now if
you think about it she had a lot of
money invested but if they didn't we
didn't pay the ransomware
for this which at that time was about
two hundred and something dollars I
looked at the encryption it was
encrypted with 256 bit AES now my wife
not knowing too much about how the
encryption works basically went back to
the brian groups don't worry don't worry
I have a professional computer hacker he
can get it back I talked to her I pulled
her aside no I can't you can't get from
so what did I do
I had to pay the ransomware is either
that or not give this couple their
photos which really was an option and
that it was my wife said well they said
they were good they were going to clean
my computer as I didn't you believe them
these are the types of things that were
up against things that we have to raise
our awareness of and to do that is to be
able to be aware of these things so you
can but or at least be aware of them
moving in
to some of the players on the dark web
we have of course organized crime it can
be established like smash-and-grab where
we where we have things like TJ Maxx and
Target really they grab mug many many
credit cards but now keep in mind the
credit cards aren't going to be a big
problem because I can turn those off in
two seconds it's a really that's not
worth a tremendous amount of money if
you see on the black market a credit
card a stolen credit card is worth
approximately maybe I think a dollar
okay although if it may be less than
that now maybe 20 cents a person's
personal identity that means our full
legal name their social security number
their date of birth
full legal address those kinds of
information that's worth about $10 on
the black market
now if you do just a little bit of math
if I go into and let's just pick on some
us corporation and I'm just randomly
mention it's that's a 3m corporation or
or let's say IBM whoever would might
happen to be it has a large amount of
employees and you're able to get into
their HR department in their HR
department they're gonna have to pay
payment details for all of those pieces
of information and I just mentioned so
if that company has a hundred thousand
employees I guarantee you you just made
yourself a millionaire that's what
they're typically after they're
typically after these large
organizations stealing the information
about the individuals the most
information that is the most prevalent
are the information for the agent and
you might think well what day you should
don't have that much money yes that's
true but the way that Medicare works
it's very easy to scam Medicare and get
information and get the money from
Medicare and the individuals from
anywhere from 21 to about 40 years old
maybe up to fifty years old those are
prime targets for identity theft because
they generally have not generally most
of they'll have good credit and we can
steal that credit all right there are
ways of locking down that credit in the
US and I'll talk about that that's kind
of as an interesting questions but so
the smash-and-grab techniques of just
grabbing the credit cards it's really
not that impressive although if they
were to grab that HR information then
that's gonna be quite a little bit more
all right uh the average exploit when
someone gets into a company before
they're noticed is approximately if I
remember correctly it's one hundred and
thirty five days so most of these time
most of the time it could be you know
close for half a year some some some
people say it's all the way up to more
even more than a year there was somebody
that got into JPMorgan Chase and and
they actually were there for several
years and then naturally ransom okay and
some of the popular ones I've given you
one of them which ransomware
Sony Pictures was kind of held for
ransom by the North Korean they decided
not to release that picture because it
embarrassed them Ashley Madison another
one I gave you an example of so who are
the players in this generally a lot of
them are former Soviet military the
Russian mafia professional hackers
possibly spammers trying to get you to
click on something traditional mafia
basic cybercrime organizations there's a
lot of really bad people in the world
that we're trying to protect yourself
against let's take the first one the
former Soviet Union military there's a
lot of military industrial complex in
Soviet Russian was much more corrupt
than their USA counterparts with the
collapse of communism
many upper military personnel inside of
Russia themselves they had few skills
that paid so they were good you know
good at money laundry
we're good at moving goods across
borders and we have a lot of connection
with international crime though there's
going to buy that skill set well I think
you've already figured out who's going
to buy that skill set so we have a lot
of individuals that maybe want to feed
their family and I'm not trying to
victimize these people because they are
doing evil deeds but they want to get
paid the most and money isn't as a great
enticement then we have places like the
Russian mafia
one of the head of the Russian mafia I'm
not going to try and pronounce his name
Serge a head of the Moscow based Russian
mafia organization has over 5,000
members worldwide
he started with extortion counterfeiting
drug drug trafficking blackmail arms
eeling you know anything you could think
of he owns his own organizations of
banks casinos car dealerships anybody
therefore it very difficult to stop
something like this and you've heard a
lot about the Russian mafia a second
largest gang operating out of Russia is
this one I'm not going to try and
pronounce that name either cyber crimes
and activities a lot of the standard
criminal ventures they believed behind a
rash of bank robberies conducted over
the Internet in 2001 especially against
banks using vulnerable Windows NT web
servers often times its people are slow
to move off their technology because
it's working let's take a look at some
of the things that we could purchase all
right here's some of the a form that is
on this particular web form okay or
they're asking various questions in a
chat group this one is called dark
profits okay and they're asking various
discussions where you could ask these
types of information that kind of stuff
and this right here represents the
amount of tor traffic now let's take for
example tor and what it does is it
basically starts by hopping through many
different nodes on the internet after
you were to take a look at your home
router i'm just going to use an
illustration of little bloom Linksys
router we may have something called nack
or network address translation what it
does is it translates a private address
the ten dot X addresses the one ninety
two dot sixty-eight address is the one
seventy dot 16 addresses into a public
IP address on the Internet
but what if we took that NAT router and
put it into another NAT router and took
that other NAT router and plugged it
into another NAT router and went on for
maybe twenty or thirty NAT wrappers all
right finding how to get back to the
original one where the tables are erased
for example of the log drawer raised
perhaps Devi that gives you a little bit
of an idea of tour but tour also
encrypts the message as it hops from one
person to the other so the entrance node
in tor sees the full text data as clear
text and the exit node before it goes to
the ultimate recipient season but all of
the tour routers in between it see only
the encrypted data and so the the US
government and several governments are
all looking for exit nodes and they're
looking to see what kind of information
is coming out of these exit nodes
because if you're going to go through
the trouble of having your traffic
encrypted with tor that's a good
possibility you're not doing something
that's necessarily up-and-up and I would
say that's probably true I have a friend
of mine that works for the NSA they see
they tells me that that's primarily what
they look for is tor traffic all right
so if you're wanting to fly under the
radar or may not be the best way of
of determining that okay so moving on
let's start with the why people would
even do this well first off in let's say
back in the Bonnie and Clyde days where
we want to go rob a bank there's a high
chance of us getting caught there's
people with guns at the bank there are
individuals at the bank that possibly
could cause us some problems so I'm
gonna go back to this one slide real
quick there we go that's what I want to
say it so what we need to look at what
the motive is of hackers if you start
with why risk going to jail we actually
have maybe one in 99% chance of getting
caught and then of that one in 99%
chance of getting caught we actually
have maybe a one in a hundred chance of
actually getting prosecuted for it do
the individuals that are going to rob
the bank the Bonnie and Clyde that I had
talked about earlier do they have that
same level of risk the fair risk is much
greater all right this is why it's very
motive it's it's the big motive of
attackers you could easily damage
somebody's reputation getting paid with
money humiliation they have a lot of
cause and they can profit off somebody's
pain for example they profited off the
pain that my wife had you know when when
they had stole or they had locked up
they had actually didn't steal it the
pictures alright they used something
called ransomware
and ransomware now comes in what's
referred to as a what's referred to as
like for example dotnet is a library of
sorts or is a framework of sorts they
have a framework of sorts that they can
use for ransomware
making it very easy very trivial for
someone to get into the ransomware
business and steal your information as a
matter of fact I've read articles where
individuals are being asked to work for
these companies and they'll pay your
childcare they'll pay for a benefits
that pay medical they paid retirement I
mean this is big business because if you
are sitting in a company that actually
tries to do this and in a country I
should say it's actually trying to do
this the chances of you getting caught
or even getting prosecuted or slim to
none and the way they individual is
justified why can't we take some of the
West's money when my gosh they have so
much we're just simply trying to feed
our family I'm not saying it's right and
I'm not saying it's wrong I'm just
saying that's the kind of thing we have
to deal with the Internet is can be a
very bad place and we have a lot of
issues with that okay so how the how is
called the journey that is the kill
chain okay so we're gonna start out with
the impact in severity and the phases of
that kill chain first off we're gonna
start out with reconnaissance all right
sir our simple lowest impact of security
when I do a a pin test on your
organization I'm going to see all of the
different ways that I could attack you
without ever touching your organization
I'm going to look at Google I'm going to
look at the various places that have the
metadata and I'll never go to your
organization but I will looked up a
LinkedIn who the people that I could
target who are the individuals in your
organization that I could surveil that I
could possibly extort you know I'm going
to look where the low-hanging fruit
might be okay they will move into
weaponization all right so I'm going to
actually
try and weaponize some of those targets
that might may have identified in this
reconveyance
ideal weapon crafted to build by a ramp
a bot for example how many people have
heard the story especially like from
their parents or somebody because
everyone in this particular session
right here I can guarantee you you are
the IT department for your family and if
you know much about computers you are
that IT department and you've heard your
family basic but why in the world would
they want anything I have I don't keep
anything on my computer they don't
necessarily want what you have on your
computer they want your computer they
want to make it into a weapon that they
can use to take down a lot of opponents
and maybe perhaps point the crime back
to you uh they can also crip defy their
service script if I said a word I think
it is
I could encrypt their service and remain
very very stealthy and doing that the
delivery might be the delivery of this
weapon against a target maybe it's email
phishing social media a USB websites
there's a lot of those things that we
cover in some of these classes that most
of the people that that go through a
class that I teach I've heard they
they're not going to touch the computer
for four years after that a little
impractical but the class does really
scare you
exploitation is the portion where we
actually break in to your computer the
code triggers an installation and then
we have some kind of persistence
mechanism persistence mechanism is is
how even if you reboot the machine it
still reinstalls the bot it still redoes
what we're trying to do and then the
highest action where we compose data and
commands exchanged over a second
communication channel the objective is
achieved data excel exfiltrated
intrusion of the second stage target all
those kind
things are not so why are you thinking
of what - what why you're thinking of
what you were gonna watch on TV tonight
24 years organized-crime was a different
point a different journey with your data
maybe you were looking up things when
your cable box maybe you were surfing
the web looking for this a lot of that
information can easily be tracked on
financial impacts we have three trillion
US dollars that have been stolen from
the the information that can be gathered
from class law class action lawsuits IPO
impact ok initial public offering bad
press or losses all these things can be
can have occurred because of someone
stealing that information and and making
you look bad embarrassing your
corporation alright most people after
the the big target heist of all the
credit cards I was not I had no problem
shopping at Target after that because I
know that I'm protected of my credit
card I mean for example if my credit
card was stolen at Target I called my
credit card company never get my money
back most people still didn't want to
shop at Target because of this huge loss
of credit card data now I would be very
concerned if someone hacked into an
organization that had my social security
number that had my a lot of very
pertinent information okay
the bigger you are actually the more I
want to use word easy it's not necessary
easy the more a subjective you subjected
you are to getting this information
let's just take a couple of information
here
101 ESPN employees there's a Deadspin
report that they were actually
they were actually forced into divorce
wedding cancellation a lot of things
because information that they had might
come out loss of researcher intellectual
data identity theft scammers those kinds
of things basic economic disaster
okay loss of business or even
non-recoverable consequences that you
can't even recover from this one I think
will really kind of be interesting for
you this is a credit report now let me
tell you how dangerous this is and I'm
gonna tell you right now you never ever
never ever ever never did I say never I
hope I said never ever put your credit
report and save it to a PDF or anything
else and keep it on your computer
because if the bad guys happen to get
your credit report there is not a
question that they cannot answer if
somebody asks them questions pertaining
to your information haven't you ever
been asked by a bank did you ever live
at this particular address did you ever
get a loan from this particular company
did you ever do business with this
company do you have our credit card from
this company where do you think they're
getting the information to ask you those
questions
if you guessed your credit report then
you're exactly correct if that credit
report would fall into someone else's
hands I'm sorry but it's game over
so don't ever store your credit report
on your computer
sure download your credit report print
your credit report off put it into a
folder and put it in your drawer in your
desk that's fine make sure that you
delete the credit report from the
computer so we're gonna want to look for
actionable threat intelligence all right
try to mitigate that threat before they
enter your network this is the proactive
phase all right and possibly if we do
discover it discover the threats that
entered or tried to
the network and then three you know
basically respond to it okay as if it
has been breached all right on an
incident response so let me go ahead and
move right on to some questions that I
might have so if I could get the
announcer to come back online and and
ask me some of the questions that would
be great
absolutely Tim thank you so much for
that it's I really personally had no
insight into what the dark web was all
about I've heard it mentioned but I
didn't realize how how pervasive and how
dark it can truly be fascinating stuff
there are some questions queued up
before we do that really quickly I'm
going to ask everybody to bear with me
for a second while I take care of some
simply learned business which means I'm
going to take over the screen here real
quick and launch this very simple little
poll here what's what that's about is
obviously this webinar is the public
facing webinar that means that there's
some folks on here with us today who
maybe have never learned of her to
simply learn outside of these webinars
you're not familiar with us and what we
do and you found out about this webinar
through a link on social or maybe a
friend sent you here and that's fine
we're happy to have you here and thanks
for joining us we run a lot of these
webinars every month and we talk about a
lot of different kinds of topics so
clearly ethical hacking and security
issues we talk about project management
and so forth and beyond that though what
we do is our core service is that we're
a business and technology training
provider we offer 400 web-based training
courses and if you're interested in
taking courses and learning more about
ethical hacking and how to turn that
into a career for yourself by keeping
companies and individuals safe tick the
appropriate box we'll have someone get
in touch with you and they can help you
choose the right course of training to
make the most out of your career in
ethical hacking I am being told by my
a lock is having to leave us thanks
again for being here lock and sorry you
can't stay a little longer sorry we got
a bit of a late start but we aren't
going to go ahead and get to the
questions here in just a moment for the
rest of you who are able to stick with
us so go ahead and take the appropriate
box we'll have somebody get in touch
with you no obligation but happy to tell
you a little more about that I'll also
be sharing a link over to the simply
learned site guiding you to some of
information on our ethical hacking
courses so I'm gonna close this now and
we should be going back to Tim's screen
there we go so Tim just so you know
we're seeing your screen again if you
decide you need to surf around or
anything to answer any of these
questions so we have a few questions
queued up I'm going to take care of the
very first one myself because it's a
very common question and the question is
is this being recorded and/or can I get
access to the slide deck and the answer
is yes all of our webinars are recorded
but they are gone through they go
through a little production process we
clean them up a little bit and then they
get posted to the simply learned site
and they also very often end up on our
YouTube channel so if you're not
subscribed over there yet please do so
and then you'll get a notification when
new videos go up let's see here in terms
of questions
Tim this one came up for a few folks
what is the best third-party kind of
anti-virus or anti hacking kind of
software that we can get access to on
the open market install on the laptops
for our company or for ourselves
personally that will give us some
reasonable amount of security against
this sort of thing is the things we
wrote about things like malwarebytes's
or Microsoft Security Essentials where
should we go
great question let me answer the
question by telling you just a real
quick little story as of uber from 2001
to about 2014 antivirus manufacturers
had
found in the order of about three
hundred and three hundred thousand two
hundred fifty thousand three hundred
thousand virus signatures a year as 2015
and 2016 rolled around the antivirus
manufacturers started seeing a
tremendous uptick but we're seeing three
hundred thousand to three hundred and
fifty thousand signatures a day a me
repeat that a day there is no way that
an anti-virus organization could
possibly give you all the signatures to
flag the virus so am I talking to you
women do not really I'm hoping that your
you're not proceeding this as gloom and
doom but I do want you to understand
that the answer that I give you is by
personal preference I would go with the
Microsoft answer because one one reason
it's free another reason is you're not
going to be able to find everything
there's there's no way am i outing that
you shouldn't use out of our stuff I'm
not saying that especially if you're a
person that isn't it is easily fool
myself do I use antivirus no I don't it
slows my computer now and I feel like if
if I was able to get a virus I I would
notice it but pretty readily I have
various mechanisms where my computer is
rebuilt every single day I do all my
surfing from a virtual machine that's
rebuilt every day so if somebody did get
hold of my machine it would last for a
day that does take quite a bit of doing
and you might say that I'm very paranoid
person well okay I I agree with that
but short answer is if I had to go with
one I think I would go with Microsoft
Security Essentials but I didn't feel
obliged to tell you that
you know there's not a tremendous amount
of protection there if somebody really
wants to get in they're gonna get in
that's really all there is to it you
need to be thinking about what you're
going to do once they do get in
interesting so having that particularly
for a corporation having having that
response plan in place to just to shut
things down quickly and to rebuild and
and secure your and your customers
materials as quickly as possible that
makes a good sense I should also mention
that another thing people should be
doing is encrypting their computers
encrypting them with the Microsoft
encryption that comes with Microsoft a
BitLocker for example if you and your
corporation are attached to a Active
Directory and you have administrative
privileges on your own machine I can be
in your corporate I can have total
control over your entire Active
Directory in less than five minutes if
your machine is encrypted I can't do
that and I'm talking I'm not talking
about laptops did you take out of the
office I'm talking about the machines
themselves that are part of your
corporate network they should all be
encrypted hmm good to know good to know
and that's and that's if you're using
Microsoft that's baked in there is an
option that's correct that's correct and
I'll go over this in my class I'll go
you know great about a detail and I'll
show you exactly how they would get in
and in less than five minutes I'll be in
just fantastic good to know
Samir has a comment is it true that some
of these antivirus companies that offer
you know downloadable free or paid
antivirus software is that they actually
support the creation and release of new
viruses to help their business is that
really part of the business model in
that industry what are you talking about
here let me
back up and I'm up a site that that I
can go to virustotal calm is one of the
sites that he's talking about this is a
free service where you could upload a
I'm not sure if my screen is being shown
or not but you could help yes we're
seeing as me okay you can upload a an
exe an executable and it will be scanned
by a number of antivirus manufacturers
virustotal is actually the best one but
there's another one that i you typically
use in class because it kind of lists
the antivirus manufacturers on it these
are the would it be nice if there was
somebody that would scan it by every
single one of these that what every nice
wouldn't it alright well by uploading
your file to jadi
or virus totally does just that but what
he's talking about is it is a
double-edged sword
because the the the bad guys will prove
that none of these antivirus
manufacturers can catch what they have
done to to conceal their virus but by
doing that you are actually giving the
antivirus manufacturers a reason to look
more closely at that and fight and
possibly find it so that is absolutely
true okay it's kind of a double-edged
sword there isn't it
yeah that's like a losing battle you
know that's just it's never gonna end
it's a it's a tide that I've had people
that have taken my class and at the end
of the class I had this one guy not too
long ago check out it shook my fantastic
stuff I mean wouldn't you rather know
than not know I guess ignorance is bliss
oh my goodness my my
laws in her 70s and she recently fell
for one of these you've got a virus let
me clean it scan she has a very hard
time as an elderly user telling the
difference between what's an ad on a
site and what's part of the actual
navigation and she was in Yahoo and she
saw something that clearly represented
itself as Yahoo IT support clicked on it
ended up on a phone call guy says hey I
can see you've got a some kind of virus
on your machine why don't you let me in
real quick and I'll scan your machine
which gave him access to her laptop he
says oh yeah well you've got all kinds
of stuff in here it's so easy for them
to do I want to jump through a few more
of these questions really quick here
Adam says he runs a couple of commercial
sorry ecommerce sites where do I start
learning to make the most benefit for my
sites what particular area of IT
security should I first start with to
start educating myself about how to
protect protect homicides come to my
class I'm not advertising I'm saying
that as the ultimate truth because we
will talk about all of the different
ways you could be attacked and they're
going to be greater for some
organizations than they are for others
and so I can't really give him a
cut-and-dried answer because after
coming to the class then I can address
any question that you have
that's absolutely reasonable actually
folks for those of you that are still on
with us I just put some links into the
chat module for everybody to see so one
of them is a link to the simply learn
site guiding you to where the ethical
hacking courses are and from there of
course you can surf around and see a lot
of other courses available to you too
but that'll shortcut you in the right
direction to get rolling the I also gave
you a link to some other resources
articles and ebooks and things that we
have up on the site regarding this issue
and then of course a link to be able to
surf around see any other upcoming
webinars in a number of other
specialties including an outside of
these security challenges so I hope that
at least starts to answer your question
Adam
and by the way Adam says Tim you are the
man he appreciates you hosting this real
quickly here let's see does the in-house
ethical hacking training prepare you
sufficiently to appear for the ceh exam
and I think I can answer that question
which is yes and take a look at those
links that I've sent you to and you will
see that they are courses are based to
address the latest balk for book of
knowledge for seh and should prepare you
sufficiently for the exam absolutely
we've let's see we've already answered
Samir's question that i want to get
through one or two more before we have
to take off what are the prerequisites
for attending the ethical hacking course
what should somebody's technical
expertise and experience be to get the
most that's a great question that's a
great question
you're going to need to be proficient in
general computer skills if you've had
like the security plus or you've had or
you been using a computer in a technical
sense like as a helpdesk or as a systems
administrator for a number of years
those are going to be the people that
get the most good out of the class
somebody who like you mentioned your
mother she would not be a good person
this you would not understand all this
stuff we're talking about you know yeah
a lot of prerequisites that would need
to be done first before they actually
understand ok and then I can even offer
a test there's like 50 questions to give
you a little bit of feedback if you'd
like to take it to see if you're
interested if this has to be good for
you perfect I appreciate that
let's see we've got time maybe for one
more Tanisha has a question he's working
on an application for a banking
application how can I make sure that my
application is safe that I'm building I
think maybe we can expand that question
and wrap somebody else's inquiry into it
too which is if I'm working as an
ethical hacker what are our personal
security response
when we're accessing client data not
only with respect to things like
people's personal info but things like
HIPAA and other federal regulations are
we gonna learn about how to be
conscientious of those sorts of things
and the answer is yes you will
now the the your first class is I like
for example the ethical hacking class is
kind of more about these are the tools
that are in your toolbox all right just
like a plumber has a set of tools a
carpenter has his set of tools a hacker
whether he be ethical or unethical has
his set of tools it's more about the
tools that are in your toolbox now there
will be a follow on course which is
actually penetration testing where you
go in hack the person site with their
permission for the good of that person
and that would be the answer to the
person who is asking I'm developing a
banking application how do I know that
I'm Dell walking down the right track
the best way to know is to have someone
other than yourself try and break into
it all right and hire individual
corporations should not be accepting
applications written from an outside
source without them being pin tested
first because there are a lot of
developers and I teach a development
course that basically it's it's very
similar to hacking your own developer
website before somebody else does some
teach the developers how to hack alright
and and what they would be subjected to
all right and there's a lot of learning
that goes on in that and they end up
coding in a completely different fashion
that's perfect thank you for that lots
lots of things for folks to think about
with regard to keeping themselves safe
we're gonna get one more question in and
then we are going to have to scoop and
this is kind of a this this fellow says
I know this isn't exactly
business-related per se but with regard
to the passwords that we use either
personally or at work to access
particular applications or services I
hear that it's best obviously to use a
different password for every account
change them often but
so hear from some people that it's more
secure and harder to hack passwords that
are random word combinations like
unicorn bobsled than it is to hack a
letter numbers string like 1 2 3 ABC can
you eliminate on the best way to go for
choosing passwords and I can tell you of
a free utility called LastPass
that will generate a random string of
characters and it will be different for
every site that you go to mine or
generally 40 characters long and they're
different for every site most people
will tell me how do you possibly
remember it I don't remember it the
application remembers it but I use one
passphrase to get into that digest if
you will or encrypted storage then it
puts it in for me automatically and that
blob of data is replicated around the
internet to all of my devices like my
iphone my iPad the browser on my Mac the
browser on my Windows machine but the
blob of data is never given the password
so no one could actually decrypt it so
even if the NSA held a gun to the guy at
LastPass his head and said to give me
the password he couldn't do it all right
if you give you the blob of encrypted
data that is aes 256-bit encrypted which
to give you an idea how strong that is
if we had a computer that could decrypt
our second-strongest which is triple des
in one second it would take that same
machine a hundred and forty nine
trillion years to crack AES at only 128
bits so our scientists back in
particular our universe is about our Sun
is I think about five billion years old
and whether our sun's going to burn out
in about five billion years and so as
one pundit put it I guess I'll be
cracking those passwords in the dark so
a very very strong password so to answer
that question you would have something
like he had mentioned my password might
be I am my wife were married in 1990 and
have two kids
first off your wife's not gonna let you
forget that okay second off your kids
aren't either you'll see everyday
something easy for you to remember but
very difficult for them to come up with
something personal to you that isn't a
long string of characters you have to
enter just once and then the rest of the
passwords are put in for you at the
various sites that you go to all right
that's the best scenario all right
absolutely the best
that's great I've heard of LastPass
before I was actually gonna recommend it
to my mother-in-law again as I say she's
an elderly woman she has a million
different banking passwords and things
to remember and she has I'm all written
down somewhere on a sheet of paper that
she'd constantly loses so something like
this might be great but I wasn't sure
how secure is LastPass right I mean what
happens if somebody breaks into LastPass
and gets the database of all those
things I presumed it wouldn't even
matter that's good to know I really
appreciate that all right this has been
fascinating and I could continue talking
about it with you forever but we we are
well past our time now we got a late
start and now we've run late so I think
we've we've fulfilled our our obligation
to everybody really really appreciate
you being here Tim it's pleasure to meet
you and to to spend some time with you
today oh don't worry about it technical
things happen with GoToWebinar it's it's
great once it works but it can be a
little buggy so it's not the first time
it won't be the last time and to all of
our attendees who joined us today we had
a great turnout some terrific questions
Michael is saying thank you Andrew is
saying thank you we we wish we could get
to all the questions we just don't have
time but everybody took time out of
their day to join us here we really
appreciate it
again take a look at the other webinars
that are coming up on simply learn join
as many as you can get as much out of it
as you possibly can thank you everybody
for being here we're gonna go ahead and
shut things down and send you back to
your to your lives have a terrific rest
of your morning afternoon or evening
wherever you are and oh one real quick
thing if you were one of those folks
that was interesting we had a few if you
were one of those folks that was
interested in having someone contact you
and
to give you about 30 seconds if you want
to to speed up the process throw your
phone number into the question module
nobody else will see it but will have it
and that'll make it easier for somebody
to get back to you really quickly and
give you some guidance on helping you
pick out the right course so I'll give
you about 20 or 30 seconds to throw your
phone number and if you want to and then
we'll shut down Tim are you queued up
for another future webinar with us soon
that we should point folks to I'm not
I'm not sure at this point the date of
it is but just be on lookout for it I'm
sure that I'll be doing some more
exactly terrific okay thank you folks I
see a few people have put their phone
numbers in there we appreciate that
we'll have someone get in touch with you
all right
we'll take off now everybody have a
great day Tim you have a great day and
everybody we will talk to you all next
time take care everybody
