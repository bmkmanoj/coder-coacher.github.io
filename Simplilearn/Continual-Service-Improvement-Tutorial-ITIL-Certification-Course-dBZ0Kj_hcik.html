learned about gap analysis this slide
explains benchmarking benchmarking is a
process used in management particularly
strategic management in which
organizations evaluate various aspects
of their processes in relation to best
practice usually within their own sector
this then allows organizations to
develop plans on how to adopt such best
practice usually with the aim of
increasing some aspect of performance
benchmarking may be one-time occurrence
event but is often treated as a
continuous process in which
organizations continually seek to
challenge their practices let us now

process but most organizations find that
it more than pays for itself

our visit costs this includes travel and
accommodation related expenses for team
members who need to travel to the site
time costs members of the benchmarking
team will be investing time in
researching problems finding exceptional
companies to study visits and
implementation this will take them away
from their regular tasks for part of
each day so additional staff might be
required benchmarking database costs
organizations that institutionalize
benchmarking into their daily procedures
find it useful to create and maintain a
database of best practices and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
