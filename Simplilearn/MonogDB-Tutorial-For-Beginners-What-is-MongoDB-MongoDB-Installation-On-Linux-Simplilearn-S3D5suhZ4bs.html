basic idea behind shifting from
relational data model to a new data
model is to replace the concept of a row
with a flexible model the document the
document based approach allows embedded
documents arrays and represents a
complex hierarchical relationship using
a single record this is how developers
using object-oriented languages want to
represent their data MongoDB is schema
free the keys used in documents are not
predefined or fixed without a fixed
schema massive data migrations have
become unnecessary while migrating data
to MongoDB any issues of new or missing
keys can be resolved at the application
level rather than changing the schema in
the database this offers developers the
flexibility of working with evolving
data models the table given on the
screen depicts the various sequel
terminology and concepts and the
corresponding MongoDB terminology and
concepts in MongoDB the table and view
structure is known as collection
typically these collections group
documents that are structurally or
conceptually similar MongoDB allows
embedding a related document to one
another these documents aren't used to
query related data the data for a table
in MongoDB are distributed among
different shards which is similar to the
concept of partition in relational
database management systems or our DBMS
after grouping structurally similar
documents into collection MongoDB groups
different collections into databases for
instance a single instance of
go DB is capable of hosting multiple
independent databases ideally you should
store data related to a single
application at one database you need
separate databases when storing multiple
application or users data on the same
MongoDB server the data model in MongoDB
is document based although documents
provide rich structure they need not
conform to any pre specified schema in a
relational database rows are stored in a
table and each table has a strictly
defined schema that specifies the
permitted types and columns if a row in
a table requires an extra field the
entire table needs to be altered MongoDB
on the other hand groups documents into
collections that do not follow any
schema each individual document in
collection can have a completely
independent structure in practice
documents in a collection are relatively
uniform for example if you are creating
a collection review underscore comments
for storing review comments given by the
customer then every document in this
collection will have fields such as
title tags comments and so on
the lack of schema offers many
advantages first since structure is
defined by the application code not the
database this speeds up initial
application development when the schema
tends to change frequently second a
schema less model lets you represent
data with variable properties compared
to our DBMS such as my sequel which
supports two-phase commit
MongoDB only supports a single phase
commit at each document level a write
operation in a single document is
considered atomic in MongoDB even if the
operation alters multiple embedded
documents however the entire Opera
raishin is not atomic and other
operations may interleave some of the
key features of MongoDB are as follows
ad hoc queries MongoDB allows performing
of search functions by field range
queries and regular expression searches
queries can return specific document
fields and may include user-defined
JavaScript functions querying for
document retrieval MongoDB uses rich
query language it also allows you to
write any complex condition to retrieve
documents fast in place updates MongoDB
allows you to choose right semantics
enable journaling and thus control the
speed and durability all rights are sent
across a transmission control protocol
or TCP socket and do not require a
database response to get a response use
the special safe mode of the drivers and
perform a write this generates a
response acknowledging the receipt of
the write with no errors server-side
JavaScript execution MongoDB uses
JavaScript in queries and aggregation
functions such as MapReduce which are
sent to the database for execution
capped collections capped collections
are fixed size collections supported by
MongoDB these collections maintain
insertion order and once the specified
size has been reached behaves like a
circular queue MongoDB supports other
data types while retaining Jason's
essential key value pair characteristic
how values of each type are represented
depends on the language used following
is a list of the commonly supported data
types
null is used to represent both a null
value and a non-existent field for
example field x has no value undefined
is used in documents
javascript has distinct types for null
and undefined
for example field X is undefined boolean
is used to represent true and false
values for example field X is a boolean
variable whose value is true 32-bit
integer cannot be represented on the
shell javascript supports only 64-bit
floating-point numbers hence 32-bit
integers will be converted to 64-bit
64-bit integer the shell cannot
represent these and will display them
using a special embedded document 64-bit
floating-point number all numbers in the
shell must be of this type here are a
few more data types supported by MongoDB
maximum value Beeson contains a special
data type that represent the largest
possible value the shell does not
support this type minimum value Beeson
contains a special data type that
represent the smallest possible value
the shell does not support this time
object ID object ID data type is unique
fast to generate and ordered these
consists of 12 bytes where the first
four bytes represent the object ID
creation time string Beeson strings are
utf-8 compliant typically when
serializing and deserializing basem
programming languages convert language
strings to utf-8 format this allows easy
storing of international characters in
visa and strings symbol symbols are not
supported by the shell when the shell
gets a symbol from the database it
converts it into a string timestamps
decent offers a special timestamp for
internal MongoDB use that is not
associated with the regular date type
note that within a single
mangodi instance timestamp values are
always unique date date and visa is a
64-bit integer that denotes the number
of milliseconds since the unix epoch it
can represent a date range of about 290
million years into the past and future
regular expression documents contain
Java scripts regular expression syntax
for example X is the field whose value
contain substring simply learn following
are some more data types supported by
MongoDB code documents can contain
JavaScript code for example logic inside
function binary data it is a string of
arbitrary bytes it cannot be manipulated
from the shell array sets or lists of
values can be represented as arrays
courses is the field whose value is an
array this array holds three elements
PMP cloud and MongoDB embedded document
documents can contain entire documents
embedded as values in a parent document
for example course underscored duration
is the embedded document which has field
name MongoDB the value for this field is
24 hours the core database server of
MongoDB can be run as an executable
process called Mongo D or MongoDB Exe on
windows the Mongo deep RAAS
receives a command to run the MongoDB
server over a network socket through a
custom binary protocol the data files
for among go deep Roz
are stored by default in the directory
slash data / DB you can run a Mongo deep
Roz in several modes the most common
mode is the replica set typically
replica set configurations
two replicas and an arbiter process that
resides on a third server the auto
sharding architecture of MongoDB
consists of Mongo deep processes
configured as per shard replica sets it
also consists special metadata servers
called config servers in addition Mongo
s a separate routing server is used to
send requests to the appropriate shard
Mongo s queries from the application
layer and locates the data in the
sharded cluster to complete these
operations among the s instance is
identical to any MongoDB instance
MongoDB tools consists of the following
javascript shell database drivers and
command-line tools the java script shell
the command shell in MongoDB is a
JavaScript based tool it is used to
administer the database and manipulate
data a Mongo executable loads the shell
and connects it to a specified Mongo
deep rasa's in addition to inserting and
querying data the shell allows you to
run administrative commands database
drivers the MongoDB drivers are easy to
use it provides an application program
interface or API that matches the syntax
of the language used while maintaining
uniform interfaces across languages
10gen a company behind MongoDB supports
drivers for C C++ C hash Erlang Haskell
Java Perl PHP Python skaila and Ruby
command-line tools MongoDB contains the
following command line utilities Mongo
dump and Mongo restore our standard
utilities that help backup and restore a
database Mongo dump can save the data
and the Beast and format of MongoDB and
thus is used for backups only
this tool is used for hot backups and
can be restored with mungo restore
easily Mongo export and Mongo import are
used to export and import JSON comma
separated value or CSV and tab separated
value or TSV data these tools help you
get data in widely supported formats you
can use Mongo import for initial imports
of large data sets however you need to
adjust the data models for best results
in such a case you can use a custom
script to easily import the data through
one of the drivers Mongo sniff is a wire
sniffing tool used for viewing
operations sent to the database
this tool translates the Beeson that is
transmitted to human readable shell
statements Mongo stat is similar to IO
stat Mongo stat provides helpful
statistics including the number of
operations per second
for example inserts queries updates
deletes and so on it also provides
information such as the amount of
virtual memory allocated and the number
of connections to the server this demo
will show the steps to install MongoDB
on Linux in this demo you will learn how
to install MongoDB on Linux machine
first download the latest MongoDB binary
for Linux platform to download type the
