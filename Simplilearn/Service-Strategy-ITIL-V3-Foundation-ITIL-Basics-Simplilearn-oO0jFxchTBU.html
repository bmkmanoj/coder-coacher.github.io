defined solution to a business problem
the purpose of the service strategy
phase is to define the perspective
position plans and patterns that a
service provider needs to implement to
meet an organization's business outcomes
the objective of the service strategy
phase is as follows understand the
strategies and identify the services and
the customers who will use them define
how value is created and delivered
identify opportunities to provide
services and how to exploit them design
a clear service provision model that
articulates how services will be
delivered hand funded to whom they will
be delivered and for what purpose
document and coordinate how service
assets are used to deliver services and
how to optimize their performance set up
processes that define the strategy of
the organization the service provider
should answer the following questions to
define the scope of service strategy
what services should be offered and to
whom how to differentiate themselves
from competing alternatives how to
create value for customers how to
capture value for stakeholders the scope
includes defining a strategy to deliver
effective services to meet a customer's
business outcome and to manage the
services provided to the customers the
service strategy phase offers value to
business in the following manner support
the activities performed by the service
provider to enable outcomes for
customers enable the service provider to
understand the types and levels of
service that a customer requires enable
the service provider to respond quickly
and effectively to the changes in
business environment support the
creation and maintenance of a portfolio
of quantified services facilitate
functional and transparent communication
between the customer and the service
provider in the next screen we will look
different types of services services are
classified on the basis of the customers
requirement and the service providers
capabilities broadly services are
classified into core services enabling
services and enhancing services core
services provide the basic results that
a customer requires they signify the
value that a customer wants and for
which they are keen to invest core
services anchor the value proposition
for the customer and provide the basis
for their continued utilization and
satisfaction enabling services are
required to deliver a core service they
serve as basic factors enabling the
customer to receive the core service
customers do not perceive an enabling
service as a service in its own right
also the service may not be seen by the
customers enhancing services are the
services added to a core service to make
it more appealing to the customers they
are not vital to the core service
delivery and are added as excitement
factors which will encourage customers
to use the core service often let us
look at an example in the next screen
let us consider an example to understand
the types of services suppose the
employees of a company can monitor the
status of their benefits such as a
health insurance plan the company can
come up with a portal that provides
front-end access to the benefits
tracking service this is an enabling
service if the company can also help
employees create and manage a fitness or
weight loss program then such a facility
is considered as an enhancing service in
the next screen we will define customers
and users customers are the people who
pay for services they negotiate and
agree to service level targets with
service providers sometimes customers
can also be users users are the people
who use the services on a regular basis
