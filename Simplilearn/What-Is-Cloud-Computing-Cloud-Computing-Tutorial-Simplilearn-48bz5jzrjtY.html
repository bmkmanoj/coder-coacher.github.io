provisioning of IT resources and
applications through the internet you
pay for what you use and how much you
use this is termed as the pay-as-you-go
pricing scheme whether you run
applications to share information or
support critical business operations
cloud computing facilitates quick access
to cost efficient and flexible IT
resources accessing servers databases
storage media and a variety of
application services on the World Wide
Web the providers of cloud computing
such as Amazon Web Services or AWS
possess and maintain the hardware for
different services in their own premises
and enable you to manage a required
Hardware through a web interface this
saves you from making hardware
investments or spending several months
managing the hardware with cloud
computing you only need to determine the
type and size of the required resources
to empower your latest business project
or idea for example you need to
determine the number of files to be
stored as a backup on the internet so
that you can access or retrieve them at
any time and from any web-enabled
interface the idea here is to restore
these files if they get corrupted cloud
computing provides the following six key
benefits to a user first you do not
incur capital expenses you go for
variable expense that cuts down the high
hardware cost you only pay when you use
the resource instead of investing in
servers and data centers even before
using them second you can take the
advantage of economics of scale
investing in cloud resources is like
buying electricity from a company this
provides benefits such as pay as per use
and reduced costs due to economies of
scale as an increased number of
customers use the service of cloud
computing
writers hire economies of scale become
inevitable this becomes evident in the
form of lower variable or pay-as-you-go
expenses that you incur by subscribing
to these cloud services plus several
data centers lack space this forces
their owners to expand the existing
centers or build new ones by moving the
applications to a providers
infrastructure there is no need for an
expansion third you can optimize the use
of resources easily when you guess your
capacity needs for deploying an
application chances are high for you to
come up with Eyal or overloaded
resources these issues go away with
cloud computing now you access according
to your needs and scale in minutes
fourth you can effortlessly boost speed
and agility making new resources
available in a cloud computing
environment is too click away this means
that it takes less time for other users
to access and use resources this leads
to a dramatic rise in agility as the
costs and time for testing and
development are now lower fifth
it becomes simpler to streamline
processes you can get more work done
with a hand of people and in less time
this leads to giving greater attention
to customers and other important
projects six you'll enjoy the freedom of
going global in a few minutes in a cloud
computing environment it takes only a
few clicks to deploy your application
across several regions across the globe
this ensures lower latency and better
customer experience at minimal cost
there are three distinct forms of cloud
computing namely public cloud private
cloud and hybrid cloud depending on the
type of data you need it is essential to
comprehend the three cloud types in
terms of levels of management and
required security a public cloud is
essentially the world wide web a public
cloud service provider uses the Internet
to create resources such as storage and
applications available to the public
while a third party may own or manage
the cloud it exists on the premises of
the service provider this form may not
be ideal for all organizations due to
security limitations a public cloud is
ideal for sharing non-secured
applications and testing application
code examples of public clouds include
the Windows Azure services platform
Amazon Elastic Compute cloud or ec2 Sun
cloud and IBM's blue cloud
a private cloud has an architecture
similar to a data center the
infrastructure and services of the data
center exist on a private network the
owner of a private cloud is required to
buy and maintain all infrastructure
assets these clouds are only for large
enterprises or projects that demand
better control and security the company
owns it to ensure provisioning
monitoring automation and scalability
while public clouds offer economies of
scale private clouds bring in modest
economies of scale and are expensive a
hybrid cloud is a mix of public and
private cloud services offered by
multiple providers through such a cloud
a company is able to retain control over
an internally managed private cloud
while depending on the public cloud when
required for example during peak time
you can migrate a few applications to
the public cloud such management is also
beneficial during forecasted unfavorable
events such as a scheduled Windows
maintenance and hurricane warnings the
only con here is the need to track the
different applications in each cloud to
ensure proper communication another use
of a hybrid cloud is to cater to
different market verticals
with the increasing popularity of cloud
computing different models are
introduced to fulfill distinct needs of
different users the three models of
cloud computing are infrastructure as a
service or IaaS platform as a service or
paas and software as a service or SaaS
each of these models possesses different
levels of management control and
flexibility it is essential to
understand the differences between these
models to identify the right set of
services and according to your needs
infrastructure as a service offers
access to networking features data
storage space and different computers
also known as hardware as a service it
ensures the highest level of control and
flexibility for your IT resources this
model is similar to the prevailing IT
resources known to several IT developers
platforms as a service is responsible
for allowing organizations to focus on
managing and deploying applications
instead of concentrating on managing the
core infrastructure composed of
operating systems and hardware this
increases the overall efficiency by
eliminating the need to bother about
software maintenance capacity planning
resource procurement and tasks of
running an application software as a
service refers to end-user applications
that are run and managed by service
providers it eliminates the need to
think how to maintain a specific
application or service or how to manage
the underlying infrastructure
you only need to focus on how to use the
application or software an example of a
software as a service application is an
online service to send and receive
messages without managing feature
additions to the application or
maintaining the servers on which it is
running
Jacque Farzin an American historian once
said we gather historical knowledge not
to make us cleverer next time but wiser
for all times so if we take the
historians quote seriously it becomes
all the more important for us to learn
and understand the historical background
of Amazon Web Services in other words
that would have led to creating
something which is a revolution in the
IT industry and how a budding thought is
evolving into a giant tree with roots
and branches spreading and reaching
every household on this planet
Amazon Web Services or AWS was
officially launched in the year 2006
however the process to create AWS was
initiated in 2003 by Chris Pinkham and
Benjamin Black during their presentation
on Amazon's retail computing
infrastructure they proposed that the
infrastructure should be uniform and
completely automated also it was
envisioned that Amazon would exclusively
be dependent on web services for its
internal storage requirements and would
offer the services related to virtual
servers to other organizations now let's
see the chronological milestone events
in the history of AWS in November 2004
AWS released their first service for
public use it was termed as simple queue
their team in Capetown built
Amazon ec2 in 2006 AWS was launched in
June 2007 over 180,000 customers signed
up with AWS in November 2010 amazon.com
retail web services were moved to AWS in
April 2013
AWS started providing certification
courses for computer engineers
interested in cloud computing in May
2013
AWS was awarded as an agency authority
to function from the US Department of
Health and Human Services under the
federal risk and authorization
management program in the first quarter
of 2015 there reported sales figure was
one point five seven billion and 265
million dollars as the operating income
founder Jeff Bezos described AWS as one
of the fastest growing businesses that
might reach 5 billion u.s. dollars
whereas the analysts described the
growth of AWS as surprisingly more
profitable than the forecast in April
2015 BBC reported AWS as a profitable
organization
