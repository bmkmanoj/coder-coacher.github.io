probability concepts Volume one study
session to reading eight quantitative
methods
hallo candidate welcome to the ninth
lesson of the simply learn cfa level 1
tutorial in the previous lesson we
learned the concept of Statistics and
the application of statistical methods
to summarize return distributions by the
use of measures of central tendency
measures of central tendency are mean
median and mode we also discussed the
measures of dispersion or risk such as
variance and standard deviation and also
learnt about some advanced concepts like
kurtosis and skewness of distributions
some of these concepts will be required
to go through these readings though we
will try to explain the concepts again
if required it is expected that you have
gone through the complete cfa level one
reading 7 provided by cfa institute this
session is on reading AIDS as prescribed
by CFA Institute learning outcomes
statements or L OS we learned about L OS
in the first session please go through
the learning outcome statement the
detailed list of learning outcomes after
this lesson the candidate should be able
to understand the basic probability
concepts related to the calculation of
the expected return and risk of the
portfolio agenda let us now look at the
agenda of this lesson the agenda of this
session is the cover reading 8 as
prescribed by the cfa level 1 curriculum
you can go through this reading from
volume 1 of the cfa level 1 curriculum
made available to you by cfa institute
in this lesson we will start by
understanding the concept of probability
and explain to you some properties of
probability then we will learn about
different ways probability can be
estimated after that we will cover the
most important concept of this lesson
which is conditional and unconditional
probability
this concept is important because every
real-life calculation of return and risk
is dependent on certain conditions while
explaining these concepts we will study
some important rules of probability
every concept will have a roll attached
to it the roll will be discussed with
the concept to understand the importance
of the rule its application and
significance
after learning conditionality of
probability we will cover types of
events that is independent and dependent
event next we will learn how to
calculate the expected value and
dispersion or variance of the possible
outcomes from the expected value
calculation of dispersion is important
because it is a measure of risk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
