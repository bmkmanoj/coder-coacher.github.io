and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on an
introduction to routing concepts and
configuration this lesson focuses on how
to manage Cisco devices let us begin
with the objectives of the lesson in the
next slide by the end of this lesson you
will be able to describe the basics of
cisco hardware devices configure a
change in boot order activate iOS
licensing discuss the concept of remote
access verify remote access to a Cisco
device perform local database
authentication in this course so far we
have discussed software processing let
us look into cisco hardware a Cisco
device has components similar to other
types of electronic devices it has a
universal asynchronous receiver
transmitter UART which controls the aux
and console ports there may be one or
two universal serial bus USB ports which
may be used as flash memory for a switch
an application-specific integrated
circuit ase controls the flow of data
between memory a CPU and an interface
now let's look at the memory components
read-only memory ROM stores the power-on
self-test post raw monitor Raman and
bootstrap random access memory RAM
stores dynamic information such as the
routing table running configuration ARP
cache and buffers compact flash and
flash stores the cisco internetwork
operating system iOS non-volatile Ram
NVRAM holds the configuration file and
the configuration register in the next
slide
let us discuss basics of Cisco device a
new switch can provide basic switching
capabilities with no configuration
however a router requires configuration
until an IP address is configured a
console connection is required to access
a Cisco device in the following slide
let us discuss a console
a Cisco console port requires a rollover
cable with an rj45 connector a rollover
cable pin house our one through eight on
one side and eight through one on the
other to connect to the console port
from a PC a serial connection with a db9
connector is used to access the serial
port use a terminal application on the
PC the serial settings are displayed on
screen take some time to study it let us
look at some other types of ports on
Cisco devices in the next slide
aux port was designed for modem access
which is not used often anymore not all
Cisco devices have an aux port let us
now discuss an Ethernet port in the
following slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
