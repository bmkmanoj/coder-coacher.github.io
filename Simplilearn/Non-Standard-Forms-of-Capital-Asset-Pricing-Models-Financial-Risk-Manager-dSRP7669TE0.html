financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
non-standard capital asset pricing model
this is a sixth lecture in the
preparation for the frm par one exam you
must go through lecture five standard
capital asset pricing model before
proceeding to this topic the upcoming
topic is a very advanced topic in the
field of risk management and at many
places you may not fully understand the
concept underlying the assumptions are
the results of some models as in these
cases researchers have postulated their
own different theories and most results
are based on certain research and
findings that are well beyond discussion
in the course structure GA RP requires
you to just have a brief idea about the
various practical cases scenarios that
exist and their possible impact on
pricing at equilibrium agenda until now
we have studied the standard form of a
capm or the capital asset pricing model
used to arrive at the asset prices at
market equilibrium if you recall we have
made many assumptions in arriving at the
model which may not hold in practice in
this lecture we will briefly see the
impact of removing some of the
assumptions in many cases the model is
similar to the standard capm but in some
cases it is very different and it is
even difficult to determine the price
behavior we will then briefly learn how
the model changes when investors
decisions are taken over a period rather
than a point of time
no short selling in one of the
assumptions of capm we said that short
selling of any amount is possible we
also learned that at equilibrium all the
investors hold the market portfolio if
all the investors hold the same
portfolio then there is no need to short
any security that is shorting is not
required hence this is not the necessary
assumption in the capm and even if
shorting is not allowed there will be no
impact on the capm derived earlier
riskless borrowing and lending we have
earlier seen in the standard form or
capm that unlimited riskless lending and
borrowing is allowed to the investor in
practice borrowing a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
