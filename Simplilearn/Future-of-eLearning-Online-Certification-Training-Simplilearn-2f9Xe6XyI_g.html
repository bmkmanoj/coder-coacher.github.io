core learning challenges online learning
solutions lack clarity on tangible
outcomes and with this the end benefit
for the learner gets diluted busy
schedules keep most professionals
pressed for time posing yet another
problem to enroll for training and even
when they do find time elearning courses
are just not engaging enough and a lot
of participants drop out before the
training is over that simply learned
finding solutions to these problems has
been keeping us busy and guess what
we've got good news all our online
trainings result in a certification
after successful completion this
industry recognized certificate provides
the learners authority on the subject
our on-demand flexi pass training offers
the learners access to multiple live
instructor-led batches over 90 days
letting them maintain their schedule and
learn from an expert live at the same
time plus our online classrooms are
designed to be interactive getting the
participants and the trainer to engage
in active discussions here's how we do
it ok team and hear your responses to
the question how long it will take to
develop a payment gateway for an
e-commerce site so any why do you think
it will require so much time to complete
that user story yeah I guess if you are
building it from trash this has resulted
in the average course completion rate of
our learners being seventy-two percent
while the industry average in online
training is less than ten percent now
what all we need to do is revolutionize
the present bridge the talent gap and
change the future we found the ultimate
way for professionals to climb up the
career ladder with minimum compromise
and it's not just us saying it here what
our customers have to say the Washington
to me and I was doing the simpler now I
own my own pace which I actually like
that that that went through really well
that process was pretty
nice for me go just log in click on
module cutting the session right now is
broke up into a lot of like a nice
little 45 minute que somos nice I've
been trying to learn on my own I decided
I wanted to have someone who i
suppressed by a questionable the
experience is like a real world class it
feels just like a lecture you can type a
question which ever made you said don't
let anyone see the question send it to
run into him to hear Justin when the
kids to it and he does well I love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
