commands for data exploration let's look
at how data is stored in our the data in
our is stored as data frames which are a
tabular representation of the rows and
columns there are other types of data as
well including table matrices vectors
and single values in our course we will
primarily use data frames and time
series data in the later chapters in the
slide you can see a sample data frame
the iris data set is a very popular
commonly used data set introduced by Sir
Donald Fisher the data contains 150
entries belonging to three different
species and includes features such as
sepal length and width and petal length
and width the three species have 50
entries each as shown in the data frame
each row denotes a particular case or in
this context features of a particular
flower the column denote the different
attributes measured in the next slide we
will look at different commands to view
data let's start with basic commands to
view data in our throughout this lesson
we will look at commands and screenshots
of our that will display a sample output
you are encouraged to pause the video
and try out the commands on your command
prompt for better understanding the iris
data set is loaded by default in our to
view the data set just type the data set
name on the prompt to view the top few
records use the head function the syntax
is head of data set name comma number of
rows the number of rows is an optional
argument and the default number of rows
is six to view the last few records the
tail function is used the syntax is
similar to the head function tail of
data set name comma number of rows in
the next slide we will look at commands
to view the dimensions of data listed
here are a few commands to view the
dimensions of a data set dim of data set
name gives a vector result of the number
of rows followed by the number of
columns and Cole of data set name gives
the number of rows and n row of data set
name gives the number of columns
separately try these commands with the
sample iris data set in the next slide
we will look at the attributes of the
data frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
