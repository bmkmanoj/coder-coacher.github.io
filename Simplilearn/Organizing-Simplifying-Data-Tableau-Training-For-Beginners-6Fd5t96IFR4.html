organizing and simplifying data for
complex analytical projects organizing
and simplifying data is one of the
crucial tasks it is important to be able
to simplify data for proper analysis
organizing and simplifying data is a
critical part of tableau mission to
facilitate you to see and understand
data tableau can help you with all
stages of an analytics project by using
these advanced capabilities
in this lesson we will discuss advanced
capabilities to complete sophisticated
analytics projects after completing this
lesson you will be able to perform
filtering and sorting on data create
combined fields to merge data from
different dimensions create groups and
define aliases create and work with sets
and combined sets drill to other levels
of data in your hierarchies add grand
totals and subtotals in a view change
aggregation functions for a measure
split a measure value into bins the
first topic that you will study in this
lesson is filtering data
Jenny the sales manager of a chain of
departmental stores is planning to
launch a new branding policy for a line
of furniture that sells well for this
she needs to analyze the subcategories
under furniture with sales over $30,000
in the year 2013 to discuss the matter
she calls one of the sales executive
Alex hi Alex we are in the process of
launching a new branding policy for a
line of furniture with good sale but to
decide on the categories I need to
analyze which furniture sales crossed
over $30,000 in 2013
can you recommend a way to complete this
task sure Jenny I think what you need is
a bar chart where you can filter the
results as per your analysis that's
right how can we do this in the most
efficient manner we can use tableau
application that provides a number of
features to create bar charts and filter
large amounts of data as per your
desired analysis great you can start
working on this task and present the
analysis to me when you're done
so before we proceed further let's
discuss what is a filter yes you guessed
it filters let you filter data a filter
is a condition which can be applied to
dimensions measures or date fields to
narrow down the data displayed in a view
in tableau they can be either static or
interactive being able to filter data is
essential to any analysis with tableau
data can be filtered in different ways
you can apply filter using one of these
methods select data to filter in the
view drag fields to the filters shelf
activate quick filters when you select
data to filter in the view the filtered
fields are added to the filters shelf
and the unwanted fields are removed when
you drag fields to the filters shelf a
filter dialog box opens
when you activate quick filters the
filter dialog box opens as a new card
where data can be quickly added and
altered so how can the dimensions be
filtered dimensions can be filtered
either on the filters shelf or
in the quick filter when you drag the
dimension to the filter shelf a filter
window will appear
these are the key tabs of the filter
window so how did these tabs function
let me explain each tab one by one the
first tab is the general tab which helps
you select the list of elements you want
to include in the filter you can use one
of the following options to define the
element list select from list this
option allows you to select the elements
you want to include from the list next
is the custom value list in this option
you can use the search box to directly
locate the elements and the last one is
the use all option that allows you to
include all the elements in the filter
now you understand how general tab
functions yes I do great let's move to
the next tab the wild card in the wild
card tab you can match the names of
elements by selecting one of the
following options contains starts with
ends with exactly matches next you have
the condition tab with the help of this
tab you can specify a filter condition
in this only the elements that satisfy
the condition will be included in the
view to define a condition you can use
the none by field and by formula options
these tabs allow you to perform a lot of
functions what about the last tab in the
top tab you can specify a condition to
include the top n or bottom n elements
to define a condition you can use the
none by field by formula options thanks
Alex Tablo really has some amazing
capabilities let me now explain how you
can apply filter on measures before you
begin with that Alex I have a quick
question this tab will allow me to
filter on a measure where an I can
select to either filter row level data
or an aggregated value of data indeed it
does tableau allows you to filter at row
level data in which measure value is
calculated individually for every row in
the data set no aggregation functions
are used for row level calculations
while in summary level calculation
measure value is calculated use
an aggregation function on the row level
data aggregation functions are used for
summary level calculations in tableau
the data is automatically aggregated by
performing summation when a measure is
placed on a shelf when you apply filter
on a measure it allows you to filter row
level data select all values to filter
summary level data select one of the
available aggregation functions date
filters are extremely common date fields
are a special kind of dimension that
tableau often handles differently than
standard categorical data so far we have
learned how to perform filtering and
sorting on data Gregg is planning to
launch a new branding policy for a line
of furniture that sells well this
demonstration will help you understand
how Greg analyzes the sub categories by
creating bar charts and applying
appropriate filter to it open tableau
9.0
from the homepage connect to the saved
sample superstore data set create a
horizontal bar chart with subcategory
dimension and sales measure
drag the category dimension to the
filters shelf
filter only for the furniture category
drag the order date dimension to the
filters shelf
select filter field as years to filter
only for 2013
you
you
drag the sails measure to the filters
shelf
filter for subcategories with some of
sales greater than $30,000
you
observe the change in bar chart after
applying filters
rename the sheet as filtering data
you
save the workbook as furniture
subcategories with sales more than
$30,000 in 2013
you
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
filtering data
the quick filter can get started for
existing filters as well as for non
filtered fields the filter dialog box
includes these filter modes single
values lists single value drop-down
single values slider multiple values
lists multiple values drop-down multiple
values slider wildcard match the data
can be selected from the given list as
well as can be searched using the search
icon present in the title area of the
quick filter with a quick filter option
you can quickly add and modify filters
you just need to follow three simple
steps firstly activate a quick filter on
the region dimension notice a smaller
representation of the filter dialog box
opens as a new card quickly select what
to include in the view and you are done
now let us move to the second topic
sorting of data
sorting data is an integral part of data
analysis sorted data is easier to
analyze sorting a data view refers to
arranged in dimension members in a
specified order you might want to put a
list of names in alphabetical order
compile a list from highest to lowest or
order rows by colors or icons sorting
data helps you quickly visualize and
understand your data better organized
and find the data that you want and
ultimately enables you to make more
effective decisions in tableau you can
sort data in numerous ways sorting can
be performed on axis specific fields and
manually tableau supports computed
sorting and manual sorting computed
sorting uses programmatic rules to sort
the view such as sorting alphabetically
or from lowest to highest manual sorting
enables you to reorganize the order of
dimension in the table and can only be
implemented on distinct fields with a
distinct measure now that you know that
the data can be sorted in different ways
let's discuss each of these in detail
sure I would like to know more about it
to sort on axis you can single click the
sort I con on the measure axis to sort
the bars in descending order or double
click the sort I con on the measure axis
to sort the bars in ascending order the
data can be automatically sorted using
the sort button on the axis to give a
better view of data to sort on a
specific field use the sort menu option
to sort by one or more fields in a
specified order then select the data
source order option to sort data in the
order of the data source the sort dialog
box includes these criteria sort order
displays the output in ascending or
descending order sort by sort either by
data source order alphabetic or by
fields to perform a manual sort use the
sort menu option to sort manually
then rearrange the order of dimension
members in a custom order based on your
business specifications manual sort can
be done in two ways use sort toolbar
button on the selected item locate and
drag headers in the view let us now move
to the next topic
creating combined fields
combined fields are used to create a
cross product of members from different
dimensions two or more dimensions can be
combined to create a Cartesian product
of dimension members the view includes
all combinations of each member of the
dimensions let's look at an example a
combined field has been created using
segments and region when added to the
view it displays all combinations of
segments and region elements creating
groups and defining aliases are some
more features that tableau offers let's
understand each of these concepts let's
say you want to view data at levels that
are not already present in the data
source in such situations groups are
used to combine dimension members to
create a higher level member when a
group is created a default name is
automatically formed using the combined
members named the new grouped field
takes over the dimension on rows or
columns for example a group can be
created by combining the sales for
envelopes labels and paper for analysis
now the question arises that can
alternate names be provided in this case
and the answer is yes you can aliases
will provide the flexibility for
renaming dimension members to help make
more sense in the current view the good
part is tableau does not change the
original data on changing an alias in
your view you can change aliases at any
time using the edit aliases dialog box
there are some things you need to keep
in mind such as aliases can only be
defined for discrete dimensions and
dates these can be applied to dimensions
only and not to measures moreover the
method for creating aliases depends on
the type of data source you use
following is an illustration of defining
an alias for the easte element of the
reason dimension
let us now move to the next topic
working with sets and combined sets
usually you have large sets of data that
you want to visualize in such a
condition you might find that limiting
the amount of information displayed to
an important subset of Records helps you
work with and answer questions about the
data more effectively sets are custom
fields that define a subset of dimension
members a set can be created for
specific dimension members in the view
or it can be based on a condition
computed sets are dynamic as the number
of members in the set can vary at
runtime based on the condition
furthermore you can also drag a set to
the filter shelf to quickly filter the
view to display only the members of the
sets likewise you can also create a set
by combining existing sets all you need
is to specify the logical operator
between the two sets new sets can be
formed by combining the sets consisting
of either all the members from the sets
only shared members members existing in
one of the sets the dimensions of the
sets should be the same in order to
combine two sets by now you have a brief
idea on how to create groups define
elias's and create sets and combined
sets Gregg is planning to launch an
advertising scheme for certain product
subcategories that are related to each
other this demonstration shows how Gregg
creates a visualization that displays
the aggregated profit ratio and
highlights the bottom five subcategories
by sales this demo will give you an
overview on how to create a group to
combine dimension members create a
computed set to include dimension
members automatically open tableau 9.0
from the homepage connect to the saved
sample superstore data set create a
horizontal bar chart with subcategory
dimension and profit ratio measure
you
select tables and chairs to create a
group
you
you
create a set on subcategory
you
you
name the set as bottom five
subcategories by sales
you
click the top tab
under by field select bottom five
subcategories by sales from the
drop-down
you
you
you
drag the bottom five subcategories by
sales set to the color shelf to the
marks card
rename the sheet as groups and sets
you
save the workbook as working with groups
and sets
you
close the workbook
this completes the demonstration on
working with groups and sets now let us
study how can we drill to other levels
in a hierarchy
Jenny is required to present the
company's sales performance across
different Regents states and cities in
an upcoming meeting she calls Alex to
help her make this report in a quick and
efficient manner
hi Alex I need you to create a report
for me to present the company sales
performance across different regions
states and cities sure Jenny are there
any specific points that you want me to
keep in mind yes I want to use the same
data source for the detail and summary
information in other words I want to
create a report where all the data is
contained within the same report can you
suggest a way to do that sure Jenny for
creating such reports tableau offers the
feature of hierarchy where you can drill
down to several lower layers of detail
great
please start working on this report and
share the final output with me
I was just wondering can we drill to
other levels in a hierarchy yes we can a
hierarchy is a grouping of related
dimensions depicting direct parent-child
relationships between them built-in
hierarchies are not present in
relational databases but it can be
inherited from the relational databases
that have similar dimensions it is
useful in the following ways it
facilitates analyzing a high level
overview of your data and then drilling
down to lower levels of detail what's
amazing in that tableau separates the
data fields automatically into
hierarchies so you can easily break down
the view by year quarter month etc
moreover it also enables you to create
your own custom hierarchies if you want
to view your data at a lower or higher
level in the hierarchy then drilling is
what you're looking for for instance you
can drill up from date through year or
you can drill down from year to date
that way drilling is one of the most
suitable ways to navigate hierarchies
various methods of drilling are
available in tableau it allows you to
drill using fields on shelves or drill
using headers let me show you how
drilling using headers can be referred
to as uneven drill as only desired
members are displayed rather than all
the members from the list you can click
a header value in the view and select
drill down or drill up from the menu
let's say it is drilled down from your
level to quarter level you can expand or
collapse a dimension in the rows or
columns shelf to drill down or up
respectively the plus and minus signs on
the fields that are placed on the
shelves shows the drilled status so that
means the plus sign indicates that it
can be drilled down further while the
minus sign indicates that you can drill
up but cannot drill down further Gregg
is required to present the company's
sales performance across different
regions states and cities he is required
to create a report such that all the
data is contained within the same report
let's see how he does that open tableau
point zero
you
from the homepage connect to the saved
sample superstore data set create a
hierarchy by dragging state on to region
name the hierarchy as geography
in the geography hierarchy drag city
below state
create a report with region and sales
right-click West select keep only
drilled down from region to state
right-click California select keep only
drilled down from state to city
rename the sheet as sales analysis
save the workbook as company sales
performance
you
close the workbook this completes the
demonstration on drill down report
now let us discuss another important
feature of tableau grand totals and
subtotals totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute grand totals and subtotals for
the data in a view these totals can be
applied only on grid type visualizations
tableau does not compute subtotals and
grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity totals facilitate the
aggregation of data in a view you can
compute grand totals and subtotals for
the data in a view these totals can be
applied only on grid type visualizations
tableau does not compute subtotals and
grant totals as just an aggregation
instead subtotals and grand totals are
computed as a separate calculation of
the measure at a coarser level of
granularity tableau computes subtotals
and grand totals as the original measure
at a higher level of aggregation let us
proceed with understanding how to define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices tableau allows you to define
aggregations other than the predefined
choices such as summation and variance
you can change the aggregation function
by right-clicking a dimension in either
the rows or columns shelf or by
right-clicking a field in the data pane
here we have changed the aggregation
function to average next we are going to
study about tableau bins which are
useful to create a range of data bins
are custom bandings of the values of a
measure based on a specific size you can
bend data only for relational data
sources it does not support this feature
for multi-dimensional data sources bins
can be referred to as buckets of values
and can be created for numeric
dimensions there are two types that you
can create fixed sized and variable
sized you can create a fixed sized bin
by specifying the size of each bin in
the create bins window keep in mind that
by default
tablo creates even-sized bins based on a
size you specify as you can see I have
created fixed sized bins on the discount
measure of size 10 each to create a
variable size bin create a calculated
field with an appropriate script you
will learn about calculated fields in
detail in lesson 8 calculations for now
just remember that you need to create a
calculated field to create bins of
variable size look we have three bins on
the discount measure of variable sizes
now that you have gone through the need
and importance of organizing and
simplifying data let us have a quick
look at the key takeaways filters enable
you to narrow down the data displayed in
a view sorting refers to the arrangement
of dimension members in a specified
order combined fields are used to create
a cross-product of members from
different dimensions a group is a
combination of dimension members that
make up a higher level category aliases
are alternate names for specific values
within a dimension sets are custom
fields that define a subset of data
based on some conditions drilling helps
you analyze the data in a view at a
lower or higher level in the hierarchy
bins are custom bandings of measure
values they can be created either as
fixed sized or variable sized time for
some hands-on practice let's now
understand the below scenario and work
on it together you are an owner of a
store and want to analyze the existing
discount strategy offered by your store
you wish to view the number of customers
who have been offered discounts between
zero percent and 10 percent 10 percent
and 20 percent and so on create a
histogram with discount bins and count
of discounts and answer the following
questions how many customers were given
discounts between zero percent and 10
percent what is the total sale recorded
when customers were offered a discount
between 20% and 30% now wasn't that a
great experience you will be happy to
know
we have two more similar scenarios for
you to strengthen your understanding of
organizing and simplifying data read the
scenarios carefully and perform the task
on the tab o9 tool downloaded onto your
device you can evaluate your steps by
referring to the solution guide provided
in the download center scenario 1 you
work in an e-commerce companies division
that deals with the dispatch and
delivery of shipments is facing losses
you are required to identify the
customers who mostly tend to return
their orders you need to focus on the
list of customers who have returned
their orders more than half the time
using the sample superstore excel sheet
you have to create an appropriate
visualization and answer the following
questions how many customers do you have
on your list
what is the distinct order count for
customer Hilary Holden which customer
has the highest count of order returns
scenario 2 you are a store manager of a
leading retail chain in the United
States that wants to launch a discount
campaign to promote the sales of related
products as a part of this campaign you
need to analyze the aggregated sales for
envelopes labels and papers you are
required to see the combined sales of
these products on a graph create a bar
chart showing the accumulated sales for
paper products and answer the following
questions what is a total sale of paper
products what is the profit ratio for
paper products
this concludes the lesson organizing and
simplifying data
