lesson of the Big Data Hadoop and spark
developer course offered by simply learn
this course will prepare you for cloud
eras ccaa 175 certification and equip
you with all the skills for your next
Big Data assignment in this video you
will get an overview of the course -
most people big data is a baffling tech
term if you mention Big Data you could
well be subjected to questions such as
visit a tool or a product or is Big Data
only for big businesses and many more
such questions so what is Big Data today
the size or volume complexity or variety
and the rate of growth or velocity of
the data which organizations handle have
reached such unbelievable levels that
traditional processing and analytical
tools failed to process the big data is
ever-growing and cannot be determined
with respect to its size what was
considered as big eight years ago is no
longer considered so for example Nokia
the telecom giant migrated to Hadoop to
analyze 100 terabytes of structured data
and more than 500 terabytes of semi
structured data the Hadoop distributed
file system data warehouse stored all
the multi structured data and processed
data at a petabyte scale according to
the big data market report the big data
market is expected to grow from 28 point
six five US billion dollars in 2016 to
sixty six point seven nine billion by
2021 big data Hadoop and spark developer
certification and training from simply
learned will prepare you for the cloud
era CCAA 175 exam of all the hadoop
distributions cloud era has the largest
partner ecosystems after completing this
course you will be able to master the
concepts of the Hadoop framework and its
deployment in a clustered environment
understand how the components of the
Hadoop ecosystems such as hadoo 2.7 yarn
MapReduce HDFS
king hive Impala HBase scoop flu and
Apache spark fits in with the data
processing lifecycle learn to write
complex MapReduce programs describe how
to ingest data using scoop and flume
explain the process of distributing data
using spark learn about spark sequel
graphics ml library list the best
practices for data storage explain how
to model structured data as tables with
Impala and hive Big Data Hadoop and
spark developer course includes 40 hours
of instructor led training with access
to high quality e-learning the key
course differentiators are as follows
sixteen lessons with a total of 37
demonstrations 85 chapter and quiz
questions to test your learning 16 pop
quiz questions hands on exercises at the
end of every lesson which you can
practice on cloud labs for simulation
test papers with 10 questions each
installation guide free access to java
scala and python ebook 5 real-life
projects using Hadoop and spark this
course will facilitate you to achieve
Big Data Hadoop and spark developer
certification after successfully
completing a full scale industry project
and scoring at least 80% in the
simulation test papers the course will
give you the required work experience in
big data analytics via implementation of
real-life projects spanning three months
this concludes the introductory lesson
the first lesson is introduction to Big
Data and Hadoop ecosystem wish you all
the best for completion of this course
happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
