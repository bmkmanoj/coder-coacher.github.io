hello and welcome back to simply learns
elearning course on istqb foundation
preparation this is the third session in
istqb foundation level training at the
end of this training you will be able to
understand static techniques dynamic
techniques and the difference between
them you will also learn about the
review process and static analysis using
tools like in session 1 and 2 we have
quiz questions at the end of this
session as well and you are strongly
advised to answer let us now look at the
agenda for this session the whole
session is divided into three parts one
static versus dynamic techniques to
review process and three static analysis
by tools we will cover the following
areas under reviews activities of formal
review roles and responsibilities types
of review success factors for reviews
before we move on let us recall the
objective of testing we discussed in
session one and see how these techniques
are related to testing objective of
testing is to evaluate the system under
test to reveal defects and provide
information about the state of quality
two techniques can be used to achieve
three objectives these are static
testing techniques and dynamic testing
techniques let us look at how we can
define these two techniques the key
difference between static techniques and
dynamic techniques is that static
techniques are used to examine the code
or other project artifacts without
actually executing the code while
dynamic techniques are used to examine
the code through
execution of code both the techniques
can be executed manually or through use
of an automated tool both techniques are
complementary and should be used
together for best results let us take an
example to explain this better when you
want to buy a cycle you would first want
to examine it physically to see if it
has all the parts fitted together in the
right way and it doesn't have any
scratches this can be called static
testing techniques then you would ride
the bicycle on plane surf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
