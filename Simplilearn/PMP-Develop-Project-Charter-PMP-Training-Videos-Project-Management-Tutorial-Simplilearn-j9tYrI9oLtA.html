initiating process a project charter is
essentially a document that authorizes a
project once a project has received a
charter it means that the project
manager can start employing the
organization's resources for the project
activities let us look at the key inputs
to be considered in preparing the
project Charter the first input is the
project statement of work this is
created by project sponsor or the
customer describing their needs project
scope and how the project fits into
their strategic goal if the project is
taken up under a contract the request
for proposal that is RFP can be
considered as project statement of work
the next input is the business case this
document establishes whether the
investment in a project is worth from a
business point of view the business need
for the project and the cost benefit
analysis it provides important
information to the project manager about
the goals of the project and the
boundaries in terms of the desired
results cost etc if the project is being
undertaken as part of a contract or
agreement the agreement provides an
important input for the project manager
that establishes what must be done in
the project the next input to be
considered for projects Charter is
enterprise environmental factors any
project to be executed within the
organization has to deal with the
organization culture and existing
systems you can consider this as an
organization baggage that comes with the
project this is the reason of project
being executed in two different
organizations may be done differently
another factor to be considered is
organizational process assets this is a
broad term and includes all the
organizational processes procedures and
policies corporate knowledge base and
historical
project information every organization
develops a set of processes procedures
and policies that are based on the best
practices learned by the organization
over time the historical information
includes past project management plans
risks lessons learned etc of similar
projects executed now let us look at the
tools and techniques used in this
process the first technique is expert
judgment expert judgment is an
invaluable input to the process of
formally authorizing a project because
an expert can provide insights into why
a project makes business sense or why it
does not from experience they may be
able to shed light about the validity of
the business drivers feasibility
assumptions and constraints that need to
be considered for the project
facilitation techniques is another
technique used the chartering process is
often a collaborative activity involving
many influential stakeholders in an
organization facilitation techniques
help bring all these stakeholders
together and engage in fruitful
discussions in order to arrive at an
informed decision whether to go ahead
with a project or not the only output of
this project is the project charter let
us try to understand what the project
charter might contain the project
charter usually contains the high level
project requirement and it should be
created by the project sponsor and
handed over to the project manager the
project manager can do the groundwork to
prepare the project Charter but it must
be signed by the project sponsor or
somebody in the performing organization
who is higher in authority than the
project manager it is important to point
out that a project charter is not a
project management plan the detailed
risk schedule cost analysis etc is part
of the project management plan and
should be done during the project
planning phase when there is more detail
on the availability of the project to do
so
the Charter should be sufficiently high
level to accommodate the minor changes
that might arise in the project in the
next screen let us discuss the second
process under project integration
