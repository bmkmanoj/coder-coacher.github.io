network professional ccnp routing and
switching course offered by simply learn
this is the first lesson in the tshoot
module this lesson focuses on network
maintenance let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to list the different network
maintenance models explain the features
of the Cisco lifecycle services model
identify the various types of network
application traffic lists the different
forms of network documentation explain
white change control is important let us
start our discussion with an
understanding of maintenance models
maintenance models are used to address
all aspects of technology usage in a
business methodically there are many
maintenance models and each of them
takes a slightly different approach for
example the IT infrastructure library
model focuses on how the use of
technology can meet business needs it is
considered as the worldwide standard
maintenance model to other models look
at the same issues but from an IT
services point of view they are a fault
configuration accounting performance and
security f caps model developed by ISO
and telecommunications management
network TMM finally Cisco lifecycle
services is the maintenance model
promoted by Cisco in the next slide we
will start a detailed discussion of the
Cisco lifecycle services model
the cisco lifecycle services model
defines the steps involved in deploying
hardware and software solutions in an
organization the word lifecycle denotes
that there is always change in an
organization consequently necessitating
a repetition of the stages in Cisco
lifecycle services this methodology
comprises six steps prepare plan design
implement operate and optimize the
acronym of the steps is PPD I 00 hence
it is also known as the PPD ioo model
let us learn more about each step of the
cisco lifecycle services model and its
features in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
