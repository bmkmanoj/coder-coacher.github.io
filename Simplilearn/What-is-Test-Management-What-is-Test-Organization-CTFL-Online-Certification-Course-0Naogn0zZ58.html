hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on is tqb foundation
preparation this is the fifth session
that one needs to go through to complete
the is tqb training at the end of this
training you will be able to understand
the importance of independent testing
advantages and disadvantages of
independent testing within an
organization and different roles and
responsibilities within a test team you
will also learn about test plans
estimates monitoring and control
configuration management and about risks
as well like in earlier sessions we have
quiz questions at the end of this
session and you were strongly advised to
answer these before you move to the
following sessions let us now look at
the agenda for this session the whole
session is divided into six parts one
test organization two test planning and
estimation three test progress
monitoring and control for configuration
management five risk and testing six
incident management in the first lesson
test organization we will learn about
testing organization's importance of
independent testing and roles and
responsibilities involved in testing
the effectiveness of finding defects by
independent testers is much higher as
compared to developers doing the testing
themselves let us look at a few points
in order to understand this point the
level of Independence will be very low
when tests are designed by the same
person who also wrote the code for that
software this is because developers who
wrote the code will tend to test only
for positive scenarios and also limit
their tests to that particular
requirement or specification only also
they would presume things which they
might have included while developing the
code if these presumptions are wrong the
same defects as built in the code will
also be built in the tests
hence testing will never be able to find
the defects so though there is a chance
of identifying defect even when tested
by same resource</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
