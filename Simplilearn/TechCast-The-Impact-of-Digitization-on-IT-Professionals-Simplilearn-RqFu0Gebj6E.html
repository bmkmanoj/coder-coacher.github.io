depending on where you're joining from
joining us from welcome to simply
learned we are honored to have you join
us today for digitalization and what it
means to IT professionals with your host
krishna kumar from MindTree my name is
richard and after the central be mostly
in the background helping Krishna Kumar
or KK so that everything goes smooth
before we start let's just go ahead and
have a hello and make sure that our
audio is coming through I have a note in
here Oh excellent I see from up I say
the name right
Buddha Locke audio is coming through and
let me also just test to make sure we
get we're still missing
krishnakumar audio up here let me just
get him on here
for some reason they haven't moved them
up to the panelists I'd give us just a
moment here
you know and sometimes everyone saw with
these webinars we do run into a little
hiccup that does happen give us just a
moment to get krishnakumar up here
because I want to make sure we have a
sound check with him before we dive in
to all the excitement make sure his
microphone is also working
so let me go ahead and do this because I
always do a general introduction not
that make a needs an introduction from
where he's coming from but let me go
ahead and do my basic introduction for
the set up and then we'll get
krishnakumar on here and get him set up
so today is dislocation and what it
means to IT professionals krishnakumar
comes from mindtree it doesn't need a
whole lot of introduction but we'll give
him a brief one he was a president of
CEO of the IT services at mine tree then
became the chief executive office and
manager and over the last couple decades
is now executive chairperson for the
company for those who aren't familiar
with this former webinar I want to
introduce you to the chat setup already
some of you who have gotten in there and
take notes back and forth if you need to
say a quick hello to Kay Kay let them
know you're excited to be here and this
also yeah we have a couple people having
audio trouble so if you're having audio
trouble try coming back in with a phone
just a quick note in there I see
someone's already got that in there so
if you don't have an audio come back in
with a phone or if it's coming in real
slow hello oh great
Ashi thanks appreciate that
Dominic excellent I see coming in here
hello great to have you guys aboard
so go ahead use this for your questions
the way it works is that Kay Kay will be
on for the first half hour 35 minutes
and then we'll take those questions and
I'll go through them and we'll see how
many we can get through in the last 15
minutes for a question and answer period
share your experience if you hear
something awesome brilliant interesting
insightful and you want to share in your
social channels whatever your social
channels are Facebook LinkedIn tweet you
can use the hashtag SL webinars that way
people can find it and you'll make them
wish they were here go ahead sit back
relax have a cup of coffee tea if it's
evening where you're at maybe a glass of
wine and enjoy you didn't come here to
listen to me so let's go ahead and get
KK on board here so without any other do
let me jump in and let or let's like
take a jump in and take over I'm excited
to be here and I'll be in the back for
any questions
KK that you need and I'm excited to have
here today so after that hiccup we can
jump right into digitalization and what
it means to IT professionals thanks so
much
all of you on the webcast it's a
pleasure
joining you today so I think this
question of digitization is being talked
about in different forums many times in
the context of the Indian IT industry
yeah yeah so the news around and what is
being talked about in the media is that
is the Indian IT story over and I
presume all of you on the call are
reading media reports about it and many
times I think these are very short
sighted views so let me really share
with you what I've been seeing in terms
of transition over the last couple of
years and more than anything else how
does the future really look like so some
of the indicators based on which people
think that the story of the Indian IT
industry is over is that is that the
industry growth rate is flowing down
what used to be in the 60% in the early
2000 got down to the 30 40 percent and
today probably the industry growth rate
many of you have seen the NASSCOM
forecast for this year is that it's
going to be between seven and nine
percent so slowing industry growth rate
is being linked to the story of the
industry over
again it is compared with many global
industries very rarely any industry
growers a double-digit for a continuous
period of time there are many industries
if you take metals or if you take given
consumables or if you take given
high-end appliances or things like car
if you get a growth rate of two to three
percent on volume basis it's a good
growth so my argument would be that
strong industry growth does not in any
way indicate that the days of the
industry are over it is true that the
legacy spends are declining because the
Indian industry as very as IT services
in the globe beat IBM or Accenture
having engaged in a lot of supporting
legacy Sprint's on which the clients
existing businesses are growing but the
market as well as business model
pressures of clients clearly the legacy
expense of growing but that again I
would argue is not an indicator that
seemed up these days are over the
digital revenues which is probably one
of the bright spots in the industry
which is where I think I am going to
share with you the exciting
opportunities ahead is growing but
that's still small but one thing the
industry has to sort of take cognizance
of is that in this transition there are
going to be new winners which means
companies which look at this transition
or even people like you or professionals
in the industry there are going to be
people are going to win and win big time
and there are people over the lose out
so there are going to be new winners
amongst organizations among individuals
and there is going to be new competition
because there are going to be both new
type of people are going to come into
the industry the creative people whom
they have never seen becoming a part of
the industry offer advantage companies
which are really advertising agencies
which are morphing into more digital
service agencies so there is going to be
both new winners and new competition
which you have to deal with there are
also other things which are impacting
the economic factors are not
supporter if you look at developed
economies they have been on a negative
interest rate for probably the last
eight to nine years and the economy in
real terms is not growing substantive Li
which itself is a sort of dampener for
technology spends the social factors are
also not conducive because they'll dusty
is a global industry and if you need to
really get value out of it you need to
have single professionals
unfortunately politicians see this as a
big negative of their wood bank so all
of us have been reading about the
negative connotations of are the
implications of tightness coming on h-1b
or markets like Singapore almost trying
to stop immigration or even markets like
Australia UK tightening the visa
regulations so so social factors are
really not conducive and political
factors which is again late social is
that more and more politicians are
getting bothered about their own bank
air country without looking at a larger
element of efficiency and goodness which
will come by free moment of
professionals but if you look at
technology I think in the future it is
going to impact in full fundamental ways
I am NOT going to get into that depth of
some of this but as a summary more and
more organizations are going to look at
consumers has indulgence which means
practically every product of service is
going to be individualized for that
individual consumer there are going to
be massive disruption of the channels we
have seen that physical branch branches
have reduced by 50% so intermediation of
channels is the reality but beyond this
I think today we are able to look at
data in a far more elegant way by which
we can use data for real-time actions in
configuring products and services and
that is going to be one of the big
change and all of this is going to drive
a big change which is leading to
software and services really becoming
all pervasive while the pundits who are
painting a doomsday of their
the industry say that all tightened up
systems growing by two three percent but
if you really take the covers away where
the spend is really declining is really
in hardware whereas the software and
services the growth is substantive in
fact in the period between 2012 and 2016
the spend on software and services is
only increased and this trend is going
to be conducive for IT professionals
because there's going to be more and
more investments it is done in software
and services so and this is leading to a
dramatic increase so if you look at in
terms of numbers and I'm really
referring to the chart on the right-hand
side of the slide down there is almost
an incremental spend of 250 billion in
services and software so all of us were
a part of this in our disengagement we
are all primarily delivering services
and software and services so it is a
great opportunity for us we need not get
bothered that the hardware spend or the
encou spend is declining by 55 percent
because that's really going to impact
people who make computers people who
build data center products and so on but
the services and software is really
growing and that is really the big
opportunity this is a slide from the
McKinsey Global Institute that what they
predicted is that the global spend on
technology and services will cut four
billion dollars by 2025 well which is a
substantive number in fact the loner
industry which can arguably say that the
spend is going with four trillion but
there is going to be an interesting mix
change which means that 60% of this is
going to get driven by digital
technologies and even by 2020 they
anticipate 65 percent or the digital
spend to go to about 35 percent of the
overall spend and that in five years
will really become sixty percent which a
majority of it today it's probably in
the 10 15 percent level so even within
the next four years they're going to see
a big
position and digital which necessarily
means ask professionals we need to get
ready for this change by rescaling
ourselves which is what I will touch
upon in the subsequent part of my
presentation coupled with some of the
big changes which I am saying in
organization so if you look at the
Indian IT industry while there might be
people who call it a doom state I
believe the real opportunity in the in
IT industry is just beginning I share it
with you the enterprise spend the four
trillion in 2025 and today the Indian IT
industry is about 140 billion in terms
of revenues so there is a great
opportunity in digital now and clearly
market estimates are that there will be
50 billion dollars of business for the
Indian IT industry in the next four to
five years which itself is a substantive
increase from what it is currently but
this has to be looked at in the context
of some key market transitions and what
are these market transitions so let me
call out the key ones one adding every
company is seeing itself as a technology
company earlier companies used to view
service providers as the experts and
they used have limited expertise on
technology within the company but today
technology becoming the core of how a
business is being run every company is
seeing itself as a technology company
which means as professional or healthy
or serving a company we need to be
experts in what we do otherwise
customers will really not have the trust
and the confidence in us delivering
those services the pace of change is
very high and market growth also for the
next five to ten years will be in the
low teens which means necessarily every
player has to become relevant as to will
market here new disruptive technologies
these big data or based analytics on
artificial intelligence they are going
to change the way in which the
engagements are run customers wanted
with more speed and agility so I think
we need to understand a different
operating model which leads to my next
point that they never
and spheal is going to be at least ten
times what it is today and clearly the
decision-making is going to get far more
democratized we have to go beyond
bailing the just the CIO to now have the
capability to being with the chief
marketing officer to deal with the chief
data officer and so on so what does the
future look like what organizations are
getting flatter and flatter which means
that obviously there will be more
responsibilities at each level but also
over the Indian IT industry and many
times say because the industry is
growing so fast
everybody gets into the mindset of
saying I need to get promoted every two
years which itself is a cause for
motivation those days are going to go
away because organizations are getting
faster agility is the only way to
survive and succeed both for
organizations and individuals automation
and artificial intelligence will have an
impact on jobs and here I really want to
stress one while automation will have
productivity improvements and will have
impact on jobs there are going to be a
new type of job which is going to get
created which means that the pace of job
addition may not be the same as what it
has been in the peak of the IT industry
but clearly this industry is still going
to be a next job-creating industry but
the type of roles and type of jobs are
going to be very different and so people
are getting the part of industry
decision making is going to get more
complex so you because organizations are
flattered you will have to make decision
and responsibility and accountability
position will need to get pushed down so
whether you're a person who has entered
the company tomorrow or you have spent
five years and they are managing a small
team you have to be responsible for the
results and outcomes and consequently
you will be answerable for that so if I
were to put these market transitions and
what are the changes which are happening
at the customer a the digital workforce
of tomorrow and I am sure all of you are
wanting to become a part of it because
the opportunity is real and it's going
to be large you will need
handle increasing customer expectation
because today's customers is not
satisfied it will just deliver what she
has told you to do he wants you to bring
in new ideas innovate in the context of
his job and business and be in a way
value adding to him you have to learn
new disruptive technologies
it could be virtual reality or augmented
reality it could be automation it could
be IOT you have to learn the new
disruptive technologies beyond that I
talked about customers wanting
everything to be delivered faster and
quicker you need to learn new
engineering methods obviously you need
to learn goodell methods and engineering
you need to learn DevOps because those
are the ways in which products or
services or solutions are going to be
engineered in the future clearly you
need have an appreciation for new trends
like artificial intelligence machine
learning automation and how will you
really treat it as an opportunity rather
than thinking of it as a threat where it
could potentially take away your jobs
which really leads on two very important
aspects which all of you in this webcast
need to think about you will not only
need to have an engineering mindset
which is what a majority of our IT
professionals have or for that matter
globally all IT professionals tend to
stay with an engineering mindset you
also need to build your business
capabilities because you need to see
technology in a business context so you
need to build business capabilities you
need to build social capabilities
because in the world of the future you
can find solutions only when you
collaborate them which means you need to
build your networks you need to be in a
collaborative and social mindset so try
to leave three tips on what you need to
be doing I would say the headline would
be you need to be on a continuous Ries
killing journey
you cannot stop saying that okay I have
mastered struts and Java some version of
it but you need to be on a continuously
skilling learning and you need to build
put these in some area they're
externally you are acknowledged in the
market as an expert
today's people who probably there is a
fresher who's coming into the IT
industry I am sure some of the
participants here are treasures you need
to think of working towards a full-stack
capability which means you just can't
say I'm only somebody who knows coding
in a specific language but you need to
know the implications of putting that
code on production how do you manage the
infrastructure how do you really test it
you need to have the full stack
capability of doing it and beyond that I
think you need to be multi skill you
need to understand the security
implications of what you are doing you
need to understand what are the ways by
which you can automate some of the work
which have done so some of the
horizontal skilled you also need to have
an appreciation the ability to deploy it
in the solution which you build there so
the next slide please so what does this
mean to you a click
one as I said because organizations are
getting flatter and flatter you cannot
delegate upwards and later if you are a
leader of a team you cannot carry the
monkey for your team you need to ensure
every individual is accountable which
leads the thing of saying the buck stops
with you
it is very important each of you start
thinking in terms of what is your
personal brand what is what is it that
you are an expert in by which your lone
outside your teams as well as outside
your organization and what is the
differentiation you have influence in
your company's offering today being a
part of the technology team you tend to
stay away from market offerings but in
the new world you as a multiscale
professional you will be expected to
participate and contribute to what
offering your company takes to the
market so that's a very key capability
which you need to build so next slide
please and like I said your mindset has
to change from uni-dimensional
way of making the shell to complex
decision making where you need to
optimize several parameters which
sometimes you could almost look like a
unsolvable problem but the reality is
you have to deal with complex situations
make decisions real-time and be
comfortable with making wrong decisions
also so that is really some of the
things for if I were to just capture in
summary what I had the sort of shared
with you over the last 20 minutes I
think the opportunity for the IT
industry in the next 10 years is
humongous never has been a time that
technology has become so core to
enterprises so it's a great time to be
within the technology industry but being
within that I think you have to change
and you alone are responsible for the
change and there are some questions that
have come maybe in answering those
questions I'll try and capture some of
the action with each and every one of
you will have to start doing
excellent and so for those in the
webinar if you have questions go ahead
and post them in the checks I'm watching
for those and then we have our own set
of questions that are very common that
people ask a lot you know the first one
is um KK when there is need to train
millions in the coming the other
industry is getting that size of tech
professionals how how to do this at a
scale and ensure the competitiveness of
the Indian IT industry that's a very
interesting question Richard I think
that's a question which is on the top of
the minds of most IT companies now
clearly I think the observations that
you brought out saying it means we done
at scale what I would add to that is it
needs to be done at scale and be done in
a very effective manner what I certainly
think companies have to change is the
way in which they currently deliver the
pedagogy of the training I think it will
move far more to an experience in
learning mode and more and more
companies will start using the mock type
of operation against ISIL follow me
Omarosa
hello the MOOC type of operations to get
to people on change now clearly I think
the ability to sort of treat the scale
then also come not just in terms of
doing some of the akhil they like making
a conference call Thingiverse
digitization hello
yeah so I think companies will have to
think in terms of using certainly
technology to deliver this training on
scale they have to think through of how
the pedagogy will change yeah
from just being classroom oriented
training to more experience alluring
they need to see how they can liberate
external partners to really deliver this
on scale and in a manner where it's
impactful I see those three as being
important to deliver in scale and to
ensure the competitiveness of the Indian
IT industry is retain excellent so let's
get to the next question
oops there we go you would agree that
employers are creating courses to
upskill the workforce do you think
employers are taking it seriously and
utilizing them and given my career
history this is important one for me too
because I came from like a pigeonhole in
technology and suddenly found myself not
skilled in today's technologies so I
would like I'm excited about this
question
that's a very interesting debate because
I think there are two sides of the story
and typically tension we painted that
while we've done all the work employees
are not taking it seriously and
utilizing them I don't think the picture
is just that like I mentioned earlier in
particularly new areas which are
evolving beat artificial intelligence
machine learning or in terms of virtual
reality yeah the pedagogy of how these
concepts are taught need to be very
differently thought through yeah I think
what currently organizations are doing
is they are really using online as a
channel to get at or give employees
access to a lot of content but that does
not give people the understanding of the
concept and the ability to apply that
concept on a specific business scenario
which is why I think there needs to be a
change from the organisation side to
make learning far more an impactful and
fun-filled one which means if you are
really doing an experiential preferred
training if you take an area like IOT
and sensors
how do you really create the content
where by doing people are learning some
of the concepts in doing so they will
fail a couple of times how are they able
to learn out of those failure and how do
you create an ecosystem where people can
learn at their own pace because
particularly if you look at new
technology setting each person would
have his own capability to learn at a
pace so I think from the organisation
side the thinking on how the training or
pedagogy is delivered needs to
dramatically change and the moment it's
made far more impactful and fun-filled I
think employees will start utilizing it
better and will also gain from the
knowledge which as they go through the
training or the
excellent let's go ahead and go to the
next question
oh good luster our switch in the back a
bit if you go in there we go for people
who are looking at growing in their IT
career which skills are becoming more
and more relevant what's what's on the
top of the chart this month when I think
in ID it's always being a question of
what is the flavor of the month and I
guess depending on who the person who's
writing the article they tend to sort of
change flavor but what I do see is for
professionals who are wanting to make an
impact in this industry I think you need
to be clear what is it you're going to
be an expert in and there is enough
opportunities in every potential new
area which is coming up immense
opportunities and big data immense
opportunities in advanced analytics M
there's immense opportunities and
artificial intelligence and how do
applied in the context of business have
you sort of extended to machine learning
or how do you drive efficiency and new
services through IOT or how do you bring
in virtual and augmented reality in the
context of delivering customer services
but it's important that people take a
call in terms of varys's that they
really want to be an expert in because I
think you cannot afford to be everything
to everybody because the world of
tomorrow
doesn't really support a
jack-of-all-trades you have to be an
expert in one but beyond focusing on the
area on which you have to gain deep
capability and expertise understanding
of business is also becoming more and
more clear which is when you'll be able
to really map a technology into a
business problem so which is the segment
you're going to focus on are you going
to understand the retail
business well or are you really going to
understand process of manufacturing very
well so the business understanding is
also extremely important and finally is
really the social skills are probably
becoming very very important now gone
are the days when you say you know what
I am a coder I am going to sit in my
computer and just knock away code there
today I think if you really want
technology to be adopted you must have
the ability to sort of put that case in
front of a business user convincingly
which means your ability to network with
business is important many times you may
run into a situation where you don't
know the solution to the problem so you
need to reach outside your circle which
means the ability to collaborate outside
a network outside your team outside your
organization is becoming very critical
so I think in the technology space there
is enough opportunities but choose where
you want to be an expert clearly beyond
technology understand that domain well
they can apply it and while you do all
of this continue to work on improving
your social skills that is really what I
think will be a thing or do you rich and
I see the next question which is really
about mine tree and what do we follow
and to drive a learning culture yeah the
one I think before we jump in this
question I had like two questions it
directly related to the previous ones
yes yeah and I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more about the
multi skills where we have dev test
analysis integrating horizontally that
came from Ashish then I had silent guru
yeah we have some interesting names that
come in here but we come from Joshi
having both dev and testing skills
can you speak specifically on the
testing skills and development and held
you know if you're focusing on those how
that looks like in
IT world and building your own skills up
absolutely I think that's a great
question and I think it came from Ashish
Ashish what I see in the future respect
while in the past we have had people
wear roles were failing narrowly defined
saying okay he's a developer he's a
tester and those distinctions or walls I
see them as blurring yeah obviously if
you had a carrier as a tester and again
I think testing is probably one of the
most value-added roles within as you
build a solution today the way to build
the skill is from manual testing you
move to automated testing you learn
pools and consequently how do you
improve the efficiency and the way in
which you create test cases sir but I
think the future ahead or even now you
really need to think in terms of
becoming what I would think is a
full-stack engineer where beyond your
testing capability you have the ability
to understand the infrastructure on
which your own good run or how do you
put it on production them which means
you need to understand servers you will
need to understand storage at really a
user level so that you are able to take
into account some of the constraints and
how do you need to operate in an
environment to optimize the
infrastructure so you certainly need to
understand develop some bit of coding
skills because a lot of the future is
going to be about how you are going to
build on platform and in that world you
will move more the scripting world where
basics of programming are very very
essential now so I think in the future
these nano define goals is developer
tester and infrastructure engineer I
think are really going to get much and
you will increasingly have what we term
as full stack engineers who understand
right from the development to the
testing to the production upload and
infrastructure and really ensuring
end-to-end this ties up
excellent and now we can jump in to the
question on mine tree I'm definitely
familiar with mine tree since it's a
global product very excited about that
one what are some of the best practices
which mining follows to build a learning
culture
see I just sort of need three or four
things which you think are very
important which is what we have tried
driving over the last several years in
mind three one is I think setter
learning culture the drive has to come
from the top so what we necessarily says
all our leaders we want them to
demonstrate that they are continuously
learning between c4 or ask them to do
sessions in our internal trainings to
share their learning them which means
from the top the culture of learning is
driven which i think is a very what I
would say almost subfertility or a
ground condition in any organization to
create that learning culture beyond that
I think the changes which have done in
the last two years is a move from very
classroom oriented training to what we
call a very experience based training
where clearly we don't have class
sessions everybody is working on a light
problem they work in groups of eight in
fact we have created of physical and
intellectual infrastructure and a place
for bullish work where we have a
thousand place resident thing which is
divided into cohorts of eight between
people live in groups of eight twenty
four by seven they are solving the
problem and that's how they are really
learning so this whole focus on
experiential learning through people
living together and solving a problem is
another thing which I think we have sort
of done well we think it's really
creating a big impact the third aspect
is practitioners really being the
Mentors
because we do believe well there could
be specialized people who can teach in a
classroom type of environment we think
that people should learn from mentoring
which means you really teach them to
fish not fish for them so how do we
really make practitioners become good
mentors by which they create the next
workforce of tomorrow and the last
aspect is we have really made training
very much self-driven activity we have
an online portal called Yabut where
people can go and decide and create
their training goals and they do it at
their own pace there's nothing in the
organization it maps them but of course
we do recognition because they get
points for swimming in a domain you
clear the what is called a 101 program a
201 program and a 300 program which is
their expert in a domain they get points
and consequently they get recognized
that's the recognition part of it but
the urge to learn and what I want to do
is really the responsibility is on the
individual now because the thing only
when individual responsibility will be
there people will drive the change to do
stuff and that's where I think the
learning also becomes far more embedded
rather than them just going through a
training program I see these four are
some of the key elements of our best
practices in mind 3
excellent and your guidance to employees
who are always anxious about their job
how should they be shaping their future
relevant questions which are the in fact
many times I meet both within mine tree
and outside as an industry sort of
person I need groups of people and many
times probably due to the external
messaging which is happening a lot of
people are anxious about what is their
future I would think there has never
been a better time in terms of future
for IT industry both in terms of the
opportunities as well as what is it that
you can credibly aim to achieve within
the IT industry so while the opportunity
is there I think there's a lot of
responsibility for you
to really look at this not as a problem
but yes legacy spending is going to go
down so the number of jobs which were
there in the legacy part of services it
is also going to go down but our new
jobs or new roles getting created I
would certainly think so in terms of
people who deliver exciting customer
experiences because that's becoming a
very key part of digital that sort of a
role has never existed in the IT
industry so if you can start thinking
like a customer say what are the
technologies what are the type of days
by which you will make the consumer
experience exciting so there are many
new roles which are coming but then that
clearly means that you have to build
your technology skills in the new
disruptive areas and really be an expert
in one clearly build your business
skills because you need to then see how
those technologies can be deployed in a
business context so you need to build
understanding of the domain and your
business skills and lastly you must sort
of constantly try and keep improving on
associate skill so that you can
collaborate with a larger ecosystem
bring in some of the innovation which is
happening that ecosystem in the context
of your consumer customer and
consequently also start gaining the
credibility and the
position of being an expert in the field
in which you work so I would think that
while external messaging might tend to
be negative there has never been a
better time but the responsibility is on
you to try and change and really lis
skill as well as add on entirely new
capabilities that you may not have today
but as you keep doing that you will
continue to gain the benefits of success
you
Bob ujin okay so thank you KK that was
wonderful boy we have so many questions
from so many different areas coming in
and we do have a lot of people on the
webinar for those people if you're
counting so trying to pull them together
I see a few trends and the questions one
of them maybe we can start from more
specifics like if you're somebody who's
who's on the ain't to say on the bottom
because you know as you were talking
about there's less layers you know not
really on the bottom you're more
horizontal but somebody who's in their
beginning of their career or is doing an
internship or is trying to move up the
ladder
what kind of IT fields are the top ones
right now there's a lot of questions on
machine learning and AI I noticed
there's somebody mentioned security on
there we have Java developer you know
doing Android and OS I kind of came from
all directions on that so I don't know
if you have a answer for the people who
are working on the career from the
bottom or starting or just have been and
of course short period and figure out
where to go what I do and probably sort
of give some of my thoughts on people
who at an entry-level stage who
obviously have come in with an intention
that maybe they might be great option
tis night industry and might also have
the anxiety of saying did I really make
the right choice in getting into this
industry yeah I think probably in the
case of people have entered the industry
I think their problem they are probably
the best position because unlike people
who spend five ten years in the industry
they have to unlearn a lot of things and
learn new things I think people were
just entering the industry they really
have no legacy they can really start
fresh
so which is why I think is very
important for them to understand what is
the opportunity ahead
them and how is it that they're
continuously going to become experts in
an area with ratures so it could be an
area like artificial intelligence but
beyond understanding tools and
artificial intelligence or how do you
combine artificial intelligence and big
data so that you are really able to give
to businesses the ability to take
decisions on a real-time basis which is
based on a strong analytics as well as
applying artificial intelligence to the
data which are really sort of churning
out so many possibilities like this
exist you could certainly become
somebody who looks at process and sees
how do you really digitize this process
for efficiency yeah
which really comes in more sour process
background so that's an entirely new
opportunity available to you so I don't
think there's a limitation of
opportunity clearly you have to
constantly keep looking out all how to
sit that technology is being adopted by
customers where is it I can add value
and consequently start putting your
effort and energy into becoming an
expert in that area that is really the
advice which at least with you
and again the chat just as a thing what
I agree with you probably there are lot
of questions
one of the sessions which came was that
if you're not able to answer some of
them later on what I could do is I could
pick up those questions and
independently may do it through email
which could then be available to all the
participants okay and we have simply
learned if you go to community to simply
learn comm we have open forums there if
they want to put them in there and we
can certainly set you up with like your
own forum for this or something like
that just to make it easy and they we
also have other people coming in and
answering those so we have a full forum
and then if you want to supply an email
we can do that also
I have take walking up the ladder we
have so we talked about people who are
trying to form their career what about
project management we have a lot of
questions from IC SH and debauch are
asking about the roles of project
management practice how much IT are they
going to need to learn how is there if
they're doing if they're doing a system
analyst or solution architect business
analyst all of those people in that
particular level trying to figure out
how to put the pieces together how does
this affect them simple role which I
think where maximum change of mindset
has to happen is really the project
managers role we've lived in a time
where clearly project managers are
playing a very key role of managing
resources managing clearly the schedules
and keeping the customer updated of the
progress and consequently planning risks
and any other aspect of both assets
which needs to be deployed in the
project term the fact is a lot of them
are getting automated if you look at
basic essential things in terms of
project management most mature
organizations are implementing
automated way in capturing some of the
mattresses with respect to how a project
is being run which necessarily means
people who want the continuous project
managers need to partly become
application architects for solution
architects and that's the key value
which they need to bring in in the
context of the project maybe a role like
an application architect or a solution
architect in a project team itself may
disappear and the project program
manager will play that role in a
combined manner because he is bringing
in the value of his experience of
application solution to really architect
that solution and then have the coping
under him which brings me to the other
point even in terms of levels within
project team setting levels are going to
get flatter and flatter which
necessarily means as a project manager
people need to get far more hands-on
because I think the span of control now
essentially for most project managers
may be anywhere from 15 or 20 to even
sometimes miss 50 people I think that
span of control is going to reduce but
clearly it's also going to reduce in a
manner where there's accountability at
the next level so the project manager
really needs to focus more on what are
the key risks have a hands-on
understanding of the technologies so
that he can validate those risk and work
out which mitigation plans them the
ability to be an expert in one key value
add area in the context of the project
which will be application architecture
maybe security architecture any one area
where they can clearly add value being
the expert in that so there is going to
be certain merger of roles which will
happen but beyond that I think there
could be very lack of opportunities for
project managers so but I think one of
the key skills they still have is the
social skill of interacting with
customers and business and I see
particularly as technology is getting
deployed as a far more widespread scale
in a
there is a need for change managers to
really manage the transition at the
business side so I would see a good
number of project managers really
becoming great proponents of change
management and implementing the change
managing the change at the customer end
there so I do see multitude of
variations in terms of how potentially a
project manager today can morph into the
digital workforce of tomorrow and I
think each person clearly has to make a
very conscious choice of making this
transition and particularly for them I
think it may not be an easy change
because at the end of the day they used
to doing something in a way in which
they've done and they've done it for
several years so that ability to unlearn
and learn new skills is going to be
extremely important
excellent answer yes and I have a number
of questions to kind of continue along
the project management if you could
address cost because I guess you know as
a project manager there certainly they
have to figure out you can't just start
new projects without figuring out what
it's going to cost the company and it
certainly cost money to train people and
then there was a number of people who
are talking about how they feel like
they're moving up in their project
management roles in their company and
they get kind of hit a dead end with the
company can I don't know if you've run
into that problem of how do you get the
company to start taking in the changes
and know that they're in trouble if they
don't make those changes what kind of
kind of a sales pitch I guess to the
company itself I think that's a very
important point which are the horrors
botted I think it's very important for
companies to realize the need to change
yeah because you can't leave it to the
project manager and known to fight this
for the end of the day I think they will
then be left behind they're lonely
people who probably have to then face
the customer as well as deal with a
company which is not responsive to the
change yeah so I think the first change
which is required is for the company to
realize that what conversation they're
having the customers need to change and
how are they creating both a physical
and an intellectual infrastructure to
help project managers navigate through
the change yeah and clearly from the
customer side while it's rational or not
there is clearly the pressure to reduce
cost so the customers really are just
going to push for saying or you know
what I don't care what you do but I need
a 15% 20% reduction for the services
which have delivered them which is where
it's important for the company eight
cubes project managers to appreciate
what is the way in which they can think
of automation how do they really even
judge or evaluate that automation is
relevant in the context of the project
is delivering how is it that they get
the real benefits out of it what are
going to be the adopt a ssin implemented
issues what is the change management
which they need to be clear on and how
do they help them le Monica change here
so these inputs of support does not come
from the organization then clearly I
think the project manager should be far
more challenged because the demand from
the customer is real and it is actually
today it's not something is just of the
future today's customers are demanding
that so the quicker project managers
transition to acknowledge this demand
from the customers and treat how they
can deliver this change I think they can
effectively manage this transformation
well
excellent excellent in we are at the end
of our time I don't know if you are
available for another few more minutes
to filled another question or two I
surely can I'm a minute
okay I was just making sure on that and
also we have created a forum there's a
link for it right there here it's simply
learned so if you have additional
questions this is a public forum you can
go in there and I think you do have to
register to actually post the questions
or something like that but you can go
into that link and they'll take you to
the open forum and along the lines of
we're still have a lot of questions you
still come in on a project management
there's a number of people who are
asking about consultant how does that
fit into the business model if you're a
project manager or you're trying to have
a consulting company
how do those come together so that the
burden of doing sprints and that change
can be absorbed by having another
company step in that you're not paying
the full price for you know you don't
have a full-time employee is going to be
gone and you don't you're not going to
need in six months can you maybe touch
on that just a little bit Sherman said
that again just to share my perspective
I believe in the world of tomorrow there
would be a good percentage of employees
who consciously choose to be what I call
the mobile workers which means they're
an expert in an area they really don't
want to get engaged with a company on a
long-term basis but would just like to
work in here for specifics of time and
then
what is their own passion now internally
within my organization I've been saying
we should prepare ourselves for an
operating model that between 15 to 20
percent of our workforces the mobile
workforce and that has huge implications
on the product manager why Sprint's in
terms of the way in which it's
structured how do you prepare people for
an agile model of doing stuff with so
what I was including massage I think
it's a reality that project managers
need to think in terms of things where
they have a percentage of mobile
workforce which may not be full-time
employees but are more experts there
could be an expert on big data who
becomes a part of your project team for
a couple of sprints and then he moves
out so managing mobile workforce their
aspirations how to motivate them again
could be an area where you need to sort
of think about because these are
individuals who will get motivated by
what excites them while probably if some
of them may have a commercial reason why
they chose to be mobile workers because
they probably think their earning
capacity is higher than that but many
will be based in terms of water such
that they want to do and how is it that
they see their work recognized so it's
important to understand how to also deal
motivate and get the best out of mobile
workers which also becomes very critical
in the context of a project manager
excellent boy I was I wish we had like
another hour to do this we can spend all
day
