session today with Steve Howard. Steve is
a Big Data Hadoop expert at Simplilearn. My
name is Michelle Jones.
Did you post something on Facebook today?
If yes, then you just contributed your bit
to over 1 billion pieces of content that will
be shared this week alone [sr1]on the medium.
Welcome to the world of Big Data! Companies
like Facebook, Google, and Twitter use Hadoop[sr2]
to keep track of every profile they have,
as well as all the data related to them such
as images, posts, comments, videos, etc.
Am I right, Steve?
Steve (Male): That’s correct. Within three
to five years, half of the world’s data
will be processed on Hadoop for risk modelling,
intelligent advertising, financial trading,
law enforcement, etc. Job opportunities for
Hadoop professionals have gone up by 64% compared
to last year, with an expected salary increase
of 14 %. While companies are struggling to
find Hadoop talent, we at Simplilearn are
dedicated to training professionals become
Hadoop experts who can handle petabytes[sr3]
of data.

Michelle: Fantastic! So what are the different
modes of training offered by Simplilearn?
Steve’s VO for animation on screen: There
are three different modes to take the Hadoop

Apache[sr6] Pig and Apache Hive enable data
transformations and analyses. Other ecosystem
components such as Zookeeper, Flume, Sqoop,
and HBase [sr7]have also been explained in
detail. Also, this course will provide an
