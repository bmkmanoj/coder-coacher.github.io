define and establish the project's
structure of accountabilities and
responsibilities this theme is based on
the principle of defined roles and
responsibilities prince2 is based on a
customer or supplier environment it
assumes that there will be a customer
who will specify the desired result and
probably pay for the project and a
supplier who will provide the resources
and skills to deliver that result let's
discuss the definition of an
organization in the next green
this is one of the most important prints
to themes people are required to perform
the project activities and so it's
essential to define the project
organization structure beforehand let's
study the key definitions associated
with organization to understand prince2
methodology these definitions have to be
remembered and understood
program is a temporary organizational
structure created to coordinate direct
and oversee the implementation of a set
of related projects and activities to
deliver the outcomes and benefits
related to the organization's strategic
objectives program has a longer life
than a single project a project can be a
standalone entity or be a part of a
program of related projects let us
continue our discussion of the
definitions in the following screen
project is a temporary organization
created for delivering one or more
business products according to the
agreed business case prince2 does not
define management jobs to be allocated
to people on a one-to-one basis it
defines roles each of which is defined
by an Associated set of responsibilities
roles might be shared or combined
according to the project's needs but the
responsibilities must always be
allocated let's look into the three
project interests in the next screen
prince2 defines a project as a temporary
organization that is created for the
purpose of delivering one or more
business products according to an agreed
business case the prince2 principle of
defined roles and responsibilities
states that a prince2 project will
always have three primary categories of
stakeholder as seen in the image on the
screen they are business user and
supplier the reason for undertaking a
project is to introduce change to meet
the current business challenges we will
continue our discussion on the three
project interests in the following
