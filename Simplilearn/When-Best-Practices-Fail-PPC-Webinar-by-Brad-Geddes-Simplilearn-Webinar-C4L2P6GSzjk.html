good afternoon wherever you are good
evening if that's what it takes welcome
thanks for joining us for this latest
edition of our paid search marketing
webinar series with mr. brad geddes
of mice and best practices when best
laid plans fail and what happens when
your best practices aren't really the
best anymore even the most trusted plans
often go awry and when that happens
there are ways to rebound it's not all
over so today Brad is going to help us
discover the next steps after when best
practices fail to deliver because it's
always important and good business to
have a fallback position now before we
get rolling of course I want to make
sure that everybody knows what we're
doing why we're here who we are if you
don't know who brad geddes is we got to
fix that he is the author of advanced
google adwords and the co-founder of
analysis PPC ad testing and management
platform he is a keynote ador spoken at
more than 85 probably getting on a
hundred conferences around the globe by
now he's one of only two Google approved
AdWords seminar leaders he's conducted
more than 70 officially Google's
supported AdWords seminars for success
that have been attended by more than
5,000 marketing professionals around the
world so before we get rolling let's
make sure you know how your dashboard
works I want you to take a look and see
if you can't find the questions module
and that's a place for you to type in a
little note that I will be able to see
and respond to so let's just take
advantage of that right now go ahead and
type a quick hello in there for me if
you would to Brad let's just say hi to
Brad let him know how you're doing and
let him know that you're looking forward
to hearing what he's got to say and
while you're at it tell me where you're
joining us from it's always fun to know
where folks are when they're joining us

working vacation Dubai fantastic Noor is
here from Dubai I that's there's a
fascinating place that I wouldn't mind
visiting one day all right terrific
that's good that means that folks are

many questions as we need to do and if
there are important links shared or
other resources I'll share those links
into the chat module with you all as
well
Brad sir welcome thank you for being
here ah thank you and I'm joining from
sunny very summer-like DC at the moment
so we're gonna talk about you when best
practices fail and you know they're they
usually fail for one of a few reasons
right whether it's simplifying some
complex problems some resource issues
and then there's truth failures so the
problem is is what's the best practice
right and that's where it's easy to say
oh it's the best practice to do X it's
the best practice to do Y the problem is
you've got multiple groups to sort of
define best practice we're gonna kind of
touch on that some today too because if
you ask someone hey broad match is it
amazing
is it
terrible all right you'll have some
people who say it's fantastic I love
broad match others who say I use a
little bit and then old schools we like
broad match are you insane right
modified broad matches the way to go and
so even something as simple as use broad
match don't use it right
some people save the best practice
others like no no that's not and if we
look at something like hey Google's help
files how do you get more traffic you
use broad match then you look at a blog
like BBC hero hey do you make this
common mistakes using broad match so so
that's kind of one of the issues you get
into with best practice is in some cases
there's not best practice those in other
cases that there definitely are but it's
often perception based what's best
practice for you now we think of ones
that are just tried-and-true best
practices paid by return on adspend
increase quality scores rates of things
like that when you look at why they fail
it's usually one of three reasons you
one is a complex problem was
oversimplified another one is either
resource problems or non defined
processes and then and then finally we
do have like just hey it's a fabulous
practice because there's a true
exception out here so we're gonna kind
of walk through some examples of each so
let's start with the simplifying complex
problems and our goal here today it is
really to give some examples and and and
solutions of why you do a best practice
and it fails so that if you're in the
situation like ok I remember that so we
should look at X instead and you know I
think most people would say you got a
key word and never gets a conversion
maybe we should delete this key word
right and so in this account when you
look at how many key words you know have
conversions that's in blue not a huge
number you look at yours out conversions
it's an
it's a huge number this company you know
finally got their paid search on under
control they looked at this they turn to
their data up I think it was 18
months and said if a keyword has never
had a conversion or hitting the delete
button and that's they did which seems
like best practices and month one is is
when they did the analysis month two was
the month after the analysis month three
they said we did something wrong so this
is again some find complex problems when
you look at how people bar on the
website it was a really really clear
scenario someone search for a generic
term such in this case they were a
nursery um not for kids but for flowers
so someone would search for flowers or
best flowers for you know summer growing
um in the South write something really
generic and they get some answers then
they'd search for all right how do I
make blue roses all right and then they
would search for the brand and convert
so what had just happened is they
deleted every single word that was their
generic and specific words because they
didn't have conversions and their cat
was almost all brand but nobody searched
for their brands without searching first
and seeing them on generic words so this
is where you know attribution management
is important it's also important to
understand what is that assist value
because if you have a one click one buy
scenario this is not going to happen to
you if you have a three four five click
than buy scenario it's really easy to
accidentally delete keywords which are
essential this gets an audience
targeting are the essential in your
overall process of attracting those
users you're not a company there are b2b
company and and they looked and said
we want to do bid modifiers right we
know that our conversion rates change by
day of the week we're gonna go do a huge
daily week analysis and we're gonna use
bid modifiers time of day day in the
week to get rid of our wasted spent and
so they plotted up their calls per day
and it's b2b so of course don't open on
the weekends so their first step was to
say well Saturday Sunday - 100 Monday's
doing really well what's pump of its 25%
Tuesdays about average when sales slower
a bid Thursday it's raising a little bit
and so they went into this analysis and
they put them in modifiers and their
calls dropped Monday they dropped a lot
Tuesday a little bit they actually went
up a little bit Thursday and if I
actually worked properly Thursday Friday
just not there their big day and the
problem in this case right is they went
and they looked at when their phone logs
right they pulled out their phone logs
they had AdWords phone tracking in place
they crunch the actual data that AdWords
was driving traffic from problem is the
weekends because when you looked at how
it works in reality and this is really
common in b2b is that everyone goes home
early on Friday right the web die is at
two o'clock on Fridays might as well
just hang up the phone and there's no
reason to answer the phone at four
o'clock advice for most company what's a
real emergency
so what's happening is these b2b people
were going like Sunday like I didn't get
my work done or Friday we were planning
our bar night we should figure out how
to get this done so they were doing
heavy heavy research on Sundays calling
a Monday morning because they weren't
open on Sundays so by removing their bid
modifiers and basically saying let's
start off the weekend they kill their
money phone calls
and so it's important to also understand
when people search versus when people
take action so it was in their case I'm
not too difficult of other other fix
right a they we did a bid modifiers yet
again but then they started doing things
like hey schedule a call so that way
someone on Sunday could schedule a call
from when they in take action they also
promoted white papers more on Sundays to
collect information since they didn't
really want to staff the office on a
Sunday well that was not in their their
budgeting their goals but they could
look to say how do we address the
weekends when we want those calls Monday
morning we're not open and people are
looking so let's focus more on these
other actions so we can take advantage
of that traffic well not staffing for
the weekend this is one of my my
favorites
so this company what many ecommerce
companies would go in and look at their
words and say that words doing poorly
let me lower the bid that words doing
well and raised but there was no math
involved it was you know their bids were
125 150 250 right when you see all
exactly even numbers and course you know
no one's really doing math for the
bidding and they had hired a someone who
actually to come in and manage digital
marketing cross channels and one of his
things they wanted it was get paid spent
under control so we looked the team and
said how do you bid they kind of
sheepishly told him and he said all
right we're gonna put or e-commerce we
care about return I've spent so we're
going to put some ROAS bidding rules in
place and they did so and their
conversions and there are OS dropped the
ad hoc random bidding was actually doing
better now that again does not make
sense mathematically so they said okay
this makes no sense we need to do some
more analysis
and so I'm gonna explain it's a complex
I'm explain this real simply so when
they looked at whether orders came from
right most to their orders under five
dollars handful of orders over ten
thousand dollars right that's a big big
change now in an average month they had
a hundred roughly a hundred orders over
ten thousand dollars came from 87
keywords and if he looked month over
month over a month
those 87 to 90 keywords would always be
different so it was random which keyword
got a conversion for a large order then
we get two orders over 500 dollars
well they had a thousand eleven hundred
orders off of 120 keywords all right ten
ten orders per keyword that's a little
more manageable from an RS standpoint
orders under five her dollars super
predictable for 200 orders only 245
keywords so this was the problem is that
if the keyword got a $15,000 order
theoretically right ahead you know for
impressions one-click $15,000 in sales
he would say we could bid unlimited
amounts for this keyword because hey
look how profitable that's an roas of
infinity they're just about so that's
the problem with what pure rules based
bidding is it relies on predictable
based information so there was no way
you are away as bidding relies on
predictable data you can't do this you
can't bid this way roas but what they
could do was say well overall when we
look at month over month over month
we know per month what our average order
value is worth based on the roas were
looking for by sort of products then we
can understand a CPA that we want to get
which will then translate into the
correct return on adspend
that we're looking for month over month
so they actually went ecommerce and
turned a CPA bidding
a automated the bidding which is great
because bidding so trains units a
communal wing at times increase our OAS
increase conversions right and so
sometimes in e-commerce if you have non
predictable data CPA bidding can
actually be better
they were turn Aspen bidding that's
weird
sorry with that so another problem we
run into is the changes to location
targeting over the years so this was a
company that in in 2011 so this was six
years ago
right they were really smart and really
hit other time for local company they're
a a landscaping company so because
they're a landscaping company they're
their goal really is to attract people
who are living houses in our upper
income so they went and they looked at
all their credit card data zip codes and
so they targeted that along with other
high revenue zip codes around their area
really smart ID in 2011 did fantastic
for them by 2014 their conversions were
falling by 2016 they knew they had a
really big problem because there was no
way their conversion should have dropped
as much as it has so when we look at the
problems in something like this when it
said a in 2011
not everyone smart phone had GPS on harm
some time now most smart phones pretty
much just leave GPS on location targets
more accurate this is the the DC area
and happens DC is the worst commuting
traffic in the entire United States it
is not even in the top ten cities but
it's actually has the second most public
transportation used so what's happening
right is people are not in the suburbs
in there
when they're searching for landscaping
they're like most people do they're
sitting at work and suddenly they're
there sorry I just saw your note there
chip and suddenly right the users that
they're trying to reach aren't actually
seeing the ads any longer
so they adjusted it they said all right
during the work hours 8:00 to 5:00 we're
gonna advertise where people commute to
and so they added a few locations but
only from 8:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday
then out in the suburbs they left their
ads on all the time
boom fix the conversion problems so this
is a a trend I've seen several several
times of companies who three to five
years ago got really smart about
location targeting really smart about
how they were doing it and then they've
kind of let it sit there and as
technology has gotten better they sort
of lost what they gained because before
you kind of made adjustments okay we
don't really know where someone is so
we're gonna target this way instead it
was much more IP based targeting now
that it's so much more accurate you
really do any but no more pinpointed
them with where your users really really
are another problem so ad testing as
everyone who's been here multiple times
knows where my absolute favorite things
and and love at testing because what
you're doing right is you're getting rid
of your losers so that your your
impressions to flow to your ads are
conveyed more conversions wonderful and
in search we don't have banner blindness
right in search someone's actively
looking for something right they see
your message they say yes I like this or
no I don't right they click on or they
ignore it
in display a user seizure right here
seizure at there based on context and
and Tom avail
may decide to take advantage of your
offer thing is because display users see
your ads more often if you do the exact
same ad over and over and over again a
you certainly people to you take in
plant banner blindness and three you
don't rotate the reasons why they might
want to come back to your company so
this company looked to their data and
said well gosh the the second ad here is
our best click-through rate our most
conversions our best conversion rate
let's pause every other ad we've got and
they did and their conversion rate
dropped their their CTR dropped and the
reason why is while that ad individually
was the best remarketing app there were
some users who didn't find out for
compelling and preferred a different
offer instead so we often find with
remarketing that keeping two or three
sometimes even four remarketing ads live
at once actually increases the whole
even though you know obviously two of
your ads are not your best in absolute
but their best and they grouping right
so sometimes that call us the Geico
effect if you watch TV long enough you
don't see the same Geico commercial and
over again right you see the caveman
then you see the gecko then you see
something else right because they're
speaking to different audiences now
another reason that best practices fail
resource constraints so this first
example we did an entire workshop around
this example I'm gonna do this really
fast just to highlight that the issues
of resource constraints so this is an
airline company they fly from about 40
cities to 40 cities those cities are in
six countries and five languages so just
considering that aspect it's very easy
to say wow this mean overwhelming on
Rutgers and
as like most more people do to figure
out how to structure their account that
they turn to add testing first right
because the ads only part of the count
the user sees so they first tested all
right do we how precise do we need to be
in that keyword to add matching when a
user searches from one city to a second
city in their flights
so someone search for a lander community
community room do they have to have an
ad that echoed that exact city
combination because if yes you can only
use exact or phrase match can't use
broad turned out CTR conversion rates
were much too double doing city to city
so a that says we need a whole lot of ad
groups to handle that but what if
someone types in cheap flights to Munich
well your ad could say cheap flights to
Munich or you could geo target the city
and then say flights from Orlando to
Munich because you know the users in
Orlando so they did that test turns out
guessing the city eight users in helped
out the seats here conversion rates
again almost double so again that's
saying we needed to do target every city
we fly from in there in five languages
so they did some more testing and more
testing right and and the end result is
for perfect management based on their
data they need it's three hundred sixty
thousand ad groups and that's before
display kicks in there are four people
now most of you probably call gonna I
don't really want to manage ninety
thousand digress myself
they didn't either they went we yet we
get this is the best we can't do the
best their boss wasn't gonna hire more
so they had to essentially figure out
how do we pull out the items from our
best of list that makes the greatest
reduction in ad groups while still
maintaining Orkin good conversion rates
and click-through rates and then put a
growth strategy in place so instead of
making three or six
thousand daggers were they made you know
53,000 this was a a conscious decision
not to follow what was best because if
they did best they would never actually
manage the account said rather make
something smaller that they can manage
properly right they may not be quote the
best because it's something they could
actually manage and handle but then they
made rules right they they turned their
boss and said hey how about this right
some manages perfectly we need like 12
people
you're not going to triple our team
overnight but what happens if we make
some rules that say hey if the cities
have more than 500 conversions a year it
gets a campaign and if it gets more than
you know a thousand conversions a year
then it actually needs its 14400 a
groups so for every city then of our
offer list of 40 that hits those numbers
let's hire one more person because now
we can show hey if we hire a person we
can structure it this way if we
structure this way as opposed to that
way we make X more per year and X more
per year - on a person salary is still
profit for the company right so it's
actually a way of putting together
hiring practices with campaign expansion
while not following best practices due
to resource constraints and so sometimes
it's not about what's best is up what
can you actually get done another really
good one comes to resource it is close
friend matches so this company is a um a
wholesaler of kitchen supplies and
restaurant uniforms and what they would
see is that they're plural versions of
terms would often have average order
values between five to eight times
higher than a singular version now
here's the problem if you have the word
blue widgets exact phrase or broad or
modified bar doesn't only matter in your
account you're going to show singular
and plural
but you're willing to bid five times
more for the poor version so you can
look at this and say well then we really
do need to make a plural ad group with
the singular negative keyword and when
you make a singular I group with the
plural negative keyword because that
would be best practice it's that way you
can bid appropriately for singulars and
plurals but in reality right you should
think more how much are we spending
because if you're a small account and
you're managing 20 a groups and paid
search is like five year hours per week
because you're managing SEO and email
and the website probably not worth your
time to handle as few click differences
and what the value is now if you're a
large account you could do the math and
say all right we're about to double our
ad groups and it makes complete
financial sense so it's not always about
best practice right it's about resources
as well I've talked to this this many
times right the discovery sort of
managed structure we've got your
discovery campaign these are modified
broad match words you say what keywords
are doing really well and then you make
them a negative keyword in your
discovery campaign you make them exact
match to manage campaign right so this
is this is not anything new this is a
common structure to see and so this
company what Donna said all right
you know like let's let's move to the
structure type and so they went through
and started looking at all right so
every award that's got a conversion we
are going to make it a negative campaign
one it will make an exact match go to
campaign - they did this huge exercise
doing all this work and their
conversions dropped for a very simple
reason a process definition problem is
that in AdWords if you don't get thirty
to thirty five and pressures a month
you see low search volume and in a
structure like that if your campaign
your manage campaign which is exact Matt
is the volume and in your may your
discovery campaign your you- out the
exact ranch version that keyword
you can't show anywhere so sometimes the
the fix is actually defining the process
right so once they basically sent all
right
if the word gets thirty five impressions
and two conversions for three
consecutive months we know what a is a
good word it leads to conversions and it
has enough impressions not to be low
volume then we can make it a negative
keyword right and campaign one and add
it as a exact matching campaign - so how
is defining the process boom
they they got what they're looking for
which was a reduction in CPA and an
increase in total conversions so
processes are very useful to me unless
webinar we talked a lot about process is
very useful but if they're not properly
defined you could just cause yourself
some problems now now sometimes there
are just weird exceptions that happen
and and this is an account that I have
gosh worked on and off for twelve years
now I believe and so most people would
agree best practice you don't send all
your traffic to the home page I mean
that that's a pretty easy best practice
to get behind now in this case the
remaining company this is not their
website these are examples from other
websites I can't show their data and so
you've got one that's a home page that
says hey search for your nanny put in
your zip code and you can see nannies
around you by the way we we do
background check them you can background
check them yourself as well and then
there's these really nice city pages say
hey you're in Chicago you need a nanny
well here are the resumes and the people
you can hire to come in
and so simple task now most simplifies
ask you to vote right if someone
searched acog own Annie worse you send
the traffic all of you all of you by
default should be saying all the Chicago
Nene page that just makes sense to
connect geographical somebody and we
look at all the data combined across
search and gdn you know what city
landing page is a is the lower cost per
conversion and a higher conversion rate
that's what you would expect to see so
while we always always we show down a
write the step one is can we segment it
and what is this segmentation show us so
for the Display Network their city pages
are amazing works great first search
they can't beat their homepage they have
tried and tried and tried
they can't be their homepage they buy
all the geo queries senator homepage
because regardless of how many tests
they've run designs they've done and
they've done on over a hundred tests
last ten years homepage wins and it's a
mindset difference in this case right
and this is a nanny somebody's gonna
come into your house and watch your kids
raid so when you affect family money
right those are two of the big things to
be careful of right you're paying
someone to watch your family two other
really big things that take care about
unsearched
someone's really fired about who is this
person display it's often different this
is not including marketing right display
it's more like I would love to get out
for the weekend you mean there's someone
who will come and watch my kids for an
entire week I'm all over that I would
look they're already local there's a big
mindset difference of that first
interaction between search and display
so sometimes things like search win
number what another landing page test we
ran we're having a
very long sales page with the
call-to-action only at the bottom always
one we made the call to action the top
but the forms the top of page would
never win
people need any information or another
another landing page test different
company we had a autoplay video where a
user could not take action for 5 minutes
now that sounds like a terrible horrible
idea
couldn't beat it it was a 11 11 and 1/2
percent conversion rate on a hundred and
twenty four dollar product couldn't beat
it
so sometimes right you look and say
that's the way to do it and best
practices say that should not work but
that's why you test in many cases now I
mean this makes sense right never lower
your cause go on purpose that's that's
pretty pretty good advice now
there are companies who do better
conversion rate wise with lower quality
scores Quality Score rate is based on
your your do you have your CTR right how
relevant your ad is and ad extension and
self with information so when we think
when the primary primary drivers across
score is CTR there are times you don't
actually want a huge CTR right you want
the correct clicks on a search page not
all the clicks and so in this case the
term is safety gates and so the term
safety gates the majority of searchers
are looking for 20 or kitten pets gate
some of this searchers not all some of
the searchers want a thousand to twenty
five thousand dollar gates for their
industrial plants and their factories so
the the people at yellow gates and the
people at say frack and industrial
safety gates calm they can raise her
call score really easily take out the
word industrial take out the words OSHA
compliance right there close rules go up
the covers rate for tank so sometimes
we'll call
cores aren't necessarily bad if the
reason for it is your pre-qualifying
traffic now this is another one right
speed is important we've all heard this
afore
we're a part of Klaus was actually
landing page speed speed is important
now in in this company it's a database
lookup site so you go there you enter
your name you enter your zip you choose
your data type your email and the system
starts looking up data and then while
it's looking up data the system says hey
we're searching database XY and Z and
now a B and C and not X Y and Q rating
shows benefits to the user while it's
doing this search now in theory they
could show you the results in 0 seconds
but slowing down how long it takes make
some people think wow you're looking for
a whole lot information was taken as
long and they actually find that making
people wait 2 and a half minutes for
this data which they could display
immediately actually raises conversion
rates alright there's a point people
drop off drop off and then big spike
when they realize how much is actually
happening and so for a mindset of user
who goes that far that's why a lot of
times you use you know OTAs or flight
engines and they're searching he or
searching they're searching here some of
them have that data cached and could
render it in seconds but how many times
have you done a search somewhere and
you're like oh my goodness just up
searching 8,000 Airlines he give me my
results right often they're actually
slowing you down
because you're become invested you've
waited ten seconds what's two more
you've waited 12 seconds it must about
to occur you waited 15 seconds okay soon
this will happen it's like you order
pizza right and you'll and they say
30-minute delivery and at 35 minutes
right you're not cancelling your order
he's like it should be here really soon
and at 45 you you call the Cubs hit
where's my order
right and this point I'm the company
could say it's ten minutes away
you're not gonna cancel your order even
though they're theoretically you know 15
minutes late another 10 like okay
they'll be here in ten minutes at least
it's on its way now that's the same
thing you're invested yeah if you knew
exactly at 30 minutes hey we can
actually cancel or for someone else
faster you might do it same thing here
you don't know see gets someone invested
in the process sometimes they stick
around longer so circle back to to where
we started from right changing broad to
modified broad so this company got a new
PPC manager this company had lots and
lots and lots of broad match and the
manager said terrible idea terrible idea
I hate broad match make it all modified
broad match so they did and their
conversion rates did go up and their
total conversions dropped and one of the
items about modified broad and I forget
who's in Dubai you're gonna love this
example broad crosses languages modified
broad stays within languages
so when search queries are in multiple
languages at once only broad match can
actually show an ad for it all the other
match types cannot show an ad for it and
so off when you talk to someone will who
loves broad match they're in the Middle
East or Europe because you will see
queries that are French and English
German and English Arabic in English
right this is a Middle East
occasionally Africa but but more Middle
East European issue that comes up and so
you often hear better things abroad mats
and that reads in those regions then
when English is primary as broad match
it's good right it's good for longtail
reaching small gos if you're doing
targeted bid audience targeting right
research it's got some uses it might not
be best
for everybody unless you fall into one
of these use cases right in one of those
use cases it's a great thing to use
outside of these use cases it could be
good to be questionable at times so you
just said just a wrap-up you write best
practices that they're starting places
and they're called best practices
because they work most of the time not
all of the time most of the time so
there's exceptions right mostly around
due to simplifying complex problems
right sometimes resource constraints and
some are because they really you are a
true exception to the rule and best
practice may not apply you alright ship
I'm gonna hand it over to you to see if
we have questions thoughts comments
whatnot fantastic we do have a few a few
questions queued up here we'll get to
those in just a second the first thing
I'm going to do though and folks that
have been here before know how this
works
I'm gonna do what I like to call my
contractually obligated screen take over
a moment and just drop in this quick
poll here for you to take a look at the
reason behind this this is a public
facing webinar of course so we've got
folks on here joining us who are already
market motive members they know what it
is that we do they're all familiar with
market motive and was simply learning
with our training but some of you are
not maybe you saw this webinar being
shared around on social media or you had
a colleague or a co-worker point you to
it and you're here because we're giving
away all this free information and
that's fine we're happy to have you here
love doing it and it's our way to give
back to the community with the insights
of our subject matter experts like Brett
but it's just important for you to know
that webinars is just a small part of
what we do we do a number of these
webinars every month on either the
simply learn or the market motive
platforms across a variety of
disciplines within digital marketing of
course there's content marketing
analytics SEO PPC mobile we also of
course under the simply learn banner
lots of other skill set
that we offer training for like project
management big data and so forth but our
but our core service is actually
providing the training for these skill
sets we built web-based digital
marketing training curricula that's used
by higher education institutions Duke
University and Rutgers us licensed by
agencies professional organizations
in-house enterprise teams these are
structured courses with streaming videos
and downloadable workbooks and quizzes
and tests he had access to forums you
can interact with other with the faculty
and with other students you can ask
questions you can you can get guidance
on how to apply what you're learning to
your specific real world real world
challenges so it's a tremendous
opportunity to to not just drop in for
these webinars every month but to really
get down and dirty and up to the elbows
with the training itself and get
yourself prepared in many cases of
course for third-party certification
testing so as well as of course just the
skills that you'll learn as you go
through the course in and of itself if
you want to know more click the
appropriate little box there we'll have
somebody get in touch with you no
obligation you'll get a backstage tour
we'll talk to you about what your goals
are and we'll see if there really is a
fit here if you like phone calls better
than emails go ahead and drop your phone
number into the end of the question mob
well it'll be connected to your to your
data and we'll have somebody call you
instead of email you alright let me get
rid of that
that's my obligation say goodbye to the
poll we'll get back to real business we
should be seeing Brett's
screen here there we go in just a second
with regard to that nor asked you know
if I'm already with simply learned what
do I choose if you're already with
simply learn then you're golden
we're happy to have you here and I'm
happy that you're getting the the
training access to the training you need
and so nothing nothing for you to do no
need to respond let's let's take a look
here at some questions and some comments
that we have and my browser is acting
very funny let me get back to the right
place here all right Andrew asks are
there any best practices on if
statements and caveats to consider it's
okay so can you real quick type
right back to Andrew do you mean the
brand-new default if ads that came out
well I don't even need to type it back
hopefully Andrew heard you ask so andrew
just type in their a clarification for
us real quick if you could enter are you
referencing the the brand new feature
that was just released
we'll find out I've had it privately for
a while but it's only been public for a
month or so gotcha well in the meantime
is we're waiting for a response back on
that it's just it's interesting to to
hear it through the presentation you
know how best practice really kind of
means I guess best practice right this
minute for this specific situation and
you know even those things that work
really well for a long period of time if
you're not keeping up with changes in
your industry or with the technology
it's it's gonna kind of fall out of best
practice favor kind of underneath your
feet and yeah I think the only best
practice that has probably existed since
the dawn of paid search and in 98 is
granular ad groups these are the ads
these are the keywords and they don't
match you need better a group
organization that's that's been a true
one but you know what I think over the
years technology changes consumers
change yeah I don't know how many more
best practices well and don't ego bid
like bid to profitability but that's
more of a concept than an execution
statements interesting yeah the part
where you were talking about I'll I'm
not sure I understood this correctly and
get a little more clarification when you
were talking about search funnel
keywords early on I found that really
interesting that folks are initially
doing on our Bionic search they're doing
generic searches for flowers and then
they're doing specific searches flowers
that'll grow in my region and then
eventually they get ready to make a
brand decision and then they're
responding to brand queries so is what
we're saying is that folks are seeing
your brand because you're you you are
displaying folks are seeing your brand
showing up alongside even if they're not
ready to click so you're you're building
that brand recognition through their
search process well in this case people
were actually clicking on their ads for
flowers and then far as my region and
then and then searching the brand term
because they went to the website
twice gotcha but we do see I mean
there's a company idea what's up in
Canada that they're terrible at SEO like
they really should go through mark on
training on us here they're horrible at
it the really really good at paid search
there are maybe five years old now never
done anything but paid search to
generate traffic and they're kind of
getting emails now but some people have
been on their website via paid search
they now get it's something like forty
thousand brand clicks a month for coming
they didn't have a brand you know five
years ago so yeah painters can build a
brand a lot of people they click on your
act a couple times or the or your
organic listings your name your email
whatnot great they'll they'll eventually
search for your brand and so often for
large companies brand terms look like
they're amazing ROI and the other firms
may look like they're they're really
anemic and that's understanding do
people need to visit your site multiple
times in some cases know right payday
loans it's like they click once they buy
they don't buy Bail Bonds right no one's
comparison-shopping Bail Bonds if you
need a bail bond person you're gonna
call the first one or a the same like
you know I'm locked out of my car right
now you're you're not calling for
locksmiths you know so so made doesn't
matter others it's you know the larger
the purchase the the the more invested
someone is in the outcome of it and you
know gardening being the most common
hobby in the world people get invested
in it and so it often takes multiple
searches multiple visits and then they
search brain at the end that's a really
funny about Bail Bonds and and and
lockouts I imagine that that's where you
invest your money in a memorable jingle
for your phone number they don't even
have to get on the phone to search
anything oh that's that guy with that
phone number oh yeah 1-800 get me out of
jail I can remember that well we're
still waiting on Andrew on a response on
the if statement but let's go here
regarding multiple languages like your
airline example if we don't speak the
language we need to advertise and we're
use
outsourcing to help us do that
translation how can we make sure we're
getting a quality translation its
culturally sensitive as well as language
you know is there are the recommended
sources or ways to go about best
practices for doing that so this is a
budget consideration so some companies
they they can't afford to hire double
checkers and they don't all right so
that's kind of a I hope other companies
hire two different agencies right one
will write half the ads the other one
write half the ads and they'll check
each other and because they both know oh
they're kind of in the same boat right
they will give you very honest feedback
but that's not really sensitive
obviously hired agency who is got locals
who are doing their ad writing and not
someone who just took a course in Polish
and the the if you've got the budget and
more time than money hire local moms
stay-at-home moms even in the US are
golden because they're usually well-read
they've got you know two to four hours a
day when the kids are at school or
whatnot but they're not doing anything
and paying them $25 an hour if you're in
Europe you know 20 euro 15 euro an hour
to check your ads for cultural
sensitivity is a great they love it
because they're making some money while
they're bored and not watching daytime
shows and you're getting a local to
double check your ads it's harder to
find them right but but that is one of
your best ways of doing it that's
there's a little cottage industry that I
never even knew existed that's
interesting back to us and said yes this
is in reference to the recently released
feature so there's no best practices yet
it's they're just too new but let's
let's sew a few things on the tail let's
first explain it to everybody and then
throw some stuff on the table so with if
ads what they're kind of like ad
customizers and what you can do is say
if user is on mobile device
show you know mobile special offer and
then if they're not on a mobile device
show you know SHOP NOW
so you can change the the ad copy based
on device or based on audience now with
device right if you're willing to make
mobile special offers if you want to say
you know tapped Ã«cause as opposed to
call us now or something and it makes a
little difference it's a lot of work at
times with and so mobile of with mobile
it can be worth it if you really want to
customize the mobile the problem with
audiences is that you only get if this
or that so if you've got eight audiences
you can't do nestled statements like you
can in Excel rain is basically if
they're one of these four groups show
this out if they're not show this one
and in less unless you have very clear
reasons for showing a different message
to a user base from an audience
standpoint it it can be easier if you're
customizing messages by audience to just
up the campaign level say only this
audience can see these ads these ads are
audience one only the side is concedes
ads these are audience two if you're
doing this like five or six or seven
audiences if you've got you know one or
two audiences that you want to customize
to it's easier to use the if ads than it
is to just split your campaigns multiple
times for just a change and add around
so if you're smaller one or two audience
is great if you're larger not worth it
yet I keep waiting for well I'm hoping
that the next change here is
demographics because there are
definitely male versus female adjectives
that are very clearly distinctive that
that would be very nice to put in those
because people identify more in age
ranges or in gender ranges than they do
by devices these days
and so it's a nice first step I don't
think this best practice is really
around it yet outside of you know watch
your time commitment there but once once
demographics are introduced into it I
think there'll be some very interesting
applications in gender-based language
usage that could be done to help
identify with users
well that isn't quite resonate with you
we're doing a workshop in like two
months or something actually on
demographics and search and we'll get
into demographic demographic languages
by age and gender perfect andrew says
sweet thank you I think that answered
the question pretty darn thoroughly and
hopefully Andrew come join us back again
like you said in a couple of months for
some more specific guidance there all
right we are coming up against the end
of our hour I'm going to share some
links into the module real quick for you
folks so you can click them and get them
open in your browsers before we
disappear on you first of all of course
our links to more digital marketing
courses on market motive within PPC and
then again over also on simply learn on
that platform again under PPC and from
there of course you can dig around and
find courses in other disciplines as
well there's also a link there to market
motives YouTube channel a lot of folks
that will ask us you know can I get the
slide deck for this webinar is their
record and going to be available etc in
the answer is always yes we always
record every webinar I'm recording this
one right now it goes over to the
production team they're gonna clean it
up a little bit take all the chitchat
take that poll out of the middle I hope
that kind of thing and then what they do
with it is post it to a YouTube channel
over on on YouTube under the marker
motive name now the old webinars get
siphoned off into a specific playlist so
I have the link directly to that
playlist there with you it used to be
that that was a hidden playlist you had
to have the the URL to find it
and otherwise it was invisible to you I
don't know why hopefully they've changed
that but just in case there's the direct
link and lastly is a link to Brad's
