management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the
eighth knowledge area that is project
risk management and its processes risk
is an uncertain event or condition that
can affect a project positively or
negatively although most of the time you
view this uncertainty as bad sometimes
it also has a likely positive outcome
let us look at an example of risk having
a positive outcome you are using a
software for managing time sheet of your
team members due to budget constraints
you are forced to use a new software
though you were initially reluctant to
use it you found the new software to do
better than the current one it is more
efficient and has better reporting
facility an example of bad uncertainty
can be swine flu government declares
mandatory holiday to check flu spread
which may affect your project work risks
can be managed only if they are measured
quantitatively suppose there are many
risks identified in a project and you
have limited resources to manage them
you should know which risk is most
important that has to be managed
first therefore measuring risk becomes
very critical risk is measured by
assigning a monetary value to it and
that value is arrived at by multiplying
the probability and impact of the risk
risk can be categorised in various ways
one such categorization is external
internal technical or project management
related risk external risk arises out of
external policies or regulations for
example government policy that the river
water can be used for drinking purposes
may hinder your production which is
dependent on the river water internal
risk arises from within the project for
example the complexity of the work may
result in time and cost escalation
technical risks
arise from the technology being used
projects and space exploration have a
lot of technical complexity risks could
be related to project management for
example if there are many inter
dependencies between the sub projects it
is a risk from the project management
standpoint the categorization of risk
can be based on the origin risks can be
classified as scope risk resource risk
schedule risk cost risk and quality risk
scope risk can include redoing the same
task if the scope is not well understood
when the only resource is assigned to
some other project it is called resource
risk a decision tree helps in analyzing
risk and its impact on making decisions
and a scenario where there is
uncertainty on the outcome suppose you
want to buy a car you can buy either a
new car or an old car which one should
you buy which has more risk over a
period of five years consider the
concept of decision tree to solve this
problem the initial cost of buying a new
car is twenty thousand dollars and the
cost of buying an old car is fifteen
thousand dollars for a new car the
probability of it having any problem
failed scenario is only ten percent that
is there is a 90 percent likelihood that
it will just work without any problems
past scenario and if it does have any at
all the impact of the problem is fifteen
thousand dollars the reason is that it
was bought at a higher cost an old car
has 70 percent probability of having a
problem
the reason being the probability is high
because the car was already used by
someone else in the past however the
impact here is low say ten thousand
dollars if you add probability
multiplied by impact of both the options
at the decision nodes you will find
buying an old car over a period more
risky than buying a new car the project
cost will be arrived at after
considering the risk reserves of both
the known risks and unknown risks there
is a
civic order in which these reserves are
calculated in the project cost first the
cost of all activities is identified
activities are the smallest unique
project tasks all the activity costs add
up to the cost of the work packages work
packages are the last level of
classification in a work breakdown
structure work packages cost adds up to
the control account cost one or more
work packages are clubbed together to
create a control account and manage the
cost of the work packages next the
project costs are identified there can
be multiple control accounts in a
project now once the project cost is
calculated some reserve is added to take
care of any uncertainties you may have
made some assumptions to calculate the
cost of the activities and by adding
some reserve you would want to take care
of those uncertainties in this case make
a note that you are accounting for the
assumptions made and it can be said that
this reserve takes care of known
uncertainties this reserve is also
called contingency reserve at this point
you have arrived at the cost baseline
that is the cost for the project that
will be used for budgeting and tracking
purposes once the planned cost is
arrived there is another reserve that
gets added called Management Reserve
note that management reserves are not
part of the cost baseline and are used
during emergencies only
by adding contingency reserve you have
taken care of known uncertainties and by
adding management reserve you take care
of unknown uncertainties that is those
risks that perhaps have not yet been
identified
unknown uncertainties are added based on
experience or expert judgment project
risk management includes the processes
of conducting risk management planning
identification analysis response
planning and controlling risk on a
project the key objective of risk
management is to increase the
probability and/or impact of positive
events and decrease the probability
and/or impact of negative events
there are six risk management processes
plan risk management identify risks
perform qualitative risk analysis
performed quantitative risk analysis and
plan risk responses belong to the
project Planning Group and control risks
belong to the monitoring and controlling
process group hey want to become an
