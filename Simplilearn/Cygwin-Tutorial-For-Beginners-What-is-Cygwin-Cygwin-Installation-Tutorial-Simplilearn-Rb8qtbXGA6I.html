of Hadoop training by simply learn let
us first have a recap of the previous
lessons that we've discussed in this
course in Lesson one we dealt with the
introduction of Hadoop followed by
Hadoop architecture in lesson two in the
previous lesson we learned about a few
important unix commands in this lesson
we'll be covering cygwin commands as
most of the users have windows computers
and Hadoop runs only in unix linux
environment we are going to use unix
emulator cygwin to learn hadoop before
we begin with this lesson let us look
into the agenda in the next slide in
this lesson we will learn about the need
of cygwin the installation and the usage
of cygwin we will also deal with a few
special unix commands which we can run
on cygwin as well let us first begin
with what cygwin is and why it is needed
cygwin is a free software that provides
a unix-like environment this is a
software tool set for the users using
any modern version of a or the Windows
operating system cygwin consists of a
UNIX system emulation library cygwin one
dot dll together with a vast set of G
and new genuinely not unix and other
free software applications organized
into a large number of optional packages
as Hadoop basically needs to run in the
UNIX operating system and usually a
majority of the users have windows-based
personal computers or laptops we think
it is most convenient to show the Hadoop
installation configuration setup or
development in an emulated environment
on the windows based system and because
cygwin is based on a the UNIX emulated
environment and is going to be the right
solution for you in the next slide we
will look into the insulation of cygwin
installing cygwin will begin with
downloading and running the cygwin
installer setup.exe which is a small
application that allows you to choose
the cygwin root directory where cygwin
will be installed on your system you
should choose which of the many cygwin
mirrors you will use while downloading
and then finally choose the optional
cygwin packages which should be
installed as well as a few other
installation options you may need
approximately 1 gb of disk space for the
minimal version of installation and
around five gb of disk space for full
installation if you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
