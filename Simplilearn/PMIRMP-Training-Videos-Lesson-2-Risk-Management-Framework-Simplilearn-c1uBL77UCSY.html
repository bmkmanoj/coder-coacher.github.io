management Institute's risk management
professional certification preparatory
course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we are going to discuss the risk
management framework let us begin with
the objectives in the next screen after
completing this lesson you will be able
to describe the purposes of practice
standard for risk management define
project risk management list the good
risk management practices list the
different types of risks in the next
screen we will discuss the purposes of
practice standard for risk management
PMI does not advocate a methodology for
managing risks but it provides a
standard for stakeholders and the
framework which are recognized as ideal
risk management practices so before
implementing risk management policy or
governance the team should think about
setting the standards within the
organization or function using best
practices which could be applicable for
all the project owners consistently and
which would be recognized by
stakeholders there should also be a
standard that is globally applicable and
consistently applied the so called
practice standard emphasizes the
principles that are fundamental to
effective comprehensive and successful
project risk management the principles
are expected to be agreed upon to have
more stability and persistence if you
look at the image on this screen the
standard practices can be derived from
the principles on the specialization the
practice standard for project risk
management is the magnification of the
project risk management knowledge area
of the fifth edition of PMBOK guide
called a guide to the project management
body of knowledge PMBOK consists of 47
processes spread across ten knowledge
areas and five process groups out of
these 47 processes six are within risk
management the remaining 41 processes
influence or provide inputs directly or
indirectly to manage these six risk
process
the bottom layer has a reference to the
handbooks textbooks and courses from
this the definitions theory tools or
techniques can be derived these
fundamentals are essential for
frameworks such as the PMBOK framework
we will understand the definition of
risk in the next screen the standard for
project risk management defines project
risk as an uncertain event or condition
that if it occurs has a positive or
negative effect on a project's
objectives the negative effect is called
threat and the positive effect is called
opportunity for example consider an
organization that may need to shut down
due to the break out of swine flu in the
city due to this there is a probable
delay in delivering the project on time
this is a threat and is called negative
risk on the other hand let us assume
that you are supposed to purchase a tool
the vendor says that there is no stock
of this tool which may be a risk for the
project after a quick survey you come to
know that there is an alternate tool
available from a different vendor which
has more functions better performance
and can be procured at a lesser cost
this is an opportunity and is called
positive risk so it can be said that an
opportunity leads to a benefit while a
threat leads to an issue we will discuss
the definition of project risk
management in the next screen every
project encounters some risks during its
lifecycle you cannot run a project
without managing the risks project risk
management addresses these risks by
planning and controlling them the
standard for project risk management
defines project risk management as
project risk management includes the
processes concerned with conducting risk
management planning identification
analysis responses and monitoring and
controlling of a project as you know
from the previous lesson the project
risk management consists of six
processes the objective of project risk
management is to
increase the probability and the impact
of positive risks and decrease the
probability and impact of negative risks
the image on the screen illustrates the
effects of project risk the positive
risk consists of four risk responses
exploit enhance share and accept the
negative risk also consists of four risk
responses avoid mitigate transfer and
accept the response accept comes under
both positive and negative risks we will
discuss these responses in detail in
forthcoming lessons in the next screen
let us look at the definitions which are
frequently used in the course risk
management is not an optional activity
it is essential for successful project
management because of high level of
uncertainties project risk management
addresses the uncertainty and project
estimates and assumptions please note
that project risk management is not a
substitute for other project management
processes it requires other processes
like scheduling budgeting change
management quality aspects etc it
becomes an integral part of every aspect
of managing the project in every phase
and process group the risk management
outcomes act as inputs for considering
the contingency reserve in case of
scheduling and cost management to meet
the project objectives risk management
should be conducted throughout the
lifecycle of the project the earlier the
identification of risk higher will be
the chances of project success so the
risk management role can be utilized
effectively by adapting different
processes across the lifecycle of the
project
these processes will be explained in the
future lessons in the next screen we
will find out the good practices for
risk management to achieve risk
management successfully good practices
need to be followed good practices may
originate from the organizational
culture
and the ore can originate from
organizational assets project risk
management is a valuable component and
it enhances the value of other project
management processes which in turn helps
in achieving overall project objectives
the good practices in risk management
are the risk management should be
consistent it should consider Enterprise
environmental factors and organizational
process assets it should be conducted in
compliance with internal and external
requirements it should be conducted in
an ethical manner following code of
conduct which includes honesty realistic
expectations and responses professional
and objective way for all the projects
and there should be a periodical review
conducted for effective risk management
in terms of identification analysis and
responses periodical review is carried
out as the changes in project management
plan may result in a change in project
risk management processes this results
in a consideration of the external and
internal factors to make a compliant in
terms of standards regulations law etc
project risk management should be
conducted in a way that is suitable to
the project and should recognize
business challenges and multicultural
environment including customers
suppliers and workforces
the other good risk management process
is the consultation and communication
with stakeholders project risk
management should be conducted on all
projects
the level of detail tools time and
resources varies from project to project
depending on the expected value and
general large projects that provide
value to an important customer require
more resources time and attention to
project risk management than the
mid-sized and small projects which may
work on a more flexible timeline let us
understand the critical
factors for project risk management in
the next screen the image on the screen
explains the critical success factors
for project risk management the criteria
for success include integration with
project management consistency in terms
of risk effort as per the skill to the
project organizational commitment
recognition a value of risk management
individual commitment or responsibility
and open and honest communication to
manage the risk effectively you need to
identify the role to be played project
risk management needs to be looked at as
an integral part of project management
as there could be risks in the project
estimation of time cost and scope there
could be risks in the plans processes
and competencies of Human Resources and
so on therefore PMI recommends that
integration with project management is a
critical success factor for project risk
management the scale of risk effort
should be commensurate or proportionate
to the size of the project uncertainties
of the project skillset of existing
human resources etc also there needs to
be commitment at an organizational level
because the project manager is not the
only person responsible for showing
commitment the organization also needs
to recognize the value of risk
management besides their support and
commitment any hindrances towards open
and honest communication should be dealt
with as this is a critical success
factor in the next screen we will
understand the functional organization
structure the focus of risk management
is to not only identify risks within the
project but also to look for risks
within the context of the organization
in which the project is carried out PMI
recognizes three organizational
structures such as projectized
functional and matrix the structures are
defined based on the authority given to
a project or functional manager these
organizational structures do contribute
to risks on
the project in a functional organization
the control of budgets and resources are
with the functional managers and the
team members work in silos the image on
the screen is an example of a functional
organization in the next screen we will
focus on the advantages and
disadvantages of a functional
organization the advantages of this
organizational structure are easier
management of specialists clear
reporting structure and the employees of
the same skill sets are managed as a
part of a department
however the disadvantages of this
structure our team members loyalty and
lack of project management career path
the team members would be loyal to the
one who promotes them or provides them
with reward or bonus and the loyalty is
not much towards the project since the
project manager has no empowerment as a
disadvantage there can be risks in terms
of the attrition of resources who are
more interested to work in the project
management area than in their respective
functional area since the functional
organization shows interest in their
functional related activities rather
than the project related activities the
projects which are running under this
functional organization may carry
project related risks like schedule
delays due to lack of human resource
commitment in the next screen we will
understand the projectized organization
structure this image on the screen is
about a projectized organization project
eyes Dorgan ization differ from
functional organizations in a project
eyes Dorgan ization the project manager
is in total control of resources and
budget let us look at the advantages and
disadvantages of projectized
organization structure in the next
screen the advantages of this
organizational structure are this
organization type has effective project
organization and the loyalty of the team
members is towards the project the team
members know that they would not be
provided with any bonus or reward if the
project does not
see and they would try to give their
best towards the success of the project
these organization types are customer
centric and there is more effective
communication however the disadvantage
for the team is that they would need to
search for a new job once the project is
complete also there is no competency in
specialization and if there is no proper
resource management plan it might result
in less efficient use of resources in
case of projectized environment the risk
is that project team who want to be
specialized in specific technical area
may not show full interest to the
project as there is growth for them as
per their expectation this can lead to
lack of motivation among the people from
the organizational point of view the
risk is in terms of the revenue loss due
to lack of effective resource
utilization let us move on to the matrix
organization in the following screen the
image on this screen shows the matrix
environment and risks associated with it
the matrix organizations combine the
aspects of functional and project AI
structures in the next screen we will
look at the advantages and disadvantages
of a matrix organization structure the
advantages of this structure are that
there is a high visibility of project
objectives and there is an improved
control over resources in terms of
communication there is a better
horizontal and vertical dissemination of
information than functional
organizations even after the completion
of the projects the team members have a
home department to go to there is a
maximum utilization of scarce resources
challenges are the dual reporting
structures which might foster conflicts
therefore there is a need of extra
administrative resources to resolve
these conflicts which is not
cost-effective due to different
priorities of managers there are greater
problems with resource allocation in the
matrix organization there is a higher
potential for conflicts and
effort duplication the conflict arises
due to the scheduling prioritization
admit raishin and personality issues
between the project and functional
managers these conflicts can be negative
in nature and can result in overall
project objective risk by understanding
the type of organization where one is
working he or she can anticipate the
kind of risks discussed and should be
able to plan the risk management
methodology in a proactive way let us
understand the types of risks in the
following screen the two types of risks
are business and pure risks business
risks have a possibility of gain or loss
and may either be a threat or an
opportunity but the only outcome of pure
risk is loss let us take an example of
business risk that is raw material price
fluctuation if the price of raw material
goes up in a long-term fixed term
contract project it can lead to a
negative risk for the seller and if the
price falls below the estimated
threshold seller can be at the
opportunity or gain side examples of
pure risks include direct property
damage fire flood windstorm accidents
damage to equipment in transit theft
legal liabilities like lawsuits
work-related injuries and so on think of
a firecracker manufacturing company
where there may be no proper safety
measures it can lead to serious
accidents caused by fire at any point of
time and create injuries to people
depending on the business or pure risk
one has to utilize the appropriate
response for the overall project risk
management in the next screen we will
understand a few other types of risks
with reference to the knowledge of risk
level risks can be defined in terms of
its impact on the project objectives
such as scope quality schedule and cost
for an instance impact of loss of
$10,000 delay of project by one month
and
Nara risks are also defined in terms of
uncertainty unknown risk is a risk that
is clearly identified and its impact is
clear for example you know that a
colleague of yours is resigning and this
will impact your project and you have a
resignation date which is known a known
unknown risk is a risk in which though
there is knowledge of risk and the
impact is uncertain for example you know
that there is a threat of strong storms
but you cannot predict how bad they will
be finally an unknown unknown risk is a
risk which has not yet been identified
and there is no clarity of the impact
examples can be fire theft flood and
earthquake let us move on to the quiz
questions to check your understanding of
the concepts covered in this lesson here
is a quick recap of what was covered in
this lesson purpose of the practice
standard for project risk management is
to provide a standard for stakeholders
that is globally applicable and
consistently applied project risk
management includes the processes
concerned with conducting risk
management planning identification
analysis responses and monitoring and
controlling of a project good risk
management practice is to keep it
consistent consider enterprise
environmental factors organizational
process assets and so on the two types
of risks are business risks and pure
risks this concludes the risk management
framework the next lesson covers
principles and concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
