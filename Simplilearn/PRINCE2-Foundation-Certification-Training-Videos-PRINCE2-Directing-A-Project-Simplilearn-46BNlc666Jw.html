directing a project process which is
located here ok
so it's all by the project board and
we're going to as usual identify who's
responsible state the purpose and
objective and then describe the
activities in the directing a project
process so according to our methodology
the board's responsible for making all
decisions in the project so depending on
the size and complexity of the project
the board can control the project
formally by a written report and
assigned stage approval or informally
through verbal communication so as we
commented on in one of the examples that
one of you brought up that if we have a
project that we find out partway through
the initiation or startup stages no it's
not viable we may verbally express that
to our executive and you know that would
be a type of exception report and
discuss it with them and determine what
we need to do next so the board can
determine the level of formality so
there's still even though you need to do
all these things ie apply all the
principles and all the themes there's a
fair bit of flexibility for you to
tailor our seventh principle to tailor
the approach so that it is reasonable
given the particular project in context
that you're working in and so the
purpose is to enable the project board
to be accountable by making sure that
they're involved in the key decisions
and exercising overall control without
actually getting involved in the
day-to-day management of the project cuz
that's what the project manager is there
for so it's all about making appropriate
use of their time by involving them when
and where required and not bothering
them when it's not so we do this through
setting up our tolerances and defining
our stages if we don't need the project
manager to update us throughout the
project it can be one long stage in
terms of the management process if we do
want them to give us and allow us to
provide input then we'll make it smaller
stages or maybe multiple stages of a
longer length if we want a mid-range of
control so the objective is to make sure
that there's authority to initiate the
project and deliver project product and
so when we
see the mandate we had authority from
the corporate or program level to to
start the project startup process and
the directing a project process makes
sure that when we initiate we have
approval to do that and that we have
approval for any subsequent stages to
deliver the product so the board isn't
actually approving the work packages
that authorize the individual team
leaders to work on the product delivery
but it does authorize the stages so that
the project manager can go ahead and
authorize work packages it gives
management direction and control
throughout the project life and it makes
sure that the project remains viable
throughout the project life and that's
because it's the project boards
responsibility to make sure that the
business case is valid and also to make
sure that project assurance is happening
to make sure the project is being
managed according to the plans and
strategies and business case that has
been laid out the corporate or program
management interfaces with directing a
project process so that's where the
corporate or program level gets their
interface you'll notice on the diagrams
any of the diagrams you see you don't
see a direct link from team leads to the
corporate or program level or to the
board level there's that hierarchy has
always followed the corporate or program
management sorry I just did that one the
benefits review plan is managed and
reviewed so they are responsible for the
benefits review plan and making sure
that the benefits are realized for the
organization so if we look at our image
of the directing a project process as we
saw on our starting up they will
authorize project initiation based on
our project brief and our request to
initiate the project as we see here
which came out of the starting up so
once they authorize initiation the
project manager has authorization to
initiate the project then we'll execute
the initiating process at the end of it
we'll make a request to deliver the
project the project board under
directing a project will authorize the
project and notify the program
level that they've authorized the
project then they'll also authorize the
stage or exception plan depending on
which has been submitted for approval
which allows the project manager to
begin the work on a particular stage and
assign the work packages within that
stage so most of their work is at the
stage boundaries however an exception
report can be raised at any time and a
request for advice as we see here can be
raised at any time as well or advice on
an issue that needs to be escalated up
can happen at any time as well so the
board gives ad hoc direction that's part
of the directing a project process and
then finally in the last stage they're
going to authorize project closure and
that comes from the closing a project
process or there may be premature close
an exception may cause us to go back and
look at the business case and realize
that it's no longer a viable project and
it may be closed early so they would
also give that approval the board
similarly in directing a project can
request advice from the program or
corporate level and they can give advice
back when the project is closed the
board is notified or sorry the program
level is notified the program board so
the activities related to directing a
project are to authorize initiation
authorize the project authorize a stage
or exception plan and to get ad-hoc
direction and then authorize project
closure so during the authorized
initiation the project board is going to
review and approve the project brief
which as we recall includes the project
the business case and the project
product description they're confirming
the customers quality expectations and
acceptance criteria so we would have had
to prepare the project product
description which includes your quality
expectations did you review with in the
last couple sessions the
makeup of the project product
description if you didn't I'm going to
go through it now I'm assuming you did I
usually do when I'm doing the principles
than that but when we do the manage by
product principle so I'm going to assume
you did but if you did not let me know
and we will go through it in detail and
it's an important one to know so because
our quality expectations are okay so our
quality expectations and acceptance
criteria are always defined in our
product description so the project
product description needs to identify
the those as well all right I'm going to
go through it just to be certain if it's
a couple of you don't remember it is an
important one to to go through just let
me flip to it here make sure I don't
leave anything out okay so the project
product description is used to
understand the detailed nature and
purpose or function of the appearance of
the product so am i doing an accounting
system and i am i offering an
educational program in a country am i
trying to encourage economic development
through offering loans so it describes
the product it's going to define who's
going to use it so I'm going to get some
identification of the stakeholders
involved when I look at who's using it
identify any sources of information that
might supply the product so am I going
to have to use contractors for example
is it something I'm buying off the shelf
is it information I'm getting from a
government department about a program
that they will fund if I'm looking at
them as a source of funding perhaps I
can identify the level of detail
required for the product in terms of its
quality so I'm looking at both quality
and grade their meaning is it you know a
high-end product or a low functionality
minimal project product and the grade
are the quality being it's fit for
purpose so it can be a low grade high
quality product but it's I'm defining
all of that in my product description so
if I'm offering for example I run an
e-commerce website and my hosting
provider offers a number of different
grades of service one being the bare
minimum I can host my site and
everything's up to me to look after or
one I have because I'm too busy is the
top grade service where they do all my
backups they monitor to make sure the
site stays up and they monitor the
performance and all those kinds of
things that would be the grade and the
quality just making sure it fits in the
appropriate grade they verify that the
outline business case demonstrates a
viable project so the board is the one
that's ultimately responsible the
success of the project
so because the board is a set is
ultimately responsible they've got to
make sure that that outline business
case demonstrates that it's viable so
that's the the product description has
to be detailed enough that it can help
determine that from the business case so
let's also identify the activities to
produce review and approve the product
define the people or skills required to
produce and review and approve the
product so if I need specialist skills
for example I would need to define that
in the product description so I'm
producing a car and I'm producing engine
components some of those engine
components the Pistons map might have to
be within a couple thousandths of an
inch of tolerance to the specification
to be acceptable whereas if I'm
producing the tire a quarter of an inch
may be close enough so there's a big
difference in those tolerance levels and
also the types of equipment and
expertise that would be required to
produce a product with Spiner tolerances
so all of those things are defined in
your product description so your product
description will have a unique
identifier so that you can uniquely
track that product in the configuration
items in your configuration management
system you're going to have a brief
title sort of the the text by which
you're going to refer to the product
you're going to define its purpose so
its purpose if it's an accounting system
your purpose is to keep track of
financial records and do financial
reporting if it's a project in a
and country it might be to stimulate
economic growth within the inner region
or to improve the health of citizens in
a region so I'll be looking at its
purpose its composition so for example
when we looked at perhaps reducing the
incidence of a specific disease in an
area we could do it through education we
could do it through providing
medications we could do it through
improving health so what components of
that are making up the product of
reducing and improving the health of
people big difference in the scope right
as to whether I'm just educating the
health care workers or educating the
general population and providing goods
that will help them like mosquito nets
inoculations better quality foods
perhaps drinking water very different
cost and scope to the project so that's
why we have to lift the composition we'd
also want to identify where we're
getting the products thus the parts from
so do I have a particular supplier in
mind am I going to make the parts myself
I've also got to list the format and
presentation so is it a report is it an
online tool that I'm looking at
composition does not equal approaches
composition is the parts that it's made
up of it's affected by the approaches so
if my approach is to do public education
and inoculations for example I'm going
to have vaccines as one of my
composition so in that particular
example that I used they do sound like
they're equal but approach could be too
outsourced versus developing in-house
and my composition could be a financial
reporting an ad hoc financial reporting
tool that interfaces with my current
accounting package and then also having
an accounts payable accounts receivable
and an outsourced component as that fits
in there as well
development skills required we covered
off the quality criteria the quality
tolerances so if I have to have
have if my specifications indicate that
a piston on a car needs to be a certain
size what's my tolerance range on that
is it plus or minus one one thousand two
one thousand seven in sand eighths of an
inch so that would be that an example of
a quality tolerance how I'm going to
measure that tolerance
what's my quality method in my using
automated testing tools if I'm producing
a vaccine and I need to test its quality
I need some I probably need some very
specialized tools to do that so what's
my quality method and what skills are
required and then the responsibility so
that's the overview of the product
description okay so once we've produced
the product description we confirm the
quality expectations and the acceptance
criteria so my senior customer is going
to be taking a very close look at this
and maybe asking some of their
stakeholders and staff to look into this
as well they'll verify the outline
business cases we said review and
approve the stage plan for the
initiation stage they're going to obtain
or commit resources needed for the
initiation stage plant so if they're
supposed to hire people they would
commit the funds in order to do that and
give the approvals to go ahead and issue
contracts etc or they might be
reallocating staff to work on the
project they inform all the stakeholders
and the host locations that the project
is being initiated so for example a host
location if I'm a multinational company
and the project is going to affect
certain offices in certain country in
specific countries I would be notifying
the people that are impact is what we're
saying here I'm making sure that all of
the stakeholders at double occations
are also communicated with they
authorize the project manager to proceed
with the initiation stage so those are
all of the activities related to
authorizing initiation so as you can see
it looks like one bullet when we look at
the summary but there's quite a bit
involved when they do this so let's look
at a summary of this on the diagram so
we're going to get the approach the
quest to initiate the project which
includes the project brief and the
initiation stage plan
then they authorize the project by
carrying out all the activities we just
looked at which ends up with an approved
project brief and an approved stage plan
for the initiation stage those then
become baselined products so you get the
authority to initiate the project and
they give the notification to the
program or corporate level with the
project's being initiated and so that's
what they do at the end of the startup
process and prior to the initiating
process so when we look at the next task
which is the authorizing the project
it's very similar to what they did in
the startup except now they have a lot
more details and a lot more deliverables
to review so the project manager is
going to make the request to deliver the
project the board's going to confirm
that there's an adequate and suitable
business case now we have the full
business case not just the outline
business case and that the project
viable they're going to make sure that
the project is as it's prematurely
closed they're going to make sure that
the authorization to prematurely closed
is issued if they don't approve it when
they're authorizing the project they're
going to confirm the quality risk
communication and configuration
management strategies are sufficient so
when they're doing this they're looking
at our if there are program or corporate
level standards or requirements related
to those strategies that those have been
adhered to they may have project
assurance looking at these documents
which may be a member of the board or
someone external to the board that will
be looking at these to help give them
guidance on that as well so they make
sure that those they also make sure that
if any customization to these strategies
from the corporate standards is required
that it's justified and has been
reflected in these plans so if there's
anything unique about the program that
requires something special to be done
they make sure that that's addressed
they then review and approve the
benefits review plan because as we're
going to see when we look at the
initiating process we're going to
created the benefits review plan there
so it will get approved when we
authorize the project is such a
summarize that we're going to have the
request to deliver a project we're going
to see a lessons log
okay so the project initiation
documentation is used to define the
project so that it has a basis for
management and assessment of the overall
success so what's going to be included
in there is going to be the detailed
scope it's going to have all the stages
identified and the deliverables required
at the end of each stage or the progress
that was to be achieved at each of those
stages so that's going to all be
outlined there it basically forms a
contract between the project board and
the project manager so the project
they're both agreeing that the way we're
going to manage the project is
describing the project initiation
documentation and we all believe that we
can achieve the results that we intended
to with it and we will be successful so
there's three primary uses we use it to
ensure there's a sound basis before we
go to the board or commitment to the
project it acts as the base document
against which we can assess our project
and viability of the project so we are
assessing progress and viability
it provides a single source of reference
about the project so that anybody new
joining the project can quickly and
easily find out what the projects about
and how it's being managed and we
maintain this document patient
throughout the project so when we do
exception report when we're doing our
progress review if necessary and ie if
there are changes to what we're doing we
reflect that back into the project
initiation documentation and it's rebase
lined so it's composed of a background
it has the project's objectives and
desired outcomes it includes constraints
and assumptions and be a project
approach the business case so again the
project initiation documentation isn't
one document typically it could be but
it typically isn't it's an amalgamation
of different documents so it would
include the business case the business
management team structure in the rural
descriptions the quality management
strategy is part of that the
configuration management strategy is
part of the initiation documentation as
well as a risk management strategy the
communication strategy the overall
project
plan is included in the the project
initiation documentation which is also
called the pit by the way the PID the
pit any project control so all of the
tolerances all of the guidance around
when the project manager should escalate
to the board is documented there and a
summary of how the prince2 has been
tailored for the project could also be
included so it also has the project
quality criteria which is going to come
from a lot of that will come from the
project product description which is
also included as part of the project
initiation documentation so in summary
at a high level that's what it is you'll
find it on page 254 of managing
successful projects so the pit is
basically everything about how you're
going to manage the project and its
scope and how that the stages are set up
in the tolerances and all that and in
addition we would have the benefits
review plan so those three products go
into the authorized the steps we just
went through on the last screen are
carried out by the board and then we
approve the project initiation
documentation and the benefits review
plan and they are then baselined
so this means that because my business
case is part of this my full business
case now replaces the outline business
case from startup we give the project
authorization notification to the
program in corporate level and if
appropriate ie if an initiation we
determine the project was not desirable
or feasible we will go to premature
close any questions and the same steps
would occur if it's an exception plan
that we're reviewing it would replace an
exception it's basically the same for
for anytime you review a plan which
brings us to our next step so the next
task that they have to authorize a stage
or exception plan so anytime a tolerance
is exceeded or planned to be exceeded we
raise an exception and if requested to
we produce the
option plan and then it's submitted to
the board and they will either approve
it or request changes or what have you
any deviations from the overall project
plan so the high-level plan outlining
the stages and the dates the stages will
finish and the products that are being
produced etc would need to be escalated
up to the corporate and program level
any deviations in the work packages go
to the project manager using the
controlling a stage and only if the
deviations in the work package once
they're consolidated across all the work
packages in the stage if they exceed the
stage tolerance then the project manager
would have to escalate that up to the
project for it but they don't escalate
every single work package only if either
the consolidation of the the impact for
those work package deviations or if the
single work package is deviation exceeds
the stage exceptions tolerances in any
of the six areas in the six areas that
we establish tolerances on of course are
the risk quality benefits scope cost and
time if an exception plan is requested
its approved by the board and it
replaces the plan that it was related to
so if the exception was only at the
stage level it will replace the stage
level plan if the project the exception
affected both the stage and the project
plan both would be replaced and then
they become the new baseline plan so if
we look at the summary for authorizing a
stage or an exception plan our inputs
have changed right from the authorizing
the project but they're similar I'm
still looking at and I'm still looking
at lessons learned or follow-on action
recommendations from lessons learned but
I'm looking at them in the context of an
end stage report now so in addition to
the lessons learned from other projects
I would have looked at in the approving
a project I now look at them from what
did I actually experience on my project
in the last stage I'm going to have the
stage plan for the next stage so instead
of the initiation stage plan or the
project plan I have the initiation stage
or
plan my benefits review plan and my
updated project initiation documentation
so the only difference between this and
approving the project or authorizing the
project was the number of input from the
scope of the input I'm still going to do
all the same things I will have an
updated and approved project initiation
documentation so for example if doing
the work I realized that the benefits
were going to be more or less than I
anticipated
I would update the business case to
reflect that my end stage report would
be approved and stored my next stage
plan is approved in baseline and my
benefits review plan would have been
updated and approved if it needed to be
as you see my end stage reduces my left
nurse report and my follow-on actions if
required so at this point I'm either
going to get from my project board an
author an authorization to proceed with
the stage a premature close or the
exception plan being authorized the
other task that the board can will
perform in directing a project process
is to provide ad hoc report a direction
so they'll do this for an escalated
issue or when we simply need advice from
management or they want to take a
decision so if there's a problem or
concern the project manager will prepare
an exception plan or they may ask for
guidance in which case the board would
give it if there's a request for change
the project board would either approve
defer or reject that change our ask for
more information keeping in mind that by
default the project board is the change
Authority however some changes may be
delegated down to the project level with
very clear criteria around what those
are or that may be delegated to a change
manager but by default they would be
providing approving and providing advice
on them
they would also in the case of an off
specification grant a concession defer
decision till later time reject or ask
for more information and determine if an
exception report
is required based on the off
specification so if the off
specification means we won't achieve
certain benefits they have to see if
that's going to be exceed the project
tolerances and escalate to the program
level for approval if they need to give
a confession and get that approved in
that area okay so this is the examples
of the types of things they might give
ad hoc direction on so again to
summarize the project manager can
request advice they may get an exception
that's been raised or they might ask
corporate for advice and decisions or
corporate may ask them for advice or
decisions they're going to receive
highlight reports exception reports and
issue reports in terms of the types of
documents that they will get unless they
determine they want them in in verbal
form so the output of this task are
going to be that they provided advice as
requested it provided the exception plan
approval approved premature close or
raised a new issue as a result of giving
this direction so if we look at
authorizing project closure in the
directing process we would undertake
this as the last activity in the project
so the plans for how we would go about
project closure would be included in the
last stage stages plan so I do the stage
plan for the last stage it includes the
planning for the project closure process
it is not a separate stage on its own
usually so when they authorize project
closure they may need to get approval
from corporate or program it depends on
what tolerances were set for the board
and what authority they were given the
steps are taken to review the original
and current versions of the project to
understand the initial baseline and the
current strategies and control so what
we're doing here is we're getting our
lessons learned things that might help
future projects you're going to look at
the end project report which summarizes
the experience of the overall project so
if someone coming back and looking at
this later wants to know how the project
went and what lessons were learned etc
they don't need to read each stage plan
they could read
the end project report which might refer
back to the if there's a lot of
documentation in the stage plan but
typically they could look here to get a
good view of what lessons could be
gleaned from that particular project so
it's prepared by the project manager and
reviewed and approved by the board the
project board will confirm who receives
any follow-on
action or recommendations so for example
if the lessons learned report indicated
that some of the templates used by the
project management office could be
improved then the project board would
make sure that someone has
responsibility for implementing the
action on that particular item that's
what we mean by follow-on actions also
measuring any benefits because a lot of
the benefits may not occur until after
the project they be making sure it's
clear who is responsible for doing that
the project board also reviews and gains
approval for the updated benefits review
plan so if there are any changes to it
and this would be with the program level
as well before the formal closure of the
project the project manager will send
the project closure notification to the
concerned stakeholders and the project
closure notification is going to give
people the heads-up that the project is
coming to an end if they're outstanding
costs when those need to be submitted by
in order to be paid and that when the
resources etc will be released she'll
give that formal end date so if we
summarize our inputs to those activities
are going to be a closure recommendation
that would be receive that near the end
of the last stage it's going to include
the project initiation documentation and
updated business case if there were
updates the end project report which
includes lessons and follow-on actions
if there are any and the benefits review
plan they will then approve those inputs
so the end project report the business
case and the benefits review plan and
issue the closure notification
correct approving any off specification
since approach at board that would fall
under the giving advice or ad hoc
direction at task authorizing project
initiation correct ad hoc Direction yep
which also covers off the issues and off
spec authorizing project closer correct
so the project board is responsible for
well actually the put yeah the PM
produces the final report and the
project board approves you're correct
and authorizing individual stage plans
absolutely
yeah so basically the project board is
responsible for all of the tasks in
directing a project process and you're
actually going to find that for the
remainder of the processes so good exam
chap here the only project the only
prints to process that has shared
responsibilities is the startup which is
shared with the directing and the
project manager so the board and the
project manager work together on that
all of the other processes are owned by
a responses responsibility lies with one
of the management levels so it's either
the delivering at the team lead or its
manager project manager or it's the
project board or its program level
so only startup process shares
responsibility across to the group how
are the seven themes applied absolutely
the board reviews the project manager
and the board reviews the business case
and it's updated if necessary actually
we're not verifying the outline business
case here we're actually sorry yes we do
we do if we're in the startup they would
verify and approve the outline business
case under the directing process making
sure that there is a business
justification you're right yes approving
the plans the overall project plan when
they're approving the initiation of a
project and approving the delivery of a
project and the stage plans themselves
yep creating the project product
description
would be planning and business case it
would be both of those yep
managing product delivery directing
doesn't get involved at the detail level
of that that's more the project manager
but they do if you're looking at it from
the perspective of they're overseeing
the delivery of the project product yes
quality team tolerances yes and also
because the quality criteria will be
defined in the product descriptions
yes benefits review plan would be the
business case it can also fall under
progress or sorry tolerances if in
managing by exception if the tolerances
for the benefits are also identified
which they should be in the benefits
review plan we're still missing at least
one I'm thinking - oh no I think it's
just one missing you did cover progress
the risk theme the risks within the risk
management strategy would be defined
planning could also cover off the
strategy and organization as well my
detailed roles and responsibilities will
be part of the pit which they are
approving yep ad hoc changes they be
approving any changes required to the
formal change review process so we've
covered the business case the
organization plans progress quality
risks and change we didn't cover
absolutely everything that's involved
about them but we did give examples of
each which management products are
produced right the project product
description others typically they
wouldn't be involved in the logs however
from the perspective of them approving
the strategy that will define how the
logs are maintained yes they would
approve that part of it could work
Christopher others they're approving the
project brief the stage plans the
project plans the exception plans so all
of those plans and and documents are
products issue reports exception reports
our pit is being reviewed by them
so for looking at be reviewed here so
basically they're approving and
reviewing just about everything except
the actual work packages all right let's
start the initiating a project process
gain same objectives as before state the
purpose and objective look at the
activities and then identify the
strategies for defining defined in the
initiating a project process so the
objective look yes I skipped one the
purpose is to establish a solid
foundation for the project enabling the
organization to understand the work that
needs to be done to deliver the
project's product before committing to a
significant spend so it's just upping
the game before we actually authorize
all the work we're making sure we've
done it it's detailed a review as we
need to to be confident that our plan
and our estimates are all accurate and
that the benefits can be achieved the
objective is to make sure that we have a
common understanding of the reasons that
we're undertaking the project so that
everybody is operating from the same
context ensuring that their scope of
work is well-defined and everyone
understands it that the cost and time
scales are established and agreed to
that we have the expected benefits or
understood by everyone that the issues
and risk and how we will manage them are
agreed to and outlined quality
expectations and management are have
been planned for and everyone is in
agreement that they're there good ie
everyone agrees that the quality
criteria and methods and resources and
all of those things that are described
in the product descriptions are accurate
it establishes the decision-making
authority so everyone knows who they
need to go to to get something approved
and what types of things need approval
that we've agreed on how we're going to
handle communications or the
distribution of information on the
project and that we know what the
monitoring and controlling project
progress is going to look like so how
often are highlight reports and
checkpoint reports being produced how
many stages are there - royal how I'm
going to involve my project board and
how often and at what points so those
are all the objectives so they take a
look at it from an overview as soon as
we have the authority to initiate sorry
once the the authority to initiate a
project has been received the project
manager can start to prepare the risk
management strategy the quality
management strategy and the
configuration management strategy
because our project brief has given us
enough information to do this we're
going to make sure that those strategies
address any corporate requirements so my
project management office has a
guideline on on how I'm supposed to
manage risk and the processes that I'm
to use those will be either referenced
or incorporated into my risk management
strategy and the same with quality and
configuration management the
configuration management strategy can
include more than one configuration
management tools so for example many
organizations have good configuration
management around their software items
and perhaps their hardware but not so
good on the documents side like the
project plans and like feasibility
studies or process maps or things like
that that might be produced throughout
the project so you would have to
identify all the methods you're using to
manage all of the product deliverable or
project deliverables once we know what
the risk management strategy the quality
management strategy and configuration
management strategy are we can then work
on the communication strategy because
there's going to be communications
related to each of these so I need
know those strategies to properly
prepare the communication strategy
having all my strategy set up I can now
set up the project controls so my risk
logs might certainly issue logs my
quality registers my configuration items
my product status account report can all
be established and I can create the
detailed project plan now the detailed
project plan is describing the stages
not the how the work gets assigned to
the individual teams right that's done
in the stage plan i refine the business
case so if doing all of this work
especially creating the plan has an
impact on the business case or if there
were assumptions or blank spots that we
had intended to look into during
initiation those would get filled in so
that we have a complete business case
when we're finished project project
initiation and then we pull all that
documentation together into the project
initiation documentation and prepares a
request to deliver the project and so
that's the initiating a project and we
just went through all these the many
components of the project initiation
documentation so when the stage boundary
is approaching ie I'm getting close to
the end of the initiating a project I'm
going to start my managing a stage
boundary process which means I'm looking
back at lessons learned and how this
went and I'm preparing the detailed
stage plan for the next stage
so that's initiating a project the
activities are as we saw on the diagram
preparing all the strategies
setting up the controls creating the
project plan refining the business case
and assembling the project initiation
documentation so let's take a look at
each of these in the risk management
strategy we're going to define the goals
of the risk management plan including
the risk management procedure so if
there's a specific form someone needs to
fill out when they say I get a fire risk
that would be identified
who's going to enter it into the risk
register how who's going to manage and
control that risk as it goes through its
lifecycle roles and responsibilities
related to risk management as I was just
outlined so who's the owner of the risk
who's the action e if the risk is
realized what are our risk tolerances
defining of any risk activities so how
often am I going to review my risk
register am I going to review my risk
register on a monthly basis a weekly
basis am I reviewing all my risks or am
I just reviewing the high impact high
probability risk so that would all get
defined in the strategy any tools or
technique so I'm using certain tools to
track risk maybe it's an Excel
spreadsheet or a Word document
or maybe I have a risk management
software package that I'm going to use
those would all be specified as well so
on and under here as well we could be
putting forms we would define what the
specific risk register would look like
and what the key components are that I
would be tracking they're all my
reporting requirements related to the
risk would be identified so if I have to
report weekly on a risk to my project
manager if I'm the risk owner then that
would be specified and how I would do
that
any questions in developing the
configuration management strategy we're
going to define the configuration
management procedure so basically it's
the same types of things we did in risk
only we're applying it configuration
management so we're looking at all the
procedures
how we're going to identify the items
how we're going to control them what
processes go through and there's an
update to them and we may have different
types of control for different types of
products so software might have one way
of being managed a document or a
feasibility study or a process map might
have a different one so we have to make
sure that we cover off all the items we
need to manage and have an appropriate
control for each one how we're going to
do status accounting and status
accounting is just letting us track and
take a snapshot of where are things at
at this particular point in time what is
the status of each of the deliverable is
it started has it been verified has it
been approved and signed off are their
outstanding change requests related to
it so it may be signed off but there's
change requests so there's still work to
be done on it our issue in change
control procedure falls under the
configuration management strategy now if
you want to produce it as a separate
document that's fine you've addressed it
it's been looked after but it is grouped
for the sake of explaining the prince2
it's grouped under configuration
management strategy the timing of the
configuration management activities and
the issue and change control activities
so for example if the if there's a
change advisory board it's going to have
to review all of the changes that are
submitted how often does that board meet
how quickly after receiving a change
request do I have to respond to the
person who initiated it or make a
decision on it any of those timeframes
would be be documented and of course any
roles or responsibilities so if I have a
change Authority what's their role
what's the board's role by default the
board has to approve all changes but if
they're delegating some of that down to
a change authority or to the project
manager that would get specified
and that may be a different change
authority is required depending on the
impact or severity of the change that
skips identified there as well so the
configuration management strategy just
let me quickly flip to that for you so
just summarize the configuration
management strategy just a little bit
more than we have here it's going to
answer questions like how and where are
the projects products being stored how
are we going to look after the security
of those products how are the versions
going to be tracked how are the changes
going to be controlled to each of those
products and a game that could differ
depending on the type of product and
where is the responsibility and yes
we've covered it out the only thing we
haven't covered is the scales for
priority and severity so if a change
request or an issue has a high impact
what does that mean so we would define
how we're categorizing them and we're
going to see a couple of those and some
of the other steps
the quality management strategy
describes the expectations and standards
to be followed and how we're going to
assess whether our products have met the
quality management strategy and the
quality criteria or not so as we're
evaluating whether the quality criteria
have been met for each product we're
making sure that the quality management
strategy has been implemented properly
so that would be a project assurance
type role to check and make sure that
that's happening so the strategy will
outline the procedure including any
quality planning control or assurance
activities that have to occur and I'm
assuming you guys understand the
difference between the planning control
and assurance this being more about the
actual setting up of processes this
being the how and when and scheduling
and this being the actual inspection
type how do I verify it and making sure
it's done roles and responsibilities as
identified for quality management and
the timing of the activities so am i
doing the quality management and
verification and quality control of a
product when it's completed or am i
waiting and doing them all at the end of
the stage typically you would do them as
they're completed but you'd make sure
that that specified any tools or
techniques that you're using so if
there's a quality review checklist for
example you would specify that and it
would be developed you might even have a
sample of it in the quality management
strategy if you're using an automated
test tool you would be defining that as
well and where it fits into the
procedures communication strategy which
is prepared after those three strategies
we just reviewed fibers off the
communication manage a procedure so for
example I used to work for a big steel
company on one of their projects I was a
change manager there and any
communications that went out whether
they were internal or external if they
were meant for a group of people as
opposed to an individual email had to be
approved by the corporate communications
department so that had to be worked into
our communication procedure for the
project no other project I worked on did
that I just had to get the project
managers or the project sponsors
Authority in that case
which would be the equate to the
executive under prince2 so whatever the
management procedure is who drafts it
where does it get stored once it's been
created is it going to be electronic is
it going to be a presentation face to
face our communications going to use a
website where people can blow their ask
questions or access all the project
documentation the timing of the
activities so am I going to send out an
update at the end of each stage to
stakeholders do what what are the
requirements for communication what are
they interested in would also get
covered off roles and responsibilities
for the communications who's producing
them who's planning who's approving and
the stakeholder analysis because without
stakeholder analysis I don't know what
they need to hear I don't know whether I
can send the same message to everyone or
whether I need to customize different
messages for different stakeholder
groups and then open up your mic Turin's
you can state your question to them not
clear I'm not sure I quite understand
okay okay go ahead yeah yeah can you do
me yes I can actually my question is
like we're following certain documents
and we're following some certain
procedures and is there any from quality
point of is there any check which make
sure that okay those processes followed
or not okay not there in the person yes
yes they are in there part of the
project assurance and the quality
assurance so the quality issue and they
would get addressed in in the quality
management strategy as well so a good
point so the project assurance which is
the board making sure that you're
following the processes and strategies
that they laid out and following the
plan that was approved so they might be
checking it themselves or they might
have somebody external to the project
perform that Quality Assurance or
project assurance for them so that could
be someone from a project management
office for example does that fully
answer your question yeah because I was
not able to understand it coming quality
management strategy or not yeah okay
thanks for asking
you're welcome okay so please look at
these strategies we're making sure that
everything is
developed and aligned to the corporate
and program management strategy so we're
making sure that the results are the
products of the product are going to
enable the organization to achieve its
objective and we're going to make sure
that any requirements related to quality
or related to risk management or related
to how we manage configuration items
would all be addressed so the strategies
are derived from the corporate and
program management strategy standards
and practices if they're applicable and
we have to have a pretty good reason for
not including them so we're not going to
follow them we'd have to provide the
justification for why we weren't and get
approval of course
the strategies are defined by the
project manager reviewed by project
assurance and then the project board can
approve the strategy it may also be
reviewed by quality assurance which is
external to the project the project
board and project deference are
considered to be internal to the project
because the project board is part of the
project team the project board approves
two strategies and then project support
once the strategies approved can create
the quality register the configuration
item registered records and the project
manager would then approve that they've
been properly set up so here's an
example of the pit' giving you a better
idea of what's include included in it so
in initiating the project one of the
activities is to assemble the last one
is to assemble the project initiation
documentation so I'm taking my project
brief and building on it which has my
project definition and approach I'm
preparing the detailed business case the
team structure the role description if
they hadn't already been done if these
had been done in project startup then
obviously I wouldn't need to do it but
they would still be included in the
documentation the quality management
configuration management and risk
management strategies and then the
communication strategy the project plan
project controls and any tailoring that
we did would be identified and again if
this had been already set up or
described in startup then
we would just simply include the
relevant documents okay let's start
controlling a stage so we're going to
state the purpose and objective and look
at the different activities related to
it the purpose is controlling a stage is
to assign the work to be done to monitor
the work deal with any issues and report
progress to the board if we find there
are problems controlling a stage also if
the mechanism we use to take corrective
action to ensure that the stage remains
within tolerance so if I as a project
manager can take corrective action to
bring the stage back into Tolerance I
don't necessarily need to report it up
is callate it up if I can't get it into
tolerance so that I can get advice and
assistance so if I find out that one of
my project teams is running late but I
have a resource that can help them out
and if I loan them to that team for a
week that will get things back on track
then I don't have to worry about it
yes addressing changes because they are
incorporated in issues in the in the
issues log for prince2 that they are
also addressed here that's correct good
point yes because if I you make any
changes I read a sign so the objective
is to ensure that the team including the
managers members and suppliers all know
what they're supposed to be doing to
make sure that their work is authorized
to ensure that the project manager is
getting accurate progress information on
a regular basis and that's done through
our checkpoint report and of course any
time it's necessary I could be providing
advice to my project team my team leads
or their team members I'm making sure
that the work allocated to the team is
formally agreed upon and authorized and
I do this through my work packages so
the lowest level of my product breakdown
structure has my work packages and I'm
going to use my controlling a stage to
interface with
the protein manager to assign the work
package if they need any clarification
or they have any concerns we discuss
them before they start working on it and
I can provide advice as a project
manager to them at that time we're
making sure by doing this by making sure
we walk through and get an agreement
with the team lead that they can produce
the deliverable or the product according
to the plan or we make the appropriate
adjustments so that they can we're
making sure that the team is clearly
aware of what the product is because I
have my product description the cost and
timeline efforts and estimates and the
tolerance is related to that particular
work package and product so we're making
sure all the communications are clear
understood and everybody's on the same
page before we start the work this of
course requires a signed off product
description which is sometimes a
challenge in our product project
environments they want us to start
working before we have those under
prince2 you should have a signed off
ie the user have signed off on the
product description before you start
working on it does everybody have that
happen in their work environment I'm
saying that somewhat tongue-in-cheek
because it's always a battle yeah most
of my most of the participants in my Pro
and the classes I teach tell me the same
thing and it's political not that you
don't want them it's not that you don't
press for them as a project manager it's
that our executive or a sponsor or
whoever we report to tells us to just go
ahead and not worry about it prince2
gives you some backing as to why you
need to have these things
VJ want to open the mic up and have you
explain how agile helps us with this
because I know the principles but I've
never I'm not really as familiar with
agile assemblies go ahead so so and one
what I meant was so we don't have the
product description really signed off
and for various reasons it could be
either they're pretty much not clear of
what exactly they want there might be
changes that will come their way
in in terms of the functionality there
could be priority changes that happens
and they want C to be completed much
before a is completed in the sequence of
ABC kind of so that is where agile is
helping us in terms of quickly existing
to the schedule and and I'm going back
to the MVP what we call in the agile
which is the most viable product that
they were fond and keep keep on adding
the additional features as and when the
heat asking is and and and and what
happens is the the Sprint's are the
delivery schedules that we timber leaky
as as small as two weeks and I'm
typically and and helps us to go back
and and great baseline half plan and
keep adding those features to the
backlog and in first place and then
change the priorities and priority of
the backlog in such a way that focus
moves on to item number three first that
is them item number one because we don't
have the complete details on item number
one which needs to be signed off by the
by the client or by the issuing
authority and so I think that's where
agile is helping is when compared to the
waterfall methodology because the
product if we are working on was
developed in the waterfall methodology
quite a long time back and in the
current scheme of things we are getting
enhancements to it in the a giant way or
re rewriting the product into a new
technology and a new base in that way of
following the Adelle and it's really
helping us to do things that somewhat
index to notice pronoun has a good point
here as well it does help you from that
perspective but prince2 still applies
and it's pronounced a we usually want to
get the sign-off on what we're doing in
that that sprint or in that two or
three-week period
so you're still it's almost like you're
getting that work package approved
as you go along you would still have
overall objectives and overall plans for
a specific window of what you're trying
to accomplish I understand correctly
you're never going to open your mic is
there anything you wanted to add to that
ah actually I did not introduce myself
in the first place I'm pronouncing a li
four years of experience as a business
analyst as a business analyst the
process in my company goes in such a way
that we initially get the requirements
if we don't freeze the requirements in
the initial stage and it keeps on going
it crosses a project budget so that is a
reason we usually get the shrine up in
the initial stage and then get the other
requirements as a feature enhancement so
that's how it goes on basically so we
want the customer to feel the product
first and then do their outputs at your
inputs so that we can go further and do
their enhancements yeah absolutely
and that's that's why under prince2
regardless of your methodology whether
you're using waterfall or agile you
still need a product description so it
may be a general description and then
you're tweaking the features that you're
including in it according to your sprint
so other words you can be treating it
like a work package as to specifically
what you're going to include in the next
version of it but you still should have
that approved what what your user is
expecting before you start the work for
that sprint so Vijay is that is that
what you're doing are you getting their
approval before the individual Sprint's
that you're doing this that's correct
and you Stella
you're still applying prince2 it's just
you're you you're overlaying injector
exactly exactly so I think I agree to
kind of point in terms of the future
enhancement but but what we generally
follow is is not the feature enhancement
but it basically gets added to my
backlog
and we keep working on it as we proceed
to make subsequent links so it gets
prioritized and when it gets on the top
of the list it gets dealt with yeah okay
absolutely and that all falls in a
general project product description and
it might still be broken down but the
details at that very detailed
requirement level or what's going to be
changing within those different sprints
correct perfect that most of the
subsequent sprints because of this I
know we don't have this and the reason
is the the the client is also very not
scared about what they would want or how
should it function yes sometimes we need
to work with it to really understand
what they need and that's business
analyst there's only so much you can ask
to clarify with them excellent
conversation and very helpful I think in
terms of helping identify how we could a
pride prince2 under both did you discuss
how technical stages overlap the
management stages in your previous
sessions because that was that
discussion was a perfect example of how
that works so you're in agile your
technical stages are quite short so you
might have several of them being
addressed in a management stage whereas
in waterfall you may have something like
the design technical stage being
stretched across multiple management
stages but you would at least define how
much of the design you expect to have
finished at the end of the stage yes
exactly sometimes they do evolve day to
day ok excellent so summarizing we've
got our controlling a stage where we are
looking at escalating issues reporting
doing our highlight report taking any
corrective actions authorizing work
packages reviewing the stage status
reviewing work packages on a regular
basis and primarily through our
checkpoint reports that we would be
receiving receiving the completed work
packages and capturing and examining
issues and risks so that we can report
on those of course central to all this
is reviewing the stage status to make
sure things are moving along and
identify if we have any exceptions that
need to be escalated up
so in the stage boundary approaches
we're going to do the managing a stage
boundary process where we do the review
of the past stage and the progress on it
and many lessons learned and incorporate
them into the next stage plan and if
we're in the final stage and the project
end is approaching instead of the stage
boundary we would do the closing project
so controlling a stage interfaces within
that way and the authority to do a work
package would be provide so we would
authorize it in controlling a stage but
the actual work is part of the managing
product delivery and once it's completed
we receive it okay thank you so much
everyone have a great weekend
