pmi-acp certified agile practitioner
from simply learned I've got over 30
years of project management experience
in the business sector the public sector
and as an entrepreneur more importantly
for you I along with my colleagues that
simply learned have decades of
experience in exam prep coaching and
I've been asked to share a few thoughts
about agile project management and the
best way to become a certified agile
practitioner there are two basic
approaches to project management
waterfall and agile at a high level here
the differences the waterfall approach
favors projects with clear requirements
and the creation of a master plan up
front and then measuring actual results
to the plan in order to determine the
health of the project the agile approach
focuses on projects that are more
complex with unclear or changing
requirements and delivering value to the
customer in frequent iterations while
there's a place for both waterfall and
agile project management approaches it's
worth noting that the pmi-acp
certification is PMI fastest-growing
certification
well there are other agile
certifications available they each focus
on a single agile methodology PMI tests
on the broader family of agile
methodologies including scrum XP lean
Kanban and crystal for example this
means the pmi-acp credential has broader
appeal furthermore it's not an entry
level or exam based only certification
rather it is a recognised way for a
project manager to demonstrate
experienced and professional versatility
you may also like to know that certified
agile practitioners earn more than their
uncertified colleagues often with annual
salaries of more than $100,000 here's
the real bottom line the main reason
project managers should care about
obtaining their PMI credential is
because employers care and the best way
to acquire your pmi-acp credential is a
simply learn that's why you're here
congratulations
we're glad you are so I welcome you to
learns pmi-acp exam prep workshop this
engagement module is the beginning of
the course and here are a few important
things for you to recognize this
workshop is fully aligned with p.m. eyes
new July 2015 syllabus
it covers agile concepts methodologies
tools and techniques extensively with
real-life scenarios plugged in
throughout the course the workshop
covers the seven domains in the same
sequence as specified in p.m. eyes exam
content outline they are agile
principles and mindset value driven
delivery stakeholder engagement team
performance adaptive planning problem
detection and resolution and continuous
improvement each domain is divided into
two lessons for your convenience there's
also an introductory lesson that covers
the details related to the application
process and the pmi-acp certification
exam itself the workshop also includes
coaching on how best to pass the exam
including some amazingly effective tips
tricks strategies and tools i love
project management I view it as the
science of getting things done and I
rather think everyone must like getting
stuff done learning and implementing
agile concepts tools and techniques is
one of the most exciting professional
endeavors you'll ever be a part of let's
look at a real world example that
demonstrates how agile adoption can lead
to effective scaling and faster delivery
the Information Systems department of
nutri Worldwide Inc has been following
the traditional waterfall approach for
its software development for many years
the department has an average of 25
active projects at any given point in
time but pressure for faster delivery
has been increasing from stakeholders
the organization decides to expand its
services and is expecting more than 50
projects in the near future the
management team of nutri Worldwide Inc
in the collaboration with the
Information Systems department decides
to implement agile methodologies to
increase the department's of the
they handle more projects wouldn't you
want to be a part of such an undertaking
it would be so exciting nutri worldwide
inks effort to take on more projects and
deliver value faster to its customers is
one of the real-life scenarios we follow
in the workshop will let you know the
outcome in the reinforcement module once
you've completed the workshop as we
explore and learn more about agile
you'll see why many market leading
companies like Amazon Verizon General
Motors and Nationwide Insurance have
implemented agile practices we'll review
the history of agile its founding
evolution and core concepts and
principles you'll find that fascinating
more importantly you're going to be
tested on that information we'll explore
the in-demand agile methodologies which
are covered in the certification exam
including scrum XP clear Kanban
test-driven development etc and there's
much much more as I mentioned earlier
we'll cover all of the information
necessary to pass the pmi-acp
certification exam and to provide
strategic coaching to assist even those
that hate testing and don't do well at
it it's such a fantastic feeling to pass
the exam we want you to experience that
feeling and I know if you work hard
follow our guidance you will pass the
exam are you ready
