hazard risk operational risk and
strategic risk then we will proceed to
learn about the measures models and
tools used in the erm framework finally

considerations in implementing erm
what is erm let us first understand the
concept of erm or enterprise risk
management traditionally each unit of
the vision of a firm managed its own
risk that is every department assessed
and controlled their individual risks in
their own way this had a serious
drawback in the sense that the firm
could not capture its overall risk this
also turned to be more expensive and
redundant for example the steps taken by
one unit might have reduced the risk for
other units as well hence the steps
taken by other units to reduce their
risk were actually redundant to overcome
such issues an integrated approach is
taken to manage risk on a firm-wide
basis the firm assesses and controls
risks from all possible directions and
makes decisions to minimize the overall
risk to the firm this type of risk
management is called enterprise risk
management this increases the value to
the stakeholders of the firm such as
shareholders management and customers
various risks addressed by erm hazard it
is important to list various types of
risks that are addressed by erm the
first type of risk is the hazard risk
