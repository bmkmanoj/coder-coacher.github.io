hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on Minitab this is the
third of the five sessions that one
needs to go through to complete the
Minitab training there are quizzes at
the end of every session and you are
strongly advised to answer them before
you move on to the next session the
third session takes you through the
interoperability of Minitab with other
applications like Microsoft Excel and
PowerPoint
agender let us now look at the agenda of
this session the whole session is
divided into three parts first starting
with Excel then moving the data onto
Minitab and finally presenting the
analysis on a PowerPoint presentation
Minitab interoperability let us now
consider an example of importing data
from Excel into Minitab and then
presenting the analysis on PowerPoint
presentation this requires three steps 1
start with Excel select the required
data to be imported to Minitab to move -
Minitab move the data to Minitab and
perform the required operations 3
presenting the result on PowerPoint
present the result obtained from the
analysis onto the presentation
starting with Excel firstly we need to
open Microsoft Excel then click on the
file menu and go to open command here we
need to search for the required file to
be opened for migrating data into
Minitab starting with Excel once we open
the required file the data present in it
will be loaded onto the excel sheet
starting with Excel once the required
file is opened copy the cells with the
data that you want to migrate to Minitab
to copy the data we need to select the
required cells first and press ctrl + C
or right-click and select copy from the
pop-up move to Minitab after we copy the
data from Excel we have to open Minitab
once Minitab is opened in the Minitab
data worksheet window select the columns
where the data has to be pasted move to
Minitab now we need to paste the data
into the selected columns in Minitab to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
