previous lesson we learned the basic
concept of the consumer theory that is
how preferences of consumers are defined
and how the preferences get converted
into demand functions the preference of

the graphic portrayal of utility
functions using indifference curves and
maps after that we studied how utility
derived from the budget changes in the
light of the changes in the income of
consumers and changes in the price of
goods we also define normal and inferior
Goods and how the demand functions is
different for them so we have studied
how individuals behave in an economy
