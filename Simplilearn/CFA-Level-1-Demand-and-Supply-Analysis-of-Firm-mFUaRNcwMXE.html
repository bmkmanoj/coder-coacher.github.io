welcome to the 16th lesson of the simply
learned cfa level 1 tutorial in the
previous lesson we learned the basic
concept of the consumer theory that is
how preferences of consumers are defined
and how the preferences get converted
into demand functions the preference of
a consumer or the satisfaction derived

the graphic portrayal of utility
functions using indifference curves and
maps after that we studied how utility
derived from the budget changes in the
light of the changes in the income of
consumers and changes in the price of
goods we also define normal and inferior
Goods and how the demand functions is
different for them so we have studied
how individuals behave in an economy

the firm's factors of production
calculates an interpret total average
marginal fixed and variable costs
describe breakeven and shutdown points

distinguish between short-run and
long-run profit maximization distinguish
among decreasing cost con</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
