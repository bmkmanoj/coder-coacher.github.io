standard providers that supply data from
sources such as the system registry the
built-in providers include the following
active directory provider this acts as a
gateway to all of the information stored
in the active directory service this
provider allows information from both
WMI and active directory to be accessed
using a single API windows installer
provider this allows a complete control
of Windows installer and installation of
software through WMI it also supplies
information about any application
installed with Windows installer
performance counter provider this
exposes the rule performance counter
information used to compute the
performance values shown in the system
monitor tool any performance counters
installed on a system will automatically
be visible through this provider
performance counter provider is
supported by Windows 2000 registry
provider this provider allows registry
keys to be created read and written WMI
events can be generated when specified
registry keys are modified SNMP provider
this acts as a gateway to the systems
and devices that use the simple network
management protocol SNMP for management
SNMP MIB object variables can be read
and written SNMP traps can be
automatically mapped to WMI event event
log provider this provides access to
data and event notifications from the
Windows 2000 event log win32 provider
this provides information about the
operating system computer system
peripheral devices file systems and
security information WTM provider this
supplies low-level driver information of
Windows driver modeled for either input
devices storage devices network
interfaces and communications ports view
provider this allows new aggregated
classes to be built up from existing
classes source classes can be filtered
for only the information of interest
information from multiple classes can be
combined into a single class and data
from multiple machines can be aggregated
into a single view the WMI technology
also provides support for third party
custom providers custom providers can be
used to service requests related to the
managed objects that are environment
specific providers typically use the MOF
language to define and create classes
providers used the WMI api to access the
CI m object manager repository and to
respond to see I M objects manager
requests initially made by applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
