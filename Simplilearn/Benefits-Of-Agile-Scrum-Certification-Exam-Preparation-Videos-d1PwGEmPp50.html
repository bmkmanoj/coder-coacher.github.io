10 advanced scrum concepts welcome to
the tenth lesson of simply learns agile
scrum training program in this lesson we
take a slightly offbeat critical look at
adaptation of scrum to different
situations scrum is a very simple and
lightweight methodology and
realistically it can be applied in any
situation however every situation has
its own unique challenges which may not
be addressed in the basic guideline
hence we talk about some best practices
about how to adapt scrum for large
projects or maintenance projects for
example these insights would be useful
to have a satisfactory experience of
using scrum let us begin with the agenda
of this lesson
agenda we will now look at the detailed
agenda for this lesson we start off by
looking at how scrum works in different
situations
large projects with large teams working
on multiple subsystems with complex
integrations and interfaces presents
some unique challenges this is a
challenging situation for any
methodology and so it will be from scrum
as well we shall talk about some of the
best practices that will help make this
easier we then talk about scrum in
maintenance projects we then look at how
to make scrum work in distributed teams
and we shall consider a few common
scenarios to make it real then we looked
at how scrum principles can be worked
into contracts and how scrum can work in
different contract types lastly we
talked about the challenge of
transitioning a team which is used to
and steeped in traditional methodologies
to scrum again we look at a few steps
and measures that can help make this
transition just a little bit smoother in
the next slide
we will understand about scrum on large
projects
scrum on large projects scrum guide
talks about small teams seven plus or
minus two members so how will it work on
large teams with team sizes running into
three digits at times how does one deal
with the multiple interfaces and
integrations across subsystems which are
working together to deliver complex
solutions let us try to address some of
these questions the first step is to try
and divide up the team into smaller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
