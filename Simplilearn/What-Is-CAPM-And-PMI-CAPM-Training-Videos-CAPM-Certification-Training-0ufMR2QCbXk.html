and welcome to simply learn introduction
to CAPM certification course this is the
first of the 12 lessons provided by
simply learn on CAPM exam preparation
this is the introductory lesson and it's
a must read for all the 11 remaining
lessons as well please make sure that
you have access to the other lessons to
fully comprehend the course
let us first set up the agenda of this
lesson as indicated in the previous
slide this is an introductory course and
it covers areas like what are see APM
and PMI these are terms you will
frequently encounter in your
conversation with certified project
managers or people preparing for this
exam once you are comfortable with what
CAPM and PMI is we will discuss the
syllabus of the CAPM examination next we
will discuss more about the CAPM exam
itself we will cover topics like how
many questions are there in the exam
what is the pass marks how many
questions are expected from which part
of the syllabus etc lastly we will
explain how the CAPM certification
course is structured going through this
part is a must before you start
accessing the remaining lessons of this
course
CAPM stands for certified associate in
project management it's the name of the
certificate awarded to anyone who scores
more than the required passing mark in
the CAPM exam so if you successfully
pass the CAPM exam you become certified
associate in project management ie CAPM
as evident by the name itself the
certificate is of interest to anyone
interested in project management as a
career let me tell you CAPM is most
recognized individual certification in
the area of project management it's
valued worldwide for many of the project
management jobs it's even a mandatory
qualification CAPM is not for project
managers from a specific domain a
project manager working in an industry
be it in manufacturing or retail or
defense or information technology can
write the CAPM exam and upon successful
completion can become a CAPM now let's
look at what is PMI PMI is
not-for-profit organization who conducts
a CAPM examination PMI stands for
project management institute PMI is
based in USA and it has local chapter
across the globe so if you are based in
Singapore you can look for PMI chapter
in Singapore such local chapters conduct
regular knowledge sharing and networking
session for people interested in project
management if you need more information
about the PMI you can check out their
website WWE got org a CAPM certificate
is valid for only five years post
completion of this five-year period you
need to either retake the exam to renew
your CAPM certification or you can go
for PMP certification
PMP stands for project management
professional and this certification exam
is also conducted by PMI PMI measures
project management experience in units
of PD you PDU means professional
development unit so if you attend a
project management class of one hour by
an expert its equivalent to say one PD
you if you write a white paper on
project management related topic it may
be equivalent to five PDU PMI has
detailed guideline on what kind of
project management activity amounts to
how many PD use you can check their
website for more details
finally let's look at what is PMBOK
PMBOK means project management body of
knowledge it's a book that PMI releases
every four years the latest version of
the PMBOK is version four and it was
released in June 2009 PMBOK acts as a
textbook for the CAPM exam you can also
think of PMBOK as standard for project
management profession well can anyone
take up the CAPM examination yes
provided one meets certain prerequisite
the prerequisite depends upon person's
formal education as shown in the table
you must have a high school diploma all
its global equivalent to appear in the
exam in addition to this diploma you
should either have 1500 hours
professional experience on a project
team or 23 hours of formal education on
project management this is also called
23 PMI contact hours
there are many project management
training companies who are PMI re P now
what is re P simply learn is a global re
P of PMI PMI re P Training Institute
means these training companies are
registered with PA
my as registered education provider if
you attend their training or go through
their elearning they give you a
certificate for 23 PMI contact hours you
can use their certificate and your high
school degree to apply for the CAPM exam
let me also inform you that one has to
submit proof of everything I eat your
educational degree your project
management experience etc to PMI while
submitting the online application for
taking up the exam PMI randomly ordered
such submission from time to time so if
you do not meet the prerequisite and
still go ahead and submit the online
exam application there are chances of
you getting caught PMI disqualifies such
application also once your online
application for taking up the exam gets
approved PMI sends an authorization
letter you must write the exam within a
year of getting the authorization letter
now let me tell you more about the CAPM
exam it's a three hour exam consisting
of 150 questions out of this 150 15
questions are not scored but beware you
will not know which these 15 questions
are so you should answer all 150
questions with the same seriousness PMI
includes these questions to see how many
test takers are getting them right based
on this they might decide to include
these questions in future exam it's like
a survey conducted by PMI the pass marks
for the exam is 88 out of 135 which
roughly translates to 66% now you must
be guessing that CAPM exam is not that
easy you were right taking CAPM exam
does require certain seriousness in
preparation next I have shown in the
table on how many questions appear from
which part of the syllabus basically
PMBOK has 12 chapters
and you get a certain number of
questions from each of these chapters
the table shows a name of the chapter
and percentage of questions from each of
these 12 chapters please make a note
that percentage is calculated with 135
questions as base and not 150 questions
because 15 questions are dummy and not
counted getting confused with so many
new terms hold on for a moment
you will learn them in the next slide
there are three terms that I would like
to introduce here first let's see what
process group is the whole project
management discipline is divided into
five broad process group they are
project initiation project planning
project execution project monitoring and
control and project closing you probably
might be aware of them as well when a
new project starts it is in the project
initiation phase from initiation it
moves to planning then to execution and
monitoring and control and finally it's
closed project execution and project
monitoring and control processes go
hand-in-hand so when a new project is
started ie initiated all processes of
the project initiation process group
should be applied to the project
similarly when the project is being
closed all processes of project closing
group should be applied let me give you
more specific example identify risks is
a process of project planning group so
when the project is in planning phase
you must identify all the risks of the
project next let's see what a knowledge
area is as per PMP okay there are nine
knowledge areas for example human
resource management is one of the
knowledge areas knowledge area is a set
of specific processes required to be
performed to meet a project objective
a knowledge area may have some processes
to be done in project planning process
group and some other processes to be
done in the project monitoring and
control process group for example if you
take human resource management knowledge
area develop human resource plan is
processes in project planning group and
another process manage project team is
in project execution group lastly there
are 40 to process areas we have already
come across two such process areas
develop human resource plan and manage
project team if you are totally confused
by now don't worry this is the whole
exam syllabus and there is one lesson
dedicated to each of these topics for
now just remember that there are five
process groups nine knowledge areas and
42 project management processes
let me give you an overview of all the
lessons of this tutorial in all we have
12 lessons the current is the first
lesson which is an introduction to the
CAPM certification lesson 2 which is
named as project management framework
aims to explain what project and project
management is all about it also explains
some related terms like program
management project management office etc
so lesson 2 can be considered as an
introduction to the project management
next lesson 3 aims to explain the five
project management process groups that
we discuss some time back just to recap
these process groups are initiation
planning executing monitoring and
control and closing from lesson four
till lesson 12 the nine project
management knowledge areas are explained
one lesson dedicated to each of these
nine areas we have explained few tips
and tricks for the PMP exam on our blog
we suggest you go through it once it
might be of great help along with the
tips and tricks we have also listed what
is called PMI ism now what is PMI ism
well PMI has a certain way of thinking
and PMI ism is a compilation of the same
you might not agree to all of that but
you must know this to pass the PMP exam
let's quickly take a look at a PMI ISM
example you must be using the word task
in your day-to-day project execution to
mean a project related work but Pierre
mine never uses this term instead they
use the word activity and work packages
this is PMI ISM there are many such
things that we discussed on our blog at
this point I would also like to add that
at the end of each of these lessons we
have a quiz we strongly support you to
take up the quiz
and also and also look at the
explanation of all the questions those
which you got right as well as those
that you got wrong this would help you
get a better grasp over the subject once
you are through with these entire 12
lessons you can go ahead and start
taking our online practice test
you
this marks the end of our lesson one
let's do a quick recap of what we learnt
so far in this lesson we learnt about
what is PMI and CAPM we also got some
information about the CAPM exam format
itself and looked at the prerequisite of
taking up the CAPM exam
finally we covered the syllabus of the
CAPM examination wherein we explain the
five process groups the nine knowledge
areas and the 42 project management
processes before marking the end of
lesson one we also saw how the whole
