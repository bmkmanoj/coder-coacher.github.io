and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
advanced OSPF this lesson focuses on
wide area networks LANs let us begin
with the objectives of this lesson in
the next slide by the end of this lesson
you will be able to explain the concept
of when lists the different LCP options
explain the frame relay architecture
configure frame relay explained
different types of VPNs let us start our
discussion of winds wide area network
when communication occurs at layers 1 &amp;amp;
2 there are three methods to connect
non-local networks the first is a
dedicated line using synchronous serial
communications it is the most expensive
option and is usually leased by
organizations the second method for when
communication is switched line this is
broken down into two categories circuit
switched and packet switched circuit
switched options include modems or ISDN
among the packet switched options are
ATM or frame relay the third method for
Wang communications is using the
Internet let us look at a point-to-point
leased line and how it works a channel
service unit data service unit csu/dsu
is connected to the local router serial
interface this is a data communication
equipment dze
device used to convert the data from the
local router into a form acceptable to
the one service provider and vice versa
it provides clocking for the serial
connection the csu/dsu is the d mark the
point in the organization's Network
where responsibility passes to the
service provider all other networking
equipment are considered customer
premises equipment CPE and is the
responsibility of the customer alone in
a lab environment a way in connection
be simulated in the next slide let us
discuss digital subscriber line serial
encapsulation is similar to the
encapsulation used in the OSI model as
data is sent to a higher layer a header
and sometimes a trailer is added to the
data let us look at pppoe as an example
the PPP frames are encapsulated within
an Ethernet layer 2 header and trailer
this allows the PPP frame to be sent
over an Ethernet network normally PPP is
used with serial interfaces pppoe
provides the capability of passing PPP
data over a LAN to check the
encapsulation on an interface use the
show interfaces command let us now
discuss the high level data link control
encapsulation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
