common probability distributions volume
one study session three reading line
quantitative methods review hallowed
candidate welcome to the ninth lesson of
the simply learn cfa level one tutorial
this is the first lesson of study
session three of the cfa level one
curriculum to know more about the
curriculum refer to lesson number one of
the cfa level one tutorial let us
quickly recall what we learned in the
previous lesson in the lesson eight we
learned the concept of probability as
well as some properties of probability
we learned about conditional and
unconditional probability we calculated
expected value variance and standard
deviation using some practical examples
after covering all of the concepts we
learn to calculate the expected return
and risk of the portfolio we learned the
concept of covariance and correlation
and how covariance of stocks affects the
risk of the portfolio the concepts of
expected value variance and standard
deviation will be used often in this
lesson you are expected to remember
those concepts let us now start this
lesson agenda today we will discuss the
topic of common probability
distributions this includes the
examination of patterns of differently
scattered random variables in this
lesson we will study the techniques of
analysis used for different types of
probability distributions of discrete
random variables and continuous random
variables different analysis patterns
have been developed in order to study
the patterns of the distribution of
discrete and continuous random variables
the discrete uniform distribution and
binomial distribution are the
probability distributions under discrete
random variables and continuous uniform
distribution the normal distribution and
log normal distribution involve analysis
under continuous random variables we
will study these distributions in detail
lastly we will learn
at Monte Carlo simulation a
computer-based technique to evaluate
patterns this technique is mainly used
to evaluate risk in investment decisions
as per the learning outcome statement
after this lesson the candidate should
be able to define a probability
distribution and distinguish between
discrete and continuous random variables
and their probability functions
described the set of possible outcomes
of a specified discrete random variable
interpret a cumulative distribution
function calculate and interpret
probabilities for a random variable
given its cumulative distribution
