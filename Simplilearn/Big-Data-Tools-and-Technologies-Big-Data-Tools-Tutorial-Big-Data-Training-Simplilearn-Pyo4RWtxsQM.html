large or complex set of data and it's so
large that it's difficult to process it
using traditional database and software
techniques every day we are creating
approximately 2.5 quintillion bytes of
data so where is this huge amount of
data getting generated from earlier we
had mobile phones with the functionality
of calling and text messages or clicking
some pictures maybe but with the new
technologies like smartphones we have a
lot of applications for music sports
social media like Facebook Twitter
Linkedin and many more also data is
getting generated when we shop online so
why does it need attention as the data
is growing companies are capturing the
data that streams into their businesses
they can apply analytics and get
significant value from it with better
speed and efficiency companies are
leveraging the benefits of big data by
analyzing the patterns and trends and
predicting something useful out of it
for example companies like Amazon and
Netflix use big data to improve customer
experience as we see here from the
statistics shown by 2020 1.7 megabytes
of data will be created every second for
each human this needs immediate
attention because this data can't be
just thrown away it's going to give
profit to the businesses big data
challenges big data is not just about
the volume of data it poses other
challenges as well like velocity and
variety as a volume 40 zettabytes of
data will be created by 2020 this huge
volume of data is either human generated
like from social media YouTube or candy
machine generated like through sensors
and personal health trackers and can
also be generated with organizations
like
card details commercial transactions and
medical records another challenge is
velocity the speed at which data is
coming into the system the data needs to
be processed with faster speed and then
there is variety of data data is not
only structured but unstructured and
semi-structured data like images videos
and tweets so how our enterprise is
using this big data today let us see Big
Data popular use cases Internet of
Things these are numerous ways in which
analytics can be applied to Internet of
Things
for example sensors are used to collect
data that can be analyzed to achieve
actionable insights tracking customer or
product movement etc many enterprises
are creating a dashboard application
that provides a 360-degree view of the
customers that pulls data from a variety
of sources analyzes it and presents it
to customer service so that allows them
to gather the rich insights about
businesses big data popular use cases
are related information security and
data where has optimisations big data
tools are being used to remove some of
the burdens from the data warehouses
even the healthcare industry is looking
for patterns and treatment that lead to
the best outcomes for patients the main
challenge of Big Data is storing and
processing the data at a specified time
span the traditional approach is not
efficient in doing that so Hadoop
technology and various big data tools
have emerged to solve the challenges
faced in the Big Data environment so
there are a lot of big data tools and
all of them help the user in some or
another way in saving time money and
uncovering business insights these can
be divided into the following categories
like data storage and management for
example the no sequel databases such as
MongoDB Cassandra neo
J and HBase are popular nice no sequel
databases the talent Hadoop Microsoft HD
inside and zookeeper are popular for
data storage and management tools next
broad category is data cleaning data
needs to be cleaned up and
well-structured examples of such tools
which help in defining and reshaping the
data into useable data sets are
Microsoft Excel and open refine data
mining is a process of discovery in
sites within a database some of the
popular tools used for data mining are
Terra data and rapid miner data
visualization tools are a useful way of
conveying and complex data insights in a
pictorial way that is easy to understand
for example tableau and IBM Watson
analytics and plotly are the common
tools for data reporting power bi tools
are used data ingestion is the process
of getting the data into Hadoop Ford
which can be done using scooped flume or
storm data analysis requires asking
questions and finding the answers and
data the popular tools used for data
analysis are hive Pig
MapReduce and spark data acquisition is
also used for acquiring the data for
which scoop flume or storm tools are
quite popular
the popular Big Data tools offer a lot
of advantages which can be summarized as
follows
they provide the analyst with advanced
analytics algorithm and models they help
the user to run on big data platforms
such as Hadoop or any high-performance
analytic systems they helps the user to
work not only with structured data but
unstructured and semi-structured data
coming from multiple sources and it's
quite easy to visualize the analysed
data in a form that helps in conveying
the complex data insights in a pictorial
way which is easy to understand by users
big data tools help you to integrate
with other technologies very easily
