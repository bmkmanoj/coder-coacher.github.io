way to track the project progress
against the project plan it is a method
of measuring the project performance
objectively and comparing it against the
project baseline results from an earned
value analysis indicate deviation of the
project from cost and schedule baselines
baseline is the initial approved value
along with approved changes therefore
scheduled baseline is the first approved
project schedule along with approved
changes there are various terms used in
earned value technique planned value is
the authorized budget assigned to the
scheduled work earned value is the work
performed in terms of budget authorized
for that work actual cost is the cost
incurred and work performed budgeted
completion is the budgeted amount for
the total work estimate at completion is
the expected total cost for the project
estimate to complete is the expected
cost to finish all the remaining project
work variance at completion is the
projected budget surplus or deficit at
the end of the project all the
parameters displayed on the screen are
measured in terms of cost you may come
across business scenario based questions
on earned value management in the PMP
exam so ensure that you develop a clear
understanding of this topic let us look
at an example of a planned value in the
next screen planned value is the
estimated value of the work planned this
value is measured in terms of currency
say dollar if the plan value is $340
then the work planned is worth $340 how
do you calculate earned value the
solution is add the budget allocated to
each of the activities that have been
completed at the point of time the
resulting value is the earned value in
the next screen let us look at the
formula used to calculate earned value
in cost there
negative means the project is over
budget positive means the project is
under budget
similarly in schedule variants negative
means the project is behind schedule
whereas positive means the project is
ahead of schedule the value of the next
two parameters cost Performance Index
CPI and schedule Performance Index SPI
values vary between 0 and 1 for example
a CPI of 0.8 implies that 80 cents of
work is obtained for every dollar spent
in the project
similarly if SPI is 0.9 it implies that
project is progressing at only 90
percent of the speed originally planned
the next parameter is estimate at
completion or ei see there are different
ways of calculating the e AC value the
method used depends on how the cost and
schedule variances are expected to play
for the rest of the project BAC by CPI
is used if you expect that the current
cost performance will continue until the
end of the project AC plus BAC - Evi is
used if you expect that the rest of the
project will be managed at the budgeted
rate AC + BAC - Evi by the product of
CPI and SBI is used if you want to
factor in the impact of the cost as well
as scheduled variances AC + e TC is used
if you want to re-evaluate the project
based on a forecast value for the
estimated cost of the remainder of the
project the next parameter is estimate
to complete or etc' which is the cost of
project from this point to the end this
is calculated by subtracting the actual
cost from the estimate and completion in
addition variance at completion can be
calculated by subtracting the estimate
at completion from the budget at
completion variance at completion is the
cost estimation whether it is over or
under budget
another parameter is the to complete
performance index or TC
P I this is the cost performance needed
to achieve a desired outcome for example
if the project needs to be managed to
the original budget BAC then T CPI that
is the CPI that must be maintained for
the rest of the project is calculated as
BAC minus CV by BAC minus AC similarly
if it has to be managed within a revised
target say EAC then T CPI is calculated
as BAC - Evi by EAC - AC before the
start of the PMP exam please make a note
of the formulas of earned value
technique in the next screen let us look
into a business scenario to understand
this concept better after reading the
problem statement click the solution
button to look at a possible answer let
us take the example of a software
development project there are four
phases and each phase takes a month to
complete and is expected to cost $10,000
the phases are planned to be completed
one after the other the status of the
project at the end of the month 3 is
summarized in the table requirements
definition is completed and actual
spending on this is $10,000 architecture
and design is done and actual spending
on this is $12,000 development and unit
testing is only 50% done though it was
supposed to be completed by third month
it has cost $9,000 until date system
testing and go live has not yet started
note s indicates start time F indicates
finish time and PF indicates that it is
partly finished at the end of the month
based on the above information calculate
the CV SV CPI and SPI of the project let
us look at a solution in the next screen
before we end this lesson let us also
look at a few definitions that might be
useful for your PMP examination law of
diminishing return this means the more
you put into something
unless you get out of it for example
doubling the number of resources working
on a project will not necessarily have
the time working capital the amount of
money the company has to invest on the
project and the day to day company
operations funding limit reconciliation
the process of comparing the planned
expenditure in a given period with the
available funding for that period large
assets purchased by the company lose
value over time this is called
depreciation there are two forms of
depreciation straight-line and
accelerated same amount of depreciation
is taken every year for instance a car
with a price tag of ten thousand dollars
and useful life of ten years is
depreciated $1,000 per year at the end
of the tenth year the value of the car
is considered 0 for all accounting
purposes accelerated depreciation
depreciates faster than the
straight-line depreciation for instance
a car with a price tag of $10,000
depreciates three thousand dollars the
first year one thousand five hundred the
next year one thousand the third year
