isn't coming up on the exam much at the
moment but it will do in the future so
it's good to have an overview of what it
does
so AWS lambda lets you run code without
provisioning or managing servers so you
only pay for the compute time that you
consume and there's no charge when your
code isn't running so the best way to
explain it would be rather than having
an ec2 instance that you have sat around
that occasionally runs some code AWS
lambda just runs the code and AWS
manages everything else for you so how
this works would be firstly you upload
your code to AWS lambda and then you set
up your code to trigger from other AWS
services or endpoints so it may be that
a file arrives in an s3 bucket which
triggers lambda to do something when the
trigger happens lambda runs your code
using only the compute resources needed
and then it will shut down again
straight away so you're paying just for
the compute time you use there are some
huge benefits to using AWS lambda
firstly there's no servers to manage AWS
lambda automatically runs your code
without requiring you to provision or
manage servers you just write the code
and upload it lambda continuously scales
your application by running the code in
response to each trigger so if you have
hundreds of thousands of triggers lambda
will automatically scale precisely with
the size of your workload and also with
lambda you're only charged for every 100
milliseconds your code executes and the
number of times your code is triggered
and you pay nothing when the code isn't
running let's take a look at some case
studies to show you how lambdas used in
the real world the Seattle Times uses
AWS lambda to resize images for viewing
on different devices such as desktop
computers tablets and smartphones so
here is a diagram of their process so a
photograph is taken by a user and it
loaded to an s3 bucket as soon as it
hits the bucket Lander is triggered and
Lander runs an image resizing code to
generate web mobile and tablet sized
versions of the image AWS elastic
Beanstalk is an easy hue service for
deploying and scaling web applications
and services so if you have a web
application written in Microsoft net or
PHP or Java you can just upload it to
elastic Beanstalk and it will handle
everything else for you so it's kind of
like lambda but this is specifically for
web applications here are some of the
benefits of elastic Beanstalk it's the
fastest and simplest way to deploy your
application on AWS within minutes your
application will be ready to use about
any infrastructure or resource
configuration work on your part to do
the same with ec2 you'd manually have to
launch the ec2 instances yourself and
install the code on that it increases
your developer productivity because
elastic Beanstalk provisions and
operates the infrastructure and manages
the application stack for you so you
don't have to spend the time developing
the expertise to do this it will also
keep the underlying platform up to date
with the latest patches and updates
actually Beanstalk automatically scales
your application up and down based on
your applications need using easily
adjustable auto scaling settings so it's
impossible to outgrow and it gives you
complete resource control you can choose
the type of instances that it's going to
be running on that are optimal for your
application the AWS command-line
interface is a unified tool to manage
your AWS services with just one tool to
download and configure you can control
multiple AWS services from the command
line
and automate them through scripts so you
can access ec2 s3 ELB and tons more
things from the command line rather than
having to go through the AWS management
console Amazon command line interface
can be installed on Windows using an msi
or a linux and unix with tip or the
bundled installer the amazon linux ami
which we mentioned earlier is
pre-installed
with AWS CLI so it's used to perform
multiple tasks and some examples of this
would be you could use it to copy files
to s3 you could use it to restart ec2
instances so you could write a script to
stop and start your instances configure
cloud watch alarms or for just getting
information about your AWS resources now
if you just wanted to get some
information about your running instances
there's an alternative to AWS CLI final
running instances you can obtain
instance metadata and user data using a
specific URL and here's the URL and it's
169.254 that 169.254 and that's worth
remembering because that probably will
come up in your exam I know it came up
in mind and in a demonstration I'll show
you how you can use this in this
demonstration we're going to have a
quick overview of the AWS command-line
interface and how it works
so I've just launched a new Amazon
instance using our web server AMI and
I'm just going to show you the command
line interface so this is an Amazon
Linux instance and that has the command
line interface pre-installed now it's
very easy to install on Windows it's
just an msi that you double-click and on
other than that's all UNIX instances you
just install it by a pip but we have it
already here so how to use it so AWS
space help will give you a description
of how it works and this is quite a
powerful tool that can do pretty much
most of the things you can do through
the web console there's a whole list of
services that are available and commands
you can run now what I'm going to do is
give you a demonstration of how to use
it with Amazon s3 so this is a nice
feeder into the next lesson that we're
going to be looking at so s3 is a
storage service so through the command
line if you wanted you can create your
own Amazon buckets so we would type AWS
s3 and we want to make a new bucket so
we're going to make a new Amazon s3
bucket which is where we store our files
so we do make bucket s3 and then we give
it a bucket name and the bucket name has
to be unique as you'll learn later so
let's call this since we learned demo
test
now let's created a bucket for us where
we can store files so why would we do
this well we could move files in there
from our web servers so I'm in the HTML
folder and there's our health check file
so I could upload that file for
safekeeping to the Amazon s3 bucket so
to do that I would do AWS s3 copy the
name of the file I want to copy and the
location where I want to put it so I can
move it into the rs3 simply then demo
test bucket
hit return okay so that's uploaded so
now if I wanted to check what within
their AWS s3 so you see that's the
format says AWS in the name of the
service you want to use list and then
the name of the bucket I want to have a
look in and their assets telling me that
my health check file is in there so
that's what you can use the command line
interface for so we could use this in
our bootstrapping scripts for instance
when we start up an instance we might
want to copy in some files and some
configuration values to a newly launched
server so we could say copy the contents
of the simply learn demo test bucket
onto the web server so another
demonstration is something you could do
we could create a security group from
the command line so using the ec2
service we can do create security group
then we give it a group name which we're
going to call it until then demo S key
give it a description demo SG test and
then we need to give it the VPC ID it's
going to reside in so we want to put it
in our Amazon V PC or custom V PC and
the ID for that is this and we also want
to give it a region so we want to put it
in us keys one okay so it's created a
security group for us so if we go back
to the AWS management console we should
be able to see that in our list of
security groups and there it is
so we can see it there so you can create
security groups from the command line as
well
and then the other thing we talked about
in this section on CLI was other ways to
get metadata from your instance and that
was using this URL so if we run the curl
command with the URL it can show you a
list of things you can look at so for
example if we wanted to see the ami ID
for this instance it tells us that's our
I am i ID
and if we go and double-check that with
the AWS management console
here you can see here's a list about my
am is and that the ami ID is the same so
you can get information about your
instance using that command other things
we could look at would be the hostname
for example if you wanted to get that
and it tells you your hostname there so
you can use these commands to get stuff
for your scripts or monitoring so you
don't have to have manual intervention
to get the details or keep going back to
your Amazon management console
