Service Management but left to
themselves process cannot do anything
you need people to carry out these
processes that's where the function
comes into the picture an ITIL
terminology functions provides the teams
and the tools to carry out one or more
processes of activities functions are
units of organization specialized to
perform certain types of work and
responsible for specific outcomes for
example you work in an organization and
suddenly you find that your laptop is
not working you report this issue to a
team of people who are responsible for
fixing such problems they come and they
fix your laptop problem now this team of
people is providing the function of
technical support team ITIL version 3
defines various functions we will learn
about them as we progress in this lesson
for example one such function is Service
Desk which acts as first points of
contact for any issue so suppose within
your organization if there is a number
that you can call and report the problem
and only when you report the problem
over the phone the technical support
team comes and fixes the problem the
team that is handling the phone is
called Service Desk similarly there is a
function called infrastructure
management that cares of managing all
the servers networks and so on in an
organization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
