six scrum best practices
welcome to lesson six or simply learns
agile scrum training program till now we
have covered pretty much everything that
is mentioned in the original scrum guide
as scrum practices in this lesson we
shall extend the basic theory to some
common best practices that are helpful
in making scrum projects successful some
of these practices are drawn from other
agile methodologies like extreme
programming and some others based on
common sense and might be useful
irrespective of which methodology you
choose to use we will look into the
agenda in the next line
agenda let us now look at the detailed
agenda for this chapter we start off by
looking at the practice of continuous
refactoring which is one of the XP
practices then we talk about pairing
programming and continuous integration
which are also XP practices but useful
regardless of which methodology you use
in this context we shall also touch upon
the importance of configuration
management then we look at a jaltest
again some practices around testing that
will help make scrum successful this
leads into the topic of test-driven
development which is a worthy goal to
have from a testing and quality
perspective we round up by explaining
done criteria which is a simple
checklist but very powerful in enforcing
some basic rules within the scrum team
now we will proceed to the next slide to
start with the refactoring refactoring
refactoring is basically a code cleanup
activity it changes code without
changing the core logic or the
interfaces inputs or outputs the purpose
of such activity could be any of the
following improve readability of the
code optimize the processing logic
improve maintainability for example by
modularizing improving performance
complying with the design best practices
refactoring is a good practice
regardless of agile scrum or not it is
especially important in agile though
because the code gets built
incrementally over a period of time and
we need to make sure that this does not
end up compromising quality it also
helps to ensure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
