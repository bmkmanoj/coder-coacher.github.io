1 for the installation let us understand
the 12 step process that is required to
successfully setup Hadoop in the Ubuntu
server 12.04 LTS first you need to
install the SSH server the second step
is to create a password list login in
SSH the third step is to install Java 6
or a newer version this is because
Hadoop framework requires Java 6 or a
newer version of Java to perform its
tasks the fourth step is to download and
install Hadoop the fifth step is to
extract the Hadoop tar file the sixth
step is to copy the tar file to the
location mentioned on the screen the
seventh step is to open and set the dot
bash RC file and add the required paths
the eighth step is to open and set the
Hadoop - env SH script the ninth step is
to open and set the core - site dot XML
file the tenth step is to open and set
the map read - site not XML file the
eleventh step is to create a folder
named TMP and provide access rights to
the user by changing the ownership of
the same the last step is to start
Hadoop services starting from the next
screen we will discuss the commands that
are used to perform these steps to
install Hadoop you need to have a vm
installed with the ubuntu server twelve
point oh four LTS operating system you
also need high speed internet access to
update the operating system and download
the Hadoop files to the machine in the
next screen we will discuss the steps to
install Hadoop
as mentioned earlier the first step of
Hadoop installation is to install the
SSH server the installation is done via
the internet so ensured that the VM is
connected to the Internet
from this step till the end of the
installation to install the SSH server
type the command displayed on the screen
and press ENTER in the next screen we
will focus on the second step of Hadoop
installation Hadoop services generally
require admin privileges to run on a
Linux based system therefore you need to
set up a password list login that will
enable Hadoop services to run in an
admin mode to set up the password list
log in you need to initially create an
SSH key using the command displayed by
the first image once you enter this
command you will be asked some questions
you need to press Enter irrespective of
the type of question asked once this is
done an RSA key gets generated the next
step is to accept the RSA key as the
authorized key to do so use the command
displayed by the second image and press
Enter you will observe that the RSA key
generated is the authorized key in the
next screen we will focus on the third
step that is we will understand how to
install Java Hadoop requires Java 6 or
newer versions of Java in this step you
will learn to install Java 7 the command
to install Java 7 is given on the screen
this command requires you to have
internet access in the next screen we
will focus on how to download the Hadoop
package you will be able to download
Hadoop version 1.2 dot 1 from the URL
mentioned on the screen use the W get
command mentioned on the screen to
download the Hadoop package the download
process will start in the next screen we
will continue to discuss
doop installation once the tar file is
downloaded the files need to be
extracted from it this is done by using
the commands shown on the screen in the
next screen we will continue to discuss
Hadoop installation in this step the
extracted data is copied to the location
mentioned on the screen this can be done
by using the command displayed by the
image in the next screen we will learn
how to set dot bashrc by adding the
Hadoop paths use the command displayed
by the first image to open bashrc once
bashrc opens scroll down to the end of
the file and type two lines highlighted
in the second image next you should save
the file in the next screen we will
focus on how to refresh the bash prompt
once changes are performed in the bashrc
file the bash prompt has to be updated
use the command exec bash and press
ENTER to do this the bash prompt will
get updated automatically in the next
screen we will find out how to set up
the Hadoop environment the Hadoop
environment can be setup by opening
Hadoop - env SH which resides in the
directory mentioned on the screen the
command to open Hadoop - env SH is
displayed by the image in the next
screen we will focus on the command
lines to be modified in Hadoop - env SH
uncomment the Java underscore home line
and set the Java path in the next screen
we will focus on the next setting to be
performed in Hadoop - en VSH uncomment
the command line mentioned on the screen
and set it as shown in the image in the
next screen we will set the core - site
dot XML
open the core - site dot XML file in the
VI editor using the commands shown in
the image this XML file is used to set
the Hadoop distributed file system or
HDFS path in the Hadoop environment in
the next screen we will discuss how to
set the configuration in this file you
need to set the configuration as shown
on the screen the first parameter is FS
default dot name it is used to set the
access path for HDFS the second
parameter is Hadoop TMP dir which is
used to set the default TMP directory
where HDFS is installed in the next
screen we will focus on how to set map
read - site dot XML file open the map
read - site dot XML file using the
commands shown on the screen
this XML file is used to define the Map
Reduce settings in the Hadoop
environment in the next screen we will
discuss how to make changes in the XML
file this screen shows the settings that
need to be added to the hadoop
configuration the parameter map red dot
jobtracker signifies the location of the
job tracker in the Hadoop setup in the
next screen we will continue with Hadoop
installation the next step in Hadoop
installation is to create a temporary
directory named TMP this can be done by
using the commands shown in the first
image once the directory is created
permissions are assigned by changing the
ownership of the directory this can be
done by using the commands shown in the
second and third images where SL 0 0 0
is the username of Ubuntu server in the
next screen we will find out how to
verify the Hadoop framework by starting
Hadoop services initially you can view
the services that are running in Java
to do this use the command JPS that is
the Java process the command to start
all the services of Hadoop is start -
all dot Sh
this command will ensure that Hadoop
services start in the standard order
that is name node data node secondary
name node job tracker and task tracker
in the next screen we will discuss how
to find out whether the Hadoop services
are active type JPS and ensure that all
five services are running the five
services are named node data node
secondary name node job tracker and
tasktracker this setup is called pseudo
distributed mode as all the services are
running in different java virtual
machines or JVM but on the same machine
