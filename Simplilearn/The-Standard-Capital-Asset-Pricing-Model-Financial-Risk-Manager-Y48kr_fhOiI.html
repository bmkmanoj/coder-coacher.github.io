financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
standard capital asset pricing model we
have learned in the previous lectures
about the portfolio return and
volatilities and about investors choices
in holding efficient portfolios lying
along the efficient frontier in this
lecture we will learn about the market
at equilibrium that is we will derive
pricing models for asset under
equilibrium conditions in this lecture
standard capital asset pricing model is
discussed which will have a number of
assumptions under ideal conditions in
the next lecture we will see the effects
of removing these assumptions agenda in
the first model the markets will be
assumed to be frictionless with various
idealistic conditions we also plot the
capital market line based under these
assumptions in the next lecture we will
derive a model under more practical
scenarios we will begin by explaining
the assumptions underlying the standard
model we will then study about the risk
and its measures using beta finally we
will learn about the security market
line and how the price of acid changes
with respect to the market market
equilibrium let us first understand the
concept of market equilibrium at
equilibrium market conditions all
investors are assumed to hold efficient
portfolios lying along the efficient
frontier and have common return and risk
expectations in such a case when all
investors hold the same risky portfolio
it must be market portfolio in other
words and equilibrium investors hold the
market portfolio various models have
been developed to derive the price of
the asset at equilibrium the standard
form of capital asset pricing model CA
PM is based on the most idealistic
conditions let us now see those
underlying assumptions assumptions the
first assumption means that there is no
transaction cost or any cost of
purchasing or selling the security the
second assumption means that you can buy
or sell any asset in fractions also the
third assumption means that there are no
income taxes and hence there is no
difference in income from dividends or
capital gains or profit from increase in
the price of security the fourth
assumption means that single investors
cannot manipulate or affect the market
by buying or selling in huge amounts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
