learned today my name is Orion stallard
and one of the staff members here I also
am a data analyst and a project manager
and primarily financial services
currently I'm with with bank of america
in their corporate headquarters in the
Southeast United States Charlotte North
Carolina and we're going to be talking
about are the what I would argue is
probably the one of the top data science
language is that you'll be able to use
to get yourself launched into an
exciting &amp;amp; rewarding career in data
science and that would be the case at
whatever level it is that you you're
looking to aspire to whether you want go
purely the science if you want to use it
a business application if you want to
launch your own company any of those are
possible with with our programming and
so what we're going to do is I'm going
to give you a quick background and then
we're going to do a high-level overview
so that you can understand the basic
functionality and being prepared to
quickly use our for your own purposes
whatever those purposes are so to begin
the little background just to give you a
sense of where our came from this is a
programming language that launched in
1993 a couple of professors at the
University of Auckland built this for
originally for their students and
they've got such great feedback that
that they've decided to take it further
and make it into an open source
programming language which are continues
to be so open source means that unlike
some of the other languages out there
this is something that you can access
for free and with a resource such as
simply learn and some of the other free
online resources that I'm going to talk
to you about you'll be able to get all
of the information that you need for you
know very cost
costs uh you know inexpensive way let's
say so the beauty of our also is in my
opinion you don't need a degree in
computer science to understand you don't
need four years of programming to
understand you can by the end of this
lesson you'll be able to jump in with
both feet and and start doing things
writing basic programs in arm so with
that this is a brief again high-level
walkthrough and we're going to start
with a these are the things that you'll
you'll know by the time we're done here
just a few minutes the four types of
operators the different types of
conditional statements the loops that
are used in our commands that you can
use to run our scripts and commonly used
our functions are is what you would call
if you are a computer programming
background person if you've been when
working in Java or if you've been
working in Python or any of the other
languages out there c plus you probably
heard of what's called a caring complete
language which is a classic definition
of what a computer language is to be a
complete language and our meets that
definition and therefore a lot of the
things if you have background in
computer science will come very quickly
because they're things that you've seen
elsewhere so our has many operators that
you can use to do math and logical
operations and the overview of those are
arithmetic or mathematic operators
logical or boolean relational operators
and assignment operators and we'll we'll
take a quick look at all those things
but just know that let's say you wanted
to launch a business today and you've
just sent up your cloud service and
amazon web service and you're looking
for a language that you're going to be
able to quickly assimilate complex data
set are is going to be a fantastic
choice and that's why amazon has are as
part of its suite of products that you
can actually act
us in the cloud and scale up at whatever
level your business grows however
quickly your business grows so it's
pretty exciting thing that you can
couple together with other exciting
technology that's out there the
arithmetic operators are you know you've
done them since third grade these are
mathematical operators such as M plus
minus multiply divide multiplication of
course the asterisks and for exponent we
use the carrot that's very commonly used
throughout all walks of science a couple
things that you may not have seen are
for division with a remainder we use the
modulus which is two percentage sons and
for integer division we use the forward
slash with between the percentage signs
so if you're going to divide evenly with
simply integers you would use this if
you're going to divide and have a
remainder you use the g percentage
sponsor the comparisons in our
relational operators greater than less
than these are things that you should be
very familiar with a couple of
differences in our that are specific to
our our feet less than or equal to is a
less than son with an equal to following
it and the reverse of that for greater
than their equal to and more
specifically something that unique to
our is the equals is actually two equal
signs and not equal is the ! followed by
an equal sign so those are a couple of
things that would be worth keeping in
mind additional logical operators
logical not of course again is an
exclamation point also are as in other
languages Python believe element-wise is
how we you know the most basic data
point in our is an element it's referred
to as an element so a single character
or number
and when you want to use an illogical
and the ampersand would be used
individually to compare one element with
another if you're going to compare
larger sense as in vectors matrices and
so on which we'll get into it another
lesson then you would use two ampersands
and the same convention follows with the
or so and element wise is a single
person to ever since is comparing
vectors matrices arrays so on the same
thing would be the case for an or where
you have a pipe or also known as a
verdict bar for the element was or and
for set was you have two pipes
assignment what does that mean in our
instead of using an equals sign are uses
specifically a less than followed by a
dash to assign variables in you know
whether they be numeric character
factors what have you this is something
that's unique to our again n are
specifically you can use a lesson sign
followed by a dash to in this case
assigned the number eighteen to the
variable which we have called H so and
and we talk here about left and right
assignment technically you can reverse
this configuration and do the same thing
although this would be considered for
style by our style guides if you want to
know what is good for more good good
programming style in our and that's
something that's very important to you
and you'd like to know more about it
google has published a comprehensive
style guide which you can do a quick
google search and pull that up online as
we
all other programming languages are
supports conditional if and nested if
statements if-else allows you to test a
condition and execute a command or a
block of code if that conditioner is
true and of course execute an
alternative commander block of golden
code if that condition is false the
nested if allows us to string that
process so that you can have a range of
options if you're tempted condition is
false then it defaults to the next
condition so on so the conditional
statements in arm we're going to use a
quick example here and I'm going to put
this in a bigger context of your
business if you're again going into
amazon web service and you have the next
uber or the next Google and you're
scaling up and you're looking to
understand your client base for instance
you may want to go through and catalog
the ages and then do some analysis on
the ages of your your your core client
base in this case we're going to assign
the number 22 the age variable that
we're describing and then we're going to
use an if statement if statement says if
the age is greater than 18 that we're
going to print a major and for our
business model that we're launching you
can even insert paid a major payday if
age is greater than 18 else print liner
so in this case our is going to once i
execute the this assignment and then i
execute this if statement if i then type
the word age and run what will happen is
it's going to print major if i go back
and assign age 17 it's going to print
liner and that's the basic functionality
of the if-else statement in all
languages that's that's kind of how it
works and this gives you
the actual syntactical structure of how
this is going to look when you when you
execute a block of code in our simple
block of code the nested if does the
same thing it just gives you an
additional option and you can actually
string this and if together in really
probably as many of those as you want
although that's not something again
that's it buzzed in the style guide but
in this case X gets this is referred to
as gifts 0 if X is less than theory
you're going to say negative number else
x is greater than 0 you're going to
print a positive number else print 0 so
this is now giving you a range of three
choices depending upon the input that
you give are in this if nested if
statement and it's going to either print
negative number positive number or 0
depending upon the value that you come
back with here's another way that you
can use an if-else statement which is a
vectorized form in this case what we've
done is we've assigned this variable a a
combination of these numerics one two
three and four that's what the C says is
to combine these numbers 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 we
then use an if else and we divide a by 2
and this little command here says if a
divided by 2 is exactly equal to 0 then
you're going to print even L sprint odd
so here this when we when we run it it's
going to take 1/2 and calculate if it's
02 / to calculate and it's going to
print out these results so it's going to
print out odd even odd even basically is
what you're looking at and you can see
how if you take that and add that into
your toolbox of
of language programming that you that
you have available in our you're going
to quickly be able to use this in the
context of a business or a scientific
application that's of interest to you
another option that our gives you that
works kind of like an if statement very
similar is the switch function and we're
going to get more into functions here in
a few minutes but the switch function is
is a way to give you what we refer to as
a controlled branch of if-else
statements so in this case the switch
has the number 22 is a reference to the
position within the variables that you
have in the function so in this case we
would with the number two we would end
up printing fall in the second example
color equals green so anytime we have
green we are going to print the word
avocado conversely if we have the word
red will end up printing apple so again
this function switch function as a an
alternative if ELPS control branch
allows you to begin to have some
framework and to be able to program it
in a quickly program in a direction
that's of interest to you in the same
way our supports Luke in by the same way
I mean the same as you would expect in
any other language such as Python C Java
so on the loops are for loop while loop
and repeat loop and we've got three
basic examples of those here in this
case for the for loop what we've done is
we've assigned this variable feck the EC
gets one through five and you'll see in
a minute we can actually just take one
and then follow that by colon and the
number five that would shorten this up
but here we've expanded it out so that
it's very clear what we're doing
with the for loop command that we have
here for Val in back print Val what this
is going to do is it's going to it's
going to print out one two three four
five in other words those are the values
in the loop and when it's done the loop
is complete and it is finished executing
the while loop is the same as the for
loop but in in this case it's going to
print whatever numbers that are
encountered in the in the line while the
condition is true so while I is less
than six r is going to print the numbers
that it encounters in this case what
we've done is we've set it up that i
equals 1 and the while loop says that
while i is less than 6 print I i equals
I plus 1 so in the same way the for loop
executed this is going to print one
through five and then stop the repeat
loop requires that we insert this break
function or else it will continue to go
perpetually so in this case this works
the same as the while loop repeat print
X x equals x plus one so that's the same
as the I plus 1 and then if we did not
add in this little claws here it would
just continue to repeat so we have to
insert the brake function and that's
what this is describing inside the loop
the brake function stops the iteration
and it forces the flow to jump off of
the loop a next statement allows us to
skip a value so within a loop if there's
a value that you that you want the loop
to exclude or ignore then you can use
the next function so in this case 1
through 5 again four values in
number if it's equal to three next so
this is going to print 1245 in the loop
okay the scan function is one way that
you can access documents or scripts
which is what we call blocks coded are
and read that information into our for
data manipulation and we'll talk in
another lesson about the types of data
that are can read but quickly what we
need to understand here is that scan can
be used on for instance the file path in
this case is a web at URL it can be used
on any you know to be used as a file
path within your own directory your home
directory and scan is one way of reading
again data whether it be a script or
block of text or an Excel or a CSV I
tend to use read rather than scan and
that just seems to work for me best read
dot CSV and then followed by a
parenthesis and the file path works
equivalent you can also use the source
function which will allow you to you if
you put the the path inside the
parenthesis here that will allow you to
execute a script at the time that you
run this function so you can say source
put a file path in these parentheses and
a script will execute and here's an
example of how this covers reads if
you're really into running things in the
from a file from a command prompt then
our command batch may be a good option
for you you can pass command line
arguments to script you can get very
creative
with uh with bash scripting using the
the our command match function and these
are a bunch more functions just to give
you a taste and the nice thing is these
are not fake code items that you have to
go and reinvent they're already there
for you you just have to use the
built-in functions in are such as help
to understand how they work and what the
key parameters and variables are that
that are that are required for each
function to execute properly so I'll go
through a couple of them here we're not
going to go through all of them but
there's a couple of them that are nice
of length for instance will return the
length of an object so if you have a
variable or if you have a matrix then
you can put that information in the
parentheses length will will give you
the number of characters identical tests
whether two objects are equal that would
be nice for instance if you had two data
sets and they had varying weights for
instance weighted averages you could
potentially use this function to make a
comparison their list of objects that's
very similar to something that you would
use if you're into using command prompt
programming and append actually the
first one here append add elements to a
vector the vector which we talked about
again in another lesson is the most
basic data set in our it's a group of
same elements so for instance they're
all numbers or they're all factors IE
strings character strings and or logical
they're all logical they must be all of
the same data type
and it is a one dimensional data set so
if I had five of my best friends names
John Salley Joe bill George they I could
save as a element and then if I forgot
that I left you know chill out of that
set I can use the append function to add
chill to my vector quickly and cleanly
these are some other functions again
there is a ton of functions in our and I
would encourage you to get your feet
into our as quickly as you can and
experiment play with these functions the
quicker you do the quicker you come up
the speed with you know what they are
and how they work and there's a lot you
you'll be helped by using the help
function that's built into our to
quickly understand it so Q lower this
will take a whole string of characters
and put it at you know take it to
lowercase or uppercase grep as you I'm
sure are familiar with other languages
or may not be but um this allows us to
search for patterns and summary this is
great statistical function allows you to
get kind of course to school data and
pull it out of a data set and so on Oh
class this tells you the class of the
you of the or the type of of element
that you're looking at our object that
you're looking at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
