programming with java of the dupe
training offered by simply learn before
we move forward let us track down the
topics that we have dealt with in the
first six lessons we kick-started our
training session with introduction of
Hadoop as our first lesson while in the
second lesson we dealt about the Hadoop
architecture we discussed unix commands
in the third it was in the fourth lesson
that we tried to understand cygwin
commands in Hadoop with Hadoop
installations being covered in the fifth
we then moved on to understand how to
use Hadoop in lesson number six using a
dupe now in this lesson we will try to
understand the importance of Java in
Hadoop training so now let us begin our
discussion on lesson number seven
programming with java first let us have
a look at the agenda that will provide
us with a gist of topics that we will be
dealing with in this session
here we'll discuss about what is java
how to install eclipse the ide or
integrated development environment you
will see how to work with eclipse how to
develop standalone java program we will
also show how to debug a Java program
and how to do unit testing of a Java
program
Java is an object-oriented programming
language it is intended to let
developers write once and run anywhere
java application is typically compiled
to bytecode that can run on any java
virtual machine jvm regardless of any
computer architecture java was
originally developed by Sun Microsystems
now it is merged into oracle corp and
released in 1995 some basic features of
Java that make Java a powerful
programming language are portable
object-oriented robust and secure
dynamic and extensible code java
development kit jdk is the platform to
develop java programs as we have already
understood how to download install and
do the setup for java development
earlier during Hadoop installation we
are going to show the process of IDE or
integrated development environment setup
in the next slide we will try to
understand downloading and installation
of the clips before installing eclipse
juno let us understand what is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
