yeah that light should go
yes fine yeah thanks check shake I
remember somebody going on the mic and
saying check check DD challan draft and
a few other things so ranks so much that
for that enlightening session learned
quite a bit so even before I begin let
me introduce myself my name is John in
fact I don't know whether you got to
hear my full name you will never forgive
me for life you will never ask that
question what was his second name you
never asked that question so I grew up
with a lot of names some of the names
they call me when I was in school was
John square John ^ - King John the
second John the Baptist I heard a lot of
names but there was one question for
which I had no arms and that question
was John what would happen if you get
married and if you have a son what would
you call him would it be John cube John
^ 3 King John the 3rd what would that
name be so I said guys relax I'm still
only in school let me see if there's one
man in this world was willing to give
his daughter in marriage to me let me
see if that man and man and the woman
who I'm going to get married say yes and
let's see we had children and if you
have children if you have a son then
I'll let you know what the name would be
so as time went by one man decided to
give his daughter in marriage to me that
girl said yes in fact both of them are
regretting that decision no no no I
would that's cut that's not for the
camera cut it edit it and do something
about it
alright but we got married and we have
three children and the oldest is the son
so when I got the news from God's own
country that a son is born what do you
think was the question on my head what
would I call him so finally I
deliberated by then what to call him I
finally called him Jonathan so his name
is Jonathan John so I thought name part
was taken care of til the previous
company that I was working for I was
working for HCL Technologies for 6 and
1/2 years I had the opportunity to go
the United States and be responsible
training for that part of the world so I
took my family along with me sent
Jonathan to primary school he goes to
primary school comes back from school
all excited and says dad you know what
he said what you know what's my name I
said should be Jonathan he said no it's
John
I said say that again how did that
happen he said no no no the short form
of Jonathan is John and I said man I
took all the trouble in the name to give
you a name and I've come back to the
same problem because somebody calls us
on the phone and says can I speak to
John with John tall short dark answer by
the time you clarify those the other guy
is going bonkers so that's a little bit
of my son I have two daughters Rachel
and Suzanne I last lived in Bangalore so
my family's still there because they're
studying in classes that I can't really
shift them to a Bombay and I live in
Navi Mumbai very close to the office
that I work in console it so that's a
little bit of myself I've titled this
session we are unique and I want to talk
a little bit and I think it's going to
touch a lot of things that people before
me have spoken especially around it
touch a few on those and I'm going to
sort of reinforce eyes to the whole
thing and let me start off with
something which I think some of you may
have read or got to see the need for
significance the surplice society has a
surplus of similar companies employing
similar people with similar educational
backgrounds working in similar jobs
coming up with similar ideas producing
similar things with similar prizes in
similar quality are you here
alright I don't know whether you've read
a book and I recommend that you read
that book it's a fantastic book if
you're not ready it's called the blue
ocean strategy if you read the book you
know that there are two markets that
many people compete and fight one is the
red ocean the other is the blue ocean
most of us are fighting in the red ocean
that is somebody already there you are
also in there okay and you try eating
the pie what you and I need to do is to
get into the blue ocean when nobody is
there and create a market for yourself
and therefore if you really look at the
world around us they seem to be
everything similar to one another
I got an email from a gentleman from
reliance yesterday and it was a very
very strange email he said I'm working
in the site that you came and visited we
do a shift work and there are three of
us
same shift all of us do the same jobs
where is uniqueness and I thought that's
a very good question that the person
asked me how can I make myself unique is
a question that he had he has something
called an identity crisis because
everybody else is doing the same thing
so in a world where everything seems to
be similar where is this uniqueness so
we really look at the world around us
let's look at zebras for example y'all
know about zebras right what's what's
something that you know of zebras sorry
yeah the stripes are very unique to a
zebra you don't get the same pattern on
the next one right I don't need to tell
you about our thumb prints I don't need
to even tell us about ourselves you may
have siblings in your house you may have
three or four of them in the house but
one is certainly different from the
other sometimes back they were Iranian
twins I don't know what they've heard of
them two co-joined in the head
remember that's created a wave but they
wanted their head to be Civet and cut so
that they would die better as
individuals rather than be Co joined so
in a world where we're looking at all of
this I think that's very important for
us to understand that there is only one
John Cage on this world today I mean
there has never been one before there
will never be one after you might look
at me and say this guy's getting
arrogant no no this is factual there'll
be somebody will tell you I don't know
you'll probably have friends if you have
friends like this you'll probably need
to look at the person and and tell the
statement why do I need enemies when I
have friends like this and the statement
they'll tell you is John hey there are
seven guys who look like you have you
heard of the statement coming from some
of them right but let me tell you there
is just one John Cage on I don't know
your names what one person like you and
I'm sort of telling this statement
there's only one John Cage on with that
kind of authority you know why because
God never repeats mistakes there's one
guy and that's it it can't be another so
you got to look at yourself and tell
yourself there's nobody like me because
uniqueness is something I believe is
okay
to God we need to understand I know many
people many people who have such a
problem of accepting who they are that
they want to be like somebody else now
you may not be able to talk like me
that's alright but I'm sure I can't do
something that you do so beautifully and
we need to accept that that we're gifted
differently we created differently and
when we come together in a team and work
together in the team what I can do you
can do what you can do I can do and
that's how we fill the gap and that's
the beauty of working together so I
really look at it I mean the same thing
with leopard spots or cheetah spots you
really look at it it's just incredible
how they're so very unique the patterns
don't repeat and therefore no I believe
you're all unique and just to help us
understand this further I like my
favorite motivational speaker is the
gentleman who was in this world but he's
passed away his name is Zig Ziglar have
you heard of Zig Ziglar some of you
probably have heard of Zig Ziglar he was
America's finest motivational coach at
one point of time with a peak of his
Gary he was the greatest sales coach in
the United States I mean he is a
fantastic we haven't listened to him
pick up some of the CDs and read some of
his books he's just incredibly brilliant
he in fact said a couple of things which
I think I'd like to tell you right now
he said every third person in this world
is either extremely beautiful
wonderfully creative or or extremely
handsome every third person in this
world now look at the person to the left
of you go ahead just look at the person
to the left of you and tell it can't be
you just go ahead let me just tell them
I mean have the privilege in the
afternoon just to tell somebody that it
can't be you now look at the person to
the right of you and say it can't be you
either so who's left that's right is
this you you are the most beautiful the
most creative the most unique person on
God's earth and nobody can replace you
and we gotta understand this it's so
important for us to understand this
concept of uniqueness and I want to talk
a little bit of that as we move on
but let's look at how history has moved
and evolved in terms of understanding
people a lot of work has been done in
this area in the space the evolution of
what brings the best out of human beings
and I'm just going to take us through a
walkthrough in terms of timelines so
let's quickly look at this another book
that you may want to read is the
gentleman that I'm quoting right now
Howard Gardner fantastic man from Howard
unist University did a lot of study and
finally came up with this theory called
multiple intelligences he did so much
research in the space that even his
theory was not accepted very easily in
the United States let me just help help
us just understand this even today how
do you differentiate your son or
daughter in a particular class in terms
of their studies it will be primarily by
the marks that they actually get in a
particular subject right and invariably
you will probably look at the IQ of the
particular individual and IQ from X to Y
is what you compare right or it could be
a test or it could be some entrance exam
that the person did and the scores that
the person gets that's how we actually
look at how one is probably better than
the other if we really look at it it's
pretty unfortunate that we actually
restrict it to just Marx in a particular
subject because if I bring in the name
of Hussain Bolt what comes to your mind
yeah would you know his physics course
his math score you won't know that but
give him a track in a field event you
know he's gonna light that place or
think of a gentleman from this very land
such an Tendulkar you know what he's
best at or a Lata Mangeshkar or somebody
else now these people you and I have no
clue what their IQ is but they were
created to do something so beautiful
that when they actually start to sing or
to play or to run their intelligence
comes in so Howard Gardner basically
worked on this to find out that man and
women have multiple intelligence it
could be in the air of music it could be
in the sports it could be it could be
other areas logic mats but unfortunately
we only look at certain areas and that's
it some of you could be fantastic when
it comes to cooking and if you are
invite me home
I love to eat see well okay so you know
that holiday so some of you have a
gifting for that and look at today's
children what's their favorite channel
on television
MasterChef that's good and really I mean
really really take off you'll see many
young people getting into the field of
culinary or wanting to get into that
because that's what they love to do so
you can't say that just because you are
not as good as somebody else in Matt's
physical chemistry you probably are dumb
you can't say that so Howard Gardner
basically did this some time in the 1989
90s and he came up with this theory
called multiple intelligences going
forward there was another move that
happened initially in Europe and then
the wave caught in the United States and
that was by a gentleman called dr.
Daniel Goleman all of you probably have
heard of Daniel Goleman and his study in
terms of emotional intelligence what he
found out was that in his research he
found out that for you and me to be
successful IQ alone is not going to take
us to the top it has to be IQ plus EQ
where we have engagements we have
networking's we have partnerships we
have social interactions with people and
look at your lives in my lives in your
role as a manager or leader how much of
IQ do you use is compared to EQ right
you use your networking skills you use
your social skills to get things done
through other people and through your
team and that's how things get done yes
you need your SME you need your subject
matter expertise you need your IQ but
that's not it at all and therefore
Daniel Goleman even today the sweep is
so strong that we are still talking of
emotional intelligence is being a
differentiator today
that's Daniel Goleman and then after
some time what happened was another
gentleman by the name of Marcus
Buckingham this is another thing that
you probably can read it's a great book
strength finders 2.0 he came up with
this theory of something called strength
finders if you released by the book
strength finders some of the books you
also give you a free access to actually
get your questionnaire done which will
throw up your top five strengths as an
individual and his theory was very very
simple he went on to record to saying
that don't worry about your weakness
just focus on your strengths
don't worry about your weakness remember
when he was studying in school or
college we had five papers or six papers
to study you would obviously score well
in all five or six you probably do well
in five and that was a subject called
maths probably bring your score Stefan
all right or for some of you it could be
a language or English right
so Marcus bucking man basically goes on
to say that hey don't worry about that
English of the maths paper that's
pulling you down focus on the subject
that you're doing extremely well because
invariably your career progression will
be that area that you're doing extremely
well not that area that you're actually
doing badly look at your careers if
you're done well in school in a
particular subject that possibly is the
area that you're actually focusing your
life today on in your careers very few
take a deviation or a shift from what
they were good at to something else in
terms of their profession right so
Marcus Buckingham came up with that in
2001-2002 then my favorite guru in terms
of leadership and one of my favorites is
the gentleman by the name of Ken
Blanchard I'm sure you heard of Ken
Blanchard in a lot of management books
one of his favorite or my favorite is a
one minute manager you have situation
leadership all coming from the same
gentleman Ken Blanchard the authority or
leadership and teaming brought in
something around 2008-2009 called
passion assessment he said it's okay to
find the strength but I want to
understand what's your passion I mean if
you've seen the movie Chariots of Fire
you've seen the movie Chariots of Fire
talks about a runner his name Eric
little was the fastest man very much
like Usain Bolt in the 1920s ran for the
1924 Olympics in Paris he was from
Scotland and he actually ran a race in
1924 for England at that point of time
from Scotland and he represented England
and he was a flying he was called the
Flying Scot he was so fast that he would
leave everybody else behind so much that
he would have a lead like I'd know I've
never seen in my life
he was that fast lightning quick right
and in that movie
something happens to Eric little in the
sense he had he had a we were talking
around was talking of principles and
values and somebody else I think spoke
over iceberg one of those principles of
Eric little was the fact that he'll
never run a race on a Sunday he said
Sunday is God's day I will not run a
race on a Sunday he takes a decision
like that and unfortunately for him the
1924 Olympics comes prepared for four
years they come and tell him just three
months before the Olympics Eric your
Heath's is falling on a Sunday now let's
just get into a dialogue if that happens
to one of us what would we do exception
thank you God one Sunday please
let me just finish I will attend the
evening service the race in the morning
we will get into the dialogue this
gentleman said no that's my principle
I've taken a commitment to God I will
not he takes it and his manager gets mad
it says what's wrong with you you're
running for a country you've got glory
for England to to actually look at he
said sorry I can't
I've made a decision and now they don't
know what to do so the next fastest
runner is another gentleman from England
his name is Harold Abraham's
he runs for England and thankfully for
England England gets the gold
Harold Abraham gets the goal for England
so they don't lose anything but then
Eric he's now practice for four years to
run the hundred metres he's now left in
the lurch one of his teammates
understanding Eric's situation comes to
where he can says Eric I know your
situation why don't you run the 400
meters instead of me how many of you run
in school are college not after men and
women but I mean I'm talking after you
right right all of us have run at some
point of time right the friend comes and
gives the offer Eric says are you sure
yes I'm sure I think I want to see you
run how many friends do you have like
that and what are we talking about on
your Olympic event
sacrificing a medal for a friend and
which is the most coveted medal in an
Olympic event I mean but the metal I
mean we said gold but any maybe because
it's etched for history even if you get
the bronze your name is etched for
history here comes a friend and says
Eric I want to see you run take my place
and he runs now the reason why I asked
if some of you run in school or college
you all know that a hundred meters is
very different from a four hundred
correct in 100 meters what do you do
yeah close your eyes look for the tape
run your fastest that's it but in a 400
you start slow you build you build your
300 by the time you come to 300 you are
at your best and the last hundred you
give your very best now this man has
practiced running for four years for the
hundreds and the to hundreds and now
he's given the for hundreds but then he
takes it and as the movie sort of comes
to the conclusion that last short you'll
see that in the background there is a
statement with Eric little has told his
sister he says God has made me for a
purpose he's also made me fast and when
I run I feel his pleasure and God has
made each one of us for something but
when you do that something you will not
only feel your very best but you'll also
give him pleasure what is that area
what is that space what is that passion
area where you saying if I'm in this
area and the most satisfied my best will
come out when I actually get into the
space what is that space because we are
not in that space you'll always see
yourself one thing somebody else to give
you a 10,000 bucks more in your salary
and you think when you get there you're
going to be happy all of us understand
the monday-morning scenario right what's
the worst day of of a week are we no
guessing to that
one day right so you think that so if
reliance gives you another 100,000 bucks
more on your current CPC you're going to
be happy there let me tell you know
because the Monday will come there also
what will make you happy is if you're
working in your area of passion that's
what you need to get to so he worked on
this and my boss who's currently the CLO
with reliance industry at that point of
time he was with HCL developed something
for head CL at that point of time he
called it the employee passion
indicative count so what we did was we
administered a questionnaire to find out
what our employees passionate about
which area would they be wanting to work
and we then gave that report to every
manager so the manager would know what
area is my team member wanting to work
in it was unheard of nobody even thought
of doing something in the space I don't
think even today anybody's talking a
fashion and we need to understand that
we need to get to understand employee
you know passion so building on that
let's just move on and understand a few
things
just to understand what passion is the
state of mind when it is powerfully
acted upon and influenced by something
external to itself and if you can
probably go beyond I'll skip this but
let me just talk a little bit of our
current chairman some of you know
Gujarati so you probably understand that
that's not English that's actually ma
Javed say I'm told that he and his
father in the early days of Reliance
would go to different sites of Reliance
and this is the standard term that they
will look at at employ in us ma Java
sure and what does it mean are you
enjoying your job so if your CEO comes
to you and says ma sha have a chair
today
it better be yes
but many of us we find it so difficult
to enjoy our jobs because our jobs are
routine boring monotonous and to come to
work on a Monday morning is the most
difficult thing for many people in fact
they've gone on research to find out the
heart attacks the number of heart
attacks that happen on a Monday morning
is the highest in Germany seriously you
go down to Bangalore that the Heart
Hospital which is our largest hospitals
in Bangalore that part of Asia you walk
into that hospital it is as a signboard
that majority of heart attacks happen on
Monday morning it is true you know why
because after a beautiful day called
Saturday and a wonderful day called
Sunday to come back to routine is the
most difficult thing for many people
especially in the West because in the
West they just enjoy the Saturdays and
Sundays in the lines we work on
Saturdays some of you are off tomorrow I
envy you guys but we work six days in
one way you know saves the heart but for
many people to come back to that routine
is the most difficult thing to have
right so I really enjoying your job ask
that question and if you're not enjoying
your job you need to ask you a question
what's the area of my passion I love
what the Rho by G said a few years ago
he said if you don't have a dream you'll
follow one who has a dream if you don't
have a dream you will follow somebody
else who has one that's not very nice to
stomach but that's the fact right so
what's your dream what are you dreaming
to be that's the question my job which
are you are you enjoying what you're
doing so when you really look at the
area of passion they found out that if
you are passionate about what you're
doing you're gonna get all of this and
how many of you want all of this we want
one more thing I like this let me before
I hear you let me tell you four reasons
why people live on this earth number one
one spouse number two two children
number three a three-bedroom apartment
and number four a four-wheeler many of
us are living for one two three four
reasons and if you get the one two three
four you're the most happiest people on
God's earth
my only has submission is please don't
reverse the order and then they built a
five six and seven and that's what I
think you're coming to a five week work
week six what about what that what would
that be six digit salary possibly in
some sense something seven so let me
what do you want it to talk about their
wealth also okay let me tell you if you
get this you get your wealth
automatically alright so let's see how
many of you would love to live long
anybody you will say here I want to pop
off tomorrow but life is so bad just
meet me outside
hold on life is not that bad it can be
really good okay long life health
well people live long ask anybody who is
passionate they live longer than the
average person why because they enjoy I
met people in the United States 1995
they love coming to work because they
are in the area of passion amazing
people happiness well everybody is
searching for that get to your passion
productivity if you are passionate your
job will be much much more better than
the average person you will churn out
much more than the average person you
will do more than the average person and
you enjoy doing it and the last one
which is what I like it's got two
connotations to it one is reproductivity
read productivity into the sense that
did not satisfied being passionate to
yourself you will raise others who are
working with you to be either better
than you or as good as you and medically
there's another angle and that's what
research says that it spouses if a
husband and wife one of them are
passionate and if they don't have
children chances are they're having
children is that much more higher if one
of them is passionate that's the medical
side of it
so all of us love to get these areas and
the crutch hmm yes yes but yeah that's
that's a good thought we'll come back to
the hips let's really look at it so when
you really want something and you're
passionate about it you will get it done
look at your life yep you really really
want to do something you get get it done
and passion can hurdle in scale
mountains you can rely on your skills to
build your passion in life I know the
environment needs to be created I know a
lot of things has to be there and you
need to sort of work in those
environments we don't get it in there an
environment is stifling get out go
somewhere else then make sure that's
part of your agreement at the interview
itself that I need this I'm looking for
this and that's the area that I want
alright but let's move on
so in closing let me just quickly wind
down to give you some areas that you
need to really look at Gallup did a lot
of study and Gallup continues to do a
lot of study in terms of employee
behavior engagement and on that there
are three kinds of employees and they
will be in your teams as well you'll be
one of them as well so you need to
identify what these three kinds of
employees are number one these are
called engaged employees all right
engaged employees have the following
traits in them number one they will be
passionate about their work these the
people would love to come to work even
on on a Sunday I mean they're so
passionate about they were I mean you
just ask them to come to work they'll
come at any time
they'll stay back at any longer to
complete the job they are so passionate
about what they do they're also going to
be very very productive and the third is
they will be some kind of leadership in
them and the word that we used in when
we were working for Head seal was a word
that is getting a lot of attention these
days and the word is called
intrapreneurship I'm sure you heard of
the word entrepreneurship and you know
what an entrepreneur does what do you
think an intrapreneur would do the same
thing inside an organization so you need
to raise the people who are so
passionate inside an organization in
fact in reliance
and Mukesh Ambani talks about owner
professionals how do we get owners of
Reliance working for us he's not looking
at professionals only owner
professionals people will say a blind is
my company that's a huge mandate on us
as a learning team how do we get that
DNA all right so we're working on that
the second kind of employees are called
the not engaged employees these are the
people who come for two punches one
lunch I mean I'll do the minimum and
I'll go home don't ask me anything more
it's not part of my KRA I've just done
my minimum I'll keep going so these are
people who are stuck in low risk and low
commitment mode they don't feel a sense
of connection with their company
coworker other managers they don't feel
a sense of achievement they get fixated
on roles they'll tell you very clearly
this is not part of my career and of
course there are also people who just
concerned to do the minimum and get by
these are called they're not engaged
employees so first you have the engage
then you have a non engaged these two
are okay there's another category which
is even more dangerous these people are
called actively disengaged employees
they're also called cave dwellers
because they're constantly against
virtually everything have you met them
then you know where to find them it's
pretty easy they'll be in the canteens
they'll be at the smoke breaks they'll
be somewhere else not at their desktops
working they will be cribbing crying
they are called the quit but stay
employee I mean they mentally can quit
from your company but because of the
salary and the other things they stay
now what's wrong with this kind of an
employee yes they will go ahead and
influence and they will also influence
the most engaged employees these are the
guys you know who probably look at the
engaged employees who come early in the
morning at 8 o'clock
to work they look at the guys and said
hey why are you coming so early in the
morning why can't you come at 10:30 so
the engaged employee may look at them
and say hey haven't you heard of the
adage that the early bird gets the first
worm then this guy might look at him and
says
what if the worm gets up early so you
will have characters like these in your
organization you've got to handle them
because these are called the cave
dwellers they're busy acting out their
unhappiness and everyday undermined what
they're engaged co-workers accomplish so
my question to you is first of all you
need to ask a question I come to you sir
what category do you fall into amongst
the three number one number two you need
to find out about your teams your team
members which category do they fall in
are they in the engaged not engaged or
actively disengaged what can you do for
them so when we did the passion survey
we gave the report to our managers in
these categories based on the way they
actually reported on their questionnaire
and the manager then had to put certain
action plans to actually handle them
it's very important for us to know sir
your question
possible possible mm-hmm possible I hope
he gets better from actively disengaged
to the next role sure sure well maybe
but I think they'll be very few like
that I mean who's intelligently trying
to be you know disengaged you understand
where I'm coming from Aram I mean
strategy gamma I'm putting algorithms to
actually go to the next road there may
be a few I'm not disagreeing but I think
they'll be very few in that category
anyways let's move on and if they when
you really look at the connect between
engagement and work Gallup found
phenomenal data for example in your
company if everybody is in the engaged
population right this is what you'll see
you will see in the balance sheet you'll
see the following 50% low turnover what
does that mean
attrition will go down 50 percent 56
percent higher customer loyalty
38% higher productivity 27% higher
profitability tell me which CEO or CXO
would not want to see these figures in
their accounts that is why so much of
dollars and rupees are put into
engagement service they want to know how
many of our employees are engaged why
because it's directly hitting bottom
line right and there's so much a study
that we can talk about anyway let me
move on and then close this and when
they did this in the United States and
Singapore when they did this in this is
pretty dated
but anyway it's worth talking about when
they did the two countries the actively
disengaged employee workforce in the
United States was close to 16% and
Singapore was close to 17% when they put
this in dollar terms this is how it came
actively disengaged in cost employee
cost in the United States alone was 300
billion dollars per year 16% of the
population workforce population
disengaged that is creeping crying
wailing whining and all that when they
looked at Singapore it is close to five
billion dollars per year in lost
productivity and that's not that's huge
so that's something that you and I would
probably need to take cognizance of so
the question is I your team members
engaged are you engaged first of all
because that's the first question then
our team members engaged what should I
do for this of course map your team
members to their area of passion find
out what they love doing give to them
and you'll see them actually turning
miracles and in closing why and how does
that help this is where I want to code
Larry boss City he talked about this in
the ultimate metric and it's phenomenal
he says when you retire you won't
remember what you did in the first
quarter of 1994 or the third you will
remember how many people you developed
how many you helped have a better career
because of your interest in dedication
to the development when you are confused
about how you're doing as a leader find
out how the people you lead are doing
you'll know the answer
things that was incredibly phenomenal
right
like somebody said no one in their
deathbed when people were interviewed no
one in their deathbed ever said I wish I
worked a little extra harder that one
quarter they all said I wish I spent a
little more time with my wife my
children my family my friends my
community so how are you looking at life
itself is it the one two three four or
it's beyond that what's your purpose for
living so that those are tough questions
but we need to handle them and with that
as I think Rahul already touched be
yourself God has made as unique don't
die a cheap copy each of us are unique
and that is what you and I need to
understand and when we understand our
uniqueness and bring that uniqueness to
the workplace and you put that
uniqueness together something beautiful
happens when tomorrow's and next next
level of leaders are going to be
successful in the world tomorrow are
going to be leaders who going to use the
diversity extremely well diversity in
thought diversity in approach to doing
things diversity is gonna be key because
no one person is going to do the same
activity just the same all right thank
you so much and I hope that was you'll
be seeing more of the third type of
people so as a manager how do you
motivate them and team them up with one
of the engaged employees and start
praying no I didn't complete my sentence
and start praying that one does
influence the other but the other way
rod you got to you got to do that that's
one of the strategies that we do that we
teamed them up with somebody who's an
extreme energetic passionate person and
try and work with a person the second
thing that the manager needs to do is
find out exactly what what is wrong for
example he coated something that's
happening that he knew there could be a
genuine reason there could be issues at
home I mean how many of us even talk of
issues of our home life with somebody
like a manager we don't even the best of
managers don't understand what's
happening in our houses it could be a
personal issue that the person is going
through
the engagement sets him oh it could be a
promotion issue that happened last year
he should have got a bomber promotion
didn't come through and you didn't
handle well as a manager it could be
something like that
it needs a dialog we need to sit and
talk and you need to spend a little time
with that person but very clear
milestones to be given to the person
saying that I'm investing time with you
now I'd like to see changes and I'll be
your mentor I'll be your coach I'll give
you the support that I need I need to
give you but I'd like to see change in
in three months time in six months time
so that dialogue has to happen we suffer
mostly because no sometimes it's not in
our hands promotion and salary ha I
don't want to get into that lovely water
Oh blame it on and blame so answer I
know it I know that reality is a lot
different yes but I guess in fact I just
came from Jamnagar doing a session on
our new PMS policy and this is exactly
the question one person asked me it's
it's beyond my control so how do I
handle these demotivated people so there
are multiple things one is to coach them
mentor them send them on a program where
we talk of some of these things or just
sitting and talking with them itself
will really help them put them into
areas of passion that they love to work
maybe last year they suffered next year
you probably you know with their
potential and performance they could
probably just grow yeah but there's no
one formula that I can give you and say
use this it will work well thank you yes
he can be a software it can be
application it can be a idea it can be a
book title it can be can be anything but
something concrete needs to come out so
it's like it overnight delivery that's
why I FedEx days yeah so once you give
that kind of freedom for the person to
think and whatever he comes out with you
know that types rayon is fashion lies
and that's where you can move him into
like if it is in your control if it is
within your company if it is within not
within your company then it's better
that he moves on for himself and for for
the company as well I I would say so
maybe that is something that's a good
idea yes yes indeed employees yes as you
said and they have to be passionate
about it yes what my personal
observation was that lot of time we have
done and sort of activity on that also
is basically identity and purpose if an
employee has to find a line with what
that group is trying to achieve
if employee is not able to identify thus
with that purpose and goal that create
the biggest prohibition we have seen the
other moment it was done yes person
wanted to be a lawyer and working that
engagement so how that passion connects
to this particular role in perhaps ever
absolutel that employee that this is the
connect correct so that you're right yes
yes yeah that's the risk that you got to
take I'll cut the example that happens
in certain companies Google Yahoo 3m
these people just take the risk for
example the posted notes came up
internally in 3m because somebody had a
brilliant idea now you could shoot that
down what happened to the rocks a few
years ago when they actually came over
the prototype they were shot down and
said this will never fly though those
were famous last words but that's the
risk that you may have to take yes you
may not give the person an immediate
chance to get in the area of passion but
at least moving them in some direction
is what the manager can probably help
training reading books giving them
resources timeout to actually go and
spend time in the area of passion all
that could really help yes sure sure
a passion of you know to play cricket
here it is killed if he had a passion of
singing and he doesn't have the skill
you know that would have been disaster
so that's where this a book which was
StrengthsFinder you know which will
combine with passion finder it
definitely help you out but your your
question is very true that most of the
people and you see we are in Mumbai most
of these strugglers in the film world
they are passionate about acting what
they are struggling throughout life yeah
many of them because they are not found
maybe resources this is one thing but
many of them they have not yet known
that they have the skills yeah that you
know and if we really have to follow our
passion we should take that challenge of
deviating from up you know current job
profile and you know you know to
actually point down what are the things
you really love and you know let me take
my own personal example here I was a shy
introvert last row kind of guy right
yeah so if you tell me to come in front
that's the last thing I wanted to do but
I give for singing so you can't sit
there and sing you had to come here so
that was my first move forward so you
come and tell me sing John no problem
I'll sing but then what happened was
soon they started saying John tell an
introduction of the song and then sing
singing was alright introduction I'll
faint because now I had to think about
something to connect with the song then
slowly I moved into that and because I
was in HR I had a natural inclination
saying hey I hate paperwork I want to
connect with people and every time I got
an opportunity I would leave paperwork
and come and stand here and start
talking and over the years it's like our
two zones that we live in we live in a
zone called comfort sixty percent of the
time but
growth and learning happens in another
zone called courage and you got to take
that step of courage right so sometimes
you may have to look at in the spring
think am I actually like that frog in
the well syndrome that you know the
water is boiling it might kill me if I
don't do something so you got to take
that choice yourself so sometimes it's I
took a choice HR enough paperwork enough
I want to move into my area of passion
which is learning an element and I'm old
so 2003 I took the decision consciously
and said I'm moving out so I took that
personal decision so sometimes you may
want to do that and within learning and
relevant also for me the liking is to do
this you give me a bunch of paperwork
Excel sheets I'll faint right so I got
to then develop a team who for in the
team one person loves the excel sheets
what do I do
I say thank you for being on my team
yeah I'd go ahead and do it but I'll go
and do what I love doing my best so that
person loves what excel sheet she or she
is doing I love what I do you see that's
how you got to build your team yes sure
sure master that where there is a will
there is a way so everyone is willing so
many things then P 1 is not getting all
of that what He wills
so why how does this quote really fit it
it's it's untrue where there is a will
there's a well that's untrue so Master
says okay I'll do my prayers in in the
river early morning so you come there
and I will explain you what it means so
the pupil goes there master does his
prayer and then calls the pupil in water
and he tries to drown him forcefully he
keeps it keeps him under water a very
long time
initially pupil does not react he's just
shouting and saying hey master what are
you doing but when it came to his death
he said he pushed the master and said go
away
what are you doing I would have been
dead then Master said if you will like
you are willing to live that's when you
get the way and that's what is the
difference between like or will and
passion if you are passionate enough
about something you will acquire your
skills and your knowledge and whatever
it takes in this world but then you got
to realize that spark or that passions
yes once you have that I think you can
you will do whatever it takes and it
will automatically happen yes because
once you willed that strong God makes
things happen yes beautiful in fact you
can look up my boss has done a TED talk
TEDx recently in Chennai
he stalked of a subject called personal
branding so look up on YouTube for Anand
Pillai he talks exactly on some of these
lines in fact some of the things that I
spoke also will be there but he talked
of this whole concept of personal
branding how important personal branding
is and that's that's something that you
may want to look up so TEDx or just even
YouTube on and Pillai I think will stop
because otherwise just go on thank you
very much presentation very much today
request Maui amo Kochi and projector -
head of a small movement - to John
