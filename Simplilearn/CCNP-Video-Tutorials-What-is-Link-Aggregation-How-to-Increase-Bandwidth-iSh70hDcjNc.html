and switching course offered by simply
learn in the previous lesson we focused
on VLAN trunking protocol VTP in this
lesson we will look into link
aggregation let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to identify the requirements to
establish an ether channel explain pag P
and LACP including negotiation and LACP
parameters configure ether channels
explain load balancing and flex links
configure flex links let us start our
discussion with the methods to increase
bandwidth bandwidth can be increased
using various methods one is to replace
the link with a higher speed link this
possibly necessitates an expensive
switch upgrade this is because the
distribution and core switches will not
be able to handle the speed another way
to increase bandwidth is to add more
paths for example adding another link to
the distribution switches however
spanning tree blocks redundant paths
which means if you install another link
it would not be used the best
alternative is to implement ether
channel for link aggregation you can add
physical links but they will look like
one path to the spanning tree when
upgrading a link this may have knock-on
effects on successive up links the
present distribution and core switches
may not be able to handle the increase
in traffic as a result of grades may be
needed on these devices in the next
slide let us learn about the advantages
of ether channel using ether channel is
the best way to increase bandwidth the
advantages of ether channel are ether
channel can be used with existing switch
ports most configurations are set on the
ether channel as a result high levels of
manual configuration is not required on
the
link's another advantage is that the
spanning tree recalculation does not
occur unless all the links that comprise
the either channel fail finally either
channel provides load balancing in the
next slide let us review the
requirements for implementing either
channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
