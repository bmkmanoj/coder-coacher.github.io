case and test procedure we will do an
exercise one on creation of tests care
and another test procedure before moving
on to test development process each test
case usually has test case name which is
the identity of the test case it also
include details of the test condition
for which it was created and asset test
preconditions test preconditions are
prerequisites which need to be satisfied
before the test case can be executed
successfully test data and test post
condition are also included in the
details of the test case test post
condition describes the state of the
system which should be after the test
case execution is complete test cases
also have test case ID which increases
sequentially and serves as a unique
identifier for each test case the test
case description describes the action to
be performed and expected results from
each test case step here is an example
for modified description test case this
test case is created a series of test
cases used to test the test condition is
edit description of item the test case
simulates one of the actions a user
would perform regularly on the system in
order to modify the description of an
item the user will search for the item
by item ID and then modify the item
description in order to modify the
description of an item the user will
search for the item by item ID and then
modify the item description in order to
execute this test we need to have a user
ID which
updated privileges to perform this test
which is called precondition of the test
case as test data we have ABC as user
name XYZ as password TN 07 65 as item ID
in step 1 user invokes the application
from the desktop icon and the expected
result is application should start and
display the login screen in step 2 user
logs in using the username and password
the expected result is successful login
with main menu displayed on the screen
in step 3 the user selects search from
menu the expected result of this step is
that the search screen should be
displayed on the screen as step for the
user enters item ID in fine field and
then presses the search button item
properties screen is displayed as the
expected result the user clicks on edit
button in step 5 we have item properties
screen displayed in edit mode as the
expected result the user modifies the
test in description field and presses
the Save button on step 6 expected
result is to get item property screen
displayed step 7 is to press main menu
button and the expected result is to
have main menu screen displayed post
condition of the test case is the have
item description updated in the database
if all the expected results of the test
case are met then the test case is
considered past if even one expected
result is not met the test case would be
considered failed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
