software testing let us now look at the
basic testing principles which have
evolved over the past 40 years and can
be used as general guidelines for all
testing the first principle states that
testing can show that defects are
present but cannot prove that there are
no defects testing reduces the
probability of residual defects which
means defects remaining in the software
even if no defects are found it doesn't
mean that system is 100% correct or
defect free the second principles States
and has already discussed testing
everything that is all combinations of
inputs and preconditions is not feasible
except in trivial cases we need to use
risks and priorities to focus on testing
efforts
the third principle states that errors
identified late in the development
process generally cost more to resolve
hence testing activities should start as
early as possible in the SDLC and focus
on defined objectives the fourth
principle of testing uses the Pareto
principle as per perrito's principle or
8220 rule 80% of defects are caused by
20% of causes once these courses have
been identified efficient test managers
will be able to focus testing on the
sensitive areas while still searching
for errors in the remaining software
modules let us look at the remaining
three principles on the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
