course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project
communications management let us begin
with the objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define communication and project
communications management identify the
different communication methods
technology and channels explain the
elements of a basic communication model
describe the project communications
management processes in the next screen
let us take a quick look at the project
management process map there are 47
processes and project management grouped
into 10 knowledge areas and mapped into
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the seventh knowledge area
that is project communications
management and its processes in the next
screen let us understand communication
communication can be best defined as a
two-way process of exchanging
information between two entities as you
can see on the screen if project is an
entity the project needs to communicate
with other entities in the organization
like project managers senior management
of the organization and any other
stakeholder of the project similarly
these entities may also have to
communicate with the projects the
communication between project and the
stakeholders is always two sided project
manager is responsible for ensuring
proper communication to and from the
project in fact a project manager spends
almost 90% of his or her time on
communication you can now understand how
important it is for a project manager to
plan this activity well in the next
screen let us discuss communication
methods communication can be done in two
ways it can be done written or verbal
both written as well as verbal
communication can either be formal or
informal formal means communicating by
following some
SiC rules whereas informal means taking
a casual approach these two combinations
result in four different communication
methods they are formal written formal
verbal informal written and informal
verbal formal written method is used for
project management plans project charter
and over long distance communication
formal verbal method is used during
presentations
whereas in formal written method is
applicable while writing notes or emails
informal verbal on the other hand is
applied during conversations you can
expect questions in the PMP exam which
require choosing a communication method
for a given situation so a fair
understanding of the communication
methods can help you score higher in the
next screen let us look at the various
communication technologies communication
technology refers to the different media
used for communicating a few such
technologies are listed on screen among
which email fax and telephone are a few
popular communication technologies in
the next screen let us understand the
communication channel with the help of
an example communication takes place
between four people in a team the lines
across the members represent there can
be six unique channels of communication
existing within the team now if the team
comprises 10 members how many unique
channels of communication will be
calculated you can use the formula n
multiplied with n minus 1 and the
resulting sum divided by 2 n is the
total number of people involved in
communication in this case n equals to
10 if this is put into the formula you
will get 45 as the result there for 45
unique communication channels exist in a
team of 10 people it is difficult to
manage such a large number of
communication channels therefore it is
important to structure communication
otherwise everyone starts communicating
every
to everyone and it can become a real
chaos in the project in the PMP exam you
may be asked to calculate the number of
communication channels in a
scenario-based question so please make a
note of the formula to answer the
question correctly in the next screen
let us discuss the basic communication
model projects communications management
includes the processes required to
ensure that information about timely and
appropriate generation collection
distribution storage and ultimate
disposition of project is prepared and
circulated to all project stakeholders
it is the responsibility of a project
manager to ensure that the information
requested by the stakeholder is
communicated to them the frequency at
which the information needs to be shared
may also vary from stakeholder to
stakeholder for example think about a
simple process of sharing a project
status report with a customer and senior
management this knowledge area explains
how it should be done as per p.m. I in
the next screen let us discuss the
project communications management
processes there are three project
communications management processes
processes carried during different
process groups planned communication
management is done during planning
process group managed communications is
done during executing process group and
control communications is done during
monitoring and controlling process group
in the next few screens we will cover
each of these processes in detail
planned communications management is the
process of developing an appropriate
approach and plan for project
communications based on stakeholders
information needs and requirements and
available organizational assets this
belongs to the planning process group
stakeholder register is an important
input to this process it is a list of
all the stakeholders the project
management plan has information about a
large number of the project requirements
and the stakeholders who need to receive
communication of various kinds are
therefore a critical input to this
process in addition to these two
organization process assets and
enterprise environmental factors are
also inputs to this process many
organizations have standard templates to
prepare communication management plan
which are part of the organizational
process assets and enterprise
environmental factors the first
technique used in this process is the
communication requirements analysis
where the communication requirements of
each of the stakeholders are analyzed
and categorized in this you try to find
how many of the stakeholders need
similar kind of information which can be
grouped together
if you send information through an email
system all those stakeholders who need
similar information can be marked in CC
and the email next you can decide on the
communication technology these days
email is the most widely used technology
but in few cases you might have to send
information using some other technology
like fax or registered post for example
all government communications are done
using registered post to keep a written
record finally you need to understand
how communication really happens that is
the communication models and the various
communication methods used you may need
to conduct meetings before agreeing on
and finalizing the communications
management plan the communications
management plan is the primary output of
this process which lays down the
procedures around communications in the
organization communication management
plan has information like which
stakeholder needs what kind of
information at what frequency and how as
a result of this process some other
project documents may also get updated
there may be questions in the PMP exam
based on the plan communications
management process so a fair
understanding of the process will help
you answer such questions correctly in
the next screen let us look into a
business scenario to understand this
concept better after reading the problem
statement click the solution button to
look at a possible answer manage
communications is the process of
creating collecting distributing storing
retrieving and the ultimate disposition
of project information in accordance to
the communications management plan it
belongs to the executing process group
manage communications is done throughout
the project lifecycle everything cannot
be planned during communication planning
so manage communications takes care of
responding to unexpected requests for
information as well
communications management plan is an
important input work performance reports
have information regarding project
performance and status information
organizational process assets are the
standard templates created for the
status report by organizations in some
organizations there are guidelines for
communication distribution enterprise
environmental factors are the other
inputs to this process various tools and
techniques are used in this process
communications
she represents the means of technology
that is email instant messaging
telephone conferencing etc that are used
to exchange information the use of
communication models helps you determine
the technique that is best suited for a
particular situation communication
methods are the various methods used to
communicate for example whether it is
interactive or offline whether
information is being pushed by the
provider or pulled by the recipient etc
information management systems help
design a framework for managing the
information within a project that is how
it is acquired where it is stored and
how it is distributed and destroyed in
performance reporting all the
information is synthesized in the form
of performance reports that are later
distributed to the appropriate
stakeholders and forms an important part
of the communications strategy on a
project the first and primary output of
this process is the communications
messages that are generated during the
project the other outputs include
project management plan updates project
document updates and organizational
process assets updates in the next
screen
let us discuss control communications
process control communications is the
process of monitoring and controlling
communications throughout the entire
project lifecycle to ensure the
information needs of the project
stakeholders are met it is part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
the inputs to this process are the
project communications project
management plan and issue log which has
a list of issues that are raised by
different project stakeholders that are
related to the work being performed on
the project and various other project
documents which may have to be
communicated other inputs include work
performance data and organizational
process assets let us look at the tools
and techniques in detail the information
management systems provide tools to
collect
to date and present the information in
the form of cogent concise
communications expertise must be sought
from different stakeholders on how you
should go about this process several
meetings may be needed to ensure the
efficiency and efficacy of the
communications the major outputs of this
process is the work performance
information which indicates that the
work performance data has been analyzed
interpreted and presented in an easily
comprehensible form this process may
also give rise to change requests
updates to the project management plan
project documents and organizational
process assets in the next screen let us
look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer here is a quick recap of what was
covered in this lesson communication is
a two-way process of transferring
information from one entity to another
the four commonly used communication
methods are formal written formal verbal
informal written and informal verbal the
total number of unique channel of
communication can be calculated using
the formula and multiplied with n minus
1 and the resulting sum divided by 2 by
analyzing the communication model
problems and projects communication can
be identified project manager is
responsible for timely availability of
information to all stakeholders the
three project communications management
processes are planned communication
management management communications
and control communications with this we
have come to the end of this lesson in
the next lesson we will cover project
risk management
