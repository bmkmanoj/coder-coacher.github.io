throughout their lifecycle from when
they are first reported to when they are
either resolved or nothing more can be
done in relation to them is known as
incident management incidents are raised
over the phone over emails and through
web-based and event management tools the
purpose of incident management is to
help restore service operations to
normal as soon as possible to minimize
adverse impacts on business operations
and ensure the best possible service
quality and availability the primary
objective of incident management is to
standardize methods and procedures used
for the efficient and prompt response of
IT services incident management
increases the visibility of incident
communication to business and IT support
staff in addition it aligns incident
management activities and priorities
with those of the business the scope of
incident management is to manage any
disruption or potential disruption to
live IT services it also includes events
identified directly by users through the
Service Desk identified through an
interface between the event management
and incident management tools and those
reported or logged by technical staff
value Incident Management adds a lot of
value to business it lowers business
downtime which in turn leads to higher
availability of the services it allows
the business to better identify
priorities and dynamically allocate
resources as required let us look at an
example illustrating the importance of
incident management in the next screen
let us understand this with a scenario
imagine an IT service provider without
an incident management plan in place
only IT support staff in the absence of
incident management issues are handled
on a first-come first-served basis this
means if there are 10 issues related to
printing the IT support staff are
occupied with resolve
those issues at this time the major
business service becomes unavailable
there's no IT support available to
respond on the other hand if the IT
service provider uses incident
management printer calls will be
prioritized slow and fewer resources
will be allocated to resolving them this
ensures that if a high-priority incident
occurs focus can be shifted immediately
to resolve the high-priority incidents
and manage printer users with minimum
resources another way incident
management adds value to a business is
by increasing the ability to identify
potential improvements to services next
let us discuss the basic concepts of
incident management some of the basic
concepts of incident management are
timescales incident models and major
incidents the objective of incident
management is to restore services as
soon as possible it is important to
decide the timescales for incident
resolution the business defines the time
skills while setting up a service to
commit to such timescales the service
provider and the customer must agree and
document it in the service level
agreements timescales depend on the
defined incident priority and are
documented in the operational level
agreements and underpinning contracts or
UCS service management tools are used to
automate timescales and to escalate the
incident as required based on a set of
predefined rules when an incident occurs
for the first time and has a major
impact a procedure is set up so that any
future recurrence can be handled
effectively this procedure is now called
an incident model a major incident is a
break in service which threatens to
cause or is causing loss to the business
if not given immediate attention the
major incident may even lead to huge
loss the loss could be financial or in
terms of brand image a separate
procedure with shorter time scales and a
greater urgency is used for major
incidents in the next screen let us
discuss the incident management process
flow the
incident management process flow is
described as follows identification here
the incident is detected or reported
through event management alternatively
the impacted user registers it through a
web interface over a phone call or
through email registration here the
incident is logged and the record is
created incident categorization the
registered incident is categorized
according to type status impact urgency
or SLA if the issue reported is not an
incident but a request from the user or
a change proposal it is handled
according to the request fulfillment
process prioritization once the incident
has been categorized it is assigned a
prioritization code which indicates the
handling procedure to use internet
priority is decided based on the impact
and urgency of the issue functional
escalation after prioritization an
initial diagnosis is carried out to
discover all the symptoms of the
incident if the Service Desk cannot
resolve the incident is escalated for
further support in a process called a
functional or horizontal escalation
functional escalation is based on
knowledge or expertise hierarchical
escalation if the nature of the
incidents is more serious the
appropriate IT managers are notified
this is called as hierarchical or
vertical escalation vertical escalation
is used when the existing resolution of
an incident is not satisfactory to the
end user investigation if no escalation
is required and there is no known
solution the incident is investigated
for a new solution this type of
investigation can also occur in a
functional escalation resolved on
finding the solution it is applied to
resolve the issue closed if the incident
is fully resolved the service recovers
to a fully functional level and the
incident is closed let us look at an
example illustrating the incident
management process flow in the next
