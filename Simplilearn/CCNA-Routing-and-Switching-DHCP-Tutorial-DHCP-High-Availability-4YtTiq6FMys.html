and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
Internet Protocol version 6 this lesson
focuses on a dynamic host configuration
protocol DHCP network time protocol ntp
and high availability let us begin with
the objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain the different aspects
of DHCP configure DHCP client configure
network time protocol client explained
the concept of high availability
described the different protocols let us
start with DHCP Network Time Protocol
NTP is used to synchronize the clocks on
network devices this is important for
two reasons
system messages contain timestamps that
lists the time that each message is
generated troubleshooting a problem that
involves more than one network device is
difficult when the timestamps cannot be
reconciled in addition authentication
most often requires synchronization
because it specifies time frames for
access and uses time stamps for security
associations one router in the network
becomes the NTP server all the other
devices become clients and obtain their
time from the server the server obtains
time information for a source outside
the land just as your PC does a Windows
PC obtains its time from the website
time windows comm NTP uses UDP / port
123 it is a slow protocol the formation
of NTP associations can take a long time
NTP clients are configured at least at
the CCNA level with the single command
shown on the slide in the next slide let
us focus on high availability high
availability means that Network Devices
or the network in general is up and
available for use as close to 100% of
the time as possible
earlier in this course we discussed
redundancy of devices and links this
redundancy can help achieve high
availability but high availability is
not achieved by adding more hardware to
the network let us view the image on
slide and understand why in the image
all the PCs are in subnet 192.168.1.0 /
24 they all have a default gateway of
192.168.1 or the fa 0 0 interface of
router 1 if FA 0 0 fails
none of the PCs are able to reach the
network let us continue our discussion
on high availability in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
