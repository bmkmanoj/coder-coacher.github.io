materials and reference books are listed
on the screen hello and welcome to the
first lesson of the certified Six Sigma
Greenbelt course offered by simply learn
this lesson provides an overview of Six
Sigma and the organizational goals let
us look at the objectives of this lesson
in the next screen after completing this
lesson you will be able to describe the
basics of Six Sigma and organizational
goals you will also be able to explain
Lean principles in the organization and
design for Six Sigma let us start with
the first topic in the following screen
in this topic we will discuss the basics
of Six Sigma and organizational goals
let us start with an introduction to Six
Sigma in the following screen Six Sigma
is a highly disciplined process that
focuses on delivering near-perfect
products and services consistently its
strength is that it's a continuous
improvement process with an unwavering
focus on change empowerment seamless
training of resources and continuous top
management support these three are known
as the pillars of Six Sigma
if Six Sigma is implemented methodically
it will give sustained results for any
process now the question arises as to
what is a process this will be explained
in the next screen
a process is a series of steps designed
to produce a product and/or service
according to the requirement of the
customer a process mainly consists of
four parts input process steps output
and feedback input is something put into
a process or expended in its operation
to achieve an output or a result for
example man material machine and
management output is the final product
delivered to an internal or external
customer for example product or services
it is important to understand that if
the output of a process is an input for
another process the latter process is
the internal customer each input can be
classified as controllable represented
as see non controllable represented as
NC noise represented as N and critical
represented as X the most important
aspect of the process is the feedback as
can be inferred from the image any
change in the inputs causes change in
the output therefore y equals f of X
feedback helps in process control
because it suggests changes to the
inputs let us learn about the process of
Six Sigma in the next screen let us
understand how Six Sigma works in this
screen Six Sigma is successful because
of the following reasons Six Sigma is a
management strategy it creates an
environment where the management
supports Six Sigma as a business
strategy and not as a standalone
approach or a program to satisfy some
public relations need Six Sigma mainly
emphasizes the DMACC method of problem
solving focused teams are assigned
well-defined projects that directly
influence the organization's bottom line
with customer satisfaction and increased
quality being byproducts Six Sigma also
requires extensive use of statistical
methods the next screen will focus on
some key terms used in Six Sigma
let us look at the segment level chart
in this screen as discussed earlier the
Six Sigma quality means three point four
defects in 1 million opportunities or
process with a 99.999 6 6 percent yield
the Sigma level chart given on the
screen shows the values for other Sigma
levels please take a look at the values
carefully let us understand the benefits
of Six Sigma in the next screen the
organizational benefits of Six Sigma are
as follows a Six Sigma process
eliminates the root cause of problems
and defects in a process sometimes the
solution is creating robust products and
services that mitigate the impact of a
variable input or output on a customers
experience for example many electrical
utility systems have voltage variability
up to and sometimes exceeding at 10
percent deviation from nominal value
thus most electrical products are built
to tolerate the variability drawing more
amperage without damage to any
components or the unit itself using Six
Sigma reduces variation in a process and
thereby reduces waste in a process it
ensures customer satisfaction and
provides process standardization rework
is substantially reduced because one
gets it right the very first time
further Six Sigma addresses the key
business requirement Six Sigma can also
be used by organizations to gain
advantage and become world leaders in
their respective fields ultimately the
whole Six Sigma process is to satisfy
customers and achieve organizational
goals in the next screen let us
understand Six Sigma and quality
taking a process to Six Sigma level
ensures that the quality of the product
is maintained the primary goal of
improved quality is increased profits
for the organization in very simple
terms quality is defined as the degree
of excellence of a product or a service
provided to the customer it is
conformance to customer requirement if
the customer is satisfied with the
product or service then the product or
service is of the required quality let
us look at the history of quality in the
next screen in the mid-1930s statistical
process control SPC was developed by
Walter Shu heart and used extensively
during World War two
to quickly expand the u.s. industrial
capabilities SPC is the application of
statistical techniques to control any
process Walter Xu hearts work on the
common cause of variation and special
cause of variation assignable has been
used proactively
in all Six Sigma projects the approach
to Quality has varied from time to time
in the 1960s there were quality circles
which originated in Japan it was started
by Kaoru Ishikawa quality circles were
self-improvement groups composed of
small number of employees belonging to a
single department quality circles
brought in improvements with little or
no help from the top management in 1987
ISO 9000 was introduced ISO stands for
International Organization for
Standardization ISO 9000 is a set of
international standards on quality
management and quality assurance to help
organizations implement quality
management systems iso 9000 is still in
effect Baldrige award now known as the
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award
was developed by the US Congress in 1987
to raise awareness of quality management
systems as well as recognize and award
US companies that have successfully
implemented quality management systems
in 1988 another quality approach was
developed known as benchmarking in
approach an organization measures its
performance against the best
organizations in its field determines
how such performance levels were
achieved and the information is used by
the organization to improve itself then
in the 1990s there was the balanced
scorecard approach it is a management
tool that helps managers of all levels
to monitor their results in their key
areas so that one metric is not
optimized while another is ignored
during the year 1996 through 1997 an
approach known as re-engineering was
developed this approach involved the
restructuring of an entire organization
and its processes integrating various
functional tasks into cross-functional
processes is one of the examples of
re-engineering in the next screen let us
find out about the quality gurus and
their contribution to the field of
quality let us focus on Six Sigma and
the business system in this scream
business systems are designed to
implement a process or a set of
processes a business system ensures that
process inputs are at the right place
and at the right time so that each step
of the process has the resource it needs
a business system design should be
responsible for collecting and analyzing
data so that continual improvement of
its processes products and services is
ensured a business system has processes
sub processes and steps as its subsets
Human Resources manufacturing and
marketing are some examples of processes
in a business system Six Sigma improves
a business system by continuously
removing the defects in its processes
and also by sustaining the changes a
defective item is any product or service
that a customer would reject a customer
can be the user of the ultimate product
or service or can be the next process
downstream in the business system let us
learn about Six Sigma projects and
organizational goals in the following
screen let us understand the structure
of the Six Sigma team in this screen
there are totally five levels in the Six
Sigma screen the first level consists of
the top executives of the organization
these people lead change and provide
direction as they own the vision of the
organization for any improvement
initiative to work it is important that
top management of the organization be
actively involved in its propagation the
top executives own the Six Sigma
initiatives next in the level are Six
Sigma champions they identify in scope
projects develop deployment and strategy
and support cultural change they also
identify and coach master black belts
three to four master black belts work
under every champion Six Sigma master
black belts train and coach black belts
green belts and various functional
leaders of the organization they usually
have at least three to four black belts
under them the fourth level in Six Sigma
structure is Six Sigma Black Belts they
apply strategies to specific projects
and lead and direct teams to execute
projects finally there are Six Sigma
green belts they support the black belt
employees by participating in project
teams green belts play a dual role they
work on the project and perform
day-to-day jobs related to their work
area in the next screen we will
understand the drivers and metrics of
organizational strategy while Financial
Accounting is useful to track physical
assets the balanced scorecard or BSC
offers a more holistic approach to
strategy implementation and performance
measurement by taking into account
perspectives other than the financial
one for an organization traditional
strategic activities that concentrate
only on financial metrics are not
sufficient to predict future performance
they are not sufficient to implement and
control the strategic plan either BSC
translates the organizational strategy
into actionable object
that can be met on an everyday basis and
provides a framework for performance
measurement the balanced scorecard helps
clarify the organizational vision and
mission to workable action items to be
carried out and measured it also
provides feedback on both internal
business processes and external outcomes
by doing so it enables continuous
improvement in strategic performance
toward achieving organizational goals
the balanced scorecard achieves all this
by integrating the organizational
strategy with a limited number of key
metrics from four major areas of
performance finance customer relations
internal processes and learning and
growth many organizations in the world
use balanced scorecard approaches and
the number is increasing every day in
the next screen we will describe the
balanced scorecard framework we will
learn about developing a balanced
scorecard in this screen while applying
the balanced scorecard in and
organization care must be taken to
account for interactions between
different perspectives or strategic
business units and avoid optimizing the
results of one at the expense of another
to outline the strategy a top-down
approach is followed by determining the
strategic objectives measures targets
and initiatives for each perspective the
strategic objectives refer to the
strategy to be achieved in that
perspective three or four leading
objectives are agreed upon the progress
toward strategic objectives is assessed
using specific measures these measures
should be closely related to the actual
performance drivers this enables
effectively evaluating progress
high-level metrics are linked to
lower-level
operational measures the target values
for each measure are set the initiatives
required to achieve the target value are
identified as already mentioned this
exercise is carried out for all the
perspectives finally the scorecard is
integrated into the management system in
the next screen let us understand the
change in the approach to the balanced
scorecard
from the four box model of BSE to
strategy Maps
in earlier approaches to the balanced
scorecard
the perspectives were presented in a
four box model this kind of scorecard
was more a comprehensive glance at the
key performance indicators or metrics in
different perspectives however the key
performance indicators or metrics of
different perspectives reviewed
independent of each other which led to a
silo based approach and lack of
integration however modern scorecards
place the focus on the interrelations
between the objectives and metrics of
different perspectives and how they
support each other a well-designed
balanced scorecard recognizes the
influence of one perspective on another
and the effect of these interactions on
organizational strategy to achieve the
objectives in one perspective it is
necessary to achieve the objectives in
another perspective in short the four
perspectives form a chain of
cause-and-effect relationships a map of
interlinked objectives from each
perspective is created these objectives
represents the performance drivers which
determine the effectiveness of strategy
implementation this is called a strategy
map the function of a strategy map is to
outline what the organization wants to
accomplish and how it plans to
accomplish it the strategy map is one
page view of how the organization can
create value for example financial
success is dependent on giving customers
what they want which in turn depends on
the internal processes and learning and
growth at an individual level in the
next screen we will look at the impact
of a balanced scorecard on the
organization the balanced scorecard and
strategy map forced managers to consider
cause-and-effect relationships which
leads to better identification of key
drivers and a more rounded approach to
strategic planning the BSC enables the
organization to improve in the following
ways being a one-page document a
strategy map can easily be communicated
and facilitates understanding at all
levels of the organization and
is successful in meeting its objectives
only when everyone understands the
strategy the balanced scorecard also
forces an organization to measure what
really matters and manage information
better so that quality of
decision-making is higher creating
performance reports against a balanced
scorecard allows for a structured
approach to reporting progress it also
enables organizations to create reports
and dashboards to communicate
performance transparently
and meaningfully as expected a balanced
scorecard helps an organization to
better align itself and its processes to
the strategic goals outlined in the BSA
the overall objectives of the VSC can be
cascaded into each business unit to
enable that unit to work toward the
common organizational goal all the
activities of the organization such as
budgeting or risk management are
automatically aligned to the strategic
objectives to conclude the balanced
scorecard is a simple and powerful tool
that when implemented correctly equips
an organization to perform better let us
proceed to the next topic of this lesson
in the following screen in this topic we
will look at what lean is and how lean
is applied to a process let us start
with the lean concepts in the next
screen let us look at the process issues
in this screen lean focuses on three
major issues in a process known by their
Japanese names
muda Murrah and murray muda refers to
non value-adding work Murrah represents
unevenness and Murray represents
overburden together they represent the
key aspects in lean let us look at the
types of wastes in the next screen
there are seven types of muda or waste
as per lean principles let us understand
these seven types of muda overproduction
this refers to producing more than is
required for example a customer needed
10 products and 12 were delivered
inventory in simple words this refers to
stock the term inventory includes
finished goods semi finished goods raw
materials supplies kept in waiting and
some of the work in progress for example
test scripts waiting to be executed by
the testing team defects repairs rejects
any product or service deemed unusable
by the customer or any effort to make it
usable to the original customer or a new
customer for example errors found in the
source code of a payroll module by
quality control team motion a waste due
to poor ergonomics of the workplace for
example Finance and account team sit on
the first floor but invoices to
customers are printed on the ground
floor causing unnecessary personnel
movement over processing additional
process on a product or service to
remove unnecessary attribute or feature
is over processing for example a
customer needs a bottle and you deliver
a bottle with extra plastic casing a
customer needs ABEC 3 bearing and your
process is tuned to produce more precise
ADEC
7 bearings taking more time for
something the customer doesn't need
waiting when apart waits for processing
or the operator waits for work the
wastage of waiting occurs for example
improper scheduling of staff members
transport when the product moves
unnecessarily in the process without
adding value for example a product is
finished and yet it travels 10
kilometers to the warehouse before it
gets shipped to the customer another
example an electronic form is
transferred to twelve people some of
them seeing the form more than once that
is the form is traveling over the same
space multiple times next we will look
at lean wastes other the
the seven types of waste discuss some
lien experts talk about additional areas
of waste underutilized skills skills are
underutilized when the workforce has
capabilities that are not being fully
used toward productive efforts people
are assigned to jobs in which they do
not fit underperforming processes
automation of poorly performing process
improving a process that should be
eliminated if possible for example the
product returns department or product
discounts process a symmetry and
processes that should be eliminated for
example two signatures to approve a cost
reduction and six signatures to reverse
a cost reduction that created higher
costs in other areas in the next screen
we will look at an exercise on
identifying the waste type we will cover
each step of the lien process in the
next few screens in this screen we will
learn about the first step
identify value to implement lean to a
process it is important to find out what
the customer wants once this is done the
process should be evaluated to identify
what it needs to possess to meet
customer requirements the next screen
will focus on the next step of the lean
process value stream mapping
in this screen we will discuss the
differences between push and pull
processes an organization can adopt
either of these processes depending on
the requirement contrary to a pull
process in a push process the first step
is to forecast the demand for a product
or service the production line then
begins to fill this demand and produced
parts are stocked in anticipation of
customer demand for example a garments
manufacturer produces 200 shirts based
on expected demand and then waits for
customer orders for them
note that the demand is expected and not
actual discounts offered to customers by
big retailers or examples of the push
process if the garment company adopts a
pull process instead it would start
making the shirts only after receiving a
confirmed demand from customers note
that although the pull approach seems
better it is not applicable to all
situations for example a pharmacy uses a
push process in the next screen we will
learn about Theory of Constraints let us
look at an example for the toc
methodology in this screen the three sub
processes in the packing process are
coding or printing filling and sealing
the data for the three sub processes are
observed and collected as number of
units produced in an hour the data is as
follows coding or printing is 900 units
per hour filling is 720 units per hour
and sealing is 780 units per hour how
can you implement the TOC methodology in
this example let us build the TOC map
for this example the first step in the
TOC methodology is to identify the
constraint looking at the data the
output per hour from the filling process
is 720 this is the constraint in the
system in the second step the constraint
is exploited by analyzing the
performance using data to break the
constraint a repair and maintenance
personnel can be assigned to maintain
the filling machine on
daily basis in the third step the other
fixes in the repair and maintenance
function are made as subordinate
decisions to the one taken in step two
in this example carry out the
maintenance of the filling machine in
the fourth step the constraint is
elevated by implementing the decisions
in this example remove the damages from
the filling machine the next step is to
go back to step one and identify the
next system constraint as per the data
collected after implementation of the
first cycle of the toc sealing can be
identified as the next system constraint
let us now analyze the data before and
after TOC implementation in this example
the number of units produced per hour
before implementing the TOC
encoding or printing process was 900
units filling process was 720 units and
sealing process was 780 units after
implementing the TOC the number of units
produced per hour for the filling
process increased to 840 from 720 units
let us proceed to the next topic of this
lesson in this topic we will discuss the
concepts in design for Six Sigma or DFS
s let us first understand DFS s in the
next screen DFS s or design for Six
Sigma is a business process methodology
that ensures that any new product or
service meets customer requirements and
the process for that product or service
is already at Six Sigma level DFS s uses
tools such as quality function
deployment or q FD and failure mode and
effects analysis or FMEA DFS s can help
a business system to introduce an
entirely new product or service for the
customer it can also be used to
introduce a new category of product or
service for the business system for
example an FMCG company plans to make a
new brand of hair oil a type of product
already in the market d
ss also improves the product or service
and adds to the current product or
service lines to implement DFS s a
business system has to know its customer
requirements DFS s can be used to design
a new product or service a new process
for a new product or service or redesign
of an existing product or service to
meet customer requirements let us learn
about processes for DFS s in the next
screen the two major processes for DFS s
are I do V and DM a DV I do V stands for
identify design optimize and verify DM
ad V stands for define measure analyze
design and verify in the IDO V process
the first step involves identifying
specific customer needs based on which
the new product and business process
will be designed the next step involves
design which involves identifying
functional requirements developing
alternate concepts evaluating the
alternatives selecting a best fit
concept and predicting segment
capability tools such as FMEA are used
here the third step optimize uses a
statistical approach to calculate
tolerance with respect to the desired
output when I do V is implemented to
design a process expected to work at Six
Sigma level this is checked in the
optimize phase if the process does not
meet expectations the optimize phase
helps in developing detailed design
elements predicting performances and
optimizing design the last stage of IDO
V is to verify that is to test and
validate the design and finally to check
conformance to Six Sigma standards the
other process DM adv has five stages the
first stage is to define the customer
requirements and goals for the process
product or service next measure and
match performance to customer
requirements
the third stage involves analysis and
assessment of the design for the process
product or service the next step is to
design and implement the array of latest
processes required for the new process
product or service the final stage is to
verify results and maintain performance
in the next screen we will look at the
differences between IDO v and DM a DV
the primary difference between IDO v and
DM a DV is that while I do V is used
only to design a new product or service
DM ad B can be used to design either a
new product or service or redesign an
existing product or service
I do V involves design of a new process
while DM a DV involves redesigning an
existing process in I do V no analysis
or measurement of existing process is
done and the whole development is new
the design step immediately follows the
identification of customer requirements
in contrast DM a DV the existing product
service or process is examined
thoroughly before moving to the design
phase the design stage comes only after
defining requirements and analyzing the
existing product service or process in
the following screen we will learn about
tool quality function deployment or qfd
which is one of the DFS s tools q FD
also called voice of customer or vo C or
House of quality is a predefined method
of identifying customer requirements
it is a systematic process to understand
the needs of the customer and convert
them into a set of design and
manufacturing requirements q FD
motivates business to focus on its
customers and design products that are
competitive in lesser time and at lesser
cost the primary learning from q FD
includes which customer requirements are
most important what the organization
strengths and weaknesses are
we're an organization should focus their
efforts and where most of the work needs
to be done to learn from qfd the
organization should ask relevant
questions to customers and tabulate them
to bring out a set of parameters
critical to the design of the product
apart from understanding customer
requirements it is also important to
know what would happen if a particular
product or service fails when being used
by a customer it is necessary to
understand the effects of failure on the
customer to ensure preventive actions
are taken and to be able to answer the
customers in the event of failure in the
next screen we will look at another DFS
s tool failure modes and effects
analysis or FMEA failure modes and
effects analysis or FMEA is a preemptive
tool that helps any system to identify
potential pitfalls at all levels of a
business system it helps the
organization to identify and prioritize
the different failure modes of its
product or service and what effect the
failure would have on the customer it
helps in identifying the critical areas
in a system on which the organization's
efforts can be focused note that while
FMEA enables identification of critical
areas it does not offer solutions to the
identified problems we will look at the
varieties of FMEA such as DF MEA and PF
mea in the next screen P FMEA stands for
process failure mode and effects
analysis and D FMEA
stands for design failure mode and
effects analysis P FMEA is used on a new
or existing process to uncover potential
failures it is done in the quality
planning phase to act as an aid during
production a process FMEA can involve
fabrication assembly transactions or
services D FMEA is used in the design of
a new product service or process to
uncover potential failures
the purpose is to find out how failure
modes affect the system and to reduce
the effect of failure on the system this
is done before the product is sent to
manufacturing all designed efficiencies
are sorted out at the end of this
process in the following screen we will
understand FMEA risk priority number
FMEA risk priority number or rpm is a
measure used to quantify or assess risk
associated with the design or process
assessing risk helps identify critical
failure modes higher the RPN higher the
priority the product or process receives
RPN is a product of three numbers
severity of a failure occurrence of a
failure and the detectability of a
failure all these numbers are given a
value on a scale of 1 to 10 the minimum
value of RP n is 1 and the maximum value
is 1,000 a failure mode with a high
occurrence rating means the failure mode
occurs very frequently a mode with a
high severity rating means that the mode
is really critical to ensure safety of
operations a mode with a high detection
rating means that the current controls
are not sufficient in the next screen we
will look at the FMEA table
the FMEA table helps plan improvement
initiatives by underlining why and how
failure modes occur and helps
organizations plan for their prevention
typically FMEA is applied on the output
of root cause analysis and is a better
tool for focus or prioritization as
compared to multi boating one important
aspect of FMEA is that it does not need
data experts in a particular area can
form the FMEA table without having to
look at data from any source in
functions such as
Human Resources the FMEA table is very
useful as there might not be much data
available to the problem-solving team
the sample FMEA table is given on the
screen please go through the contents
for better understanding in the
following screen we will discuss
severity of risk priority number and
scale criteria let us first discuss
severity severity refers to the
seriousness of the effect of the failure
mode or how critical the failure mode is
to the customer or the process the
severity of a failure mode is rated on a
scale of 1 to 10 using a severity table
different industries follow different
structures for the severity table a high
severity rating indicates a mode is
critical to operational safety for
example a team working on FMEA of a
radioactive plant may insert fatal as
the effect with rating 10 another
example is the severity table for a
sports team the team manager wants to
rate the severity of failure of the team
in an upcoming game she might rate it at
9 given that the team would lose a big
sponsorship should they face defeat
which could in turn be hazardous to the
team's future shown here is a
generalized table of severity the
severity rating can never be changed for
example if a mode has a rating of 9
before improvement it will continue to
have a rating of 9
after improvement to let us look at
occurrence of RPM and scale criteria
occurrence is the probability that a
specific cause will result in the
particular failure mode as with severity
occurrence is rated on a scale of 1 to
10 based on a table like the severity
table higher the occurrence of a failure
higher is its rating again this table
might vary depending on the industry and
scenario
sometimes the project team can use data
here if available based on past data the
probability of occurrence of a failure
can easily be rated shown here is a
generalized table let us next look at
detection of RPN and scale criteria
detection is the probability that a
particular failure will be detected the
table shown here is again a generalized
one the rating here is a bit different
from severity or occurrence higher the
detect ability of a failure lower is its
rating this is because if the failure
can easily be detected then everyone
would know of it and therefore there
would be less or no damage for example
if detection is impossible the failure
is given a rating of 10 please note that
at the start of a Six Sigma project the
failure mode is given a relatively high
detection rating let us look at an
example of FMEA and RPN in the next
screen in this example a bank wants to
recognize and prioritize the risks
involved in the process of withdrawing
cash from an ATM it can be observed from
the table that not having a control in
place for network issues has the highest
rpm this is due to the detectability for
a network issue being very low the next
set of information in the table shows
the action taken by the bank's
management to address the failure modes
following the implementation the new RP
n is calculated retaining the security
level at 9 this is because the actions
were
not directed at reducing the severity
but at the causes of failure it can be
seen that the new RP n is much lower and
the risk for both causes has been
mitigated let us summarize what we have
learned in this lesson Six Sigma follows
the DMACC process that focuses on
developing and delivering near-perfect
products and services consistently
taking a process to Six Sigma level
ensures that quality of the product is
maintained with the primary goal being
increased profits lean is a continuous
process to eliminate or reduced waste
and enviers from a process d fs s
ensures that a new product or service
meets customer requirements and a
process is at Six Sigma level using
tools such as q FD and FMEA with this we
have come to the end of this lesson let
us learn about define phase in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
