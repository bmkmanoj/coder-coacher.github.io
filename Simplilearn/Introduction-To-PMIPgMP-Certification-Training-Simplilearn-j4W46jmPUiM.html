garrison I am PMP PGM P and pmi-acp
certified professional with over 10 plus
years of experience in program and
project management spanning several
business verticals I have a passion to
promote excellence in program management
and that's exactly why I am excited to
be here and take you through this
introductory module the P GMP training
program I will provide an overview of
the course and also try to answer
several key questions you might have
about the training and the examination
let's get started connecting to the
course let us review a few success
stories of strategic program management
first a large multinational company
obtained a 1 billion US dollar license
to operate in a country because of its
enterprise stewardship initiative a
retail company achieved 32% supply-chain
efficiencies and captured the market
leadership through its ERP
implementation across hundreds of its
chains a telecom company reduced its
customer bounce rate and enhanced its
user experience by its modern self-serve
experience program thus more than
doubling its customer base in two years
an agricultural cooperative was able to
motivate its workforce and more than
double its throughput what do you think
is common to all these milestones
strategic programs programs help large
corporations align day-to-day operations
with the business goals without
compromising on speed quality and
efficiency be it to gain cost
efficiencies achieve growth or deliver
stakeholder objectives program
management is a primary driver for
shareholder value program management
professional certification or PG MP from
PMI offers participants a structured
approach to understand and execute
programs establish the deed real-life
example
let us now see a real-world example to
highlight the significance of program
management a large multinational oil
company not only avoided the ten billion
dollar penalty that it would have
incurred due to lack of proper emission
records but also positioned itself as a
leader in demonstrating excellence in
emission management by implementing an
effective IT tool this company operated
in twenty different countries before
implementing rigorous program management
techniques each of its strategic
business units initiated their own
projects to attain the same goal of
environmental stewardship although the
goal was common the approach adopted by
each of the business units was
drastically different these projects
were run by the individual business
units in silos for two years without any
real valued fur to the larger goals in
fact it was getting counterproductive
because each SBU had shortlisted its own
tool to capture data so data portability
became a major concern cost of
redundancies due to duplication of IT
costs and requirement of support staff
rented several thousand dollars every
month each project team would focus on
solving a small and specific need of
that particular project and this
prevented a rollup of benefits across
similar projects several stakeholders
were either not considered or not happy
with how the project was implemented
after two years of rigorous hard work
and enormous amounts of investment in
terms of money and management effort the
CEO of the company realized that his
company was nowhere near his vision of
being a leader in green technology and
sustainability the CSO and CEO decided
to scrap all the projects with immediate
effect within a span of two weeks a core
program management office was formed to
overcome the inefficiencies that the
company faced for two years the program
manager initiated strategic program
analysis and determined the vision of
success from the c-suite many other
effective program management practices
like strategy alignment stringent
governance mechanisms and many more were
put in place after months of rigorous
and methodical execution but
that he identified a new benefit
licensed to operate in a new country
which was stringent in its environmental
norms further this company rewarded a 1
billion US dollar gas pipeline contract
by the government based on their ability
to have processes and controls around
emissions after the course we will take
up this case study again and see in
detail how the program was turned around
to achieve the benefits establish the
need why companies are opting for
specific solutions
companies are getting increasingly aware
of the fact that a strong program
management framework is the key to
obtaining strategic goals and objectives
as a result almost all large corporates
like PayPal and cognizant have realized
the need for a strong program framework
for multiple reasons including but not
limited to common technologies across
multiple projects a common customer
across multiple projects shared
resources and a strong synergy between
business cases and organizational
strategy across multiple projects let us
now look at the concepts covered in this
course to understand how you will
benefit from them if applied in your
day-to-day work this course reviews the
concepts and practices of program
management learners will learn the
specific role and responsibilities of a
program manager and how these duties are
related to project management and
portfolio management lecture materials
quizzes and multiple-choice tests have
been formatted to specifically address
the project management Institute's 5
program management performance domains
spanning 11 chapters the various domains
covered our program strategy alignment
program lifecycle management program
benefits management program stakeholder
engagement and program governance
benefits of this methodology there are
innumerable benefits in using the
program management framework some of
them include scalability the program
methodology provides a scalable
framework to manage programs of varying
sizes repeatability the processes and
methodology offer a structured approach
for designing a time-tested approach and
mitigating risk
comprehensiveness it ensures there are
no slippage a--'s and delivery and
comprehensive coverage of all the
prophecies efficiency program
methodology is designed to get more for
less control the methodology provides
discipline and reviews in the form of
tiered governance strategic focus it
starts with a purpose to deliver
strategic objectives and remains true to
its nature without getting tied up with
day-to-day demands engaged stakeholders
the program methodology incorporates
divergent stakeholder views this aspect
not just makes it flexible but also
ensures resultant benefits of different
stakeholder views are accepted business
case driven the program methodology is
business case driven and therefore
offers a reasonable risk appetite to
leverage returns effective tools and
techniques the program management
methodology provides a host of tools and
techniques like balanced scorecard
program road mapping project selection
criteria etc that help organize even
complex sets of processes and makes work
look rather simple personal experience
as P GMP practitioner ever since I did
my PG MP in 2008 I have been able to
attract opportunities as a program
manager in several large companies let
me share my experience in developing a
program methodology I had the
opportunity to create an evergreen PMO
or an opportunity Factory for a large
multinational oil company the primary
role of this PMO was to analyze the
business goal to leverage ERP and non
ERP applications and gain business
benefits the test of this PMO would
start with the business team requesting
IT PMO to do projects in ERP or non ERP
space depending on whether the goal with
cost reduction or sales growth the PMO
would then elaborate on the business
requirements and priorities develop the
program charter examine if it was a
viable proposition develop criteria to
shortlist the opportunity create an
investment roadmap and gain top
stakeholder buy-in for investment the
next step would be to define a program
from a set of opportunities identify
synergy
it's across other programs to ensure
savings and then kick off the program
once the program is kicked off the PMO
would have what is called PMO in a box
which has standardized tools and
templates process and procedures for a
program and its constituent projects the
program and project managers could
leverage this to launch the program
earlier using this framework the
Evergreen PMO launched seven programs
between 2008 and 2009 and helped save
the business 1.2 million dollars PML in
a box also helped business achieve
savings of 2.3 million dollars in
business results which included
avoidance of investments in nonprofit
Abul initiatives which companies are
using this usually companies with a
large enterprise PMO are more likely to
use a program methodology however very
few companies have their own program
ethic ology I have worked with a variety
of organizations across a diverse range
of industries and helped them in both
implementing and stabilizing a strong
program management office
some of them include Chevron Airbus
France caterpillars Scotiabank Walmart
Rogers Intel and many more product
companies like Microsoft and Google
sports and media companies like Walt
Disney and Fox Sports and several small
and aspiring state owned cooperatives
also use a program management
methodology benefits to the customer who
gets this course or certification a
program management certification not
just helped to apply the standards of
program management effectively in
organizations but also helps the
practitioner at a personal level post
certification you can definitely expect
an increase in remuneration program
managers who can understand business
strategy and program processes at a
level denoted by a PMI PG MP
certification are hard to find
remember that after six years there are
still only a few PG MP certified members
as compared to PMP certified members
worldwide I've seen an average rise of
20% in pay due to progressing from
project to program management secondly
the certification recognized
is your ability to see the big picture
this certification also validates your
ability to keep stakeholders engaged and
enables leadership progression you also
acquire new skills like business case
expertise advanced PMO skills roadmap
team and stakeholder management etc
