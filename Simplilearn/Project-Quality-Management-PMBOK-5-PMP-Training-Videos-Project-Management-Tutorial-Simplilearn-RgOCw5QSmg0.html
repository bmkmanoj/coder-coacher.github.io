course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project quality
management there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to five
process groups in this lesson we will
look at the fifth knowledge area that is
project quality management and its
processes in the next screen let us
understand what quality is the project
manager is responsible for quality in a
project however it is also the
responsibility of each and everyone in
the project to ensure that whatever they
do meets project quality expectations
quality is defined as the degree to
which a set of inherent characteristics
fulfills requirements a project is said
to meet quality expectations when all
the project requirements agreed in the
beginning of the project are met and the
resulting product is usable usable means
that the intended users can use the
product without any problem in the next
screen let us look at some quality
related terms it is important to discuss
a few terms to understand the concept of
quality better customer satisfaction is
defined as conformance to requirements
and fitness for use it is important to
understand the subtle distinction
between quality and great grade is a
classification based on technical
characteristics low quality is always a
problem but low grade may not be a
problem rather it would be a matter of
choice
similarly it is important to understand
the distinction between precision and
accuracy precision is the granularity of
measurement that is how fine-grained can
you measure the outcome accuracy is how
correct you are that is how close you
are to the desired value in the next
screen let us understand the concept of
optimal level of quality quality comes
it cost more effort put in quality will
give better results however you cannot
keep on investing on increasing the
quality as there is no limit to how much
a product can be improved investment in
quality is determined by knowing the
optimal level of quality optimal level
of quality as shown in the diagram is
said to be achieved at the point where
the incremental revenue from improvement
equals the incremental cost to secure it
suppose you are the manufacturer of toys
but the toys are below quality and the
sales are low to improve the quality you
invest in identifying the demands of
children sharing few samples and
recording their feedbacks once all these
are captured and implemented in the
products you lure the parents to buy
them as the investment is increased to
manufacture good quality toys the cost
will therefore increase and it might
become prohibitive for parents to buy
optimal level of quality is reached at a
point where you get maximum number of
buyers for the toys manufactured now
that we are clear on the concept of
quality in the next screen
let us discuss quality management
quality management involves performing
activities like creating standard
policies and procedures and ensuring
that those standard procedures are being
followed properly in the project it aims
to ensure that project meets all the
initial agreed requirements without any
deviation and that the specified
approach to quality is implemented on
the project three broad activities are
done as part of quality management they
are quality planning Quality Assurance
and quality control quality planning is
the first step when quality related
activities of the project are planned
Quality Assurance is the next stage of
implementing those quality plans and
quality control is the last stage when
periodic checks are done to see if
project quality is improving in the next
screen let us look into the differences
between the three aspects of quality
management it is important to understand
the different kinds of activities
that come under quality planning Quality
Assurance and quality control
once the quality planning is done the
quality management plan is ready this
quality management plan has standards
templates policies and procedures to be
followed in the project it contains
information on the level of quality
being aimed and the plan to achieve that
level it is the aim of Quality Assurance
activities to ensure that the activities
planned under quality planning phase
gets executed for the project it is the
task of Quality Assurance to determine
if the project is complying with the
organizational as well as project
policies and procedures this is ensured
by conducting regular process audits to
identify deviation from what is planned
in the quality management plan these
audits are generally done by quality
department of the organization's
Quality Assurance focuses on the process
not on specific products the role of
quality control is to measure specific
project data or results against
standards to inspect and verify the
project's product defect repair and
measure whether quality indicators are
improving quality control is about the
product and data for example it was
planned as part of quality management
that project would get completed plus or
minus 10% within the cost budget three
months back when the measurement was
done project was over budget by 20% when
the measurement was done a day before it
was only 15% over budget therefore the
project has showed an improvement of 5%
in the last three months and it is quite
likely that over the next three months
project may get within the plans limit
of 10% instead of showing improvement if
the data shows cost increase then
corrective and preventative actions are
required to get the project within the
10% limit this is quality control
