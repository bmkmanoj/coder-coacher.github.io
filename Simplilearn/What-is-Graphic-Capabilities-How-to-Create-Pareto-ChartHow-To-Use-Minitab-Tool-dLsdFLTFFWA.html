mini term graphic capabilities hello and
welcome to simply learns elearning
course on mini tab this is the fourth of
the five sessions that one needs to go
through to complete the mini tab
training there are quizzes at the end of
every session and you are strongly
advised to answer them before you move
on to the next session the full session
takes you through the graphic
capabilities of Minitab and how we can
create graphs to represent our analysis
of the data agenda let us now look at
the agenda of this session in this
session we will learn how to create and
interpret in Minitab the following seven
graphs business scenarios in which these
graph tools are used Pareto chart
histogram normality test marginal plot
box plot scatter plot matrix plot let us
now look at creating each one of the
above in detail business scenarios let
us first understand the common business
scenarios under which the graphical
tools of Minitab are used organizations
use these tools to understand and
interpret data for taking key business
decisions without plotting data as
graphs the information is very difficult
to interpret some examples of business
scenarios that will be used in this
session to explain the graphs include
analyze defects data to identify areas
where most defects are originating from
this is also called distinguishing vital
few from the trivial many so that you
can focus your emphasis on resolving the
vital few analyze the shape and spread
of data to understand how large the
variation in the data is
conduct normality tests to identify
whether the data distribution is normal
or non normal assess relationship
between two or more variables to see if
one can impact another Pareto chart let
us start by looking at how to create
Pareto charts in Minitab steps to create
a Pareto chart a Pareto chart is used to
determine which of the defects comprised
the vital few and which are the trivial
many Minitab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
