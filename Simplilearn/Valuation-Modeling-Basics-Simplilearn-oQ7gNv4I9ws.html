1 a part 1 valuation modeling
introduction hello and welcome to the
lesson on valuation modeling of the
financial course by simply learn this
lesson is about valuation modeling
valuation modeling is the study of the
basic elements used for financial
modeling and financial analysis it is an
introductory path to business valuation
models and advanced models based on
sophisticated projections in
probabilistic environments the
presentation we will go over today
should give you a broad overview of the
important aspects of valuation modeling
with some concrete practical examples
now let's move on to our agenda agenda
we will start by an introduction to
integrated financial models by wondering
what it is that gives value to a company
will introduce the main techniques used
a value of business and discuss the
difference between the value coming from
revenue as opposed to potential will
then get to understand scenario analysis
we will discuss why multiple scenarios
have to be considered in the context of
financial analysis and why looking at
extremely adverse scenario is very
important this will lead us to define
the concept of worst-case scenario
moving on from the topic of scenarios
analysis we will focus our attention to
cash flows and explain how financial
analysis takes an additional dimension
when uncertain cash flows are introduced
we will discuss the structure of cash
flow uncertainty and introduce the
concept of probability distributions we
will illustrate the topic through the
cash flow projection and valuation of a
coupon bond finally we will define the
concept of interest rate provide the
various types and definitions of
interest rate explain what a yield curve
is and discuss how yield curves are used
in the task of discounting cash flows
now let's move on to our exciting
present
Asian understanding integrated financial
models we will start our presentation
with the discussion on basic valuation
techniques there are three types of
primary sources that we can use when
trying to give a value to a business the
first source is the past financial
performance this means for example the
revenues from sales in the recent years
the level of profit when related to
sales the capacity to serve debt
interest and so on the second source of
information is the current structure of
the company's balance sheet this informs
us of the key financial ratios that can
provide a quick diagnosis on the
company's financial health finally the
current structure of the cash flows
enables us to relate the value of the
business to how it is expected to
continue during its business let's now
move on to the next slide and analyze
each aspect in more detail
let's look in more detail at the
analysis of past financial performance
the main aspects we are interested in
when looking at the history of a
business on the following profitability
solvency leverage turnover level and
cash flows profitability tells us
whether a company has been generating
profit historically a company that
generates profit is other things being
equal more valuable than a company that
is not equity holders expect a return on
their investment and will pay more for a
company that provides them with a good
return on capital profitability is a key
concept in company valuation because
everything is driven by profit profit is
the number one reason why a company was
created in the first place to try and
create profit we're not saying that
profit seeking is the only driving force
between companies and the people
creating companies but every business is
trying to create profit when a business
does not produce profit which means that
it loses money one can infer that
something is wrong even if it is only
temporary bad economic climate the
absence of profit makes companies less
attractive and therefore less valuable
let us go to our next slide where we
continue to explore the main aspects of
relevance in past performance
so when C is our next topic so antsy
related to the capacity of a business to
endure tough environment a solvent
company usually holds enough capital to
be able to suffer some losses or a
severe reduction in its net asset value
called MAV so the concept of solvency is
very close to the concept of strength or
resilience it is a capacity of a company
to absorb unpredicted shocks and
difficult situations leverage which is
the ratio between the assets value and
the equity value is the next aspect that
we want to look at when analyzing past
performance leverage relates to the
relative scale of equity compared to
liabilities it can also be looked at in
terms of the ratio between assets and
liabilities given the fundamental
accounting principle that assets equal
liabilities plus equity here is a simple
example to understand the role of
leverage assume we create a company
today with a capital of one pound and
borrow 99 pounds from a bank assuming
the bank will accept we will therefore
have 100 pounds worth of cash that we
can invest in various assets here the
risk of default of our company will not
be the result of the large leverage but
the results of how we decide to invest
this cash if we buy risky assets and
create the risk that we may not be able
to pay debt interest then we have
created a solvency problem if we invest
the 100 pounds into a risk-free bond
paying ten percent whereas our interest
on debt is only five percent then our
company bears virtually no risk despite
having a 100 to 1 leverage ratio let's
continue our discussion on the next
slide
turn over level is a next aspect that we
want to investigate in relation to past
financial performance despite being very
useful the turnover level is a very
misleading piece of information on the
fundamental level a large turnover is
good as it means the company is selling
yes selling is not everything because
selling is somewhat pointless if no
profit is generated anybody can do that
indeed what we need to understand is
that turnover levels in isolation are
not a good measure of profitability the
turnover is a measure of activity cash
flow is a last aspect of historical
performance that is of interest cash
flow management is a very important part
of companies life because money flows in
and out on a regular basis and a company
must adopt a cash flow management
strategy that allows financial stability
and safety while not being overly safe
in order to allow some cash to be
redirected to business growth as opposed
to making the business more secure
financially balance activity level and
financial safety is an art let's now
move on to our next slide where we
discuss a new topic let's try to compare
those two aspects of value immediate
profitability is relatively easy to
measure compared to potential when a
business generates profit there is data
to use and extrapolate past profit
patterns into the future and try to
infer what the corresponding present
value of the future profits is unlike
proven profitability potential is vague
and difficult to measure assume that a
company provides a huge number of
clients with free phones and monthly
phone subscriptions how do we measure
the potential profit that could result
from the company's ability to conceive
people to start paying for the service
this is tricky and any valuation would
only be a model relying on several
assumptions
business with potential only our
businesses investing money in the hope
that the investment in research
marketing etc will generate profits
sometime in the future enough profit to
make the risk worthwhile it is important
to understand that materializing profit
potential is difficult and requires
companies to rely on debt and private
investment those important levels of
risk can end up sinking a business when
the potential fails to be materialized
one measure followed by analysts and
relating to our discussion about
potential versus immediate profit is the
price earning ratio p/e or sometimes
called PE R it is the ratio of stock
market value to the annual earnings per
share if the stock market price is 100
dollars and the annual earnings per
share is two dollars then the PE is one
hundred dollars divided by two dollars
which is equal to 50 the PE provides
with a measure of how expensive a
company is the company's making very
little profit or even a loss the PE can
reach either very large numbers or worse
negative values showing that the profit
is a loss this is what we say during the
early 2000s with many telecom companies
let's move on to our next slide and a
new topic scenario analysis scenario
analysis is a task of coming up with
various scenarios that can materialize
for the business and analyzing their
impact scenario analysis is of course
very useful in the context of company's
valuation and more generally for risk
analysis most business planning and
projections rely on a set of fixed
assumptions relating to the future
development of the business environment
for example this includes the level of
interest rates sales level future tax
rates future costs of personnel scenario
analysis is used to assess what would
happen if those projection assumptions
are wrong and by extrapolation what
would be the impact of a very adverse
scenario for the company by doing so we
get to explore various future
possibilities and gain an understanding
of the company's risk
case study one how to define a
worst-case scenario a worst-case
scenario is usually one of the scenarios
looked at as part of a scenario analysis
those analyses are sometimes called
what-if analysis the worst-case scenario
is what we believe might be the worst
set of circumstances leading to a
significant challenge for the company
which includes some sort of loss for
example if we hold a corporate bond
investment the worst-case scenario would
be that the issuing company would
default and leave us with a large loss
on our capital for a real estate owner a
possible worst-case scenario would be
some catastrophic events happening to
one of their buildings with the
insurance policy not covering that
specific event worst-case scenario
analysis can have different layers of
sophistication from merely thinking
about the set of circumstances that
could create the scenario all the way up
it's a very sophisticated analysis
backed up by realistic probabilities and
interactions between the various factors
considered in the scenario let's move on
to our next slide where we see how to
build a worst-case scenario step by step
the first step in building a worst-case
scenario analysis is to define all the
variables relevant to the risk analysis
a variable is an aspect of the business
environment that wholesome uncertainty
for example it could be the future sales
level the future level of interest rates
the feature exit rates of existing
customers the second step consists in
defining a range of possible values for
each variable the range does not
necessarily need to include favorable
values but it must include very adverse
values the third step consists in
measuring the financial impact resulting
from each combination of variables if we
have say four variables each with four
possible outcomes we could potentially
have to explore all 16 possible
scenarios however it is often wise to
reduce the size of the exploration and
decide to ignore some scenarios either
because they are too close to other
scenarios already looked at or because
they are not really possible because
they fail common sense or for some valid
reason
you
the full step is where we compare the
financial impact of all the scenarios
looked at and where we decide which
scenario will be the worst case scenario
it does not have to be the worst
scenario among the list of scenarios
analyzed the output of the analysis may
well show that some scenarios considered
are too extreme even in the context of a
worst-case scenario at this stage we
would ideally gather additional
information in order to judge which
severity of adverse scenario we want to
use as a worst case based on that we
would choose the scenario that is the
closest the final stage of the analysis
is probably the most important one
because this is a stage where we decide
to use the information about the
worst-case scenario to the company's
advantage one possible action is to make
sure the companies is financially strong
enough to withstand the worst-case
scenario this means having enough
capital the second thing is to find some
way to insure against some or all of the
aspects or factors that can lead to the
worst-case scenario finally we can also
diversified the company's activity in
such a way that losses resulting from
the worst-case scenario materializing
might be dampened by the profits on
another sub activity that has opposite
sensitivities to the worst case scenario
variables we are now moving on to
discuss cash flows with our next slide
working with cash flows with this slide
we want to discuss cash flows
uncertainty there is no uncertainty
related to the future value or timing of
a cash flow one says that the cash flow
is deterministic this means the cash
flow does not have any risk attached to
it the word deterministic for our
discussion is the opposite of stochastic
a stochastic cash flow is a cash flow
that holds some sort of uncertainty the
uncertainty can relate to any aspect
relevant to the cash flow value time or
anything else that could be relevant it
can still usually fail within one of
those two aspects anyway the word
stochastic comes from stochastic process
which is a collection of random variable
through time each random variable
corresponds to the value of a phenomen
observed at a specific point in time a
random variable that can take different
values each value being a specific
probability some random variables are
called discrete when there is a finite
number of values they can take whereas
some others are called continuous
because they take their value within
some continuum like an interval for
example working with cash flows we give
here an example of deterministic cash
flows cash flows from government bonds
investment if we assume there is no risk
of default and those securities are held
to maturity an example of stochastic
cash flow could be for example the
coupon paid by a floating rate note
which is an investment whose coupon rate
depends on the market reference interest
rate given we cannot know the value of
the interest rate the cash flow is
stochastic uncertain case study to
building a cash flow projection for a
fixed coupon bond for this case study to
the reader can refer to the Excel
workbook for module 1 a on the tab bond
valuation this example shows the
deterministic cash flow of a coupon bond
interest rates and the price of time the
interest rate can be seen as the price
of time for example would it be possible
to imagine an economic world in which
the price today of a positive cash flow
of 100 US dollars tomorrow is the same
as a price a day of the same cash flow
in one year's time if this was possible
the whole importance of money would be
entirely different what we see in the
actual world is that the price today of
a cash flow far in the future is lower
than the price today of the same cash
flow in a nearer future as the saying
goes time is money and this is certainly
true in the financial world the interest
rate is really the price of time let us
now discuss some aspects of interest
rates with our next slide
there are two kinds of interest rates
the nominal interest rates are the gross
interest rates which means the rate of
return we get on investment without
worrying about what happens to the
economy while we earn this return the
reason we might want to worry about what
happens to the economy while we produce
a return by holding an asset is simple
imagine you buy some bond earning you
seven percent a year not bad you may
think now I mention something happens to
the economy and the inflation rate
spikes to ten percent a year this means
that the notional amount you'll be
repaid on your bond investment in a
year's time will be worth ten percent
less than today and even with the seven
percent coupon income you would have
lost a three percent on your capital
based on real interest rates the real
interest rate is a difference between
the nominal interest rate and the
inflation rate a real interest rate is a
measure of what an investment earns on
top of the growth in the cost of living
in economies with high inflation rates
the real interest rates are more
important to look at the nominal
interest rates there are also different
types of interest rates the spot rate is
the rate of interest available for an
investment until a specific maturity but
starting today spot means starting now
the forward rate on the other hand is
the rate of interest available for a
specific investment duration but for an
investment starting at the same point in
the future forward means starting in the
future that are there for two dimensions
to afford rate the deferring initial
period and the investment duration we'll
all right r of t the spot rate for
maturity t which means the rate of
interest available today at time
lowercase T equal to zero until future
time uppercase T we will write F over
lowercase T and uppercase T the forward
rate for an investment starting in the
future towards lower case T and for a
duration equal to the difference between
uppercase T and lowercase T thus with
the final maturity of uppercase T spot
rates and forward rates are linked if we
know the rates of interest
today for a one-year investment are of
one as well as the two-year equivalent
are of two then intuitively this tells
us something about the forward rate
starting in a year's time and for a
duration of one year f between one and
two let's move on to our next slide
where we look at some formulas there are
two kinds of interest rates the nominal
interest rates are the gross interest
rates which means the rate of return we
get on investment without worrying about
what happens to the economy while we
earn this return the reason we might
want to worry about what happens to the
economy while we produce a return by
holding an asset is simple imagine you
buy some bond earning you seven percent
a year not bad you may think now imagine
something happens to the economy and the
inflation rate spikes to ten percent a
year this means that the notional amount
you'll be repaid on your bond investment
in a year's time will be worth ten
percent less than today and even with
the seven percent coupon income you
would have lost a three percent on your
capital based on real interest rates the
real interest rate is a difference
between the nominal interest rate and
the inflation rate a real interest rate
is a measure of what an investment earns
on top of the growth in the cost of
living in economies with high inflation
rates the real interest rates are more
important to look at the nominal
interest rates there are also different
types of interest rates the spot rate is
the rate of interest available for an
investment until a specific maturity but
starting today spot means starting now
the forward rate on the other hand is
the rate of interest available for a
specific investment duration but for an
investment starting at the same point in
the future Ford means starting in the
future there are there for two
dimensions to afford rate the deferring
initial period and the investment
duration we'll all right r of t the spot
rate for maturity t which means the rate
of interest available today at time
lowercase T equal to zero until future
time up
t will write f / lowercase T and
uppercase T the forward rate for an
investment starting in the future
towards lower case T and for a duration
equal to the difference between
uppercase T and lowercase T thus with a
final maturity of uppercase T spot rates
and forward rates are linked if we know
the rate of interest today for a one
year investment are of one as well as
the two-year equivalent are of two then
intuitively this tells us something
about the forward rates starting in a
year's time and for a duration of one
year f between one and two let's move on
to our next slide where we look at some
formulas interest rates and the price of
time interest rates have calculation
conventions many different conventions
those conventions can vary depending on
the country one of those conventions
relates to the compounding of the
interest rate there are two main types
of compounding the X annual compounding
and the continuous compounding here X
means a fraction of the year it could be
annual compounding semi annual
compounding etc if we consider the price
a day of a cash flow of one at the same
time T in the future we can express that
price using both annual and continuous
compounding of interest rates as we see
with the two equations shown for V
between zero and uppercase T a yield
curve is the set of interest rates for
each maturity of investments one day one
week one month five years etc this is
continuous curve we also show here the
formula linking the forward rates to the
spot rates interest rates
and the price of time let's now see how
we use interest rates to discount cash
flows discounting future cash flows is
the process by which we calculate
today's value of a cash flow that will
occur in the future when we discount
future cash flows to today the set of
interest rates for the various
maturities in the future we use is
called the spod curve the spod curve is
the collection of interest rates one
owns on a zero coupon bond investment a
zero coupon bond is a bond that returns
interest and principal all at once at
the maturity so for example let's say
that we pay 95 US dollars today to
purchase 100 US dollars worth of
notional for a one year investment this
bond will return as exactly 100 US
dollars in a year's time by convention
the cash flow of any zero coupon bond at
it maturity is always one for one unit
of notional</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
