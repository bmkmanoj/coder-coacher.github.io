responsibilities involved in a formal
review manager the manager can be
considered as a sponsor of the review
process he is involved in the reviews as
he or she decides on the execution of
reviews allocates time in project
schedules and determines whether review
objectives have been met the manager
will also take care of any review
training requested by the participants
of course a manager can also be involved
in the review itself depending on his or
her background playing the role of a
reviewer if this would be helpful to the
review moderator the moderator or review
leader leads the review process he or
she determines in cooperation with the
author the type of review approach and
the composition of the review team the
moderator performs the entry check and
the follow up on the rework in order to
control the quality of the input and
output of the review process the
moderator also schedules the meeting
disseminates documents before the
meeting coaches other team members pases
the meeting leads possible discussions
and stores the data that is collected
author author is the writer of software
products under review the authors basic
goal should be to learn as much as
possible with regard to improving the
quality of the artifact under review but
also to improve his or her ability to
create future artifacts the authors task
during the review is to clarify doubt
during the review and to understand the
defects found reviewer the task of the
reviewers also called checkers or
inspectors is to check any material for
defects mostly prior to the meeting
the level of thoroughness required
depends on the type of review the level
of domain knowledge or technical
expertise needed by the reviewers also
depends on the type of review reviewers
should be chosen to represent different
perspectives and roles in the review
process in addition to the artifact

receive includes source documents
standards checklists etc in general the
