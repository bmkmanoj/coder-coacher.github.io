the follow up on the rework in order to
control the quality of the input and
output of the review process the

defects found reviewer the task of the
reviewers also called checkers or
inspectors is to check any material for
defects mostly prior to the meeting

depends on the type of review the level
of domain knowledge or technical
expertise needed by the reviewers also
