let's go through the second procedure of
configuration management strategy which
is issue and change control procedure
prince2 provides a common approach to
dealing with requests for change of
specifications and problems / concerns
this procedure also consists of few
steps and those are capture examine
propose decide and implement the first
step in the procedure is to capture the
issue and undertake initial analysis to
determine the type of issue that has
been raised and whether it can be
managed informally or formally issues
being managed formally should be entered
in the issue register and given a unique
identifier an issue report should be
created to capture what's already known
about the issue it is often useful to
ask the person who raised the issue to
create the initial issue report the next
step is to examine the issue by
undertaking an impact analysis the
impact analysis should consider the
impact the issue has or will have on the
project performance targets in terms of
time cost quality and scope the project
business case especially in terms of the
impact on benefits the project risk
profile ie the impact on the overall
risk exposure of the project impact
analysis must cover the three areas of
business user and supplier for example
the suppliers cost and effort required
to implement a change and what products
would have to be changed having
undertaken the impact
says the severity or priority should be
re-evaluated it may be necessary to
request advice from the project board to
check their understanding of the issues
priority or severity before proposing
resolutions in the proposed step you
need to consider alternative options or
responding to it and proposing a course
of action to take
consideration should be given as to the
effect of each of the options will have
on the project's time cost quality scope
benefit and risk performance targets
remember there must be a balance between
the advantage to be gained by
implementing the option and the time
cost and risk of implementing it if the
proposed option would take the stage or
project beyond any tolerances you as a
project manager should consider
preparing an exception report for that
option to accompany the issue report the
next step is decide in some situations
the project manager may be able to
resolve issues without the need to
escalate them to the project board other
issues may require escalation to the
project board or its delegated change
Authority for a decision the escalation
could be in the form of an issue report
or in the form of an exception report we
will discuss the decision making process
in detail in the next slide once again
the last step in the issue and change
control procedure is to implement
depending on the project boards decision
the project manager will take the
necessary corrective action or create an
exception plan for example updating a
work packages to incorporate the agreed
changes or issuing an all to get
a new work package to take care of the
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
