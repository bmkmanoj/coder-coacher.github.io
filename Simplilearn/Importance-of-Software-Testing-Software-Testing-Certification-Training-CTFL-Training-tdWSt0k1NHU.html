testing is let us try and understand why
software testing is important a study
conducted by NIS T in 2002 reports that
software bugs cost the US economy fifty
nine point five billion dollars annually
more than one-third of this cost could
have been avoided if better software
testing was performed considering the
spread of software into each sphere of
life since 2002 we can estimate how
prevalent these defects are in our
day-to-day lives common examples of
software defects include defects which
have impact on the individual and
defects which cause impact to the
society at large let us look at each one
of them more closely some examples of
defects which impact individuals include
defects in your monthly bills nowadays
all the bills are computer generated any
minor defect in the software generating
these bills can lead you to pay more
than is due or paying less causing
losses to the billing company another
common defect in this category is
defects in salary computations same
applies as above here what if instead of
adding a specific salary component the
software deducted from your salary more
examples relate to defects in ATM
withdrawal amounts amount of waiting
time and traffic lights phone calls
petrol filling stations etc wherever
there is software being used there is an
opportunity for software defects being
present while defects that impact
individuals are lesser in impact they
still cause huge amount of inconvenience
to users and can lead to loss of brand
or even legal issues for the
organization let us now look at some
effects which cause higher impact to
society at large take the example of
railways which has also implemented the
automated signalling system to avoid the
manuals mistakes if for any reason there
is a bug in this automated system it
would lead to train collisions and huge
loss of life and property
similarly Airlines software and nuclear
reactors and stock exchanges can have a
huge impact to the public at large</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
