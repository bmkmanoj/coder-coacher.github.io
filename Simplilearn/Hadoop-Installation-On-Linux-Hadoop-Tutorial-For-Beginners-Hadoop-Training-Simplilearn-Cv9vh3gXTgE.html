of Hadoop training by simply learn in
this lesson we are going to explain
about how to install Hadoop on your
computer but before that let's have a
recap of what we learnt in the previous
four lessons in this course lesson 1
dealt with the introduction of Hadoop in
lesson two we discussed Hadoop
architecture and in lesson three we
learnt a few Unix commands after which
we discussed cygwin commands in Hadoop
in lesson 4 before we begin with Hadoop
installation let us first look into the
agenda of this lesson in this lesson
we'll discuss about prerequisite for
Hadoop how to download Hadoop how to
install the dupe how to setup Hadoop and
finally how to run Hadoop let us first
begin with the prerequisites Hadoop
needs to run in UNIX or Linux
environment as said earlier we will use
cygwin to run unix commands in Windows
and have already showed the installation
process of cygwin in addition to cygwin
installation we need to do the following
prerequisite setup first installation of
jdk 1.6 or above second java environment
setup third add additional cygwin
libraries and finally set up a path
system variable let's look into the
first set up that is installation of JDK
one in the next slide the best way to
get Hadoop is download jdk from the
internet for example jdk 7 can be
downloaded from the URL as visible in
the slide if you go into this website
you will see a screen with a title as
given in the slide for java SE
development kit 7 u17 that will
you to accept license agreement which
you should let's proceed with the
installation procedure in the next slide
click on OK to accept the terms and
select your jdk version as per your
machines configuration save the jdk
executable file on your machine after
the download is complete execute the
file you'll be prompted with the screen
that will guide you through the
installation process click on the next
button on this and also do the same on
the subsequent screen we will continue
this in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
