responsible for executing processes that
optimize the cost and quality of
services to the required standard it is
also responsible for supporting the
business to meet its objectives service
operation delivers and manages services
at agreed to levels to meet business
user and customer requirements it also
manages the technology used to deliver
and support these services the primary
objective of service operation is to
maintain business satisfaction deliver
effective and efficient IT services
reduce the impact of service outages and
ensure IT services are accessed only by
authorized users service operation
provides guidance in the following areas
services service management processes
technology and people services are all
activities that form part of a service
and are included in service operation
they can be performed by the service
provider and external supplier or the
user or customer of the service service
management processes are the ongoing
management and execution processes
performed in service operation all
services need some form of technology
for their delivery handling this
technology is an integral part of
management of the services offered by an
organization people manage all the
processes and technology and drive the
demand for the organization's services
and products next we will discuss the
role of communication in the
organization good communication is a
part of every organization often issues
between business partners clients and
customers are mitigated or avoided with
the help of effective communication an
important principle of communication is
that it must have an intended purpose or
a resultant action communication must be
aimed at a clear audience
and involve the audience's active
participation in the next screen let us
discuss the types of communication
typical to service operation some types
of communication are typical to service
operation they are routine operational
communication communication between
shifts performance reporting and
training routine operational
communication includes incident tickets
resolved on time and communication
between service desks and users or
technical teams communication between
shifts includes shift handover reports
performance reporting is the
communication related to emergencies
such as outage or service downtime
notifications to users and customers
training on new or customized processes
and service designs is another form of
communication related to service
operation in the next screen let us
discuss the types of events an event can
be defined as any change of state of a
configuration item or component of the
service relevant to the delivery of the
service events are typically
notifications created by an IT service a
CI or a monitoring tool events can be
classified into three types
informational warning and exceptional
informational events are those
indicating a normal operation such as
when a user logs on to use an
application warning events signal an
unusual but not exceptional operation
they indicate that the situation
requires a little more supervision than
informational events such as when the
utilization of a servers memory reaches
within 5% of its highest acceptable
level exceptional events are those which
indicate an abnormal operation for
example when a user tries to log on to
an application with an incorrect
password in the next screen
let us discuss alerts and incidents
events can be classified into alerts and
incidents alerts are issued when an
event occurs
system management tools which help
implement the event management process
often create and manage alerts the
objective of an alert is to notify the
concerned of stakeholders so that
corrective action can be taken if
required for example when individuals
log into a bank's website or perform a
transaction there they receive an email
alert an incident is an unplanned
interruption of an IT service or a
reduction in the quality of an IT
service it could be a failure of an IT
component that has not yet affected the
service but can disrupt the service if
left unchecked incidents can be raised
by IT support teams and are managed by
the incident management process an
example for an incident is failure of a
server in a clustered mode it should be
noted that all alerts are events but not
all events trigger alerts all incidents
are events but not all events are
incidents in the next screen
let us discuss problems and workarounds
in the ITIL context the process of
managing problems and coming up with
workarounds for them is called problem
management in the context of ITIL a
problem is the cause of one or more
incidents or potential incidents the
cause may not be known at the time of
incidents occurrence problems are
initially classified as incidents and
are documented in problem records a
workaround is a temporary way to restore
service failures to an operational level
example rebooting a server the reason
behind the server's failure may not be
known however on rebooting the service
can be restored workarounds are used for
reducing or eliminating the impact of an
incident or problem for which a full
resolution is not yet available
workarounds for problems are documented
in known error records and workarounds
for incidents that do not have
associated problem records are
documented in the corresponding incident
records
incident or problem records are created
in the service management tool in the
next screen
let us discuss known errors and a known
error database once a problem is
identified based on its priority effort
is directed towards finding the root
cause a temporary fix or a workaround
might be used to restore services to a
usable level for the time being the
moment a workaround or an unresolved
root cause to the problem is found it
becomes a known error and IT services
are aware of the issue known errors are
managed throughout their lifecycle with
the problem management process
development teams or suppliers may also
identify known errors for example
application and compatibility to reports
for Windows by Microsoft a database is
created for known errors workarounds and
their solutions this database is called
known error database or ke dB it helps
in faster diagnosis and resolution of
incidents in the next screen we will
discuss the priority of an event and how
it is calculated priority means the
relative importance of an incident
problem or change it is used to identify
required times for action to be taken
for example the service level agreement
or SLA may state that priority two
incidents must be resolved within 12
hours priority is calculated based on
the impact and urgency of the issue
impact is the measure of the effect the
issue has on the business processes of
IT service support urgency is how soon
the issue can be handled priority equals
impact plus urgency
