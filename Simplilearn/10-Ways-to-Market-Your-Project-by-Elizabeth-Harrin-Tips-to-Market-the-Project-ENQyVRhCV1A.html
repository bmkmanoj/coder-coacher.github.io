attendees are in listen-only mode good
evening everybody well it's evening for
me I'm expecting you're in different
time zones in all of your own your
respective countries but thank you for
taking the time out of your day today to
join us at this webinar this evening or
this afternoon and what I want to be
talking about today is 10 ways to market
your project and I'm delighted to be
here it's a webinar that's been
sponsored by simply learn and hopefully
there'll be lots of things that we can
discuss this today that will help you
work with your stakeholders and
communicate effectively on your projects
I thought I should start off really by
telling you a little bit about myself my
name is Elizabeth heron I've always been
interested in project communications and
I write a blog about it today going to
talk about something that's quite close
to my heart which is taking
communications that little bit further
so trying to make sure that your project
communications are really a worthwhile
activity so that you can review the
different options available to you and
at the end of this hopefully you'll have
some good tips that you can take away
with you to include in your own project
communications planning now what I would
ask is that home you'll see that there
is a chap earn a chat option and
questions you'll have the options to ask
questions as well I will be able to take
questions at the end if you'd like to
use those functions on the webinar
software on the go to webinar you can
record your questions there and I will
pick up as many as I can at the end
hopefully you can all see that they're
just expand it in the sidebar and you'll
be able to to enter your questions for
through the montréal okay
alright so let's jump in I probably the
first thing I should do is is clarify
what i mean by marketing and in a
project environment marketing is a
planned series of tasks with the
objective of promoting your project to a
wide audience which is you know that's
fine it but it hopefully that goes that
explains to you that it goes beyond the
communications planning i'm assuming
that you've all got it some experience
of working in a project environment and
you've either been involved in writing
project communications yourself in the
form of status reports or other things
or you've received that information from
the project manager that you've been
working with even if that's you don't
have the title of project manager you
probably are still sharing information
about the work that you're doing so the
reason i think that there's something
more we can do but above and beyond
project communication is because
marketing for me is promotional it's the
promotional activity that gets people to
believe and love and want what it is
that your project is delivering for them
it's making sure that your
communications plan for your project has
an impact beyond the paper that its
resting on and beyond what simply
communication on a functional level so
finally to be clear on this point I'm
talking about marketing to your
colleagues not to the general public so
whatever it is that your project is
delivering marketing your product
externally is not something that you as
a project team member or a project
manager would have any involvement with
so what we are really looking for here
is it's things that you can do
internally to sell the ideas of your
project to your colleagues to generate
stakeholder engagement okay so that's
fine is that all rhetoric or does it
actually work in real life so let's take
a look at some research
taking a marketing lead approach to
projects really does impact project
success this is a some research done by
Peter Taylor last year 2014 eighty-seven
percent of respondents said that the
marketing activities they did on their
project had an impact on project success
and you can see here that nearly half of
them believed that it was really
critical to delivering that successful
project result normally when you look at
data like this you'll see one typical
response and that's the it had no impact
response and that isn't on this pie
chart because nobody replied to that
survey saying that marketing was
unimportant and I thought that was
really interesting so it talks to me
about the fact that generally people
believe that marketing your project and
being able to share those positive
messages is a really good idea so if
that's what marketing is all about and
it is impactful for project success what
tools do we have available to us to
actually do it well let's ever think
about the typical project communication
tools that we know and love and probably
use on our projects day to day when I
was putting this presentation together I
thought about the tools that I use most
often to communicate with my team and
stakeholders then the top four tools
that I came up with were these number
for web conferencing this is me this is
me on skype I use web conferencing to
talk to my colleagues and to talk to
friends and family it's easy it's
practical it's something that we're
doing right now I also use instant
messaging it's a good way of chatting to
people it's a good way of making sure
that you can find out if somebody is at
the desk if you need a quick answer to
something it's a very appropriate way of
informally getting that information so
we use that to
project status reports this is a picture
of an actual project status report that
i use on my projects to communicate to
my sponsor it's a weekly report I still
send out in a word document format which
is what you can see here it's one big
table even though I know that tables
don't display well on blackberries and
people who are reading the report
unlikely to be traveling they're the
kind of people who use their
BlackBerry's a fair amount of the time
so despite technology moving on in many
respects the way we communicate with our
project sponsors follows the tried and
tested root of of following normal would
perhaps what we would call traditional
project status reporting in a word
document or not a document format like
this and the number one thing well in
order to put this sort of list of top
typical project communication tools
together I didn't want to rely on just
my own experience so I asked on an
online forum for the top communication
tips and actually we got pretty much the
same results as this the number one tool
and technique in use for project
communication is stakeholder management
and you can see the kind of responses
that people gave me here they're talking
about identifying your stakeholders
carrying out traditional stakeholder
analysis reviewing it with within the
context of organizational politics and
it goes on more stakeholder management
there's identify your stakeholders
assess the power the legitimacy of your
stakeholders and put them into
categories really there is no denying
that stakeholder management processes
documents analysis they are all
fantastic tool for project communication
but what I would really stress to you is
that you don't create engagement or
change behavior in your stakeholders by
filling in a power and impact grid you
need more than those stakeholders
ants to make people understand what it
is that you're trying to do and there's
nothing wrong with stakeholder
management it's very important part of
getting your project set up right at the
beginning and making sure you have
identified those people that you need to
do communication with I'm not saying
don't do it I'm saying we need to do
that and then other activities as well
to make sure that we're really acting on
all the information we've drawn out of
stakeholder management out of those
processes so you're not going to get
buy-in and you're not going to get your
stakeholders to do anything simply
because you filled in a document that
ticks a box to say whether they are
powerful or influential on your project
you need to take actions in order to
drive that activity so that's a little
introduction I suppose because what I
want to talk about now is to dive into
those 10 ways that you can take all
those things we've looked at those
traditional ways of stakeholder
communication and the stakeholder
analysis and take it further so let's
get back to that my 10 suggestions for
ways that you can really bring on the
stakeholder analysis the status reports
you want to the next level and give you
some tools that you can take away and
use next week on your projects to really
start to market your projects to your to
your stakeholders and it starts with
getting a good story think about why you
were doing your project and how it meets
the businesses requirements how is it
going to change their lives for the
better you'll probably have heard this
before but it's really understanding the
answer to the question what's in it for
me if you can work out the what's in it
for me for each of your stakeholder
groups that you are identified in that
stakeholder analysis then you can target
your project communications much more
effectively and you're talking about
benefits people are not really
interested in the journey they're
interested in what they get out of it at
the end the benefits
you don't have to work on many projects
before you hit resistance to change
people don't like change and a good
story helps you remove the roadblocks or
at least minimize the impact of the
roadblocks along the way so how do you
get that you have to start with creating
a vision I'm just looking through the
questions here it looks like people are
having difficulty hearing me I'm sorry
about that there is a voice recording if
you can't hear me you might be able to
hear me say that and if you have asked
the question about whether you can get a
copy of the slides yes i can definitely
share copies of the slides so let's talk
about your vision the project vision
should be something really really easy
something that can be clearly stated
it's the road you're traveling and where
you are going it should be aligned to
the business goals and it should be
something that is preferably a line two
overarching corporate strategy and your
department goals even better if you can
if you can get all of those in in it at
the same time business goals department
goes and align to corporate strategy so
you should be able to articulate how
that is going to happen and it shows
that there's value being delivered and
it helps move the organization forward
that's what you're trying to do you're
trying to set your project in the
context of the business and make it
relevant to the work and the experiences
of your stakeholders that will sounds a
bit Willy actually um but the most
important thing is that your vision
should be achievable people need to
believe that you're going to deliver it
people will find it hard to follow you
if they believe that your plan is
unrealistic because they won't want to
be associated with something that looks
like it's going to fail so try to create
a vision that people can get behind and
if it feels like it might be something
that they feel is unachievable
might want to break it down into smaller
steps ultimately your project story
should enable people to clearly see
what's in it for them and what's in it
for the business overall its promotional
and we'll talk later about what happens
when there's no positive story to share
because I know that in my experience and
I'm sure in yours you're aware that not
all projects deliver things that the
stakeholders are necessarily wanting or
that I have a have a great sales message
so you've got to start with your team
mostly we think of project communication
stakeholder analysis project marketing
it's something that we do to people
outside the team but you have to have
your team on side they are ambassadors
for your project and they need to be
consistently selling the story of your
project and promoting the benefits to
the people that they work with and meet
because they are ambassadors they will
be chatting to people offhand informally
and they need to be saying what you want
them to say they need to be sharing your
vision they'll provide you with updates
for your standard communications but
they've got to be behind you in any
marketing effort as well so they need to
believe in it and most importantly they
mustn't undermine your efforts and that
is surprisingly easy to do with a few
offhand remarks especially if those
offhand remarks are to the wrong person
so project marketing should be
everybody's responsibility there's a
benefit which is not just about
delegating the work of communication to
others it's everyone's responsibility
but doesn't make it everyone's a task
but it the spin-off benefit is that
messages count for more if your
stakeholders hear it from their peers
and not from you and that's because you
know as a project manager you're
supposed to be positive about the
project it's your job the message has a
much greater impact if they hear those
good things from other people as well so
ask your team to talk about the project
informally especially when you have hit
key milestones or they've delivered
something so you know where they've had
a small success either personally or as
part of the
a project team encourage them to talk
about it people follow the lead of those
in power so identify which of the
stakeholders from your stakeholder
analysis have that power and remember
when you talk when you think about power
in your stakeholders and in your project
team it comes from different sources so
experts might be impressed by other
experts that they might not be impressed
by somebody higher up the hierarchy you
can also build a network of positive
supporters and draw on them to spread
the word and your stakeholder analysis
is perfect for showing you who those
people might be the practical issue here
is making sure that everyone understands
that the job of communication is not
just the responsibility of the project
manager and you might have to tell them
what you expect don't assume they'll
suddenly become communication
ambassadors for you you'll need to spell
it out senior managers have a role to
play in unblocking those issues and
moving roadblocks and communication as
part of that so as well as you and your
team the senior managers that you work
with should be as on message as you are
when you're talking about your project
thirdly your team is potentially quite
close to you it perhaps not necessarily
geographically but in terms of your work
you're working closely together um but
outside of your team there are lots of
ways to reach stakeholders your messages
will not get through however good the
story however engaged your own team if
you aren't hanging out where your
stakeholders are I'm currently working
on an upgrade of an HR system and I now
you skype because the HR team do it's
not my preferred method of communication
it wasn't before this project came along
but it's easier for me to change my
habits than to expect my clients my
project customer to do something
different to how they normally work I've
got to adapt and flex my own style
because I want to be easy to do business
with project managers should be doing
that they should have to expect flex
their style and
the tools that they're using to suit the
needs of the stakeholders don't expect
your stakeholders to adopt new ways of
working for them because it's more
convenient for you because they just
won't do it so along with that comes the
acknowledgement that it is more work
there's more work involved when you
adopt that approach because it means
using multiple channels to suit the
needs of different groups of
stakeholders so you know I might be
using Skype to talk to one group and I
be using something else to talk to you
another but that's my job that's part of
the job project managers are primarily
focused on creating participation in
projects so if you want to boost
participation the old engagement promote
your project do all of this wonderful
stuff that gets people on side and
unsupportive of the change that you're
trying to push through then tailoring
your communication is just part of what
needs to be done tailoring those
messages also means critically assessing
which channels are available to you for
communication and with that in mind you
need to think about how you can vary
your tools even if your communication
plan and stakeholder analysis tells you
that a particular stakeholder likes to
receive information by email it's good
to mix it up from time to time it helps
keep the message fresh it helps reach a
bigger audience and marketing is all
about as reaching as wide audience as
possible to spread the information about
your project now there are dozens of
ways that you can communicate you don't
have to rely on the tools that I
mentioned earlier as the top ones that I
use here are some you might have used
these already younger projects posters
you can use as books sorry you can use
presentations you can use a wiki
dashboards the staff magazine you've got
user guides social media tools pictures
this video reports desk drops in
terminal intranet sites or social
collaboration tools if you have them in
your business even things like posters
then you've got red amber green status
leaflets faq documents 12 ones you can
actually talk to people in real life in
person conference calls webinars like
we're doing now long content short
content roundtable meetings with a few
people town hall meetings and lots of
people and also the things that you
might think of as traditional marketing
materials like t-shirts or promotional
pens mugs testimonials success stories
of where this has worked in a different
office that you're now bringing it to a
new and new audience competitions
training sessions all these things demos
prototypes models they all give you the
option to talk about your project in a
very positive way and I hope most of
that terminology means something to you
11 terminology i will explain is desk
drops i think that might be a particular
UK term but what i mean by that is a
leaflet that you would put on
everybody's desk in the morning so when
your staff when the team comes in to
work everybody's got something on their
desk a piece of paper normally we use
desk drops as sort of a a guide to what
it might look different that day so
don't forget we've installed this
software when you switch on your
computer you will see this message or
something like that or a couple of
screenshots of how to log into this new
application that that kind of thing to
just physically remind people that a
change has happened there are also less
obvious sources of good PR like
providing information or resources to
other teams at short notice those
activities don't have a blanket reach
and they might not feel like traditional
communication activities but they will
create positive engagement albeit on a
much smaller scale and that engagement
is likely to be deeper than in the case
of receiving a mug you know am ugly the
project slogan on great but it doesn't
necessarily make me engaged and whereas
if I can help out on our team are much
more likely to create a deeper
relationship
communication is a two-way street and
just because you tell someone about
something or you'll ask for their
involvement it doesn't mean it will
happen and we'll talk more about
feedback later but I thought this was a
good point to remind everybody that
project marketing can't just be about
pushing messages out there it needs to
be ways of receiving messages as well so
another reason to vary your tools is
because people need to hear information
between three and five times before they
believe it and if you get over 5 times
it starts to lose its effectiveness and
people are just yeah yo you heard that
before it's also beneficial for
individuals to hear the message from a
range of different people so if you tell
them three to five times it won't be as
effective as if they hear it three to
five times from three to five different
sources and also bear in mind that it's
useful for them to hear it from someone
more senior to them or someone they
respect look for ways that you can
include quotes from your project board
members in newsletter articles or
intranet pages or invite them to come to
events with you if you're going to talk
to a team or you're hosting a town hall
meeting we allow your senior members of
staff wheel out your sponsor or the
director who's championing your project
because it really will help get your
message across so you've got a lot of
communication happening you've got a lot
of different tools you've got a lot of
repetition and you have to be a bit
careful because you need to create a
balance you want to avoid information
overload I love this picture with the
traffic lights and all the different
signs and you come to the junction you
think actually what am I supposed to do
what do I read first people can and they
will be fatigued by your messages
because you don't hear you harping on
and on and on about your project and you
could probably give me examples of
marketing messages in advertising that
you see so often like billboards at the
side of the road that you just stopped
noticing
there now I can't give you a scientific
method for working out when that's going
to happen on your project so there's no
rule that i can tell you and so my best
tip is to create a communications
calendar and that runs alongside the
rest of your communications plan so you
can easily see which messages are going
out when they're going out and who's
getting them I like the idea of a
calendar because you can judge if one
audience is receiving too too much
information any one time or conversely
they're not receiving enough you can
make subtle shifts to make sure that
it's spread evenly now another way to
help balance your message is to ditch
the words and go visual YouTube is the
second largest search engine after
Google with over 1 billion unique
visitors per month pinterest the fastest
growing social network last year and it
saw a ninety-seven percent growth in
active users so there is no doubting
from numbers like that that pictures
help you get your message across there
was a study at the University of
Minnesota and it found that presenters
who used visual aids were considered
forty-three percent more persuasive and
you need to be persuasive about your
project because you all you need to make
sure that people are really bought into
what it is that you want them to do so
it will really help you if you can
include images in some of your project
communications planning so let me give
you an example if i told you i was
working on a construction project and it
was two percent complete what do you
think of what if i showed you a picture
here is a project under construction
quite an old project and it's two
percent complete at this point in time
now if i was a project sponsor i'd be
really excited about this two percent
doesn't sound very much but the team has
broken ground my vision is becoming a
reality I mean in the grand scheme of
things very little has actually happened
we literally just have a hole in the
ground
but it started and I know that my
construction is underway here we are at
five percent little bit higher up but
the foundations in and we're starting to
see progress ten percent complete can
you tell what it is yet now if this was
my project I would know exactly what
that is and I would be able to start
visualizing what that would look like
when it's finished even though grand
scheme of things ten percent is really
not very far through the project at all
here's the project at twenty percent
clearly looking like a building now we
can see some stairs and even though
stakeholders will acknowledge there's a
long way to go this is great at
persuading our investors that we've got
the skills to complete this project and
we're hitting our deadlines along the
way right it's fifty percent complete
and you can tell what it is and we're
only halfway through the project but
project stakeholders can use the visual
reports of progress to engage with the
project and the development and ensure
that it's progressing as their vision
and here it is at one-hundred percent
and we built the Eiffel Tower now visual
also gives you the opportunity to think
about other things and outside of
photographs so video you can use video
it's not expensive you don't need
professional kit to do it any longer we
were talking the other day about
recording a training session on a mobile
phone camera and making that available
for people so we didn't have to visit
every single individual and train them
so there are some great clever ways that
you can use video without actually
having to spend any money on equipment
here are some screenshots from a video
we made about a big software
implementation this is about 18 lots two
years ago now originally the project
sponsor and I plan to travel to each of
the 40 locations that we were rolling
out this software to to discuss the
impact and to answer questions directly
from a wide group of stakeholders and
when we look to the logistics it really
wasn't practical for us to take that
much time away from managing the project
to solely focus on on sharing messages
and just to do communication so we made
a video of what we would have told them
face-to-face so you can see here it's a
mixture of talking heads and that's me
there's my manager giving a tour around
the new servers there's some screenshots
of the software and there is also some
panning shots you hear some people at
work it was a new software project it's
not something exciting we're not
building the Eiffel Tower there's
nothing really to look at some screens
of software the wireframes but you can
still create interesting videos with a
mix of participation from the project
team and it was fun and engaging for the
project team to do as well this video
was watched by key people at all
locations and we had excellent feedback
on it you can see how many times a video
has been watched through YouTube we put
we hosted this one on YouTube but we
published it as private so only people
with the link could see it and there
wasn't any confidential information in
there anyway it was a really simple way
to promote the project to explain what
was going on behind the scenes and to
reach a wide audience and most
importantly to give people a consistent
message without having to meet them
individually the alternative was
providing a slide deck and allowing
local team managers to share our
messages for us and they could still do
that they could still ask an answer
questions and we did have some FA cues
in presentation format but this meant
that the core messages came from from us
on the plus side we probably reach more
people through this van through town
hall-style meetings where we went
visited people but on the negative side
I had to rely on phone calls emails and
capturing queries via the internet
instead of hearing and responding to
questions face-to-face in real time so
there's payoffs and choices in every
communication decision that you make one
of the things I made sure to do for all
written communication on that projects
and all my projects actually including
any of the texts that appeared on the
video is to proofread now I found this
image I thought it was funny given that
it's on the side of a railway bridge
you really have to hunt out errors in
your marketing materials and your
project communications because nothing
undermines your credibility faster than
spelling and grammar mistakes because
what happens is your audience focuses on
the error and not the message and that
is really not the response that you want
you want them to be thinking about the
content of what you're saying not how
you're saying it now grandma doesn't
come naturally to everybody that's fine
and if you don't feel confident in your
own ability to pull out errors pass it
on to somebody else to read it doesn't
necessarily either come down to your
level of ability to command your native
language because the closer you are to
the material the more times you've
looked at it yourself the less likely
you are able to see the errors because
you're just too close to the detail and
that's why it's good idea to leave time
between writing it and proofreading it
or you give it to somebody else to check
for you just make sure that you build
that time lag into your communications
plan so you're never sending out
anything that's been rushed and not
adequately checked even if it is just
get someone from the next desk to come
and read it over your shoulder before
you hit Send it doesn't have to be a big
sort of content approval loop or
anything but the second pair of eyes can
really help on the subject of
communications plans it's great we've
talked about lots of different activity
but it really all needs to be
underpinned by a strong plan think about
what tasks you need to do think about
what budget you've got available to you
and think about what team members you
have available I was able to delegate
making a video to our project
coordinator on that project and he had a
small budget to get the work done think
about who else needs to be involved
there might be cases where you need to
get copy clearance from the corporate PR
team or there might be other approvals
required before you can carry out your
marketing activities and to give you an
example of that mostly when you see
senior executives quota
in corporate literature it's not them
who actually said the words their rights
of the quotes have probably been made up
by a press officer or their assistant
and that's fine because didn't they
they're a figurehead in a spokesperson
but more often than not if you are doing
something like that you need to get that
senior person to check that what you've
quoted them as saying is is acceptable
and that you are making sure that you're
accurately reflecting their views but in
how you've recorded what they've said or
what you think they would have said if
you'd asked them the question so your
plan overall for all your project
communications will reflect the context
of your project but it also needs to sit
grounded within what's going on
everywhere else in the business and
that's why it's important to be part of
a joined-up story project communications
are easy enough to plan stakeholder
group is normally immediate customers
your suppliers in your team project
marketing activity also needs to be part
of a plan to take your project to a
wider audience like the whole of the
rest of the company and it should be
part of a joined-up story and by that I
mean your messages should not conflict
with messages from other projects check
because people don't receive information
from only one source they will receive
information about multiple projects from
multiple departments and they piece it
together to form their own story so tap
into what else is happening in the
business tie in with other projects
where there are synergies at a minimum
check what other messages those projects
are putting out there and try to connect
your communications plan to those
strategic initiatives I suppose what I'm
trying to say really is that your
project story should be a chapter of the
bigger story of what's happening in your
company at the time just so that it's
all aligned it all fits together and
when people hear it it automatically
drops into place rather than then
thinking all that doesn't sound like
what so-and-so from the finance team
last week so when you're planning look
forward at what you have yet to do
that's fine but you also need to look
back at what you've already achieved and
you can include that in your messages as
well so in the context of story set your
current announcement in the timeline
show in your journey if you like show
how the project has evolved and if you
can demonstrate those quick wins all the
links with other departments and
initiatives that have got the project
team to where they are today without
dwelling on it too much because people
are much more interested in what's
happening today and in the future than
what's happened in the past but it does
help them see the bigger picture if you
can include a little bit of that
backstory what you're trying to do is
site your project in the context of the
business goals and make sure what people
feel that however small however
insignificant it might feel to other
people your project is actually an
integral part of what's happening in the
organization and it links to those goals
in a in a big way or in a small way part
of your communications and marketing
should be around planning for a crisis
now there will be one there is always a
crisis on projects at some point a big
one or a small one has always things
that go wrong and sometimes the things
that go wrong can be quite significant
how you deal with them reflects on you
as a project manager and it reflects on
your project so given that you've spent
a lot of time getting your communication
and marketing efforts right to this
point you really don't want to undermine
it all by messing it up when it comes to
talking about problems it's also if
you're thinking you know what can we
take it as a positive from having a
crisis crisis communications is the good
opportunity to reach a different
audience because you're talking about
messages around how you're handling
problems and you're hopefully
communicating professionally and
proactively which shows your skills as a
project manager I'm thought it's quite
hard to plan for a crisis you don't know
exactly what's going to happen but there
are some things you can do in advance
to make sure that your whole team knows
how to deal with significant problems
when they arise if their eyes cause
let's be positive let's hope that they
hope that your product isn't going to
suffer a big crisis so the first thing I
would sort out with my team is to have a
single point of contact so if something
goes wrong you know exactly who should
be the person who's in charge now that
could be you as a project manager or it
could be somebody else on the project
team everybody needs to know who to go
to for communication updates and who
will be ringing them regularly to ask
for their status updates make sure that
people know that they have to respond to
that individuals request for information
that person is dedicated to running
communication for all stakeholders for
the duration of the issue deal only in
fact you've got to do that there's quite
a lot of emotions during a problem
people have an emotional response to
what's gone wrong and that's normal but
you want to strip that back and deal
with what you know to be true gather
information from sources of complaint or
concern so that your communications are
responding to what people are worrying
about now that might sound
counterproductive because behind the
scenes you might be dealing with
something big like a big software bug or
something like that but your end users
might be worried about something else
which perhaps in the grand scheme of
things is not really that important
however it's important to them those
concerns are valid listen to what
they're saying deal with what's
bothering them and that might mean
you're splitting your efforts between
two or more activities but they're your
stakeholders in their opinion matters if
you can fix what's worrying them they
will feel a lot more confident about the
work that's going on in the background
to flixx other problems that works if
you can be fast get your messages out
there as quickly as possible because
it's the best way to squash gossip
before it starts on a big project or one
that's generated some interest from the
public like my today we're building a
soup or something like that you'll want
to get someone on site to control the
media and to control staff you might
wonder
and talk to the media and be an ear to
the ground so in that situation your
corporate communications team will
probably take control they'll pester you
for information and you'll have to put
up with it because they are trying to
help put a problem right now we rely an
awful lot on electricity for project
communications through email through
webinars through instant messaging but
if a crisis happens you might not have
electricity to fall back on people dig
up power cables it happens to us before
on one of my projects power lines cut
through generators go down when you
can't rely on email or people being in
front of their computers how are you
going to get your messages out there
stick that on your risk log just so that
you've got something that you can think
about finally on crisis communication
and stay on message you must make sure
that everybody here is the same version
of the story whatever their position it
undermines your communication efforts if
different stakeholders are receiving
different versions of the truth and that
goes for when there isn't a problem as
well no really your tailoring your
message but the under underlying message
is exactly the same it should be the
same for everybody the benefits of doing
that is because you can't control what
happens your message really staying on
message limits the impacts of that
message being changed because people
share it with their colleagues and it
goes for positive marketing messages as
well it's not just crisis management
communications you can't stop other
people talking about your projects and
when the story is positive and you're
doing you want people to be sharing
information about your project you want
them to be talking about it so these
days everybody has an audience I mean
they've always always have had because
collies convened around the water cooler
around the kettle in the office kitchen
but today they have technology tools to
share information more quickly with
their networks through internal social
networks social media
and when they do share their out their
opinion there as well and they can reach
a lot of people very quickly so I
suppose the message about problems when
it comes to communication is it's not
about people who stop projects people
don't stop projects it's sorry it's
people who do stop projects is not the
crisis the crisis itself you can deal
with and manage but it's the people who
might lose confidence or you might
decide that actually this project needs
to stop so be prepared when you're doing
your project communications planning for
that kind of problem because it gives
you a better chance of controlling
gossip controlling unhelpful
communications and limiting the overall
impact on your project now this this
diagram here is very linear but it's
important to recognize that the more you
can hear about what's being said by the
people who hear your message the easier
it will be for you to correct the story
or to respond to their concerns and
that's where feedback loops come in they
really are an essential part of your
marketing communication because you need
to know what's working and if it isn't
working ditch it stop try something else
a simple way to start gathering feedback
is to ask people really next time you
send a message for example you write an
article for your internal staff
newsletter stick a bit at the bottom
with your email address and a call to
action that says send you your comp
their comments when you do receive
remarks go back to them thank them act
on their feedback and close the loop by
telling them what you've done with it
you also get formal feedback loops
because you have posted presentation
reviews at the end of projects I think
though you get more immediate feedback
than that with communication activities
especially if you're talking to somebody
face-to-face and I do think it's worth
building formal feedback loops into your
marketing activities it gives you a
chance to track how you're doing and
correct your course if necessary and so
let me tell you about project where I've
done this as being really successful
actually with this particular project I
tracked customer satisfaction results
monthly on each stakeholder group and
they had the opportunity
to rate the project team across four
measures management of top issues our
overall communication our overall
planning and delivery and the
stakeholder group that you see here and
that gave my team my project team the
worst scores across everybody was the IT
department that's the graph that's the
green line and it's a bit embarrassing
really because that's the team that I
work in and the problem would be a book
that I had was that I was spending and
my team was spending so much time
communicating to stakeholders outside of
the project team and outside of our
immediate colleagues in my department
that they were getting a rough ride we
gave them too many last-minute requests
we made assumptions that didn't allow
them to do their job sufficiently and
once we started tracking this monthly
stakeholder satisfaction and asking them
how we were doing is project team and
hearing that they were only scoring as
four out of ten and well when you hear
that you want to do something about it
and we did and as you can see we turn
that around over the course of quite a
long time but we got that up to nine out
of ten we had great working
relationships with them by by the end we
managed that because we had a monthly
conversation with each department head
to explain how we were addressing their
concerns and we asked we said what else
could we do to improve the experience of
being on this project being involved in
this project and we proactively marketed
what we were doing differently so they
felt that we've really listened and that
we were acting on what they had said so
that helped me manage expectations
improve the satisfaction which is nice
but improve project management practice
which is better and it was an exercise
in marketing both the project and the
achievements there's a lot more about it
actually in my book customer centric
project management if you're
particularly interested in how we have
picked up and actually implemented this
but from it we learn two things first
you've got to be able to adapt what
you're doing and second satisfied
engaged stakeholders are a massive asset
when things go wrong because putting in
all of that effort builds you the social
capital and the great relationships you
need and when and that's a huge
advantage when you need to take
difficult decisions
and there are difficult decisions on
projects to take and you have to be
brave about it all this marketing
activity will hopefully have left you
with a big group of stakeholders who
understand your project and they are
excited to be part of it but they aren't
always good news for everyone much of
what I've talked about today applies
best to the positive messages about
benefits value helping people go through
the change that comes when you're
changing their working practices when
your project is doing something that is
much harder like a project that creates
redundancies or closes facilities or
outsourced services you have a much more
difficult job but you've still got to
tackle it head first so be brave talk
about the difficult things because in
the main people appreciate honesty
clarity and knowing where they stand
even if that means they don't have a job
in a few months however hard the message
living with uncertainty and rumor is
normally harder so you can help people
adjust to the new reality and tell them
how you are going to help them through
this difficult time but you've got to
face up and have that difficult
conversation first from all the tools
available to you face-to-face
communication is definitely the best
choice when it's not good news so to
summarize and will because I've talked
for quite a long time now we've looked
at 10 tips for project marketing why
project marketing matters we've talked
about some tools that you can use to do
it project marketing is really about
taking your project communications to
the level above functional
communications it supercharges your
project communications planning it
builds engagement and it promotes your
achievements it gets people to believe
in and wants what you have to offer so
I'm going to end by saying sometimes
that type of project report that I
showed you at the beginning is ok it's
not inherently bad it's what I use with
my project sponsor because he asked for
it he doesn't want videos he doesn't
want a mug with a slogan on he uses his
Blackberry most of the time he can't
read this on his blackberry
but he wants it and he even designed the
template so it's sometimes the
traditional ways of structured project
communication are perfectly ok and get
the job done mostly I think you can do
better I think you can do a better job
by stepping away from the minimum
project communication plan and that
power and influence stakeholder grid
which is somewhere in your project
filing with some creative thinking some
good planning some active management
project marketing can get you some
really great results it can help engage
our stakeholders and contribute to
delivering your project more
successfully so thank you very much for
