cloud computing elearning caused by
simply learn I hope you had a chance to
go through the second part which was
patterns of cloud computing if not I
would advise you to go through the same
as you would require the knowledge of
patterns to understand amazon web
services which is discussed in this part
this part is titled as implement we will
go through Amazon Web Services one of
the most popular infrastructures as a
service provider we will look at some of
the popular AWS offerings and go through
some interesting demos let us proceed to
the next slide and discuss what will be
covered in the implement part of the day
to session
the implement part of the data session
covers the second volume of cloud in
practice will first study with the AWS
101 which is a brief introduction into
services of AWS we will go deep into
some of the popular services under AWS
and browse through demos around them
finally we'll end with some
understanding of yeast cases where AWS
can help
let us start with the AWS 101 in the
next slide will understand about Amazon
Web Services
what is AWS firstly AWS is a set of
infrastructure web services amazon has
built a service layer over virtualized
infrastructure that allows a consumer to
provision resources over the web these
infrastructure services are exposed as
REST API or web services the services
span across server storage database
object store and many other
infrastructure components secondly AWS
allows on-demand infrastructure
provisioning this means that a consumer
can request for new resources at any
point of time based on the requirement
on-demand capability allows consumers to
be flexible with the infrastructure and
design systems that are adaptable to
scale AWS also allows pay-as-you-go
pricing model this is the third Arsenal
in the AWS sleeve due to the scale at
which AWS operates it can provide the
cheapest per hour pricing amongst all is
providers this model allows a low entry
barrier for any type of consumer big or
small AWS has provided a fine
granulation of its services that has
varied pricing attached to it this means
for each service there are multiple
denominations for exam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
