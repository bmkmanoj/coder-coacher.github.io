about test execution so one will not be
surprised to hear when tester says I am
doing testing other than test execution
typical activities that need to be
carried out in order to achieve test
objectives would be test planning
defining test specifications test
execution test recording and test
reporting let us see a little more about
each of these activities test planning
is the initial stage of testing we plan
all the testing activities including the
resource requirement in terms of human
resource training software tools
timelines risk and mitigation etc we
will revisit this topic in detail in
session 5 in test specification stage we
derive our test scenarios test
conditions and test cases from business
requirements document we also need to
combine all these artifacts using
traceability which helps us in
determining requirements coverage
achieved during the testing effort it
also helps us in maintainability of test
deliverable in case of any changes to a
particular requirement prioritization of
test case execution will also be done at
this stage considering business risk
associated with each requirement as main
factor during test execution tester will
execute all planned test cases and
verify if the expected results matches
with the actual results this can be
carried out manually or can be automated
using appropriate tools based on type of
testing carried out test recording is
the process where tester documents all
the test results as test log as a proof
of
eugen test reports will be pulled either
manually or can be automated test
reports help in understanding the
testing progress till date or at a
frequency defined in the test plan this
will be used to evaluate the quality of
the software testing can be considered
as complete for a phase once we meet
exit criteria which is defined in test
plan test closure report is another
important deliverable to consider
testing activity as complete again this
can be at the end of testing phase or at
the end of entire project testing in
different phases document review is also
considered as part of testing it helps
in identifying defects in the early
phases of testing when executable code
is not ready document review can help
find missing or incorrect requirements
defects in the design and even
architecture of the application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
