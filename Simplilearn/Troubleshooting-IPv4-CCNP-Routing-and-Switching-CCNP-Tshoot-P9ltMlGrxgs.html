and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
troubleshooting router or switch
performance in this lesson we will focus
on troubleshooting IP v4 routing let us
begin with the objectives of the lesson
in the next slide by the end of this
lesson you will be able to troubleshoot
ipv4 interior gateway protocols
troubleshoot OSPF troubleshoot border
gateway protocol let us start our
discussion with general routing protocol
troubleshooting the command show IP
protocols provides an overview of
routing protocols it displays how
routing protocols are configured for
example it indicates if auto summary is
enabled this is one of the few commands
that displays which interfaces are
configured as passive in addition the
command shows which networks are being
advertised also it can be used to check
if process IDs or autonomous system
numbers match between routers in the
following slide let us look into
troubleshooting neighbor adjacencies
both OSPF and EIGRP have commands to
list neighbors
note that the OSPF command uses the
singular term neighbor while the EIGRP
command uses the plural of the word
neighbor if a neighbor does not appear
on the output use the ping command to
check if the neighbors interface is up
also examine if all neighbor
requirements are met accomplish this
with the show interface commands among
others for the particular routing
protocol you can find all the interfaces
that are receiving messages for a
particular routing protocol by pinging
the multicast address of that particular
protocol look at the example given on
the slide in the next slide let us focus
on troubleshooting routing problems if a
route is missing from the routing table
there are some ID
to check ensure there are no ACLs
blocking the routing traffic by issuing
the show access lists command check if
layer-3 path control tools are being
used route maps distribute lists and
offset lists can also block traffic the
show run command can be used to verify
this if the trace route command reveals
that packets are not taking the correct
routes check the default route with the
show IP route command in the next slide
let us look at distribution issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
