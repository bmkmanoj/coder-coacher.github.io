to define how various categories of
changes are assessed and authorized with
different mechanisms and activities used
to process and deliver changes based on
the change type the most generic change
types or models are normal change
standard change and emergency change by
definition a normal change is a change
that follows all of the steps of the
change process it is assessed by either
a change manager or change advisory
board and a standard change is a pre
approved change that is low-risk
relatively common and follows a set
procedure or work instruction for
example password reset or provision of
standard equipment to a new employee
emergency changes are typically defined
as a change that must be introduced as
soon as possible for example to resolve
a major incident or implement a security
patch the change management process will
normally have a specific procedure the
handling emergency changes these change
models are generic and most common and
will differ in definition and scope in
different organizations definitions of
change models ensure effective and
efficient controls of changes and
prevent change management process from
becoming a bottleneck to service
operations a key concept in change
management which is looked into at this
stage of the process is remediation
planning simply put this is a plan for
how to react if the change fails and
cannot be backed out the importance of
this plan lies in the fact that only by
considering what remediation options are
available before instigating a change
and by establishing that the remediation
is viable for example it is successful
when tested can the risk of the proposed
change be determined
the appropriate decisions taken now that
we have understood different change
types let's take a look at how the
change management process flows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
