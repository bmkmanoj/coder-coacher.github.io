financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
risk management failures this section on
financial disasters can be best
illustrated using cases which have
already occurred in the past several of
these cases are described in this
presentation which pays close attention
to their causes and also the preventive
steps in order to avoid a similar
situation in many cases there is a
desire to mislead in order to earn
higher profits poor controls and lack of
proper risk management measures are the
main causes for such failures if you
have already gone through the lectures
in financial markets there will be a
better understanding of the cases
presented here even if you have not gone
through them I have briefly explained
the required concepts so you need not
worry a gender first we will discuss
cases in which there was fraud or
misrepresentation from the company's
officials such as the case of Drysdale
securities Kidder Peabody bearings an
allied irish bank in the second type of
case you will discuss about the failures
due to large market movement as in ltcm
and metal gesellschaft lastly we'll
discuss about the failure due to
improper conduct towards customers as in
the case of Bankers Trust
dry style securities and Chase Manhattan
let us discuss the first case study of a
financial disaster involving Joyce Dale
securities and chase manhattan in 1976
Drysdale securities managed to borrow
300 million dollars through the broker
Chase Manhattan their size of the loan
was way beyond the financial capacity of
Drysdale securities it could manage to
get a loan of their size because it took
advantage of a minor flaw in the
calculation of bond values at that time
bombs were valued without considering
the accrued interest Drysdale securities
purchased these bonds and showed the
value of the bonds to be higher than
what they could be sold for in the cash
market after considering the accrued
interest Chase Manhattan also missed the
contract terms that stated that it would
be responsible for payments jus when
these bonds declined in value Drysdale
could not pay the borrowed funds and was
forced into bankruptcy Chase Manhattan
had to bear most of the losses if we
reflect on the reasons for the disaster
it was mainly due to the
misrepresentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
