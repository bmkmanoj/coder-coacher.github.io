i would like to introduce here first
let's see what process group is the
whole project management discipline is
divided into five broad process groups
they are project initiation project
planning project execution project
monitoring and control and project
closing
you probably might be aware of them as
well
when a new project starts it's in the
project initiation phase from initiation
it moves the planning the inter
execution and monitoring and control and
finally it's closed project execution
and project monitoring and control
processes go hand-in-hand so when a new
project is started that is initiated all
processes of project initiation process
group should be applied to the project
similarly when the project is being
closed all processes of project closing
groups should be applied let me give you
more specific examples identify risks is
a process of project planning group so
when the project is in planning phase
you must identify all the risks of the
project next let's see what is a
knowledge area as per p.m. be ok there
are nine knowledge areas for example
human resource management is one of the
knowledge areas knowledge area is a set
of specific processes required to be
performed to meet a project objective a
knowledge area may have some processes
to be done in project planning process
group and some other processes to be
done in project monitoring and control
process group for example if you take
human resource management knowledge area
develop human resource plan is a process
in the project planning group and
another process manage project team is
in the project execution group
lastly there are 42 process areas we
have already come across to such process
areas develop human resources plan and
manage project team if you are totally
confused by now don't worry this is the
whole exam syllabus and there is one
lesson dedicated to each one of these
topics for now just remember there are
five process groups nine knowledge areas
and 42 project management processes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
