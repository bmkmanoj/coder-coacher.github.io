like all other lessons we have also
summarized the various responsibilities
associated with quality
every project produces unique product or
service right we try to produce a
product as per the users requirements we
should always check whether it satisfies
the acceptance criteria or not correct
so we always focus on products take an
example such as constructing a house or
arranging a Christmas party at your home
or designing a new website we always
strive for good quality products or
value for money the purpose of this
theme is to define and implement the
means by which the project will create
and verify products that are fit for
purpose we know that the cost is
incurred while performing quality
management activities and so the quality
is basis for scope and quality criteria
a project manager should understand that
the estimation of costs and timelines
fully dependent on determination of the
quality criteria let</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
