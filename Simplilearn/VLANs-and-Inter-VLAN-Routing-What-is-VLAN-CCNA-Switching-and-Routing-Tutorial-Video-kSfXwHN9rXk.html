and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
layer 2 switching this lesson will deal
with VLANs and inter VLAN routing let us
begin with the objectives of this lesson
in the next slot by the end of this
lesson you will be able to explain VLAN
and related components create VLANs
discuss trunk encapsulation explain DTP
discuss the options for inter VLAN
routing in the next slide let us look at
a topology that has multiple VLANs a
single switch could have multiple VLANs
here we have VLANs 10 and 20 traffic is
separated between the VLANs to provide
security this is because a VLAN defines
a broadcast domain it is a layer 3
entity this is shown by the IP addresses
of the PCs VLAN 10 uses the subnet
192.168.1.0 / 24 VLAN 20 uses the subnet
192.168.20.10 are a single broadcast
domain they can therefore be used to
split broadcast domains decreasing the
overhead on a network segment VLANs can
enhance network security because they
separate broadcast domains VLANs allow
access to network services based on
business function not physical location
on the topology pcs a and C could be
used by accounting while PCB is used by
sales VLANs make it easy to add move and
change hosts on the network for example
if PCB used by sales is reassigned to
accounting a modification in the switch
configuration accommodates this note the
switch configuration is changed not the
PC configuration the PC does not know
which VLAN it is in the VLAN is defined
on the switch
kort each VLAN has an assigned VLAN ID
let us discuss VLAN IDs in the next
slide a layer 3 device is needed to
facilitate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
