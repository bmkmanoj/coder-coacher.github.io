ITIL capability service offerings and
agreements hello and welcome to simply
learns ITIL 2011 capability course on
service offerings and agreements
certification preparation this is the
introductory lesson provided by simply
learn on SOA I am Alex who will be with
you throughout this e-learning session
this course consists of 11 learning
units apart from this introductory
lesson therefore it is important that
you go through this lesson before
accessing the remaining 11 learning
units so what are we waiting for let's
begin with the introductory lesson
agenda we will first begin with the
objective of this lesson followed by a
few recap topics that you might have
covered during your ITIL foundation
level the topics we will cover our ITIL
basic introduction ITIL intermediate and
its relevant topics this is followed by
information about the accreditation
Institute SOA course description and its
objective we will then look and who can
attend this course next moving to the
exam section we will learn about the
exam prerequisites or say the
eligibility criteria for attending this
course exam format and the exam tips to
help you achieve this certification
lastly we will look at the SOA course
outline and the duration required for
each learning unit and details about the
quiz provided by simply learn at the end
of each learning unit so go ahead and
experience this course where the
objective of this introductory lesson is
to educate you on the courseware that
simply learn offers help you on how this
online course works ensure that you are
aware of
the topics and subtopics covered in this
course let's now move on to recap on
ITIL basics in the next slide ITIL is
the most widely adopted approach for IT
Service Management in the world it
provides a practical no-nonsense
framework for identifying planning
delivering and supporting IT services to
the business adopting ITIL can offer
users a huge range of benefits that
include improved IT services reduced
costs improved customer satisfaction
through a more professional approach to
service delivery improved productivity
improved use of skills and experience
and improved delivery of third-party
service we will study more about ITIL
under the topic Foundation basics at the
end of this lesson let us now understand
the ITIL intermediate which is the next
level in the ITIL certification ITIL
2011 intermediate level is the next
level after ITIL foundation ITIL
intermediate level has a modular
structure with each module focusing on
different aspects of ITIL they are
service lifecycle and service capability
the intermediate modules focuses more on
detail oriented study than the
foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification well
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course I am sure
the thought on how one can become an
ITIL expert must have crossed your mind
let's get the answer to this in the next
slide letters have a brief look at the
ITIL certification path the diagram in
the slide is the graphical depiction of
the ITIL
certification part ITIL certification
path is based on credit point system
that is you need to accumulate nine
credit points at each stage until expert
ITIL foundation is the first
certification which gives you two credit
points on certification on completion of
the foundation level you become eligible
to appear for intermediate level where
you can choose from the two streams one
life cycle and two capability the life
cycle modules have all the standard five
life cycle phases as exams which provide
three credits each capability modules
are more focused towards implementation
content and have four exams which
provide four credits each you can choose
any one of the modules from either
streams or make a combination on the
basis of your experience in the industry
thus at this level the minimum credit
requirement is 15
once you accumulate 15 points plus two
of foundation that is 17 credit points
makes you eligible the third level that
is ma LC which provides you five credit
points once you are certified mal see
your final score credit becomes 22 to
become an ITIL expert there is no
separate exam you need to accumulate 22
credits to get the ITIL expert
certificate I am sure we are clear on
the certification part let us understand
the service life cycle and its modules
in the next slide the service lifecycle
modules are for candidates who aspire to
handle a management or team lead role
which requires a broad management focus
on ITIL practice areas it is also the
candor
who work or coordinate across teams or
manages multiple capability areas the
different modules under service
lifecycle are one service strategy SS -
service design SD 3 service transition
st 4 service operation so5 continual
service improvement CSI similarly let's
understand service capability in the
next slide service capability modules
are for the candidates who aspire to
specialized in process level knowledge
in one or more processes which focuses
more on day-to-day execution the
different modules and the service
capability are one service offerings and
agreements SOA to release control and
validation our cv3
support and analysis osa for planning
protection and optimization PPO as with
an understanding of both the streams let
us understand the differences between
them in the next slide here is the
difference between the lifecycle and
capability if you observe you will see
that life cycle is mainly phase or inton
whereas capability is process oriented
also life cycle focuses on individuals
who work on the process whereas
capability focuses on individuals who
are in the process take a few minutes to
learn more about the differences on this
slide once you're done move on to learn
about mal C managing across the life
cycle is the last step in achieving the
ITIL expert certification therefore it
is mainly focused on individuals who
want to become ITIL X
I'm completing mal see an individual can
apply the ITIL knowledge and it provides
skills that can be used in the workplace
in a tangible way we have already
discussed on the credit system in the
certification path slide however just to
mention the mal C certification gives
you five credit points now let us
proceed to look at the accreditation
Institute for ITIL in the next slide the
governing body for ITIL 2011 Foundation
and intermediate is the Cabinet Office

PMG apart from these exercises a
glossary for your reference will be
provided at the end of this course
please note to move from one learning
unit to another you need to complete
these quiz questions with the right
answers let us proceed to recap on some
of the definitions and terms used in
ITIL the next section is on found
basics
well this section is provided to help
you refresh the learnings from ITIL
foundation here we will discuss about
service service management functions and
processes of SOA
best practices provide a set of generic
guidelines based on successful
experiences of a number of organizations
they help in defining solutions but have
to be adapted to a specific organization
let us see the list of ITIL publications
since the 1980s to 2011 in the 1980s
British government determined that the
level of IT service quality they
received was not sufficient the central
computer and telecommunications agency
CCTA
were assigned to develop a framework for
efficient and financially responsible
use of IT resources this was a joint
effort between the government and
private sector experts in 2000 the CCTA
merged into the office for government
commerce OGC Microsoft used ITIL as a
basis to develop the Microsoft
operations framework MOF in 2001 version
2 of ITIL is released the service
support and service delivery books will
redeveloped in 2007 version 3 of ITIL is
released which adopts a lifecycle
approach to service management with a
better emphasis on IT business
integration the latest version is 2011
which is currently followed in the next
slide let us look into the qualification
scheme of ITIL there are three basic
components of ITIL publications first
being the ITIL core this is the best
practice guidance applicable to all
types of organizations who provide
services to a business the core consists
of five lifecycle books and a glossary
the second component being the ITIL
complimentary guidance which are
additional books providing specific
guidance based on industry sectors
organization types etc the third being
the web support services which represent
the information available from
contributors from the industry and other
channels these together formed the basis
for developing and maintaining the
lifecycle strategies depicted in the
core volumes this is made available via
the WWI TI l - live - portal comm
website now we will discuss the five
lifecycle books and a glossary of ITIL
core publications ITIL core publications
the ITIL core library is composed of
five books or publications representing
each of the service lifecycle stages the
first book on service strategy focuses
on design development and implementation
of service management so that the IT
services are able to provide value to
business the second book on service
design provides guidance for the design
and development of services and
processes covering design principles and
methods for converting objectives of IT
organization into portfolios of services
and service assets so the service design
basically deals with design of new and
changed services that an IT organization
wants that offer to its customers the
third book on service transition colors
the development and improvement of
capabilities for transitioning new and
changed services into the live
production or operating environment so
the service transition ensures that a
new services or a change to an existing
services is properly tested and deployed
into the live production environment the
fourth book on service operation takes a
look at the different practices in the
management of service operation and
includes guidance on achieving
efficiency and effectiveness in the
delivery and support of services meaning
service operation takes of
co-coordinating and carrying out
day-to-day activities and processes to
deliver and managed IT
services the fifth book on continual
service improvement is focused on
creating and maintaining value for
customers through better design
introduction and operation of services
the aim here is to continually align IT
services the changing business needs by
identifying and implementing
improvements as we have discussed the
five lifecycle publications in this
slide now we will look into a diagram
which shows the ITIL 2011 processes and
functions across lifecycle the
illustration given on the slide
demonstrates the processes and functions
of ITIL 2011 in relation to the service
lifecycle phases the diagram also
depicts what each phase of the service
lifecycle is primarily doing
although service level management
officially sits in the service design
book it plays a very important role in
the continual service improvement phase
and therefore could also fit in the CSI
book as a process now we will learn
about the four PS which are essential
for a service designer when planning a
service
service design is one of the five stages
in the service lifecycle this stage
translates the needs and requirements of
the customers into the services they
desire service design will help you
determine your target market and how you
can differentiate your business
offerings from your competitors when
planning a service a service designer
needs to consider the 4ps people people
are in charge of providing IT services
these professionals should have the
skills and competencies required for
providing services products the products
are the tools services and technology
used in the delivery of and support of
the services processes processes support
and manage the services being offered so
that the services meet customer
expectations and agreed service levels
all processes must be measureable
partners when designing services vendors
manufacturers and suppliers should be
considered as they will be utilized to
support the service once it is life
studying ITIL service design will be
helpful in understanding how these four
PS relate to one another
fully understanding and considering the
four PS as critical success factors
unnecessary not only for a high quality
service but also for the success of that
service now we will discuss about
business and IT alignment in the next
slide the diagram divides an
organization into a number of layers
that work towards meeting a number of
organizational goals these layers are
communicated by the following one
organization organization has key goals
and objectives to business processes
these business processes enable the
objectives above to be met three IT
service organization IT services are
required to enable effective and
efficient execution of the business
processes
for IT Service Management the focus here
is on the ITIL processes required for
quality delivery and support of the IT
services above five IT technical
activities the actual technical
activities required for execution of the
ITIL processes above these are
technology specific let us know what
service does mean a service is a means
of delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes customers want to
achieve without the ownership of
specific costs and risks IT Service
Management is concerned with delivering
and supporting IT services that are
appropriate to the business requirements
of an organization this improves
efficiency and effectiveness and reduces
the risks of managing IT services in the
next slide we will discuss resources and
capabilities as well as other important
things regarding this resources and
capabilities our types of assets
organizations use them to create value
in the form of goods and services
resources are direct inputs for
production management organization
people and knowledge are used to
transform resources capabilities
represent an organization's ability to
coordinate control and deploy resources
to produce value they are typically
experience driven knowledge intensive
information based and firmly embedded
within an organization's people systems
processes and technologies it is
relatively easy to acquire resources
compared to capabilities capabilities
are developed over time the development
of distinctive capabilities is enhanced
by the breadth and depth of experience
gains from the number and variety of
customers market spaces contracts and
services a business unit is simply a
bundle of assets meant to create value
for customers
in the form of goods and services
customers pay for the value they receive
which ensures that the business unit
maintains an adequate return on asset
the relationship is good as long as the
customer receives value and the business
unit recovers casts and receives some
form of compensation or profit now we
will understand creating service value
and discuss on two primary elements
utility or fitness for purpose and
warranty of fitness for use
from the customers perspective value
consists of two primary elements utility
or fitness for purpose and warranty or
fitness for use utility is perceived by
the customer from the attributes of the
service that have a positive effect on
the performance of tasks associated with
desired outcomes removal or relaxation
of constraints on performance is also
perceived as a positive effect warranty
is derived from the positive effect
being available when needed in
sufficient capacity or magnitude and
dependably in terms of continuity and
security utility is what the customer
gets and warranty is how it is delivered
customers cannot benefit from something
that is fit for purpose but not fit for
use and vice versa it is useful to
separate the logic of utility from the
logic of warranty for the purpose of
design development and improvement
considering all the separate
controllable inputs allows for a wider
range of solutions to the problem of
creating maintaining and increasing
value let us learn what processes is and
what are the characteristics of the
process
processes can be defined as a structured
set of coordinated activities designed
to produce an outcome and provide value
to customers or stakeholders a process
takes one or more inputs and through the
activities performed turns them into
defined outputs some principles all
processes should be measurable and
performance driven not just time but
measuring overall efficiency including
cost effort and other resources used
processes are strategic assets when they
create competitive advantage and market
differentiation processes may define
roles responsibilities tools management
controls policies standards guidelines
activities and work instructions if they
are needed let us proceed to the first
module finally let's understand how does
IT Service Management relate to
corporate governance but what is
corporate governance and why is it
needed corporate governance is about
establishing corporate policies enabling
strategic direction objectives critical
success factors and key result areas for
the organization it ensures their
strategy and business plans are in place
corporate compliance provides assurance
to governance that all legal industrial
and regularity rules are being followed
while executing the corporate strategy
IT compliance is a part of corporate
compliance IT governance establishes
enables and execute the IT strategy it
establishes operations to assure high
quality compliant IT service
provisioning it also ensures effective
key result areas for the IT
organizations this marks the end of our
introductory lesson let's do a quick
recap of what we learnt so
in this lesson we discussed about what
is ITIL ITIL intermediate definition of
service lifecycle and capability we also
got some information about the ITIL
intermediate examination format itself
and looked at the prerequisite of taking
up the examination finally we covered
the objective eligible candidates SOA
syllabus and foundation basics hope you
have a clearer view of how the tutorial
works thank you and happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
