management training by simply learn
before proceeding further let us recall
what we have learned in previous lessons
lesson one gave us an introduction about
lean lesson two was a study of types of
waste lesson three discussed about
various tools used in lean lesson for
detailed about lean in manufacture while
lesson five talked about lean in service
this is lesson number six and we will
talk in detail about lean in office in
the next slide we will start with the
agenda of what we are going to cover in
this lesson and then go into detail
about lean in office
here is the agenda we will start with a
background of lean in office then talk
about lean implementation in office with
relevant examples on 5s and waist and
then summarize what we learned in the
next slide we will start with lean in
office background
in this section we will cover how lean
manufacturing principles are applied to
lean implementation in office this is
based on the original Toyota Production
system principles and adapted redefined
in the office context the objective of
lean in office is streamline and
eliminate waste from administrative
processes and adding value the office
takes information works on it and
converts it into another form of
information this is no different from
any other form of manufacturing so we
can apply any of the lean tools on this
process with a little thought this lean
process can make more improvements in
areas such as lead times than in any
other area you will also often find that
more of your delays and problems
originate from your office processes
than your shop floor processes how often
do your production people complain that
they only get a few days notice from the
six weeks lead time that the customer
gave in the next slide we will
specifically talk about lean in office
and we'll cover some of the tools and
waste identification and elimination in
office
in this section we will cover how lean
manufacturing principles are applied in
office talk about 5s implementation and
waste elimination in the next slide we
will talk about using 5s in the office</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
