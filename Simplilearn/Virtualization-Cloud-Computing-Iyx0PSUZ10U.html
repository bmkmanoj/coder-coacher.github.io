virtualization this approach to
virtualization means that applications
run in a truly isolated guest OS with
one or more of these guest OS running
simultaneously on the same hardware not
only does this method support multiple
OS but it can also support dissimilar OS
differing in minor ways for example
version and patch level or in major ways
for example completely different OS like
Windows and Linux the guest OS is not
aware that it is virtualized and
requires no modification full
virtualization is the only option that
requires no hardware assistance or
operating system assistance to
virtualize sensitive and privileged
instructions the hypervisor translates
all operating system instructions on the
fly and caches the results for future
use while user level instructions can
run unmodified at native speed the bmm
provides a standardized hardware
environment that the guest OS resides on
and interacts with because the guest OS
and the vm m form consistent package
that package can be migrated from one
machine to another even though the
physical machines the packages run upon
may differ full virtualization offers
the best isolation and security for
virtual machines and simplifies
migration and portability as the same
guest OS instance can run virtualized or
on native hardware now let's discuss the
limitations of full virtualization
the virtualization software hurts
performance which is to say that
applications often run somewhat slower
on virtualized systems than on unmerge
lized systems the hypervisor needs data
processing which means that a part of
the computing power of a physical server
and related resources should be reserved
for the hypervisor program while the BMS
appear to solve the entire problem with
regard to virtualized machines it does
bring in some level of performance
degradation it is caused by the extra
processing in terms of the instruction
translation that the hypervisor has to
do this can have a negative impact on
overall server performance and slow down
the applications the hypervisor must
contain the interfaces to the resources
of the machine these interfaces are
referred to as device drivers since
Hardware emulation uses software to
trick the guest OS into communicating
with simulated non-existent hardware
this approach has created some driver
compatibility problems the issue is that
the hypervisor contains the device
drivers and it might be difficult for
new device drivers to be installed by
users unlike on a typical PC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
