automation framework without proper
design your test may look like the image
below if you don't think and you know
without any design you may end up by
saying login test product test Add to
Cart s check out tests check out test
payments check out this shipment payment
test and payment s and etc it may be
possible that the things which you are
using here might can be used in product
tests as well it might be possible there
whatever the things which you are doing
here can be used and Add to Cart as well
these are the things which we are going
to use now length is C this key with
page object you are creating one object
for sign-in page product list one object
got one object shipment one object
payment one object order one object when
you are using the login test when you
are creating select product test it
might be using sign-in page objects as
well as product list object so it may be
possible like I have shown you just now
in the trivago in that we were using
multiple pages multiple page objects and
we were coming up with the test case and
that's what it is showing us in a form
for diagram if you want you can go
through the back but this is all we are
you going to write our permission claim
book and that's what it states
consideration whenever you create page
object design always consider these few
things always create a class for every
web page create a class for every web
page web page elements web page elements
are instance variables of pages a class
of type of element what it's saying that
whatever the elements you will be going
to write in that are always instance or
always instance variable we will be
going to do that service page would
include sign-in page
act card
which becomes a method in which object
class so there will be services pages
where you may see sign in page add to
cart page Add to Cart query
functionality or methods I will say and
then at the last we have written in
tests you create object of page like us
and call the methods so let's go with
three more slides there are will quote
with an unusal design pattern test does
not have any technical code too
complicated deal with the browser so
test will not have any technical code
okay make sure that at whatever you are
writing technically you will be writing
in the pages test called page subjects
and verifies the result test is more
readable like I've shown you it was more
readable form their subject do not
verify page load we don't verify whether
the page loaded or not okay but they
communicate with the browser these are
the syntax is what I have mentioned here
if you see here they are using way dot
uh till long but is again also in the
culture you can ignore that again okay
let's just take a look at this because
all these syntax is is what we are going
to see our cookie bake but let's take a
look these are the best practices one
can follow to make design robust and
maintainable create one page object
class for each per page create it one
page object class for each web page okay
we'll be doing that each page object
method should either return the object
on that page or should return the page
object of the next page we will see it
is this is what we call as in the layman
language linking between the classes
linking between the classes each page
objects should sell query date whether
the page is fully loaded before giving
control to the next step n theta used by
the page object should be passed through
test and should not be hard-coded
so now will not be hot pudding anything
and that's what here it is showing us a
very small example with a patron sig BMI
calculator and the test and here again
but
let me just create an architecture of
the framework and then we will see all
the things we'll be going to execute
this is my test I will be going to
create few packages inside it and I will
be going to tell you about each package
everyone has a different way to define
it and this is how I always define some
people see it as page package but I call
it as core package this core package in
this core package I will be going to
initialize all my elements in this this
is the heart of the package if something
goes wrong in this package in this
whatever I will define in this package
if something goes wrong in that nothing
will get executed nothing will be
executed second package this is the
package I am going to call it as pages
pages is here we will be going to create
all our pages means all our classes for
web pages so all the pages are
maintained right here all of the package
will call it as test cases Here I am
keeping all my test cases another
package
do tell here I'll be keeping all my
utilities on the package conflict here
I'll be keeping all my configuration
pipes
another package lost here I will be
generating all my logs related to my
project
you
you
a new folder
let's do one thing instead of creating a
boulder let's use utilize those
resources and let's go here one folder
by the name of drivers so all are
Firefox Chrome I drivers will be placed
at this location
one more folder
test data excel sheet or whatever test
data you are using you'll be putting
your test data right at this location
you
but more product screenshots it said the
project level all the screenshot will be
maintained in this folder and this is
the architecture of my framework which
will I I'll be going to create hi there
