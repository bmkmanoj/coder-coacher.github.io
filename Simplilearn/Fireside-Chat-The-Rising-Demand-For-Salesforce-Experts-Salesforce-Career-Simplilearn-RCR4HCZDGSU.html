so let's get started
then maybe you can start by providing us
just a little background on yourself and
the path you've taken to get to this
point in your career sure so I started
off in Salesforce or go quality six
years ago now and I can luckily got a
graduate job working for a consultancy
and they kind of trained me up to a
decent level where I was able to be then
enjoying a company of Salesforce
administrator and I then moved on my
work one of the leading
exchange partners called conga and then
from there I was working as a business
analyst they're dealing with kind of
inquiries to need all the way to through
supporting people and now I'm managing
director empower UK we're a consultancy
focused on startups helping people scale
with the Celsus platform fantastic great
and then just before we dive into kind
of you know our main topic today maybe
you can give us for the audience out
there may not know Salesforce is origin
story how it got to be this gigantic you
know customer relationship management
tool I'm sitting right by the tower
right now and it's just kind of
symbolize how gigantic it's becomes oh
yeah yeah sure
I mean Salesforce has one of those
classic kind of start up stories that
started out of an apartment probably not
far from you right on top Telegraph Hill
and out of an apartment two guys Parker
Harris and Marc Benioff and and they
actually founded Salesforce because they
they wanted to create CRM systems and
that um CRM systems we know servers in
the basement which cost millions of
pounds and they wanted to create a CRM
system that was as easy to use as
amazon.com so anyone has used Salesforce
else's classic anyway if I kind of
remember the tabs across the top so it's
actually modeled a bit on amazon.com and
so when they set out they wanted to make
it as easy to use as Amazon and that's
basically where they came from over the
years they started with a kind of sales
focused CRM but they've acquired and
built many many companies and now
they've turned it into a huge company
which has kind of many streams and many
products from sales service marketing
and all the way out to analytics and
things like that so yeah real classic
startup story and they they've grown
massively done very well yeah yeah and
speaking for San Francisco you can't go
anywhere without seeing the Salesforce
cloud icon most on point all right well
great so let's get into the meat of what
we want to talk about today so I think
the first thing we should touch on are
just some different applications or
interesting
caters for Salesforce thank you can
provided yeah sure I mean at our
consultants II we deal with startups a
lot and you know the majority of
products our projects are to do with
sales customer service anything like
that but and sales pause and this is
what I say to all my clients it
literally can be used for anything so
we're dealing with a company that deals
with bitcoins for their kyc process and
kyc is down to know your customers
you've just gotta gather information and
make sure we do your due diligence
before you do any financial transactions
with people and so we're building a
Salesforce community where they can
monitor that and we've also built just
work with a podcaster advertiser
recently to build systems manage their
podcasters and also built another portal
community where their podcasters can log
in and interact with their system as
well so for those sales is mainly used
for its core function there are so many
things that you can use it for and
interestingly enough our actual
consultancy we've built a lot of things
in sort of Salesforce so we've built a
an expenses at a time logging hat and
more interestingly we built something we
called empower Airbnb where people can
put laps of all around Europe and then
people inside the company can apply to
stay with them to develop parts of
Europe so and there are a lot of use
cases services commutable great and
along with that I guess that creates
more job opportunities not only you know
at Salesforce itself but at companies
that are now using it from more than
just a crm platform so I think you just
touched on a few that are in any you
know new Salesforce professions that are
interesting that are out there that
people may not know about yeah and what
I'd actually say if there are less kind
of new positions so and the positions
have always been very similarly
but as menu cuts about the consultant
and technical architect however the
specializations are becoming even more
apparent so when I started six years ago
and an admin just have to know sales was
really but now people could have a whole
host of products we could have marketing
automation
field service lightning CTQ and not only
that but they might have lightly
installed and something like that and
likely is quite specialized and all
and as we should know lightning they
they might not have a particular
expertise in it and so when I'm giving
career advice to any I'm I'm one of the
kind of main things I say is you really
need to stand out and have that
specialization and one of the best ones
at the moment is lightning for that new
UI and you know being ahead of the curve
on that one yeah I I everyone I was
right and the Salesforce user from a
marketing standpoint I definitely
noticed and you can toggle back between
lightning and the classic it does create
a new experience and I think lightning
they might have got the phrase from
light I think it seems a little lighter
a little less busy on the home page but
yeah definitely interesting
speaking of UI in integrations I think
you and I when we were preparing for
this session talked about part on and
marketing automation Salesforce
integrates with that now if you're a
part out user um you're more than likely
going to be also a Salesforce users so
maybe you can touch on the various
integrations that Salesforce has with
popular marketing automation email
marketing tools things like that yeah I
mean sales force acquired exact target
number of number of years ago I think
was about six years ago when I started
and and over the years they've built up
really tight integrations with these
marketing automation platforms so
powerful marketing cell being being the
main two and how I was saying that you
know if you're out there and you have a
product like my head HubSpot or
MailChimp or something like that and
you'd be behind the times not to
integrate with Salesforce you've really
be blocking yourself into a corner
because Salesforce is the world's most
popular CRM by quite a margin I think
twenty around twenty percent I think in
the closest to that is around ten
percent and so you know if you're not
integrating with Salesforce then you're
really doing something wrong and so and
that's one of the benefits of having
Salesforce as well because whatever
whatever other products you you have in
your software stack its most probable
that one of them very most of them will
integrate into Salesforce itself and if
there's not an app really available you
can build one yeah yeah definitely I
think
along with that and as you mentioned
it's got a twenty percent mortgage here
at not we know of at least um how does
it we know why do you why do you think
that is why is it become so popular I
mean now it's at a critical mass there's
no stopping it but what do you think
separated it from other competitors when
it was first getting popularity I think
it's really innovation
I mean Ford's and rated Salesforce one
of the most it's got the number one spot
quite a few years number two
occasionally a lot of good companies
could be with nowadays but yeah they
just constantly innovate and and they've
also created this amazing culture around
the company and the platform and that
really kind of brings people together
pushes people to learn more about
Salesforce like the online community and
things like that so you know if anyone
has any questions or problems anything
like that you know there's a place to
help you online and I think that kind of
coupled with the fact that they've just
put so much effort into making their
system that's easy customizable and
integratable as possible that it's just
the clear winner for so many companies
and you know ever since they started to
I don't know exactly when but you know
have these other products Suites like
marketing automation or customer service
or CPU and you know you can start with
sales cloud or service cloud like a lot
of a lot of people do and then you know
the roadmap is there for you so once
you've done sales let's do service and
then once you've done that let's do
marketing automation and I think other
companies what while they might have you
know a good CRM product is isolated in
the fact that they don't have that that
roadmap there and yeah that couple would
apart with innovation you know sales
this is a clear winner for a lot of
companies yeah then I think it's a good
segue now that we've touched on how
popular Salesforce is obviously that
goes right into demand for actual people
who can manage in do these amazing
things and Salesforce so you know we
look at the topic for today's webinar on
the increased demand for for Salesforce
experts why do you think there's a
shortage of professionals that so I
guess what we're saying is supply is not
meeting to make any demand yet but
why do you think that is is just
expanding so fast it's interesting
because instead of second ago you know
Salesforce is reaching out at a critical
mass and I think it is and however one
of the reasons I think possibly this is
short of it I don't think sales was kind
of a household name that other
comforters competitors do and unless
you're in the business you own a company
where you work with a company knew
Salesforce very very unlikely they
actually know what else was it and it's
not a consumer facing company even
though that the third largest enterprise
and software company in the world so I
think and you know six years ago you are
the average person on the street I
really don't think they know what else
it is I think that really is starting to
change especially that people are in
business and so I think it's just that
knowledge of it and you know when people
find out about Salesforce they get
really excited and and it's yeah I think
we're coming to that fact where people
are starting to kind of realize what it
is and the power that hazard and also it
powers a lot of interesting companies
and you know like it's Dreamforce there
was the showcases where I think t-mobile
21st Century Fox and Adidas and so you
know all of these big brands around the
world are using Salesforce and I think
that it's coming to light you know well
in the near future I think we will reach
a critical mass of people now realizing
what Celsus is and how powerful is and
also that there's a you know anyone can
have an amazing career out of it as well
yeah yeah absolutely and so uh just to
wrap up this this part of getting to
know Salesforce if we can just kind of
wow people with some of the bigger you
know clients in these cases for
Salesforce across the globe I'm sure
there's some really big names by
Salesforce yeah so the ones I just
mentioned so team of already this 21st
Century Fox Bart agent coca-cola has got
some very very high profile and
implementations Unilever won most of the
big big pharma companies I think about
all of them use Salesforce and I
couldn't find the exact statistic but I
did hear it somewhere that is about 90
percent or 95 percent to 41
that actually use Salesforce and so as
you know it's big yeah yeah so I you
know after touching on the popular in
Salesforce and I think you mentioned you
know if you may not know about
Salesforce you get a job maybe it's your
first job in the business world whether
it's in marketing sales operations you
find out what Salesforce is and you kind
of go okay wow you know somebody trying
to give you a as a part of your
onboarding maybe you know they're
writing on a whiteboard and try to
explain to you how objects and lead
records and contact record supports work
and you're just like well so maybe you
can give us an idea of what tools and
resources are out there to help people
one get familiar and two to really
develop their skills obviously simply
learn as one but you know we're not
afraid for you to touch on any others
out there simply learn or align the
certification right which can help you
get a more advanced job in the
Salesforce world so yeah if you can talk
to that a little bit yeah I mean
Salesforce has always been very open you
know I've been hiding this material
behind Chinese walls you know it's been
very opening providin applicant wants
people to learn it big one they want
people to get again to the industry so
there's always been you know developer
walls have always been free you know you
can sign up for a developer right now
and get Salesforce and start practicing
so there's free tools such as such as
that and trail head is is an obvious
kind of winner that's that's come around
in recent time so trail head has come
here towards people learning the
Salesforce platform and I think actually
the reason it came about is because
Salesforce have a bit of a problem we're
an IDC released a paper for the last
couple of years and those recent one was
released in October that said by 2022 X
3.3 million jobs to come in to the sales
or speaker system we're not just
Salesforce themselves but the partners
that the users that actually use
Salesforce and tells us to have a
problem if they want to grow at the rate
they're growing which is about 25
percent 30 percent year-on-year they
have to enable the general
market out there to be able to learn
Salesforce so and trailhead is really
good for the learning Salesforce and
however if you want to get certified and
there are and you know there are
resources out there simply learn it is a
great one so simply there is a
prepackaged course that is very focused
on getting you certified and the two
main ones are the administrator and
platform app builder and developer I
believe as well now and so you know
these are geared towards you getting
your certification while trailhead is
geared towards you learning about the
Salesforce platform and so you know
whatever kind of budget you have there's
something out there for you whether you
know that's no budgets all you know if
there is there is out there or if you
have a bit of money to play around with
and you know you can you can really get
yourself up to learn about Salesforce
but also most importantly you get
certified on it yeah so it sounds like
trail and more to get up to speed ramped
up so you can do the core competencies
of your job and then something like a
simply learn to really develop your
skills and help you start advancing up
that career water yeah so speaking of
simpler and what we offer
how can people use simply learns
training courses to get up to speed and
train quickly you know that is to say
how does simply learns training work
yeah so we've got a bunch of different
material some of it written some of it
videos and it's all self-paced and so
you know if you're looking to get
satisfied very quickly you could
probably do it and we you know crash
course do it in a week and use the Tabas
duplication online or go to a test
center and or if um spaced out units or
full-time jobs and it enables you to do
that and so as mentioned the courses is
really geared to you getting your stiff
occasions so sales force material for a
certification can be founded on on sales
force use websites else's University and
there you'll find that each
certifications broken down into is a
very distinct areas one like these
security process automation at parenting
Cynthia's course is geared towards those
exact exact groups of knowledge you need
to learn
so yeah it was very impressed when I saw
it yeah and I think you just you just
touched on this I was going to pose to
you you know when it comes to learning
Salesforce how might someone that is
very interested they say there's not
familiar with Salesforce maybe they'd
taken some free training maybe they've
taken some of simple arms but you know
we've kind of identified these major
avenues that you can go down Salesforce
administrator developer or the platform
app builder you know how might someone
you know look at those and determine
what's right for them so there is some
overlap but it's pretty distinct kind of
different so I mean all three of those
are I guess you know entry-level kind of
certifications and so the administrator
is very geared to standard functionality
on sales and service cloud but there is
an element of extending it with you know
any sales as implementation needs to be
customized to fit for the business so
and the administrator does have an
element of customization extending the
Celsus platform with declarative
functionality so it's clarity of meaning
no code and platform app builder is all
geared towards extending the Salesforce
platform with declarative functionality
and so less to do with the the standard
features like quoting or managing your
needs magnetic or pipeline but how do I
use process automation to completely
automate business processes and things
like that
and while the developer certification is
is geared towards pro programmatic
customizations of Salesforce so using
effects or visual courts which is a
Texas Salesforce's programming language
and visual forces the custom UI language
and so if kids was using that to extend
the sales platform and so they're kind
of three very distinct but you know if
you're looking to get ahead in
Salesforce live into the pressure career
you really need all three and admin
needs to I mean well and admin might
also not necessarily know how to code so
I'll give it
and if you're a developer you know you
do need to know about the standard
configuration because you know why would
you go about building something custom
if they're not aware of a bit standard
functionality which is there and will do
it for you so yeah all three are very
important to know but saying that admins
should be aware of what is what is
available to a developer so when will
they need a developer to extend
functionality
so someone that is maybe on this on this
webinar now as an attendee is interested
in you know going down as career path
where would someone what if maybe what's
a job title or role that someone new to
the world of Salesforce could expect to
start they're fresh out of college
university they don't they maybe have
none or one year of actual business
experience where can they expect to
start and so I mean the kind of job
titles I guess would would be the ones
you just touched on so has been
consultant or developer or something
like that and you know junior or put the
words graduate in front of it something
like that because you know it's not it's
not just graduates that can get into
sales sources it's actually anyone that
thinks there's value in it and likes the
kind of like the kind responsibility to
be undertaken and however saying that
there are a lot of other roles available
to you for example sales operations sale
sales administrator or something like
that and so actually maybe less on the
Salesforce side but system on the
business process side and if that is
available to you you know go ahead
because that gives you exposure to
Salesforce but also the business process
side and and anyone that's involved in
the more you know I mean less that kind
of develop a bit more of the business
side and the customization Salesforce
really needs to understand how
businesses work how sales processes work
how customer support processes work and
all of that kind of AD hands up to being
being very knowledgeable and effective
at your sales job and so yeah I mean
those are those are three pretty and
pretty good routes to sort of
administrator developer or going down
consult
okay and in terms of companies that are
more likely to give you that type of
opportunity an idea of what that looks
like but just so we can be clear to the
audience you know the types of companies
that might hire someone entry-level and
have the opportunities for them there
obviously as a Salesforce customer but
they can offer kind of a growth path for
someone who wants to build their
Salesforce career yeah and I mean if you
found out that you know a company has
Salesforce you know it's always worth
seeing if they need some extra help or
something like that and also
consultancies are very very good I mean
that's why I start that's where a lot of
my friends started out in Salesforce and
the reason consultancies are so good is
because consultancies find it very easy
to train people up on Salesforce it is
very easy to learn to platform you know
the things it's for an admin it's all
pointing click so you know add new
fields create a process automation
things like that and when you're
surrounded by cells as consultants you
know that that knowledge is very easy to
pick up so and consultancies by doing
that because they can train these not
very quickly and they can put them on
projects great away you know with
supervision and another good place to
look is mantra profits so sales will
actually give 10 free licenses to any
nonprofit that wants it and which is
obviously amazing and you know it's a
sales has always been built to kind of
to give back from the communities and
that's one thing and however so a
non-profit you know they they often
don't have bags of money lying around to
pay expensive consultancies so and if
you're looking for an entry-level job
that's also a very very good place to
start and we might touch on this in a
bit but you know if you're looking for
experience as well that's also a very
good you know even if it's pro bono and
working for a work working for a charity
a not-for-profit it's a great way to get
experience and and you know and they
might and they might also have a job
offer so yeah those some good places
yeah and then you know you you're you're
you're in that state you want to go find
that job to get you in if you know most
people now these days are job
online what are the the job titles that
you know aside from searching job title
contains Salesforce but what are some of
those entry-level job titles look like I
think it is kind of they they're pretty
self-explanatory airline asthma asthma
consultants Iacon you have yeah no you
do get the ones like as I mentioned
before like sales ops but I mean saying
that you know in job descriptions that
you know there's a lot of weird titles
flying around nowadays so it's always
working those certain sales systems if
you'd actual job description because and
there's a lot of different words for
sales sales ops administrator or
something like that you know assisting
the sales team with with their deals and
with Salesforce and improving business
processes and things like that so you
know the title might be something off
but in the in the description it might
actually say you know one of your
responsibilities is to customize
Salesforce improve business processes
and work with a Salesforce administrator
to you know improve sales or things like
that so yeah it's always worth looking
into the job a bit deeper than just the
title yeah
and I think I already brought this up
just a second ago that most of the jobs
that you can find in Salesforce world
will be posted online as most jobs are
these days but what platforms online job
markets might you suggest people start
looking at whether it's LinkedIn glass
store in need yeah I mean yeah pretty
pretty much name the top ones and what I
would also say is that because
Salesforce is such a hot market and
recruiters are having an absolutely
great time because you know they because
they you know people company need
Salesforce professionals and usually
using job boards you know isn't it mean
you know you get applicants that you
have to sort of food in yourself and
stuff like that and recruiters kind of
take over that responsibility and and
that is very expensive for companies
however for candidates you know that's a
fantastic opportunity I would say speak
to recruiters and builds up you know a
nice network use feature recruiters and
find out what they can do for you
because you know something better than
others Haemon has really invested it in
in growing you and can work with you
long time because they will you know
they will go out there and they'll find
ten jobs that
good match for you and then you can
pursue them so yeah get them to do the
work yeah and then know you're reaching
out to these recruiters that they're
reaching out to you and as you mentioned
and recruited rounding a great time
meaning there are a lot of people that
want to do this they're out there how
might someone make themselves stand out
in that you know resume cover little
cover letter process you know aside from
being very explicit I will I really want
to develop my Salesforce skills I'd like
to do it for your company but maybe they
have existing skills whether they're
fresh out of college or have a little
work experience but what might those
kind of soft skills look like that might
you know lend themselves to a Salesforce
career in a while someone to stand out
within that application process yeah
it's a good question actually because I
think a lot of people might
underestimate their soft skills and what
actually you know a lot of your folks on
the technical and go you know I've done
X badges on trail head and/or I got
stiff occasions and things like that
which is also great but you know if
anyone's been in a sales job which a lot
of people have because it's often an
entry that would job you know just
understanding that sales process is a
massive bonus because you know
Salesforce at its core well if this core
system in the sales file and you know
understanding how salespeople work I
think cutter use systems is very
valuable so if you're otherwise in sales
what the salespeople then you know shout
about that a bit and also client facing
you know it's consultancy anything
you've done which is quite facing you
know is going to be extremely important
and but what I would say it's soft
skills are very important you know that
they're all they are and very comparable
to the technical skills and and you know
I've always said and especially when I'm
hiring people you know I'd much rather
work with someone that's easygoing
willing to learn rather than someone you
might be a bit better than technical
side but it's a bit hard to work with
and so yeah definitely focus on those
those soft skills and anything by client
facing sales or custom sportswear like
applying for some music Service Cloud or
even marketing you know and any exposure
you've had before is is all great yeah I
know
I can definitely vouch for the one who
is used Salesforce and marketing
capacity it's not just the technical
skills that make you stand out I mean
when you use Salesforce you're talking
about stakeholders in your company from
all over your operations you have sales
leaders who rely on Salesforce data to
look at every day to see how the
company's doing needs wise revenue wise
so you definitely do it pinged by a lot
of different people with a lot of
different you know interests in terms of
miking said sales forces used more and
more across the organization in today's
world so yeah thanks for pointing out
those those kind of interpersonal and
soft skills that someone might need to
rely upon to be successful in Salesforce
we're going to get into the real demand
right now in event I think we can also
call out some salary expectations for
the participants today but let's just
start with this segment with how safe is
a Salesforce career in terms of job
prospects and demand it I think made it
a little obvious to this point I'm going
to speak to that yeah I mean other
ventures area Celsus is bearing 25
percent year-on-year and every time they
grow you know I think people when you
know their Salesforce themselves
obviously and they're growing and but
then there's the customers they're
bringing you on board and these
customers are usually growing as well
you know people at Salesforce L that you
know you use their product and it will
help your business grow
Chris revenue so these customers are
growing and they need more sales force
personnel to support that and they've
also got that app exchange ecosystem
which I don't know how many apps it's
got but you know hundreds of
applications and these each application
is run by computers these other other
sports so and then you have
consultancies on top of that so you know
the ecosystem is huge and it's and it's
it's growing very very fast so I would
say that job market is extremely safe
you know I don't want to set on Justin
foolproof but and I think something very
important to note is that let's just say
you know 10 15 years time as
sales as killer or something like that
and the skills you're learning becoming
a Salesforce admin consultant developer
whatever are extremely transferable you
know Salesforce is a system at the end
day so when you're learning about
business process re-engineering and you
know gathering use requirements and
things like that if it sells was killer
did come out which I find very unlikely
you know there will be another system
you had to learn but essentially all
these skills you picked up would be
extremely funny go elsewhere so and you
know it's not it's not just focusing on
Salesforce here but you know maybe you
know in a few years you do get up do you
get fed up and you're looking for
another challenge we want to switch to
another industry and the skills you're
picking out they're completely
invaluable so yeah you know yes Ryan has
promised I'm going to call out some
expected salaries we have data for the
US and India so we've touched on
Salesforce administrator as being you'd
say in terms of specific Salesforce
careers Modi the entry-level the less
advanced maybe a developer and platform
builder would you say that done um maybe
I mean it's not less it's a different if
it's difficult sir yeah so I mean yeah
really depends your background I
probably thought all three of them kind
of on the same level okay well for
Salesforce administrators in the US
indeed comm gives us in ninety thousand
dollars a year salary estimation and in
India that looks like four hundred and
ten thousand rupees per year for
Salesforce administrator we also data on
Salesforce developer from Indy comm one
hundred nine thousand dollars in the US
and five hundred ten thousand rupees in
India just to give those of you out
there a bit of an expectation of course
that information is available online for
you to look at and find for yourself but
we did want to pull it out if anybody
out there was you know weighing one of
the other literally right now there you
go to tie this up say you have a you
know five or more years of real-world
business experience
maybe it's not in Salesforce let's say
not in Salesforce but you're familiar
with it but now you've attended this
fantastic fireside chat and you were
very interested in it what are the ideal
backgrounds for the three main job
titles were talking about administrator
developer app builder um so what I would
say is that you know I mean it what the
person say is if you're not from a
background of five years or anything
like that Salesforce is still a very
viable option for you and with
trailheads Salesforce started this
trailblazer campaign where they
highlight stories where people have you
know maybe not had the best job not
being happy in it and haven't progressed
their career in quite a few years and
then they've learned Salesforce using
trailhead and now they're earning you
know six figures as you pointed out so
you know those are pretty amazing
stories where people have not come from
a tech background and saying that though
there are definitely backgrounds where
you know you're maybe better placed or
you you know you pick up Salesforce
quicker and so if you're a developer a
Texas user is very similar to Java so
for a Java developer where you
understand languages like Java switching
over to Salesforce is going to be pretty
painless you know it's not going to be
too bad you might need to take a cut in
salary or something like that but you
know once you learn sales what's that
that cut you know will almost definitely
be made up over the over the next few
years and so I mean backgrounds I would
say again anyone in sales or who
understands business process you know
very well-placed become an administrator
or or a platform app builder and
from a developer yeah anyone who
understands coding or anything like that
or even if you don't you know it is a
challenge to learn coding and I think
that's where the difference in salary
comes because you know being a being
able to code is very in-demand skill at
the moment and but I mean at the end of
the day cell source is a database that's
all that is so any background in
computer science no matter what it is
you you'll probably have a little bit of
an they make up there just just cuz you
understand how this works okay
yeah fair enough we were to that point
in our chat today where we're going to
feel some of these great questions that
have been coming in I see one that ties
into kind of what we've been talking
about in the in the in the last few
minutes someone posed a question what
demands a higher salary a typical
developer role or a consultant developer
so in-house versus consultants what it
would have you seen in your market
that's a good question actually I'm just
trying to figure some figures up top of
my head if I would say pretty similar
because and I mean you say consultant
developer and the job is kind of similar
your you're not necessarily client
facing so you know a developer in a big
company I mean you know big companies
usually have developers and you know
you're working on customer requirements
but that customer is you're you know one
one customer and if you're in a
consultancy you're working on multiple
customer requirements that essentially
you're not clapping and so I haven't
saved pretty similar however if it
wasn't edge I would probably say if you
are a developer of consultancy you
probably will have a little bit of a leg
up on people who are working for an
end-user okay and basically just to just
add on to that and we've got a few
developers in our company and that
really wants to become a client focus so
now they are meeting facts and things
like that and you know that is verging
on to the area of becoming a technical
architect and you can definitely become
a Content quiet X for learning within a
learning within an end-user and I think
possibly my gesture quicker from a from
a consultancy so I think possibly the
opportunities bit greater in a
consultancy me as an end-user yeah and
along with that I think it might have
been the same person out there who asked
the question what do you see as the pros
and cons as a developer in-house or
plantation versus consultant
yeah 300 of us yeah no I would say that
if you want to learn as much as possible
and you want to accelerate your career
as much as possible join a consultancy
because you know I work for an end-user
and I loved it and it was it was great
fun I learned a lot however in a
consultancy is a lot more demanding and
you do get paid more especially if
you're kind of if you're moving from an
admin to a like business analyst
consultant you will get paid more and
but you know you're dealing with so many
different customers so many different
quirements different use cases of
Salesforce and and in all it is it is
more stressful and however I think the
opportunity to learn from a consultancy
is a lot greater than end-user but then
again it depends on the end user you
know the end user I work for was
relatively small if you're working for a
developer for Barclays or something like
that you know I can't imagine that being
too dissimilar from working a
consultancy because you're going to have
requirements from loads of different
departments like it was loads of
different clients and so I would always
say to people you know if you're if you
want to take on as much as physically
possible and learn as much as physically
possible then go to a consultancy ok
that's great we had a question posed how
do you get opportunities related to
Salesforce when you're fresh out of
college a university because most
businesses that are hiring to those
roles like a lot of jobs that people
press out of college fine require two to
three years experience minimum so if
you're so interested in that I think we
test on you know the three options in
terms of training Salesforce I mean
simply when training in Salesforce for
kind of getting that certification you
can slop on your resume and stand out
but you know you're fresh out of college
what might you do to in lieu of two to
three years of experience to try to get
that job yeah I mean it is you know it
is a challenge and
there are roots out there so and someone
actually wrote a post on my blog a
couple of weeks ago cause how do I get
cell source experience and the things he
pointed out was some things I have so
trying to find a charity or non-profit
you can volunteer for and that that is
always appreciated it will demonstrating
that you can work with real-life clients
and trailhead is obviously a good one
you know demonstrating you have a
hundred badges or something like that
you know I think does impress hiring
managers and probably not as much as
experience it's probably just Undine Oh
volunteering for a real life nonprofit
and in addition to that you've got super
badges on trailhead which are much
bigger challenges and actually a kind of
like real world problem so there's that
as well and I'd also recommend you know
trying to apply to consultancies because
as I said especially in the UK market
people are very very willing to take on
people with no experience and have the
right mindset the right Drive and if you
have computer science background or you
know you can get exposure to that that's
probably a bonus and because they know
for a fact they can very bluntly they
can train you up very quickly and bill
you out for quite a lot of money so you
know it's a win is a win win win for
them and with you because you get
trained up and you in a perfect
environment for it so I said those are a
few options you can explore okay oh good
we have clearly on the sales user out
there because the question how can I
increase my sales using Salesforce was
opposed probably not as easy of that but
maybe you can speak to streamline
processes and how you know using a
platform so advanced Salesforce can make
your job easier as a salesperson focus
more on revenue generating activities
yeah I mean if you're I mean you know
this is this is why people with my sales
force they want to increase their
revenue at the end the day you know
usually the sales team driving it or
sales manager or or something like that
and I mean if you compare kind of to
enter the spectrum like Excel and
Salesforce you know Excel you're just
entering data but it's giving you no
insight is just like a notepad you might
as well be writing at the phone book but
they also has a
lot of a lot of functionality and
features out the box a few manage states
so you can manage your leads you can
ensure that sales reps are qualifying
leads with a minimum amount of
information before you can progress them
on to the next step and then you've got
opportunity management you can connect
your inbox you can log emails and you've
got an forecasting and so you can see
you know what what stage your deals are
in and where they're getting held up and
then you've also got very very powerful
reporting module at Salesforce but you
can dig into why our deal is progressing
what the common reason we're losing
deals and all of this stuff is
relatively easy to set up you know you
do need some sales as small as to do it
and you know a consultancies generally
pull these quick starts where we go in
and we set it up very quickly for for
your business and customize it so and
yeah there's a lot of quick wins at
Salesforce and when you compare it
something like excel you really
understand why you're paying this money
for a system that Salesforce okay yeah
next which we had another question it's
one of the technical side on in which
programming language is was Salesforce
developed you know I'm sure that's a
really good question I mean I would
presume apex well let me pose let me put
this to you then can we assume that
knowledge of HTML and java would lend
themselves to where I think you've
already touched on a pack Java being
similar hTML is more of a when facing
language but maybe any other any other
coding languages that think might lend
themselves to a sale force I mean any
knowledge with AP is and connecting
other systems is extremely valuable
because I would say most project maybe
not most but maybe 40% of projects we we
deal with will have some form of into
custom integration our developers are
dealing with so and that you know that
is any yeah skill set around API is very
valuable job as you mentioned and HTML
and CSS is that and yet JavaScript
actually is what lightning is built on
so that's very valuable and HTML and CSS
is required to some degree when you're
dealing with communities and building
external sites or if you're some aspects
of visualforce actually require some CSS
knowledge as well so you know any but in
saying that you know I'm pretty sure
apex is an object-oriented language like
Java so any kind of object-oriented
language that people have experiences in
is gonna be very transferable to
learning apex very good very good
and these someone some of the pose a
question I don't know if this is
possible but we requested any way they
can download Salesforce code to play
around with it this is beyond my
technical expertise so you tell me at
that Salesforce code I mean the main
discourage me I mean I mean I mean where
you can start playing ourselves as you
sign up for a developer org you can do
it right now time to be we'll develop
ourselves as developer or be signed up
right away and in five minutes you'll
have access to your own Salesforce
environment and this sales environment
actually has like every single feature
enabled so I think it's only got two
user licenses so you can't really go
into that using actual your actual
business but and you know there are
restrictions on it but it has most
features available you can start writing
codes you can start playing around with
the declarative features and you can
enable products like you can enable
service clouds and I think my colleague
needed to be able service lightning the
other day in an orc so you know you can
start playing around with that and so
while you can't like download the sales
or source code it's all hidden you can
get access to a developer straightaway
and then you can connect Aang's
trailhead and if anyone doesn't know
what trailhead is it's kind of a
challenge based system where it will say
go and implement this automation process
and so you can go and do that press
check it will actually check your
developer wall to make sure you've done
it correctly and then give you points
and things like that
so yeah very powerful for knowing
actually if you're doing things right or
not okay let's bring it back to to the
simple learn training offering what kind
of eligibility or pretty what
prerequisite knowledge might someone
need to enroll in one of our course
anything I'm not a huge amount I mean it
goes through you know from the basics to
the more advanced so I mean I would say
you know you know have a look around
make sure Salesforce is the right career
view maybe log in to a developer will do
a few trail heads but not not a massive
amount really no symptoms course does go
through through everything from you know
the basics all the way up to some of the
more advanced things great well then I
we have run through more questions and I
think we covered a lot of great stuff is
there anything that I've missed that you
think might be worth knowing for the
audience out there I think we span quite
a bit of topics yeah the one thing I'd
say that I tell a lot of people even
some of my friends and family you know
don't look into Salesforce a that's
right for you and you know a lot of
people kind of go yeah okay looking kind
of forget about it but and you know it
is a very very rewarding career and it
you know talks and maybe get a few there
must be and someone you know who's
involved with it or or message me on
Twitter or something like that and but
you know it's a very very rewarding
career and it's very you know rewarding
in a kind of personal sense and
financially as well and so I'd say you
know if you're on this webinar and
you're you're kind of thinking about it
and kind of find that motivation from
somewhere to really look into it sign up
for develop or sign up simply don't sign
up for the trailhead and really push
forward and trying 9 yourself a job
because this industry isn't slowing down
anytime soon and you know too quickly
you can get into it or quickly you can
start reaping the rewards
great we did have one one final question
come in before we start to wrap things
up what kind of opportunities are there
for someone who is fairly advanced in IT
a very technical professional 15 years
is what this this participant asked what
happened in my day go down if they
worked in IT and they said okay you know
what I'm going to focus in on Salesforce
great off job opportunities
and I would say you know you kind of
have to take the same route as everyone
else which is quite a story ahead
develop organ and possibly simply learn
if you will get certified and I think
the difference is your learning curve
will just be massively accelerated and
if you've got 15 years in in industry I
think you'd be able to you know manage
yourself the drawl a lot quicker than
maybe someone do is starting from
scratch because you know you'll
fundamentally understand how developing
languages work how computer science and
computer science works and so yeah I
would just say kind of take the same
path I've mentioned but you know if
you've got 50 years you know you'll have
no problem landing a job once you've got
certified or you've got kind of that
base foundation knowledge yeah and then
someone also asked about JavaScript
knowledge and I think you touched on
that that lends itself very well to it
to Salesforce as well - lightning yeah
that's actually we've just had it we
didn't have a huge amount of expertise
in JavaScript in our consultancy but
we've just got some of us very well and
that mean we can we can do a load more
projects in Salesforce lightning and so
if you've got JavaScript knowledge that
will really really help you with one
sales forces newest and best features so
yeah that's a great one though great
well we're going to we're going to cut
the questions off there just in the
interest of time I think I mentioned at
