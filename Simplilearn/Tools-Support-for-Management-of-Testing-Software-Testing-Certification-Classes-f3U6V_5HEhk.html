be the management of tests or it could
be managing the testing process the
tools in this broad category provides
support for either or both of these we
can further classify these tools as test
management tools requirement management
tools configuration management tools and
incident management tools test
management tool at all that provides
support to the test management and
control part of a test process is
referred to as test management tool
features provided by test management
tools include managing tests scheduling
logging test results traceability
support interface with test execution
incident management requirement
management configuration management
status report generation and version
control example for test management
tools our Quality Center rational
Quality Manager some tools will provide
all of these features others may provide
one or more of the features however such
tools will still be classified as test
management tools requirements management
tool a tool that supports the recording
of requirements requirement attributes
for example priority person responsible
and annotation and facilitates
traceability through layers of
requirements and annotation and
facilities traceability through layers
of requirements and requirements change
management some requirements management
tools also provide facilities for static
analysis such as consistency checking
and violations to predefined
requirements rules our requirements
management tools really testing tools
some people may say that they are not
but they do provide some features that
are very helpful to testing because
tests are based on requirements the
better the quality of the requirements
the easier it will be to write tests for
them features provided by requirements
management tool include storing
requirement statements generate unique
identifiers checking consistency of
requirements prioritizing requirements
for testing purposes and managing
traceability through levels of
requirements configuration management
tool provide support for the
identification and control of
configuration items their status
versions and the release of baselines
consisting of configuration items
configuration management tools are not
strictly testing tools either but good
configuration management is critical for
control testing as was described in
session 5 features of configuration
management tools include storing
information about versions and Bill's of
the software and test where traceability
between software and test ware and
different versions of variants keeping
track of which versions belong with
which configurations build and release
management base lining and access
control incident management tool is also
known as defect tracking tool a defect
management tool a bug tracking tool or a
bug of management tool incident
management tools make it much easier to
keep track of the incidents over time
characteristics of incident management
tools include support for incident and
logging change requests provide incident
or anomaly report and other incident
management report examples of incident
management tool are starting and
