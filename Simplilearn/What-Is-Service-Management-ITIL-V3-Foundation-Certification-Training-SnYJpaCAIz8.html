Drucker a renowned American management
guru quality in a product or service is
not what the supplier puts in it is what
the customer gets out and is willing to
pay for some time back we defined
service management as an effective and
efficient process driven management of
transforming IT resources into valuable
IT services let me explain this further
by means of a diagram as you can see in
this diagram it emphasizes the link that
has to be preserved between the desired
business outcomes and the services that
service management is responsible for so
what do we mean by capabilities
resources and other terms used in the
graphic capabilities are the functions
and processes used to manage services
capabilities are intangible assets of an
organization and cannot be purchased but
have to be developed and matured over
time resources is a generic term that
includes IT infrastructure people money
or anything else that might help to
deliver an IT service resources are the
tangible assets of the organization
resources and capability put together
constitute the surface assets for
example email as a service the
organization's say Google providing this
service needs to have some hardware like
servers routers switches to relay emails
and software like Gmail to let users
read their emails these are example of
assets they also need a capable team to
manage their assets and the money
required to procure these assets but if
Google's customers don't know how to get
this email service all of these assets
go to waste so how to get an email
account how to maintain it where to go
for support if any issues occur
some of the critical underlying elements
of delivering email service these
methods are called processes we will
touch on them in a little while but
before that let me explain two more
terms performance and value performance
is a measure of what is achieved or
delivered by a system person team
process or IT service from our email as
a surface example effective use by all
users number of mails delivered to the
intended recipient etc are part of the
performance measure of email service and
value is a measure of the return on
investment of benefits to the business
so going back to our example of email as
a service in older days messaging used
to happen through paper memos if
somebody had to convey a message they
would get it in type written on a piece
of paper and then a courier service
would deliver it to the recipient at
some point in time organizations realize
the constraints their method of message
delivery had on the organizational
capability to deliver to its customers
luckily for them somebody realized the
constraints and invented email which has
since then revolutionized the messaging
capabilities of the organizations the
result of using this service allowed
businesses and organizations to spread
across geographies it has also
contributed to faster decision-making
and execution due to speedier flow of
information and ultimately contributes
to a greater revenues and profits for
the business or the organization for the
business or the organization or in other
words it has enhanced the business
outcomes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
