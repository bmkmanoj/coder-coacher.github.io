and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
VLANs and inter VLAN routing this lesson
will deal with spanning tree and ether
channel let us begin with the objectives
of this lesson in the next slide by the
end of this lesson you will be able to
explain the various aspects of CST
protocol including root bridge election
and processing differentiate between 802
1d and PBS t differentiate between 802
1d and RSTP lists the operations of
spanning tree commands explain the
advantages of ether channel configure
ether channel let us discuss the
underlying reason for spanning tree
redundancy
network availability is important for
the users to access it redundancy is
used to keep the network operational
there are different types of redundancy
the first type is redundant links this
means there is more than one connection
between devices such as ether channel
redundancy is also provided by redundant
paths this is when there is more than
one way to reach a device a device can
have more than one interface through
which it can receive packets from
another device there is also redundancy
in the form of redundant devices here
more than one device can perform a
function for example two cisco firewalls
can be configured for failover
meaning if one of them fails the other
immediately takes over therefore
redundancy is good but it can have
unintended side effects let us discuss
spanning tree protocol in the following
slide redundancy can lead to three
problems at spanning tree protocol STP
can solve in the switching domain namely
broadcast storms duplicate frames and
Mac table instability this is because
loops form when there are redundant
links and redundant paths spanning tree
is enabled by default for all virtual
local area networks VLANs always enable
STP
on all switches in the lair - domain if
STP is disabled bridging loops are not
detected and prevented let us move on to
the next topic
switching problems the MAC address table
is filled s1 receives a frame from s/3
s/3 has received this frame from s2 so
the MAC address in the frame is that of
s2 this information is added to MAC
address table the entry says that a
frame with a destination address of Mac
a1 should be sent to interface f0 for
however the first entry tells the switch
to send any frames with destination
address Mac a one out interface f05 we
cannot have the frame sent out to
different interfaces
let us continue our discussion on
switching problems in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
