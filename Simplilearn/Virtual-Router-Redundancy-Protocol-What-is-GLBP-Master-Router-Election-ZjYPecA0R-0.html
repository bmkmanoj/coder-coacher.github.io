and switching course offered by simply
learned the previous lesson focused on
hot standby router protocol this lesson
deals with virtual router redundancy
protocol and Gateway load balancing
protocol let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to list the features of vrrp
explained vrrp group and the master
router election and failure process
configure vrrp list the features of GL
BP explained the types of routers in GL
VP group and the active router election
process explained GLB P load balancing
and SLB let us begin our discussion with
vrrp virtual router redundancy protocol
is an I Triple E standard protocol vrrp
is similar in many ways to HSR P which
is a first hop redundancy high
availability protocol vrrp is SSO aware
this means supervisor failover does not
cause a new master router election there
are three features of vrrp in particular
that differentiates it from HSR P first
only the master router sends
advertisements second preempt is the
default NH SRP preempt must be
configured
lastly vrrp has up to 255 groups more
than HSR P in the next slide let us
discuss brrp groups a vrrp group has one
master router and one or more backup
routers the master router transmits
messages using a particular MAC address
as shown on the slide based on the vrrp
group vrrp groups are configured using
one of the same two approaches
as HS RP groups the first approach is to
divide n devices into two vrrp groups
the other approach is to divide VLANs
between the two vrrp routers the
preferred method is grouping by VLAN
list in the next slide
let us discuss master router election
unlike HSR P the IP address of a
physical router can be used as the vrrp
virtual address if you choose this
configuration method then the physical
router matching the virtual address will
become the master this is one way to
influence selection of the master router
otherwise the master router is the
router with the highest priority in case
of a tie the router with the highest
real IP address will become the master
in the next slide let us discuss what
happens when the master router fails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
