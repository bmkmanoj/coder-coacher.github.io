and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
traditional spanning tree in this lesson
we will focus on advanced spanning tree
let us begin with the objectives of the
lesson in the next slide
by the end of this lesson you will be
able to describe Cisco and I Triple E
variants of SDP explain our STP and RP
VST plus port states rolls convergence
and topology changes configure root
bridge and backup verify pv st plus RP
BST plus and MST describe how to prevent
STP problems let us start our discussion
of different types of spanning tree
common spanning tree uses one instance
of STV processing is concentrated in the
single roots which also if a port is
blocking then it is not used for any
data traffic
although BPD use are still exchanged
this decreases the amount of bandwidth
available in the network to overcome
these limitations STP versions that
accommodate multiple instances of
spanning tree are developed these allow
load balancing there are two approaches
the first is to create different route
switches for each VLAN this distributes
processing requirements among different
switches but it duplicates roots which
processing for each VLAN another
approach is to group VLANs and create
instances of STP by group in the next
slide
let us discuss STP implementations that
use these approaches
the STP implementations can be
categorized into all VLANs and multiple
spanning trees the two STPs that create
one instance of spanning tree are common
spanning tree and rapid spanning tree
the multiple spanning tree can further
be divided into per VLAN STP and per
VLAN list STV both the per belén STPs
are cisco proprietary these are PBS t
plus also called pv st &amp;amp; pv r s t plus
spanning trees are created for a group
of VLANs in MST or Mis T in the next
slide let us discuss the original p vs t
p vs t + + pv r s t +</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
