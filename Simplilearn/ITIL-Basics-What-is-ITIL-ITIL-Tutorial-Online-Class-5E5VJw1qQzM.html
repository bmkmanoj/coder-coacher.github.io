experience teaching several different
platforms and I have a lot of experience
in IT as well so I do teach ITIL I teach
architecture too which is a TOGAF
framework IT architecture and I teach IT
governance which is codified I have
experience in running an IT organization
at a place called Aveda and we have
shampoo conditioners cosmetics that kind
of thing I was there about 12 years and
then I got into teaching full-time in
consulting so I've done real projects
with ITIL and as well as have spent many
years teaching I tell you know if you're
not taught here it's simply learned go
come from the current idle foundation so
that's me John Bhosle yeah I'm certified
at the highest level in ITIL a little
expert that's the level you need to be
at in order to teach I tell and I'm a
consultant in idle and IT governance as
well which is something that helps run I
tell it's a different framework so we'll
go through a little bit about what ITIL
is it's it's a framework of processes
for IT to run IT and what is a process
well a process is its its work it's
doing different types of work so if you
get an input into a process the inputs
are transformed and work into outputs
which are the output of our work so they
have identified different kinds of work
within ITIL and the current version
version 3 has about 24 processes they
have identified and they've organized
them into a life cycle
a cycle of work kind of like every
business has a cycle it has a cycle of
budgeting and so does IT within a
business so they're going to all these
processes are going to work within this
cycle as IT does its work to deliver
value to its customers and the cycle is
called the service management life cycle
and then we have five different stages
in the service management life cycle and
those are units two three four five and
six are the five stages why I tell well
because well one thing is 80% of the
companies in the u.s. at least that I
know of use I tell in the language in it
and that's quickly spreading throughout
the world starting up in the UK in the
Netherlands but I know that it's
spreading throughout the world and I
don't know what the number of percentage
is around the world but it's very high
so in a sense if you want want to learn
about IT you need to learn about ITIL to
understand the language of how IT does a
large portion of its work how it
delivers value to its customers and
there are a lot of jobs that are tied to
idle certification so it's a good
investment
in your time to to learn ITIL so here
we'll take a little sample and will
point to this design stage it's just the
second stage and so you'll be able to
see some of what's in the design stage
of I detail so we've got what's the
purpose scope and value of this stage
and what kind of roles and
responsibilities are in service design
well the design stage is where you come
up with the detail requirements for any
any they column service any service that
IT is going to deliver and what idle
does
it organizes all of what IT does into
something called a service and it's kind
of like when you go to a restaurant you
get a menu right and on this menu and
you've got all these things that you're
going to get services from the
restaurant so when you order from the
menu what you really order it's like a
bundle of services like if you order
like that number six at McDonald's
hamburgers they you can get a chicken
sandwich and then but you also get
french fries and you get a coke so it's
a little bundle of services so that's
the same thing as what Idol does and IT
is it it organizes this Service Catalog
which is a big menu of what people get
from IT all the services that they that
ite provides to them so as we go through
this service life cycle it's a life
cycle of building new services and
enhancing services and retiring services
through the life cycle the first
actually the first dive the first stage
in the life cycle is service strategy
and that really answers the question of
why we're gonna do these projects for
these services what's what it really is
a value to the customers and decides
which projects we're going to do design
which we have here is when you actually
start doing the projects you're going to
strategy releases a project in to design
it charters a project to be done for a
certain service or set of services and
this is where we do the detail
requirements and the design itself the
the detailed requirements tell us what
we need to do and then the design tells
us how we are going to do it when every
design
has a set of components and we'll never
have relationships to each other so we
essentially what we've done by the end
of design is we picked our solution to
the to the requirements and the business
need so our objective is to design a
service that meets customer meets what's
a value in their requirements it helps
identify what the business needs in
detail and then identify a solution so
service design helps that designing
these services effectively and also you
know taking the latest and technology
trends etc and applying those and we
want to continually improve it as we go
so what's the scope the scope of design
is big changes that are coming like new
services existing major existing
enhancements Hance Masson existing
systems
I had retirements really of services
which are major projects - sometimes
there are long programs even it's also
what tools and systems are we going to
need to deliver this from an IT
standpoint not just the the solution
itself like sa PE or work or whatever
but all the tools were gonna need to
deliver it effectively like how we're
gonna monitor it whether it's up and
down how we're gonna handle tickets if
there are incidents that take place or
problems and all kinds of that are the
systems that underpin the service as
well and then the technology and
architecture so we want to have an
architecture technology architecture as
a part of our design and then we want to
have metrics - metrics are in scope we
want to know how to measure how well
this service is going to work and or how
well it's working once it's in
production so we need to design all that
and then there are processes themselves
we're going to have to design the
processes within design what's the value
for the business of service design lower
total cost of ownership over the in
entire life of the service you'll see
because we've used an architecture
approach we look at the whole life of
the service and integrate it well with
other services that are needed in the
business and that gives us an overall
lower cost of ownership
using compatible technology and
applications and data integrated data
it's going to give us a lower total cost
of ownership so these are all about
delivering value to our customers and to
the business the customers being within
our business that you can actually say
that every process has a customer
so even processes that are within our
within IT that just delivered to
internal people inside our customer our
company or we can refer to them as
internal customers so because we're
service oriented even to our internal
customers which actually for IT almost
all of our customers are internal
customers right there are departments
within our own company so we want to
deliver value to them in value is what
they need and value is from their point
of view and from their from their point
of view and their perceptions their
preferences
so what IT can deliver is a value
proposition but the customers ultimately
decide whether it's a value so that's
what we're shooting for we want to
understand what's in our customers heads
in terms of what they want need and
what's the priority of it so we're going
to have different roles also with in
ITIL we're gonna have these processes or
parts of or different types of work
we're going to give ownership in terms
of management of processes and owning
processes an owner will be a single
accountable person for a certain type of
work like in the Service Desk we're
going to have incidents where the system
is disrupted there's an unplanned
disrupted and we're going we need to
restore it
quickly as possible so we're going to
have somebody own that whole process
because that process goes across IT
departments and so we need to have
somebody accountable across departments
for this process as are all the other
processes as well across departments so
that's why we introduced this we're
really big on rolls and introducing
these new process rolls so we can build
in quality into the process and measure
the processes and make sure they're
improving so we have an owner is the one
accountable person in the entire
organization for that process we'll have
a manager who's responsible for the
day-to-day operations of a process like
a service desk or help desk process that
actually two processes on the help desk
incident management and service request
management are the two and so we'll have
a process manager for each one of those
processes the manager will will will
manage the operational part of the
process the daily operations 24 by 7 in
whatever location etc see so you need
probably multiple managers you only need
one owner who's responsible for the
overall quality and setting objectives
and things for the process to approve it
but you have many managers for different
locations and shifts and then the
practitioners are the ones that actually
do the individual work they do the
activities they transform all the inputs
that are coming into the process into
the output they do the work so those are
some of the roles and it's important to
have roles because that way we're giving
ownership to those people doing the work
closest to the work would give them
ownership in the ability to improve how
the work is getting done because it's a
continuing improvement thing that's part
of what the process manager and owner
are going to do and they're going to
listen to the people are doing the work
and improve with them as a team from
people close to doing work practitioner
insures all that cavities are carried
out
they're working with the stakeholders
those are basically the internal
customers and other partners doing
providing assistance to do work on the
process and they're keeping records so
we're going to keep records of all of
our incidents that take place is one
thing that's an unplanned interruption
to a service or we're going to keep
track of some achill problems - which
are when we do a root cause analysis to
determine the cause of an incident to
eliminate that cause there are many
other things we're going to keep track
of changes would be another thing we're
going to keep track of incident of
events which are changes in as we watch
the services and then what actions we
need to take from those so those are the
roles so within design there are
actually four big things to consider
when you're gonna design a service
because we want to go about a holistic
design of a service not just the
technology part but also on the people
parts in our partner relationships these
are all important so we have these four
p's of service design this would be
example of a major concept with in ITIL
a best practice concept so the partner
is are the partners that are outside of
your organization that you rely on to
assist you in the service and then and
that's become obviously a very big part
of IT relying on outside resources and
the people people we have to find the
right number of people have to give the
people the right skills and knowledge we
have to give them knowledge of the
process and we have to give them the
right kind of management and
organization and foster relationships
those are all part of the design product
and technology
is product or / technology that's
actually the hardware software part and
the process itself is the fourth P the
processes are the activities that get
done and we need that too we need to
design all the activities that get done
within the the solution itself the
business solution and then there's also
a bunch of aspects of design that we
have to consider one is the solution
itself that we come up with in design
and a solution but by the time you have
the solution you've actually picked how
you're going to accomplish your design
you am I going to use a package or am I
gonna write the code myself or implement
you know some some kind of a system like
an email system or whatever is part of
the solutions but you have that actually
have the vendor names and the custom
components you're going to build if you
when you have the solution so that's
what you have by the end of design you
haven't actually built it yet so you're
gonna use models that kind of thing in
order to draw pictures of what you're
gonna do
boxes and relationships that kind of
stuff in InDesign so technology
architectures you've got to figure that
out when you got a big change coming and
you got to you got to design the
processes and you got to identify the
metrics so those are the five aspects of
design that that you have to look at so
that's another concept and then here's
another concept they have in design it's
called a service design package and this
is the major output that comes from
design to transition which is the next
stage transition stage is where you're
going to build test and deploy the
solution that you designed in service
design so the service design package our
outputs wrapped up in a big package that
are needed to do the build test and
design and deploy build test and deploy
basically what's in here you're going to
have the requirements in there that you
came up with the detail requirements the
design itself you also have an
organizational readiness assessment
how ready is the organization to
implement this service or this enhanced
meant to the service and what do we need
to do in order to get ready because that
that's what happens in the next stage
you have to do all the the activities
that come out of the organizational
readiness assessment you're going to
have to make sure those all happen in a
holistic way so that we're ready to roll
out the service and we're also going to
have operational acceptance plan then a
wind can operations actually let the
project team go away and be able to
support the new service what needs to
happen for that and we'll also be test
specifications you know the acceptance
test there's also in the service design
package only major designs go through
the design stage one that for a new IT
service or a major change to an existing
or a retirement of an IT service
sometimes if they're smaller changes
they're just going to go into transition
they won't go through this big design
stage and they'll go they'll still be
designed but they'll be designed this
has a smaller change so if that all
happens in transition so in a sense
there are two paths the bigger projects
come through design the others just
start in change management and and go
through that way so that's sort of a
summary of design okay thank you
everybody and have a good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
