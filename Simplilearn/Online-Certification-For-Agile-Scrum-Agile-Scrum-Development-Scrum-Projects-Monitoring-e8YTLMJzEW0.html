9 monitoring scrum projects welcome that
lesson 9 of simply learns agile scrum
training program in this lesson we look
at how we can monitor and control scrum
projects it is important to note upfront
that scrum provides an inbuilt monitor
and control mechanisms by mandating a
demo review at the end of every sprint
and the opportunity to correct cause let
us now begin with the agenda in the next
slide agenda we will now look at the
detailed agenda that this lesson we
start off by setting up some first
principles regarding monitoring of scrum
projects then we look at some common
scrum metrics with plenty of examples we
also look at a number of examples of
metrics used in scrum and some best
practices do's and don'ts around the use
of the metrics we shall talk about some
of the common charts and graphs used in
scrum this includes the burn up and burn
down charts and other graphs
lastly we talk about information
radiators a concept that was originated
in the Crystal family of methodologies
but one that can be very useful in scrum
as well now let us get introduced with
monitoring scrum projects in the next
slide monitoring scrum projects let us
establish some common ground before
diving into techniques or measures to
monitor scrum projects first of all it
is important to understand that in scrum
the team should ideally be managing its
own progress the scrum master or the
manager should not try to micromanage
the team or interfere with this process
that said the scrum master should try to
provide visibility to the team about
progress
or lack of it so that the team can make
its own decisions common tracking
mechanisms that are inbuilt into the
methodology our daily stand-up meetings
where the entire team reports is
progress to each other reviews and
retrospectives the fact that the team
has to demo working software at the end
of each iteration provides a lot of
visibility into progress if the team was
not making sufficient progress or if
there was quality issues this would
become pretty obvious in the sprint
review the retrospective provides the
team the opportunity to take all the
feedback on board and take corrective
action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
