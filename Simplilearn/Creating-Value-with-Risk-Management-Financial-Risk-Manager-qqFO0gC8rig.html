simply learn your pace your place
financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
creating value with risk management
having discussed the basics of risk
management and its advantages it is
important for you to understand that
managing risk through hedging activities
is not free there is a cost associated
with hedging any investor who is a
shareholder in any company can diversify
his risk by investing in many companies
so he may not want to incur extra
charges for diversifying the firm
specific risk through hedging this is a
situation in frictionless markets where
there is no cost of bankruptcy or taxes
in reality markets are not frictionless
and in this presentation you will see
how managing risk can in fact increase
firm value even though there is a cost
associated with managing risk agenda we
will learn how managing risk reduces
bankruptcy cost income volatility
weighted average cost of capital
probability of debt overhang and
information asymmetry all these factors
contribute in increasing the value of
the firm which is the basic aim for any
firm and its shareholders reducing
bankruptcy costs a firm is financed by
debt and equity
whenever the firm faces a situation in
which it is unable to pay its debt
holders it has to file for bankruptcy
the cost associated with bankruptcy may
be high and hence as the probability of
this situation increases the investors
demand high return in order to take
higher risk hence there is a need to
reduce the default probability so as to
ensure investor confidence risk
management can help in lowering this
default probability and hence lowering
the bankruptcy cost from the graph we
can see that the cost of bankruptcy
decreases only up to the point X after
which the cost of risk management
exceeds the benefit from reducing
bankruptcy cost reducing bankruptcy
costs a firm is financed by debt and
equity
whenever the firm faces a situation in
which it is unable to pay its debt
holders it has to file for bankruptcy
the cost associated with bankruptcy may
be high and hence as the probability of
this situation increases the investors
demand higher return in order to take
higher risk hence there is a need to
reduce the default probability so as to
ensure investor confidence risk
