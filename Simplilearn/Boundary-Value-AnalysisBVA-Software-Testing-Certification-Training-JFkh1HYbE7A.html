box technique for testing this is called
boundary value analysis or BV a boundary
value analysis is a black box test
design technique in which test cases are
designed based on boundary values this
technique is based on the presumption
that errors lurk at boundaries BV a is
based on testing at the boundaries
between partitions if you have ever done
range checking you are probably using
the boundary value analysis technique
even if you weren't aware of it we have
both valid boundaries and invalid
boundaries boundary value is nothing but
an input value or output value which is
on the edge of an equivalence partition
or at the smallest incremental distance
on either side of an edge for example
the minimum or maximum value of a range
we will try and understand BVA
using the following example a program
which accepts a number in the range
minus 102 plus 100 there will be three
sets of valid equivalent partitions -
102 - 1 being the negative range the
second-class would just consist of 0 the
third class would include values between
one to a hundred the positive range for
each range there are minimum and maximum
values and each boundary for the
negative range the lower boundary is
minus 100 and the upper boundary is
minus one at each boundary three
conditions should be checked for the
lower boundary the values that need to
be checked will include - 101 - 100 - 99
- 2 - 1
the upper boundary of -1 the values that
need to be checked will include minus 1
0 plus 1 similarly for the positive
range we have a lower boundary of 1 and
upper boundary of 100 the values
therefore needed to test these
boundaries will include 0 1 2 99 100 101
in above example we can observe some
duplication in values for the test data
when we remove those duplicate inputs
our final input conditions will be - 101
- 100 - 99 - 1 0 1 99 100 101</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
