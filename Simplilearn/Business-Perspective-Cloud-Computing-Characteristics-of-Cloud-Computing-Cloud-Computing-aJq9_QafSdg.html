of cloud computing course offered by
simply learn this is a brief
introduction to the world of cloud
computing cloud computing is basically a
service offered over a network by the
use of computing resources such as
hardware and software cloud computing
entrust remote servers with the users
data software and computation end users
access cloud-based applications through
a web browser a lightweight desktop or a
mobile app while the business software
and user's data are stored on servers at
a remote location
let's look into the topics that will be
covered in this module we will define
cloud computing and common terminologies
used in it discuss its essential
characteristics and understand how it is
related to virtualization we will then
move on to cover water virtualization is
and its commonalities and differences
with respect to cloud computing in
addition we will be able to provide
common examples of applications using
cloud determine the types of
organization who are the best and least
suitable for cloud computing identify
different types of cloud services models
and their suitability and finally look
into the different types of deployment
models and the differences between them
let us now start this module with the
definition of cloud computing according
to the national institute of standard
and testing ni st cloud computing has
been defined as a model for enabling
ubiquitous convenient on-demand network
access the shared pool of configurable
computing resources networks servers
applications that can be rapidly
provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider
interaction
in simple terms cloud computing is
utilizing computing resources such as
hardware and software which can be
delivered as a service over network
typically the Internet cloud is
basically a set of hardware network
storage services and interfaces by using
cloud we can offer services such as
software infrastructure and storage
cloud service provider is entrusted with
the responsibility of storing and
maintaining the assets this brings us to
the fact that cloud computing by no
means is a technology it is rather a
business model cloud service providers
are responsible for storage of assets
and their maintenance let us now look
into its essential characteristics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
