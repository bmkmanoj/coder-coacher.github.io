with demand management is to balance the
demand and make sure capacity is managed
to fulfill those demands let's now
understand how capacity management does
this job capacity management process
starts with two activities one is making
adjustments to capacity based on inputs
from demand management from service
strategy for example the telecom
provider is going to introduce video
cooling as a service this requirement
then comes to IT an IT will then arrange
for additional capacity to manage the
demand for his new service the second
activity is an ongoing measurement
monitoring and tuning of IT components
supporting an IT service this ensures
that the current capacity is not
affecting the performance services being
offered for example if the free space on
the hard disk of a critical server is
approaching its limit which we will get
to know from monitoring the unnecessary
files and data can be deleted to regain
the free space which is called tuning
other activities of capacity management
include application sizing and modeling
which means that if a new business
process or a new application supporting
a business process is being introduced
the IT components need to be designed or
sized to meet the requirements of that
process or application using the earlier
example of a restaurant say based on
demand the restaurant is planning to
introduce Japanese cuisine the owner of
the restaurant will need to plan for
adding space for patrons storage for
ingredients more waiters and chefs with
a knowledge of Japanese cuisine or
putting it simply sizing the resources
for the new offering which is to say
forecasting of behavior of IT
infrastructure under certain conditions
for example what will happen if the
users of a service suddenly double etc
ideally such changes will be
but sizing will have a buffer for
unpredictable changes a key activity of
capacity management process is capacity
planning capacity planning is typically
a periodic activity and in line with a
financial cycle this is because of the
financial implications of capacity which
means changes to capacity typically
require upgrading or downgrading of
resources like hardware software space
and so on this activity involves
planning for capacity for changing
demands of business which happens
through assessment of current installed
capacity the current and future needs of
that capacity getting the departments
who need that capacity and the
department who provides that capacity to
agree documenting the whole plan and
getting it approved
let's understand this with an example an
organization of 100 users has currently
a 1 Mbps internet link so the install
capacity for Internet service is 1 Mbps
the link is currently 90% utilized by
most of the working hours and the users
are facing slowness or degraded
performance in application running on
that internet link the IT department
will be monitoring this utilization and
parallel user will be complaining about
the performance so at the end of the
year when the budgetary projections are
due the IT department who is the service
owner for this link will meet the
business process owners to understand
their needs and future requirements due
to the changing demand for the internet
service both business process owners and
service owners will come to an agreement
that the link needs to be upgraded to
say 2 Mbps this will then go into the
capacity plan for this service for the
next year of course to enable this
decision-making the service owner will
be doing another activity of capacity
management which is reporting
the service owner will be reporting
periodically on the demands made on the
current capacity performance of the
service under these demands and other
requirements as required by the users of
that service all this data from demand
management forecasts monitoring of
capacity performance reports and
capacity planning are maintained by the
capacity management process in a
database called capacity management
information system or CM is in short
maintenance of this database is another
activity of this process this activity
makes sure that the information
available to decision-makers is
up-to-date and accurate capacity
management can be extremely technical
complex and demanding process that
comprises three sub processes let's
understand these sub processes in the
next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
