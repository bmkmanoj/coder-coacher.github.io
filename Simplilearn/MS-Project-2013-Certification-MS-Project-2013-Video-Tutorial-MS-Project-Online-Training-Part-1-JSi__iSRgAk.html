create a product obtain a desired result
or deliver a service to meet this
objective a project manager needs to
define the scope the work that needs to
be performed and the time by when the
work should be completed the project
manager also needs to define the cost of
the project cost includes the material
equipment and resources or people who
will work on the project resources can
include a group of people who have
different skills or are present in
different locations hence these people
may influence the cost of a project in
different ways in the next slide we will
understand the concept of project
management
project management refers to the
application of knowledge and methods to
execute projects successfully the
project management lifecycle consists of
five phases they are initiating planning
executing closing and monitoring and
controlling project initiation is the
phase where a project manager discusses
the project scope and its feasibility
with stakeholders during project
planning the project manager outlines
the tasks and schedule and comes up with
an approximate budget and resource plan
the project manager execute the project
by allocating tasks to resources project
related information is updated regularly
the project is closed after the client
approves of product or service quality
monitoring and controlling is an ongoing
phase in a project the project manager
monitors and controls project activities
throughout the project cycle this cycle
continues until all the tasks are
completed although all these phases are
important planning is the most critical
since proper planning can help control
the time and cost of a project we have
discussed project and project management
