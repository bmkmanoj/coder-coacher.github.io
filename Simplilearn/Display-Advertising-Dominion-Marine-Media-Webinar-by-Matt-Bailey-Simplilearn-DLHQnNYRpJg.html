it over to Matt say thank you to
everybody for carving out the time I
know we carved out two hours but I think
we'll be done in 90 minutes or less so
hopefully we learned our last lesson the
last time we had one of these sessions
booked and we booked a little extra time
this time so we don't have technical
difficulties and Matt's probably a
little more adept at that kind of stuff
than I have anyway so thank you for
carving out the time as I shared when we
had our sales townhall a few weeks ago
Matt first of all comes highly
recommended and I'm excited that we're
all going to get to hear from him and
learn from him today matt is not a
marine expert and that's just the idea
he's a display expert and it knows
what's happening in the space knows what
works and what doesn't and we all have
myself
John Christine included and all of you
have big expectations on us for display
revenue in 2017 and when we did the
survey a couple of months ago one thing
that a lot of people asked for help on
training wise training resource wise was
display so the intent today is not to
give you a package to run out and sell
this is not necessarily going to
generate you know revenue today with a
hot new widget the idea is simply this
to make you feel more comfortable
connected to and educated on display
because our customers just like with
everything we do and sell are going to
look to us to be the experts and I know
the more comfortable we all feel with
the product and our understanding of it
the better we can feel comfortable
selling it to our clients educating them
on expectations and whatnot so the last
thing I'll say is please I know we all
have a lot going on it's a busy time of
year please give a hundred percent of
your attention to Matt for the next 60
minutes or so we're going to get out of
this session what we put
into it and I equally expect to learn as
much as anybody through this so let's
give them our full attention mats put a
lot of time into the presentation this
is not a free exercise to bring him on
board so let's make sure we make make
the best out of the investment and
improve ourselves today by being all in
mat thanks for being with us and I'll
turn it over to you all right Brad thank
you so much and really appreciate the
introduction as well as the really the
purpose of what you're doing here to
train your team just a little bit about
myself I've been in digital marketing
now for well over 20 years and Brad just
you know I'm going to keep you unmuted
so you may want to mute their locally
but if you have anything to jump in at
any point I'm going to leave your
channel open I've been really kind of on
both sides I've been in the software
development side but I've also been in
the marketing agency side and eventually
got to the point where I opened my own
digital marketing agency after eight
years I went ahead and sold that and now
I just do training and teaching
full-time I do that for simply learn for
the direct marketing association or now
the data and marketing association and a
lot of the brands that you've seen here
I've done both consultation and training
for as well as written two books on the
subject of internet marketing um but
let's talk specifically about display
and what you're doing and like Brad said
I'd like this to really be a guide to
you to help you to understand it a
little bit more and also unfortunately
like Brad said they're going to look to
you your clients are going to look to
you for advice they're going to look to
you for insight as to how they can make
their campaigns effective and get the
most out of their budget and so it's
going to fall on you to educate yourself
about how you can position this the
value of this thing on your network but
also having some of the answers and so
that's how I put together the
presentation we're going to cover five
different areas and all these areas are
going to be
to prepare you to speak competently
about display and how to position it and
set realistic expectations when you're
working with your clients now starting
with user behavior it is amazing how
much our behavior has changed just in a
short amount of time with the
proliferation of smartphones and mobile
devices just over the past few years it
has radically changed our behavior some
of you may remember uh logging in with
the AOL disk a couple you know decades
ago and you had the screeching modem
that would make a lot of noise and
really that changed our behavior because
in order to go online you had to prepare
to go to the life you would had a
certain amount of time a limited amount
of minutes that you could be online and
so you gathered everything together that
you needed for your online experience
you were prepared and you knew you had a
certain amount of time and so that
changed our behavior as to how we use
the internet we even called it going
online because it was an event then a
few years after that we finally have
broadband internet where it's always on
and the downside of that is every time
you walk by your computer you can simply
check your email because it's always on
and that changed our behavior because
now information is always accessible to
us however it was tied down to whatever
hat could be plugged in now with the
proliferation of mobile devices and
phones it has changed our behavior
because it's always with us we are
always tied in we are always on and
everything is immediately accessible to
us this is a concept that Google has
labeled as micro moments micro moments
arose because of this always-on
accessibility that whenever we have a
question or an idea or god forbid a
moment of boredom we pull out our phones
and we check our social feed we do a
search
we do something anything to fill that
moment of time that we experience this
boredom or just have a few minutes I'm
amazed when I go in or go places in this
shopping right now you go to the Bureau
of Motor Vehicles the amount of people
there in line and looking at their
phones and it's become really a part of
the fabric of our lives
now these micro-moments google tells us
that they are becoming so prolific in
our behavior and how people access
information online right now two out of
three digital minutes are paid from
mobile it's gotten to the point where
Google has changed its ranking algorithm
and now they have two ranking algorithms
and the primary one is mobile based the
secondary one is desktop based because
more than 70% of all their queries are
now done on a mobile device now this is
how it changes our life this is a study
of someone who was planning a vacation
and in looking at all these micro
moments this test subject her name was
Amy in planning a vacation had 419
digital micro moments these are
individual online sessions and as you
can see here they included 34 searches 5
videos and 380 web pages and this was
done boy only 15% was done on a desktop
and so showing how when we are
interested in making a major purchase
that would be in bet the amount of
investigation we do and our
investigation is done in very short
spurts rather than sitting in front of a
desktop for an hour or two and doing
that investigation rather we do the
search when we think of something when
we have an inspiration an idea
or the next logical step so I tried to
find something that was very similar to
what you were selling and I couldn't
come up with any boat data but we have
car buying data which is somewhat
similar so here is another test subject
that was measured in buying a car and
over the period of three months there
were over 900 touch points over 900
micro-moments as you can see here 70%
were done on a mobile device and of
these 900 digital touch points they
cluded 140 Google searches YouTube
videos image views at 69 dealer
interactions and 186 manufacturer
interactions this is the new behavior
that these are separate events that when
someone has an idea or a thought they go
online and query the information that
they need as you can see there on the
right the decision making process of
going from multiple brands to the
consideration phase and then the
decision phase and how that affected
their journey this is now we are now at
a point where we can measure the
customer journey in this decision-making
process across multiple media we've
never been able to do that before and so
it's just a fascinating step into
understanding more and more of consumer
behavior and how they are acting so for
example one of the things that you can
do is go to Google Trends and you can
type in a phrase or a word and you can
see the history of how many times that
word is searched on over a certain
amount of time now for an example I
wanted to give you an idea
comparatively of in red people searching
for car MSRP and in blue people
searching for both MSRP and 70 percent
of these searches for cars that you see
there in the red line 70 percent of them
are done on mobile and as you can see
there is a comparable trend line going
on with boats as well that you can
see that people are searching for these
and so there is this move and I think
your industry is probably coming slower
than a lot of the numbers that I'm
showing here but it is trending and
moving that way
now here Amen yes me uh go back a slide
if you don't mind I'm going to put you
give your first curveball question
alright tell so I'm intrigued by this
idea of using Google Trends share with
our team how if we're going to approach
a prospect about display advertising how
we might use that tool to our advantage
before going to see the prospect all
right this is really a tool that shows
the demand in Google for search so it
wouldn't be something I would put in
front of a client simply because uh it
really will kind of more show the demand
of if they advertise on Google they will
get this this is more for your benefit
to see number one what terminology what
words are people using and then you can
help guide your client in understanding
their campaign but where I find it most
helpful also is to understand the trends
so getting into very specific trends and
seeing how that affects the search
patterns so seeing when they increasing
when they trap off and this will enable
you to talk very competently about the
market and the ships in the market based
on different interests or different
subjects is that answer your question
Brad does that kind of help fill in the
gaps for Google Trends yes all right
great now when we talk about these micro
moments
they're called micro moments because the
average mobile micro moment is only a
minute ten so think about your own
behavior when you pull out your phone
when you do a search for something and
how it just adds up over time rather
than being
a solid event now this plays into
display marketing because it's part of
those micro moments it's part of when
they go online and they are exposed to
ads that becomes part of the inspiration
it becomes part of that moment and it
all adds up it can't be seen as one
specific impression that results in a
specific activity it is part of a
longer-term larger picture and so the
strategy that display plays in the
understanding of this new behavior that
people are exhibiting it is to number
one really anticipate the questions and
the needs of searchers and users before
they have them and so knowing that when
we are talking about display we're
trying to anticipate the question
someone might have and then provide them
the answer and then providing them the
answer leading them from the start to
finish in a very clear purposeful and
consistent way so that is the strategy
that display plays in the overall big
picture of user behavior now let's dig
into really the fundamental building
blocks of what makes display work there
are some fundamental I hesitate to call
the rules because as soon as we call
them rules someone will come up with a
way to do it that breaks the rules but
really what I find what works best about
display is that display works best when
it's used is baked
when it's used to get attention and get
the really cook the user into moving
through the process you see display
fails when our clients think that
display is the message it is the it is
the campaign and we're trying to
communicate everything through the ad
the ad is just the bait and so that's
really how we then have to
uh and as I've learned in many years of
fishing is it's all about the bait you
get the right bait you can catch the
right fish so let's look at our bait and
the number one works best in display is
a single image especially a if it's
static uh now rich media usually will
you know can use video it can go between
a number of images but even then we want
to remain with some sort of consistent
image presentation uh if it's video
that's great because you've got some
consistency set there but I see a lot of
rich media display that uses multiple
images and when you're using multiple
images they're usually not consistent in
terms of lighting contrast presentation
and so because of that it can block or
make it very unclear if you cannot see
the headline now the headline and and
this is where you know less is more say
something good but don't explain it
again this is the bait this is not the
main course and so what we've got to do
is brief copy very visible uh the the
chevy one on the left i don't like that
because it's white text on a light blue
background now you can see it because i
have expanded these to make them much
larger so that you can see them but the
contrast does not work well and so
that's one thing that i always evaluate
in terms of effectiveness is the level
of contrast between the background and
the text if it can't easily be readable
from far away then it that won't work
now the middle ad is a great example of
utilizing contrast the best contrast
online the easiest to read is black text
on a white background or as you can see
white on black works as well on the
right here you can see it's more of sort
of a brownish gray but it's still very
light but the text is very large
then the next thing that is specific is
a clear call-to-action the button what
you are asking people to do it has to
number one provide value that's the hook
that's the bait that we're putting out
there is value in order to be visible it
should be contrasting probably the most
visible button of these three is the one
on the right because it's orange with a
lighter background that's going to be
the easiest one to see the one in the
middle is gray on a light brown as you
can see that sort of blushes in and
because of the other elements in the
image it takes away from the
call-to-action button and the one on the
left even though it's light blue the
text inside of it is really small
compared to everything else that's there
and so the call to action number one has
to be contrasting easily visible and
have words in it that communicate value
that's their offer and then ultimately
the display ad works best when it's
consistent with the other marketing and
that it had if it's consistent with the
overall campaigns that are being run
right now on but again this is a
specialized part of the campaign it's
only a hook it's not the entire campaign
that's why I put that Silverado in there
that they're making the ad the campaign
rather compare that with the one on the
right with the RAM it's very limited
information very easily to be read and
then a very clear call to action and so
ultimately because the ad is the bait
you've got to use the right bait based
on who you want to bite on this so
depending upon where our prospects
depending upon the campaign we're
running and what we want to do should
then dictate the type of ad that will
run so for example if all we're doing is
a more awareness type of ad an awareness
of a product
awareness of a brand then really it's a
very low commitment type of that really
we're only going to measure that in
terms of of you or impressions maybe a
visit because you're not asking for a
commitment for an awareness type of
campaign now if you're doing a lead
generation campaign then your ad should
have a value proposition you should be
offering something of value in return
for your name and email address and
contact information
that's winner a ssin and then at the
sort of the the bottom of the funnel is
a high commitment transaction and that's
where we're asking for not just contact
information we're looking at transaction
level data and so the ad then needs to
be designed to focus on that ultimate
goal and so again click-through rate
while it's always a good metric it's a
good metric according to what type of
campaign you're running so if you're
running just an awareness campaign I'm
mainly going to be looking at
impressions as the primary metric for
awareness if you're running a campaign
that's designed to get leads designed to
get emails then you need to have an
offer that is relevant and interesting
and attractive if you don't have that
you're not going to get the click
throughs and then after the
click-through is the landing page and
this is where you may feel like your job
ends is I got the ad I've got the
creative and the landing page is the
clients responsibility yes it is but
this is where you can be the expert this
is where you can help because if you can
help by providing advice by providing
instruction as to how the landing page
is a part of the overall process because
it's critical you might get the
click-through but if this is a lead
generation campaign and the landing page
stinks they're not going to get the lead
and so it's a whole
process that we're evaluating here the
ad in the creative is just a part Matt I
want to jump in for a second and just
clarify for anybody that that might
think of landing page the same way I did
when you and I were previewing this call
I used to think of bait and I'm just
sharing this for the group that I used
to think of a landing page in in the
media that I came from it was a page we
created on our site that we took them to
the way Matt is referring to landing
pages wherever the the display ad or the
click-through takes them whether it's a
listing on our site or a model on their
site or some promotion that they're
running just think of the landing page
in this context is wherever the ad takes
them and it was really enlightening for
me that if the message and the landing
page don't match even if the
click-through rate is good there's not
going to be a success story at the end
of the rainbow exactly exactly and
here's the thing a display is an
effective ad type you see even when you
compare a at the bottom three here this
is a survey that was done recently for
brand recall based on the type of ad
when you're looking at just single
channels display organic search and paid
search display has a higher unaided
brand recall now when you start
combining channels I even just organic
search and paid search together only
provided a 23% recall but as soon as you
put display ad with either it jumps up
over 15 points and when you put display
together with organic search paid search
it almost doubles and so display is
critical to reinforcing that recall and
that that impression even if someone
does not click on it Display lodges
itself more into the psyche of the user
than organic or paid search and really
what I'm talking about there is the
search
results page because that is the mix of
paid and organic a lot of people don't
know the difference between the two but
display because of the image because of
the rich media because of the ability to
do multiple things it reinforces a brand
more than other types of digital
marketing online so this is where you
can become the expert and really just
leading your clients into getting better
value out of their campaign so when
we're talking about optimizing for
results really again let's look at it in
terms of the funnel at the top of the
funnel it's the creative it's the
message and it's the call-to-action
that's the ad itself what are we putting
in in terms of a visual what's the
message what's the appeal and what's the
call-to-action what's the promise what's
the bait that you are putting in the act
after that then where are you sending
them and on that page what are you
asking them to do
that's where display tends to fall off
and stumble because people spend a lot
of time developing an ad but they forget
to develop the landing they forget to
follow through I think of it this way
the ad is a promise the landing page the
destination where you send them is the
delivery of the promise so if you are
telling them that they can view
inventory you're telling them they can
have a a buyer's guide then when they go
to that landing page the first thing
they should see is the ability to get
that buyer's guide if it requires their
name email address that lead form it
needs to be consistent in terms of what
you are promising and what you are
delivering now I'm going to show you
some examples here of just how placement
and slight changes can improve a
campaign these are campaigns that we're
a
assaulting work with Forbes and these
are ads that ran on form and so as an
example this print ad in a lifestyle
section was running only like four one
hundredths of a quick through ranked
obviously by moving it into the
technology section vastly improved the
click-through rate we based on the type
of product the section of the content it
was in nothing else that improved the
click-through rate uh this one was very
interesting this was a a John Hancock ad
and I think you can figure out why it
worked the logo of the John Hancock's
signature is recognizable and reassuring
and zero click-through rate even though
the name is there the name is not there
in the font and presentation of the
traditional brand and so right away that
showed us what people are looking for
and what provides reassurance when they
are clicking on ads now also ad sizes
play into this as well this was an ad by
Bo's that was very very interesting
because the campaign was the TV is only
half the story but in the banner ad as
you can see there the long banner ad
really didn't provide enough information
in that format that the square ad
provided us and so sometimes just minor
changes can be significant in getting a
higher click-through rate now I'm going
to share with you some data here that
don't let your eyes roll back some of
you are already just wondering what I'm
showing here this is a report of a
campaign that we were running with four
different creatives and I want to
usually will ask was to identify what
was the best message for this campaign
and immediately you know I think
everyone knows you go to the right to
get the final column
the what we're doing this is for a
software product where there were
purchases and you bought fees and so
what we would do is take the number of
seats divide that by the spend and that
gives us our CPA and cost per
acquisition in case you needed to know
that so as you can see the best cost per
acquisition campaign out of the four is
the fourth one that it's significantly
less in terms of our cost per seat at
$49 comparatively the other campaigns
are running 56 60 to 62 now immediately
a lot of people will look at that and
will say hey that's great this is the
best one we should funnel more into it
but also I've got to follow up with a
question which campaign or which ad size
is the worst performing we go back in
and stay in that right hand side and
I'll give you a clue so you don't have
to wander all around just go right
underneath that $49 CCPA and what you'll
see there is a $73 CCPA
which is the worst performing ad size of
all campaigns in all sizes so even
though we have the lowest CPA for that
ad for that ad group in that ad group is
the worst performing sighs now
comparatively if you look at that same
ad size in the other campaigns it's
performing much better in fact
drastically better between 10 and 20
dollars a seat better so what this tells
us is while this message is probably the
more popular and the more effective the
ad size itself is the least effective
the 160 by 600 size is the least
effective and so when we're evaluating
numbers those are some of the things
that we look at number one to find out
which message is performing well but
so to see which creative does not
communicate the value effectively and so
I love this example because it shows us
that even though this is the best
performing group it contained the worst
performing ad size and so right away I'm
going to look at the creative for that
ad size and look to see what the problem
might be
now something here
that I'm going to explain a little bit
later some of you may be looking at it
but you'll see here the click-through
rates and then the purchases and there's
a click based purchase a view based
purchase and total attribution there
what that means is the majority of
people the majority of seats that were
purchased and were not purchased by an
immediate click on the ad they were
purchased by a later interaction however
they had seen the ad and because of that
it was attributed attributed as a view
based source I'm going to explain that a
little bit later as we go along now
let's look specifically at landing pages
there's an eye test that I use for the
landing page and the number one thing I
want to look for is the headline on the
landing page does it continue the
thinking and the promise that was made
in the act
I also will then want to look at the
image in the landing page is it the same
image or a similar one that continues
the continuity or the relevance that was
in the ad also on the landing page is
there a clear call-to-action
and where is that look call to action
made where is it where is it presented
and this gets to a concept that we call
above the fold now this is especially
relevant in desktop and I think so your
audience is I would say primarily still
desktop but you may be seeing some some
awakenings in that area um like
definitely desktop is not dead and nor
will it be for quite a while
concept of above the fold is actually an
old newspaper concept because anything
that was of most importance was printed
on the top fold in the front page of the
newspaper anything that was a lesser
importance you had to flip the paper to
see the bottom of it and so when we talk
about your call-to-action being above
the fold in online terms desktop terms
it means is your predominant call to
action your button your lead form the
thing that you want someone to do is it
visible without them having to scroll
because if they have to scroll to see it
you're going to lose them that's just
really the out of hand rule is the call
to action has to be in the most visible
place without scrolling ultimately the
eye test is does the landing page
maintain the continuity promised in the
act can I recognize that this is the
same brand and the same promise in the
delivery of that promise
I went ahead and pulled some examples
off your sites hope you don't mind but I
thought this would be a great example of
understanding a little more of how the
ad is the bait leading us then to the
promise of the landing page now what I
liked about the the Everglades ad here
is definitely a color and a design
continuity it's something that the same
shades of blue the same font all of that
translates into the landing page even
though it's the home page and really my
preference is that the landing page is
not the home page that is the number one
thing when someone complains about
click-through rate when someone
complains about the effectiveness of
their campaign the worst thing you can
do is simply send people to a home page
because the home page is meant as a
catch-all to anyone who goes there even
search engines rarely send people to a
home page
send people to the most relevant page
for what you're looking for in the same
way our ads need to send people to the
most relevant page of what we're selling
now in this case I think they can get
away with it I now I will see the
headlines a little different the
headline of the ad has experienced your
next obsession you get to the home page
and its quality is no coincidence
and then in script text which I will say
is very difficult to read online someone
might see that uh so the continuity is a
little shaky Oh little shaky but don't
get me wrong it's slightly shaky um
overall just based on imagery color and
the fonts I I know I've got continuity
there so that's great but usually I
always recommend setting up a separate
landing page for your marketing
campaigns so that you can control the
message control the experience and
develop a sales page essentially just
for that campaign now Grady white here
they do have a landing page there 2017
winter promo I love it that red banner
and on the ad and going through into the
landing page wonderful it makes that
jump it makes the continuity also in the
black bottom of the ad limited time
offer that black matches the the page
there where they put their logo and then
they also deliver on their promise the
promise the hook the bait is limited
time offer when you get to the landing
page they deliver the promise save up to
seventy five hundred limited time offer
so repeating the phrase but then also
adding to it and this gets to kind of
one of those rules that we've got about
this type of advertising it is basically
a the ad the ads the promise you deliver
the promise in the landing page you
don't try and do
everything in the ad the only thing was
is there wasn't really a specific call
to action on that page I believe that
you know the thinking was you're just
getting in and then browsing once you
get there but there wasn't a specific
call to action that explained how to get
that seventy five hundred dollar savings
um but I'm guessing it had to do more
with obviously you've got to contact
them to figure out what you want
now the Boston Whaler at I thought was
very interesting because the ad was
bright red and if you want to get
someone's attention
on a webpage red is probably the
ultimate color to get attention and it's
probably the the most I tell people red
is the most visually assaulting color
mainly for the reason that you never
know how it's going to look on a
computer because different monitors
present the same color of red different
ways and so it's got a bold ad color
here um but the design is different from
the ad to the page and so we are getting
a specific landing page for that add the
the font is different the color scheme
is different but the text is the same um
so it was a little different there and
then I want to show you something so
this is what I got above the fold and I
had to scroll down in order to get the
call to action so the call to action was
below the fold as you can see there I
only got uh the first paragraph and a
half in order to for the landing page
the step aboard call-to-action was at
the bottom of the page now ideally a
quick fix and I would test that is
taking that step aboard and I would put
that on the image above the fold so I
know it's going to be seen and then it's
part then of the overall presentation as
soon as that page loads hopefully that's
a great example and understanding how
below the fold works
looking at the Craig cat which looks
like a whole lot of fun is this by
factory-direct
the logo is the same the image is the
same the only thing I really just more
from a design standpoint the red on
black uh it was really kind of I would
have rather put by factory direct as the
button text
so rather than click here make the
promise the promises buy it factory
direct uh click here as it calls to
action I never recommend in the button
with your promise and then when we look
at the landing page this is a great
example of what I said as red being the
most visually assaulting color the
caveat to that or the follow up to it is
if everything is red then nothing is
important you see when I'm at all your
text yes I think you have a question in
the chat box I can't see it while I'm
presenting and what me and we can go
back at the end yeah we can do that I
can't see it while I'm presenting here
free so I will be sure and get back to
that Thanks alright so as you can see
here when everything's red it really
kind of makes your face look everywhere
rather than at one focused place and so
I'm very very conservative with that
color red and using it only when I want
someone to look at something specific if
you overuse it it may not it may not
point people where you want them to be
now I love this ad from Southeast
Financial clear simple large big bold
font loved it and it's got the boat
image now what would you owe me nuts
about this is I go to the landing page
and it could catch all it's a catch-all
for motorcycles boats trailers it's one
of those things where you may be ad with
a boat in it let's make a landing page
that's just for boats and there was no
continuity from the image to the ad or
even from
the promise the promise was specifically
apply now in time to make some weight
that's floating and I get to the page
and they're not delivering the promise
there is votes but it's mixed in with
snowmobiles lawn mowers and things like
that now I do giving points for putting
the apply now in a big red button up at
the top of the page because that is the
call to action that we want to see
another one I thought was yeah Matt's I
just want to jump in for a second and
add just a brief point of context you
know you may be your us sales people on
our team may be thinking and I have a
tendency to think this way too as a
frequent some of these examples is you
know geez how am I supposed to effect
this out these financial landing page
but it's really again back to my opening
comments this is about us being an
expert on display as much as it is about
selling a campaign for a month or a
quarter I think the easiest equivalent
we can most all identify with is when
some when you buy a car the salesperson
you've already signed the paperwork
they've already made their money but
they go through whether it's how to how
to maintain the vehicle or how to use
the features inside the car they're
trying to make sure you're satisfied and
that the car works for you at the end of
the day and so as I want to make sure
we're all connecting those dots that to
be successful with display we may have a
have to take the conversation a step
further than we're used to which is not
just selling southeast financial this
display ad but making sure they're
holding up their end of the bargain and
then it's going to work yeah if we're
for traction services on our end and we
can't put the dealers to a number or web
website URL what other call-to-action
would you suggest is far I mean I know
you said you would never use click here
yes that's really the promise is we need
to offer something of value I know
working on one campaign we found buyers
guides to be a huge value that P
we'll look you know ultimately what
you're trying to do is get someone to
surrender their email address and if you
can do that you have to provide
something of equal or greater value in
order to capture that um and so you know
I was seeing ads on the sites with view
the inventory take a tour you know those
are what I would consider more awareness
type of ads because you're just you know
you're trying to get someone to click
through but at that same time it's not a
it's really not a commitment type of
activity or behavior that we're asking
them for and it's really kind of a low
value delivery it is just looking at the
inventory or touring the boat um and so
if your clients are saying we want more
click throughs then the responses will
we need we need to present something of
value what do you have a value that
someone would be willing to give their
email address for if you want that lead
because the ultimate purpose of getting
the click-through is to get the lead and
so it's really helping people to think
in terms of a process of getting them
hooked bringing them in getting the data
that we need from them and it doesn't
just happen with an ad it happens with
the process and so helping people think
in those terms is you know to Brad's
point when I had the agency we always
said that the our best clients were our
educated clients they were the ones that
they would listen they wanted to learn
and because we were teaching them how to
get the most out of their investment
with us as the agency so at the same
thing that you may not have control over
it uh but you're teaching them how to
get the most out of their investment in
you and by providing just some simple
tips and guidance that will you know
it's up to them to listen and follow
through but it's in their best interest
to do it
I know I kind of took the long way
around to answer that question but did I
kind of get to that okay all right
yeah it really comes down to what you're
asking um
that's going to determine the amount of
the amount of engagement that someone
will take is the amount of commitment
we're asking them and what we're
providing for them now this is more of a
sort of that transactional nature the
bottom of the funnel so I love this ad
and I love the you know even though
we're sending them to the home page here
on West Marine
uh I can't fold it because the
continuity is there from the color to
the font to the headline to the shop now
button in the ad and then they get there
and it's last minute gift shop now is
repeated in the header uh this is a
great example it's also you know kind of
a we're using red but if you sparingly
it's not overdone I but I love the
continuity of the button and the font in
here and this is exactly what I was
talking about for that transactional
nature because we're driving them to a
sale we're telling them to shop and so
this would be measured based on
click-through based on sale amount those
types of things uh and so I loved the
continuity on that one and this is one
where I thought was very interesting
because it one where a promise is made
but the delivery of the promise isn't
the same so I give it pros I give it a
good thumbs up for the color the design
continuity the fonts are the same high
quality throughout but then the call to
action is not consistent if you'll
notice the button in the ad is to see
the entire fleet it sends us to the home
page and again this gets back to my my
focus on a home page send us to the home
page the home page is all about the
Hatteras 90 and if you'll see the
the call-to-action on the home page
above the fold in a very visible place
is explore model so this might seem so
minut but this is the science of leading
people from the ad to the page to the
registration the promise is to see the
fleet the delivery is to see one model
that's the breadcrumb trail that gets
broken because it's a specific model
that's being focused on in the landing
page whereas the ad was about the entire
fleet so I hope that really helps to
drill that home like I said it sounds
minut but it's huge in terms of the
mindset of that micro moment when
someone is inspired when someone sees
the ad clicks through this breaks the
mindset so let's bring it all down into
sort of a summary on the specific areas
that we're looking at so number one a
color design continuity from the ad to
the landing page same thing same font
weight style must go all the way across
from the ad to the landing page keep the
quality scan ability is critical I don't
know if you read the text down in the
corner but if you bullet text 77% of the
time people will look at that as opposed
to 42% of the time if you use bullets
without a bullet point that is there
it's just amazing the science that goes
on in how people view ads and landing
pages make sure the call-to-action is
above the fold and then it's a delivery
and it's a promise you are delivering
the promise made in the ad now I would
say that this landing page that I semi
designed here is more for informational
and awareness if I were going to do a
lead generation campaign this is how I
would change it I would put the value
proposition in there I would make the
delivery the top of the page and we saw
that some of the landing pages
make sure it's continuity but then I
would put the form and the promise so if
it's downloading a buyers guide if it's
downloading a spec sheet if it's getting
anything of value I'm asking for it
right up top because the promise was
made in the ad now I'm delivering it and
the only way I can deliver it is if I
get your name and your email address and
then once that's verified you will get
your information and so it's how we
deliver when we're looking specifically
at a lead generation campaign now a
couple things as far as trends in
display and what we're seeing in really
the the two biggest areas of growth in
trends are number one data and the other
one is attribution attribution as far as
trying to track the origins of customers
what was the first touch point of
customers you see a lot of measurement
is based on what we call the last click
and that was really the last thing you
clicked on before you bought so even
let's say you uh you know you did some
shopping online and really you just kind
of browse the sites you did some google
searches and click-through but you buy
anything and then a couple hours later
you decide you're going to buy something
uh you can't really remember what it was
but you maybe let's do a search on it
and then you click on an ad and you
click on the ad for that company and
then you go and buy it
well most analytics would give full
attribution to the ad even though you
had done a search and put on the organic
result a few hours earlier and so that's
what attribution is all about it's
trying to figure out where did this
person originate where was that first
touch point because we want to be sure
we're not leaving that out of our
campaign budgeting the other side of it
is data data from third parties that
enhance our targeting abilities and I'm
going to give an example of that first
as far as attribution one thing that
we're seeing an attribution is that view
through credit which I talked to
out a little earlier in that the
campaign we got very little clicks but
we had a lot of view through now what
view through is is a validated ad view
by a customer so for example if a user
is on a site and they see an ad now that
ad places a tracking pixel on the user's
computer and if that user then some
within a certain time frame visits the
advertiser site whether they do it
through surgery or they type it in
directly the ad server is able to see
that that user saw an ad maybe a week
ago maybe two weeks ago and they tied
together that ad view with the user link
to the brand site what that means is the
publisher is able to start getting
credit now for ad views not just ad
clicks so we're seeing a lot of this now
starting make its way into publishing
models into ad revenue models where
publishers are getting credit for sim
playing the ad to a user that ultimately
goes to the site because that may have
been the first interaction with that
advertiser or brand add a quick question
yes can the advertiser pixel the ad that
they give to us or do we have to pixel
the ad from the server uh it really
could happen either way ah no it is
powder of the way the yeah it's just how
the script that goes into ad tracker um
so yeah I could be a you know it's
always a third party um if it's the
advertiser it would be you know their ad
server would be a third party cookie or
pixel placed on the user's um now for
that to be native for
you uh if it's coming out of your ad
system yes that then would be um that
would be a cookie that you would
generate uh and it would just have to be
tied through to that advertisers account
um but then ultimately that would have
to be associated to a visit to their
site which might be a little tricky but
not impossible
gotcha as we've set up and I think I've
shared with you that we're setting up
our own ad ops environment over the next
45 days and that might be something I'd
like to follow up with you on and probe
a little further certainly certainly
yeah I can certainly provide some help
and guidance there all right so
hopefully I don't know some of you you
may be seeing dollar signs in your head
thinking about this kind of a model uh I
think it's good because as we talked
about earlier this goes back to the
unaided brand recall that simply by
seeing display ads it provides a better
recall to consumers than regular search
ads and so this attribution model
follows that brand recall study that
just simply seeing the ad and having a
validated ad view should provide
publishers a a part of the credit for
ultimately gaining that lead or gaining
that sale by the advertiser uh to talk a
little bit about third-party data we can
really get better at hitting certain
people for example this was a campaign
done by American Express and their
target audience they were looking for
people with a specific income level and
also a specific credit score so they
went out to a third-party organization
and so for their display campaign only
people that
a specific level and credit score
would see these ads however they also
added a little twist uh they took out
anyone who had visited a gambling site
within the past six months they did not
want any higher risk this was a specific
pain to a very targeted group of people
with very low risk and so by using
third-party data they were able to
create a campaign to where the ads were
only seen by this specific audience who
met these parameters and so that's how
third-party enabling some better
targeting as well to specific audience
groups now looking at I think everyone's
favorite part of this is going to be
measurements let's look at numbers but I
want to help you as far as when you're
dealing with your clients and the topic
of numbers and measurement come up
here's how here's how we handle those
conversations number one there were
three main metrics that I look at and
three main metrics that help us guide
the conversation so the first one is
number of impressions then if someone is
complaining about the number of
impressions that they've received uh and
I'm looking here I'll typically divide
unique views uh by impressions that lets
me know you know really how many unique
views how many users am i reaching with
how many impressions and if that if
that's not satisfactory to a client then
the problem is number one uh budget
consideration if you're not getting the
view ability of that ad that you intend
especially if it's just an awareness
campaign then it's a budget problem you
don't have enough budget to get the
visibility in front of the unique users
or your overall impression target now if
someone's complaining about clicks that
I'm not getting the click-through the
clicks that I want that's a CTA
that conversation is all about your
headline and your call to action and so
whenever a client talks to me about the
lack of click-through we immediately go
pull up the creative and we evaluate it
in terms of what are you promising
because if the click-through rates not
there ultimately what that means is that
what you're promising is not interesting
now you may not want to say it in those
words depending upon your relationship
with the client but that's ultimately
what it comes down to which are
promising just isn't good enough and
compare it to the other promises being
made by other advertisers ultimately if
they want to play in the in the in the
CTA to click-through rate if they want
to earn the CTR the click-through rate
then it has everything to do with the
strength of the ad and the promise
they're making in the ad because if
there's a low click-through rate you're
not promising anything of value and
that's what that conversation is all
about when it comes down to
click-through rate if they're
complaining about they do you know they
are sending people to a landing page
with a lead generation campaign and
they're not getting leads then the
conversation is about number one your
offer and then number two your landing
page those are the things that I'll look
at whenever there is a discussion about
the lack of leads being generated from
the campaign so I'll bet that these are
probably three of the top areas where
you get feedback where you maybe get
complaints and hopefully this will help
you guide the discussion in terms of
what type of campaign are you altima
tunning does the ad reflect that type of
campaign in are we evaluating the right
measurements and what do those
measurements tell us so again just to
reinforce if this is an awareness
campaign then the metrics to measure an
awareness campaign are my visibility
metrics my number of unique views and
overall impressions
that's what I'm measuring for an
awareness campaign for lead generation
I'm looking at click-through rates I'm
looking at signups ultimately
registrations and down the line
hopefully sales if we can track that far
um if the purpose of the campaign is an
investment return on investment like we
get to that transactional uh if we're
asking people to shop now then that's an
ROI metric that's what we'd be looking
at based on the type of campaign that
will inform us as to the type of
relevant metrics or that campaign so
here's kind of a matrix that I look at
just to kind of give you an idea of
comparisons and what we would be doing
so for branding and awareness again I'm
looking at buying impressions I'm
looking primarily at my cost per mil in
buying the impressions across multiple
media now if I'm selling something like
golf vacations that's a shorter sales
cycle and I'm going to be positioning
that in more demographic and behavioral
type of sights but that I will be
measuring in terms of cost per
acquisition because I'm asked that's
more of a lead generation campaign and
so in that instance when we compare the
two again we're looking at probably a
longer longer sales cycle and if you're
looking at more awareness and branding
you can't measure the same as a vacation
ad that might seem obvious but sometimes
we need to remind our clients about that
low margin things consumables this is
what you see shows up in the paid ad on
Google or Bing or any of the search
engines because those are the best place
if they cheap ad buy to get into search
engine ads but for things that are high
margin with a long sales cycle it
doesn't make sense to go after you can
add that in to go after search ads but
again it depends on what we're doing if
we're looking for awareness we're going
to measure by visibility
per mil that's what I'm buying if I'm
trying to develop some leads then I'm
going to get into my cost per
acquisition if I'm not getting enough
leads then it's a problem with what I'm
promising then additional measurement
and I can use so like I talked about
before visibility if this is just an
awareness campaign I'm looking at total
number of unique views as well as my
overall number of impressions but then
also what we will get into when we're
looking at just branding or awareness is
the share of voice the share of voice
really kind of to make it simple is a F
for advertisers uh all with a similar ad
spend then they each have 25% share a
voice on my site and so that I kind of
we're not looking so much at view
ability there but we're looking at
competition and so if you're really kind
of looking at how do I you know how do I
have this discussion with a client share
a voice is really kind of an interesting
metric to bring up in terms of if you
were to tell a client that you only have
10% share of voice when we look at all
the advertising on this site what that
does is it gives them there it helps you
position where their budget is in
regards to all the other advertisers on
the site now that may be dangerous
that's more of a you know I would say
it's more of an organizational decision
to go to that type of a metric but I've
seen it be effective especially in terms
of Education in terms of developing
budgets as well as what is the purpose
of your campaign because your share of
voice will affect your overall share
market there's numerous studies that
show that if as a competitor if your
share of voice and advertising on a site
is not greater than those of the
industry leaders then you're losing
market share
you have to exceed the share of voice in
order to increase market share
uh there's just a fascinating study
there but share voice is a great way to
give someone more of a realistic idea of
what their budget is getting them in
terms of overall competition couple
other measurements that you can uh that
I I've gone into number one is uh brand
recall and brand lift there's some
surveys uh that you can generate and run
uh to your existing customers and also
to people who may not use the cite a
number of survey tools that are
available to you uh that will help
people to uh it will help you to really
put across that when people see your ad
on our site it provides a brand lift
they're a little bit less uh you know
there's some scientific data behind
behind how they're run I find them a
little less tangible than share a voice
visibility metrics viewability things
like that uh but they're additional
things that sometimes we'll add in when
we need that little extra oomph in terms
of showing the value that we provide
also looking at engagement what else
beyond ad do we want people to see
sometimes we'll look at dwell time
especially if it's a video or rich media
type of ad or an ad that has some
engagement inside of it one thing we've
seen are some rich media ads now uh
where they will have a poll that runs
inside of the ad rather than making
someone quickly ad go to a landing page
and complete a poll question all that
can take place inside the ad and so
adding more things that will enable
people to engage in the ad without going
to a landing page is a trend that we've
seen and one that also picks up the
engagement stats and then I talked about
click through and view through as the
measurements and really how quick route
is the result of the long view of the
overall campaign so really I'm going to
I'll wrap up my side of this and we can
go into some questions and discussion
but here's my advice to you that when
you are selling display the number
one thing is to have a conversation
about the overall campaign and marketing
objectives of your client don't just
take the order this is where you can
shine and help them get the best value
so ask about their business objectives
what are they trying to accomplish with
this campaign and make sure you align
the expectations to their objective is
it just awareness if it's awareness then
we're measuring impressions is its lead
generation then we're going to measure
click-through rate and we're measuring
sales you know then they can go to ROI
but again then when you know the
campaign when you know the objective and
the expectations are aligned to the
objective now we make sure that they add
the message the offer the landing page
are all part of the alignment to that
objective we can't just look at the ad
by itself and take the creative and not
check and see where you're going to send
people because they're going to come to
you when the click-through rate isn't
good and being able to respond
competently by understanding the whole
picture of the promise the delivery the
continuity from ad to the presentation
of that offer is going to be critical
not only for you to be competent and
lead the client and understanding how
display works but also it's going to
help educate your clients in terms of
how to get the best and the most out of
their campaigns so thank you so much for
my ability to present to you today and
now I kind of look forward to what I
think is going to be the the best part
and those are your questions and so if
you want if you you can type the
question in the question box or raise
your hand and I'll unmute you whatever
you prefer
and Brad your line is open
if you've got anything right there your
question earlier in that chat about what
your social
yeah but we can't see it Jason had just
texted John give a question in the chat
Matt um okay yes I've got one from
Charlie uh with the clients that you
have worked with on average do they have
in-house developers to build specific
landing pages with the reckless CPAs or
do they rely on an agency media vendor
to build them for the campaign ah great
question charlie great question uh it's
been a mix of both um it really depends
I would say more on the size of the
company if they've got those internal
assets or not um sometimes we have been
we've done more of the with my agency we
did more the by uh and then we worked
with someone that did be creative um a
lot of times I will say they forget
about the landing page which is
hilarious um but yeah it just really
kind of depends on the size of the
company and if they have those assets
and if those assets have experience that
that's sort of the thing there there's a
follow up to that let me know from that
uh Jason had a question isn't the
click-through already recorded when the
visitor clicks the ad I'm not sure why
the landing page being good or bad is
going to affect the flip through rate
that is the click-through rate okay so
yes there's the click-through rate from
the ad to the page uh and then on the
landing page is a call to action and
that would be more for like a lead
generation uh so then we we also measure
the click-through rate on the landing
page in order to measure the
effectiveness of the campaign I hope
that explains that if not I type that in
let me know or put up your hand and I
can unmute you and we can we can talk
through it there um so those are two
questions that I've had here are there
any additional questions I've answered
the questions I've got in the text box
all right Scott I see you there and you
are unmuted awesome how are you thank
you for taking my question
sure one of the the things that I've
always argued with our clients that is
an issue is just like you said before
with your clients is the education if
you find a client that's even fairly
educated in what a banner ad does or a
display ad does and how it could help
increase their business and the matrix
that are used to measure it you're
you're way ahead of the game and I think
it's one of our biggest challenges is
finding clients that even see or have
enough education to see the value in
display ads what what are some of the
things that maybe your company did to
help educate your clients you know on a
greater scale outside of one-on-one
interactions because they although
that's the ultimate but there's only so
much you can do you know in the course
right day so what are the songs in the
wave boy that is a great question large
scale you know large scale I think we
did the best we could but ultimately
that was a large scale with like a
display ad it wasn't until we got them
into the landing page which would which
I would consider more of a face-to-face
that I could present that and be able to
show our specific value um because you
know on the large scale everyone's just
looking for better ways to promote
themselves and more effective ways of
doing it so where I would typically lead
it just the values of display um you
know the recoil metrics those types of
things
in terms of just getting that visibility
it's a great place to start the
conversation even on our larger scale
but ultimately the education takes place
unfortunately on small
scale because the vast majority of
people may just want the Silver Bullet
and they won't have the patience to
listen to anything that isn't a silver
bullet so Matt I'll ask a follow-up
question to that you shared that you
reference just now in your answer that
study that showed the effectiveness of
display ads relative to paid search
organic search um hey where did you find
that study and be you know what kind of
tools or resources like that study
should we be using on a regular basis
for those clients to Scotch point that
we need to go in and get excited about
display what's what tools should we have
in our tool belt or what resources
should we have in our disposal to help
our sales team go in and fight that
fight um this is one this was actually
from comScore and so one of the things I
really kind of keep open as a channel is
just um digital advertising news and
surveys and research um you know
unfortunately it's one of those things I
just got to keep an open channel and
constantly look at you know what are
people responding to and utilizing that
both on a macro level of you know the
big conversation but then also how does
that apply them to what I'm doing day to
day so that's the type of content that I
look for in in developing that um I was
trying to remember the other part of
your question there um I think that I
think that is okay we may just need to
identify somebody on our team whether
it's a sales planner or somebody from
the account management team that that
can or maybe even marketing that can
keep an eye on display
research keep us at the forefront of
what's happening and educating our
clients yeah absolutely absolutely and
part of that okay now I'm remembering
what the other half of this is you know
you've got your own data and data
metrics uh you've got the demographics
of who you're selling to of who uses
your sites
um now the what I think would be
effective is you know it may be even
from this webinar or maybe someone goes
back to err client and they're able to
provide them the advice on here's the
continuity of the campaign here's how I
would improve the landing page here's
how it improve the ad um now you look at
the performance of that campaign post
evaluation uh and now you can put
together you know kind of a white paper
on how you're going to help them get the
most out of their campaign here it was
when it was delivered here it was after
our feedback and advice and so it's
almost developing an internal narrative
of what Dominion offers more than just a
order your ads from us know we're going
to provide you value-added we're going
to provide you education as to what gets
you the most so more of that that
internal story that you can tell that
distinguishes dominion over competitive
sites gotcha all right uh Courtney has a
question and Courtney you are unusable I
met I have a question a lot of our
customers and display conversations of
course a very strong competitor that
they bring up our Google AdWords
obviously we don't want this the
click-through rate is you know certainly
much higher and you've kind of touched
on several different things I guess I
wanted to kind of get your thoughts on
helping a customer to reframe their
thoughts as far as the value of display
you know it seems like maybe the share a
voice market our most valuable
but it's really concerned about the
clicks you know what would your thoughts
be on you know basically trying to
convert that customer to more of a
display mindset right yeah well and that
kind of gets back to what we're talking
about in terms of expectations of the
campaign and what they're trying to
accomplish you know I think AdWords will
well always to me it's not it's an
apples and oranges comparison they're
getting an AdWords ad based on the words
they typed in to Google and so it's
based completely upon the the intent of
the searcher for that ad to show up and
so whereas display doesn't run that way
you know in this context in this context
if someone comes to your site you're
going to this is how you're going to
reach them this is how this is a you
know sort of a it's a different a
different world than Google this is not
Google this is you know this is where
you're you're looking to see what's for
sale and what's available and so it's
really creating that delineation of
that's great if you should do AdWords
but that's a completely different
campaign with different expectations
whereas this you're getting people who
are already here and already shopping
and already in the funnel
I would explain Google AdWords as being
a very early stage funnel of interest
and so you may get the clicks but those
are early early stage clicks whereas if
they are on your site they are minute
funnel and how are you going to change
your message then to reach them it's
super helpful thank you great great let
me see if we got any more hands Jason
followed up with the the biggest problem
is that customers don't have ad creative
capabilities on you to build a tub
uh yeah I seen that many many times like
I said if it's the unfortunately it's
the downside of working with different
sizes of companies and the assets there
so I guess it's really an organizational
decision as to how you want to hail that
um or you know if that's a separate
service or you know it really comes down
to really what what's the workflow going
to be and and how will those be created
but certainly I understand your point
you're paying there Jason because I've
run into that numerous times as well and
that we one thing we've talked about as
an organization is possibly for those
clients that don't have good creative
resources and our our internal creative
resources are really you know here for
other reasons we may outsource to a firm
whose that's their specific expertise is
display creative you don't have to
answer this question now but if you
could if you know of any creative shops
that do that that we should consider I'd
love to I'd love to get a note from you
on that yep I can I can recommend a few
yeah perfect yeah I'll put that in the
book Sara will take care of that this
webinar may have just paid for itself
[Laughter]
alright I'm not sure I see any
additional hands else here got one here
Norfolk Matt yes okay my question is
looking at the looking the screen that
we're looking at right now when I'm
seeing the topical thing with the 43%
says organic page display nothing about
that in terms of what I can offer five
on both trader in terms of the organic
search that they're going to do there
and the paid search which would be a
listing enhancement and and displayed to
add to that or something about that in
terms of like an SEO SEM display like
with Google AdWords work that is the
context is AdWords is basically the
front page and display ads across a
variety of sites is the context of it
however I don't think it would be a far
leap to also apply that to your site as
well I think that would be actually a
very highly contextual leap to make and
logic yeah it's a great question and I
think we he mentioned the marketing
story I think he used the phrase
marketing story earlier we probably need
to you said it really well just take
kind of a success story approach to a
marketing piece that says you know sort
of the power of membership enhancements
and display all together it's a great
idea yeah okay I'm not sure we'll see
any additional hands Brandon if there's
anything there from your group no thank
you Matt thank you
DMM sales for making the time thank you

look forward to getting the deck from
you and those creative recommendations

these unanswered questions here I did
get a few in so I will follow up on
those and send those over to you Brad as
