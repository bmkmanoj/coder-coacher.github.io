release and deployment process release
and deployment management policies
should be in place to help the
organization achieve the correct balance
between cost service stability and
agility release and deployment
management policies should help release
and deployment management personnel to
make decisions that support the overall
objectives of the business these
policies can be set at an overall
service provider level for example all
changes and releases must be fully
tested under a realistic load before
they are deployed or for an individual
service for example all changes to the
service will be packaged into annual
releases and the only permitted changes
between these releases will be to
resolve problems that have a major
impact on the business
in the next let us look at release unit
and its identification a release unit
describes the portion of a service or IT
infrastructure that is normally released
together according to the organization's
release policy the unit may vary
depending on the type types or items of
service asset or service component such
as software and hardware the general aim
is to decide the most appropriate
release unit level for each service
asset or component an organization may
for example decide that the release unit
for business critical applications is
the complete application in order to
ensure that testing is comprehensive the
same organization may decide that a more
appropriate release unit for a website
is at the page level the following
factors should be taken into account
when deciding the appropriate level for
release units the ease and amount of
change necessary to release and deploy a
release unit the amount of resources and
needed to build test distribute and
implement a release unit the complexity
of interfaces between the proposed unit
and the rest of the services and IT
infrastructure the storage available in
the build test distribution and live
environment releases should be uniquely
identified according to a scheme defined
in the release policy the release
identification should include a
reference to the CIS that it represents
and a version number that will often
have two or three parts for example
emergency fix releases payroll system
version 1.1 point 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
