and switching course offered by simply
learn the previous lesson focused on
spanning tree and ether channel this
lesson focuses on security let us begin
with the objectives of this lesson in
the next slide by the end of this lesson
you will be able to explain how access
control lists are processed configure
and verify various types of router
access control lists describe how access
control lists can be used to make the
network more secure let us start with
access control lists in the next slide
access control lists ACLs also called
simply access lists allow you to permit
or deny packets for further processing
based on packet information they serve
many purposes for example packet
filtering and NAT this lesson will
address only router access lists and
provide a foundation for in-depth
learning about other types of access
lists in the future ACLs are a critical
component in securing switches and
routers ACLs filter by address or subnet
multiple access control list entries
ACPs for access control list entries are
possible within an ACL let us find out
how to specify addresses in the next
slide
ACL s use wildcard masks like the
inverse mask used for EIG RP and OSPF in
the network command to construct an
inverse mask the ones are swapped with
the zeros in the binary representation
of the subnet address this is the same
thing as taking 255.255.255.0 5 and
subtracting the regular subnet mask for
example 192.168.1.0 / 24 has a subnet
mask of 255.255.255.0 subtracting this
mask from 255 255 dot 255 dot 255 yields
0.00 255 as the inverse mask keywords
can be
substituted for two special addresses
the word host is the same as wildcard
mask 0.0.0.0
and the word any is the same as wildcard
mask 255.255.255.0 one six eight dot one
dot 10.0.0.0
enter host 192.168.1.1 instead of 0.0
0.0 0.0 0.0 enter any before configuring
ACLs let us discuss how they work in the
next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
