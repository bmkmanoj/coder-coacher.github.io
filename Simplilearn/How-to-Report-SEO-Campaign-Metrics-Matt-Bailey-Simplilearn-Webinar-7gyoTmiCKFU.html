Matt and thank you for joining us I'll
hand it off to you now all right thank
you so much Rama
I appreciate that introduction and in
today's subject of reporting SEO
campaign metrics this is an area that
has gone through constant evolution ever
since search engines came onto the scene
people have wanted to know how well
they're doing in search but also if they
are working with an agency how do they
know what they are investing is working
and so especially with all the changes
that search engines have made over the
years the dramatic difference between
websites now and 20 years ago as well as
the measurement tools all of these
things have combined to make this
sometimes a very mystifying approach as
to knowing what I can look at to know
i'm being successful or experiencing
success in search engines so we're going
to cover a number of things and part of
also what i want to talk about are the
trends that are affecting search now and
then also some of the hindrances to
traditional SEO reporting and then ways
that we can develop competent reporting
for
our clients for our partners those that
have stock in what's going on with the
website and how we can report what's
going on what it means and what we can
do which are really the three keys to
successful reporting now when we're
talking about the trends there are
significant shifts happening in organic
search the first of which is machine
learning that is more artificial
intelligence analyzing search queries
and developing new algorithms within the
machine learning to serve up results
determine intent which is the primary
goal of machine learning and to return
not only the results but the information
you need as well as predicting
information you might need in the near
future
the second is voice search more and more
voice assistants are becoming popular
through your smartphone through your
laptop through home assistance and
people are asking for information and so
it is completely happening at an
auditory level not in visual level and
so how that is happening and how that
affects SEO reporting is really going to
be a factor moving forward and then also
as I'm sure if you've been doing any
search engine optimization for any
length of time you are familiar with the
struggle that has happened ever since
Google decided to strip keyword data out
of any analytics reporting that took
away really the number one way that you
were able to measure the effectiveness
of gaining keywords in the search
engines now to hit each one of these
just to explain them a little bit more
so that you know exactly what's
happening and what it looks like as it
affects your current level of SEO work
as well as reporting as an example of
machine learning if you go into Google
AdWords right now and you were to set up
a campaign looking at maybe
like auto body or auto work or something
like that if you typed in a few keywords
into Google what's happening is Google
is only reporting one phrase that might
cover two or three or four phrases based
on for example auto body being is it one
word or is it two words boo boo here is
providing it as two words so even if I
type in auto body as a single word this
is where the machine learning is coming
in realizing that these are the same
queries and so rather than treat them as
individual queries what is happening is
the machine learning is they are trying
to figure out what is the intent of the
search and then grouping the intent into
single categories or single searches and
then all the variations would be
included in that now if I do keyword
research at a third party such as word
tracker or something like that now what
I'm going to find are multiple different
ways that people search they're gonna
put in locations they're gonna put in
details they're going to you know use
one word two words and so in a third
party keyword research format we're
going to see a lot more variations
because those are tracking what people
are actually typing in what Google is
doing from a machine learning standpoint
is condensing everything and trying to
group it into as I said similar forms of
intent now what's happening here it
means that phrases or words that are
plurals acronyms typical variants such
as words that may mean the same thing
but then there are different words so
they're going to group them together and
then also as you saw their words with
spaces or without spaces conjunction
words as well as hyphens and apostrophes
a lot of these are going to fall out of
what you're able to bid on also in the
paid search side and it will all go into
a particular group
of words under a primary heading so
that's where voice are just taking us is
really a condensing of the language into
intent what are people searching for and
how do we give that there and how do we
give their information back to them now
obviously this isn't perfect I've worked
with a number of clients where they may
offer a service and because of that
service Google is trying to then
associate them with another service and
it's not relevant and so because of that
machine learning sometimes what we're
seeing is a difficulty in trying to get
unique businesses new ideas or something
that just isn't a part of that overall
big picture they're trying to force it
into neat little boxes but as we know
business is not full of neat little
boxes it's messy it's fuzzy if it's it's
all kinds of different types of
businesses suppliers industries that are
going to have some level of uniqueness
about them so hopefully this can
continue to improve but it does at this
point still need some human intervention
the second aspect is voice search and
maybe some of you have maybe the Google
home or the Alexa appliance in your home
and you've been playing around with it
and seeing what it can do but also
everyone's phone and then also Cortana
is on any Microsoft operating system
desktop and so being able to search from
your phone simply by a voice command now
this is affecting our ability to report
because this does not show up as a
search now if you're using Google now
and you are searching on Google or a
Google app it will show up as a search
referral however if you're using Cortana
if you're using Siri it's going to use
the search engine of the operating
system
and so in that case and I'm gonna
address this a little bit later it shows
up as a direct visit rather than a
search initiated visit and so this is
affecting the reporting of SEO metrics
but at the same time it is also changing
the search landscape entirely right now
Amazon is probably Google's biggest
competitor for most searches especially
for electronics especially for what you
would consider things for
home-and-garden Amazon right now it has
taken about 40% of the market share away
from Google in terms of electronics and
home products because people are going
to Amazon first and they're using Alexa
to do this so how voice search it really
is going to be a volatile industry to
follow over the next five years and then
as I mentioned before probably the
biggest frustration of anyone doing
search engine optimization or wanting to
measure the effectiveness of
optimization or where they stand in the
marketplace is the keyword not provided
now there's a number of reasons why
Google has gone about this the first
reason that they gave was for privacy
reasons that they wanted people's
searches to be private but at the same
time if you are doing paid search you
have full access to keywords and also if
you are advertising through Google you
can target people based on their search
terms so we know the privacy thing was
really kind of a smokescreen I think
what's going on here is that this was
really the first step to getting people
away from thinking of individual
keywords or key phrases and focusing on
one or two phrases that there that would
describe their business by taking away
the vast majority of keywords that
you're gonna see in your analytics it
will force you to look at other words it
will force you to think bigger
picture rather than those one or two
words that most people believe that's
what my business needs this is where I'm
gonna focus my attention and in and so
in some ways this has been good by
making people forcing people to think
beyond a single word or a single phrase
about their business and looking into
the bigger picture this also plays into
the short machine learning because as I
showed you before machine learning is
condensing all of these keyword phrases
trying to determine intent and what
better way to really assist that than to
start taking away keyword data in the
search engines however when you take
that away you have then taken away the
number one reporting factor of SEO and
that is what keywords am i ranking for
what keywords are bringing in not only
visitors but business and so by taking
away the number one factor we're forced
to look at a number of different methods
that we can use then to develop better
campaign metrics now one of the first
things about metrics is the expectations
whenever I work with a company I want to
know specifically what are your
expectations for the campaign what are
you trying to get out of it what do you
expect I'll never forget I was
consulting with an agency about how they
are developing their SEO campaigns and
how they were reporting them to their
clients and I went with them to one of
their client meetings and after some of
the agency people left I asked if I
could talk with a client for a bit after
the meeting and because the main reason
was on this whiteboard in the corner of
their office they had visits this month
and visits last month and the client
asked me about the agency you know what
I was doing for them and what they what
the agency was trying to do and then
they said that they had concerns and the
reason why they had concerns is
that the visits last month were higher
than the visits this month and that over
the past few months the number of visits
had been going down and because of that
they were having a lack of confidence in
their agency now this was really kind of
surprising because this goes right to
the heart of client expectations uh no
when I had asked that client then after
that you towards the end of the
conversation is how how is your business
how we're leads how are your key
performance indicators how are the
conversions on the site basically asking
them how's business and the response to
that was well business is great business
has been improving over the past few
months however the primary metrics they
were looking at was visits rather than
the business oriented metrics and so
this is where establishing expectations
of what campaign metrics we're going to
follow and what those campaign metrics
mean to a business this is a
conversation that must take place rather
than just reporting basic information
the same charts and graphs every month
or every quarter that really might not
communicate the information that
everyone needs and so a conversation
between agencies and clients about what
are the expectations of this SEO
campaign what do we want out of that and
what constitutes success that
conversation needs to take place and
then that will determine how the
campaign metrics are then developed and
presented and the discussion that will
happen around them now one thing that I
think has been you know I would say both
a struggle as well as what needs to
happen the first thing about SEO metrics
is the myth of the number one ranking
once in a while I'll still run into this
where someone will Hin
the entire success of a campaign by
seeing the number one ranking they want
a single word or a toothed word phrase
to rank number one in Google and that is
their only standard of success
unfortunately I you know anymore I will
not even work with that kind of a client
because it's an unrealistic expectation
and it also shows a complete ignorance
of how search works and what it the
power of what it can bring to your
business that this is much bigger than a
number one ranking and if that's all you
want then give me a budget we'll pay for
it but I would say for the most part
we've moved beyond a number one ranking
and now what we have to educate people
on is that rankings are really a
personal metric that you the rankings
you see are probably going to be
slightly different than everybody else
and I'm gonna walk through why that
happens and so you can help educate
people within your own organization of
why ranking is a personal metric now
rather than a universal metric and then
of course as I mentioned before it's all
the expectations campaign metrics need
to focus on the business objectives
not just on the external factors of
rankings and and somewhat invisibility
we want to look at the visibility of a
company but ultimately what we need to
look at is how is your search campaign
delivering on your business objectives
because that's the point of it all is
what are we what are we trying to
accomplish and how is it being
accomplished
see it's when I see charts like this
that still make me a little queasy and
still make me roll my eyes this was done
about two years ago asking people what
are you measuring and unfortunately
there hasn't been much change since this
initial survey that the vast majority of
people are measuring the number of
visits to the website
and then they're measuring social
sharing time on site and less than half
are still measuring SEO rankings um now
that still bottles my mind because
that's what I'm gonna walk through here
is why we can't measure SEO rankings is
a completely undependable metric and so
what what really surprises me shocks me
is that 35% of people are measuring
subscriber growth and 27% a little more
than 1/4 of businesses surveyed here are
measuring sales leads this is what a
show so shocking and surprising
especially when we come to campaign
metrics and expectations of a client and
that is what are the business objectives
what is it that you want to grow because
the last column here sales leads is what
makes business grow that is a direct
contributor to revenue and subscriber
growth well that builds my list and
marketing to my list is a direct
contributor to revenue and so as I said
this is just so mind-boggling because
the two things that directly contribute
that have a direct impact on revenue or
the least measured in this survey the
four things that have an indirect impact
meaning that you can have is as I
mentioned before an incredible number of
website visits but absolutely no revenue
coming in as a result of that these are
all key performance indicators visits
sharing time on site those are key
performance indicators they're not
business objectives and so part of the
expectations of developing campaign
metrics is understanding the difference
between a key performance indicator and
a business objective because it's easy
to get sidetracked
especially with search metrics
especially with these types of things of
you know visits time on-site pageviews
rankings but they're all indirect which
is why they are under the key
performance indicator grouping
whereas we want to look at the business
objectives of subscribers sales leads
downloads getting information into
people's hands engaging with them and
moving along the customer journey when
we can develop metrics that focus on the
experience of a prospect or a customer
then in tie that to our SEO performance
now we're developing how our campaign
will directly impact the business and
the customer now I want to just go off
to the side for a little bit here and
talk about rankings and this is the
whole concept of rankings are personal
not universal now you'll notice on this
this is the this is a rankings report
from 2008 and compared to 2006 I had to
go back really far to find this
screenshot and this is a if you were
doing a search for the keyword latest
news this would show you who ranked
number one and the change in the
rankings over the past two years and it
also we're looking at in Google and MSN
for some of you this may look really
familiar because what this did is you
put in the domains that you are tracking
the keywords and you would get a report
about who ranks where for what keyword
now this is back in the day and even
around 2008 we were still seeing some we
were starting to see fluctuations in
rankings based on where you are
searching from as well as some history
coming in but we weren't seeing it to
the extent that we see it today you see
now today your rankings that you see are
largely based on your search history
it's based on past searches it's
based on content preferences what types
of content you tend to search on click
on or visit what business or industry
you tend to search on as well as any
behaviors such as your predilection to
click on ads paid ads display ads or
anything like that and so what's
happening here is this has been actually
going on for the past ten years is that
more and more of your rankings are going
to be personalized to your unique
history and the words the sites that you
visit the words you use the types of
queries that you make all of this is
being developed in order to provide you
the most relevant personal results
ultimately it's also being done in order
to focus the paid search ads
specifically to you and your behavior
and the industry that you're in because
that's how the search engines monetize
so the better they understand you and
what you're looking for and again it all
comes down to intent if they can figure
out your intent and provide you results
that are relevant both paid and organic
then that's the goal that's what they're
trying to do and so simply based on your
history we're seeing that rankings are
going to vary from person to person and
maybe even from computer to computer to
smartphone depending upon how you use
them the second thing is regional
results if you search for specific
things in one region it's going to show
up differently in other regions if I
search for right now if I go to google
and type in for dealership I'm going to
see the one that's near me and I'm not
going to see one that's out in another
state or another region because based on
the localization that search engines are
providing it's going to look at that
query as a localized result and serve it
to me specifically
so based on location now sometimes we
will see things brands are more global
however if I'm looking for something
that is specific to my region that can
be based on my IP address my country my
city my state even into a zip code local
results targeted results can be limited
to a small area to only show to people
who are within that area or searching in
that area and so more and more based on
localization we're seeing that affect
the results and that has been highly
impactful especially over the past two
to three years as local search has just
gotten miles better in all of the search
engines and it's only going to increase
as well but then also based on the
different types of media based on
language based on the type of search the
intent of search or what words you might
use as well as here we have the machine
learning come in what you'll notice here
is simply if I do a search for something
in Spanish as compared to English I get
different results I get a completely
different results page there's more
videos on the Spanish results from the
Spanish search then the English also the
makeup of the page is completely
different so the words you use how you
structure the query the language those
are all going to affect the type of
results that you see and then also as
you can see here is that the organic
results
you know we're seeing videos taking over
results how to's actual you know
multiple things happening in the search
engine results page and so it's no
longer just a list of ten links and
running a ranking report to see where
you rank because what's happening here
is we're seeing multiple videos being
served prior to even seeing any what you
would call a traditional link or a
traditional website
here showing up in the search engine
results page so as you can see all of
these things are just completely
transforming a individuals rankings and
so if you are to measure rankings what
you're measuring is unreality here
you're measuring something that doesn't
exist
and as I like to say it's a it's extinct
before it's even run because no person
will ever see a ranking report they will
see that reflected in their results it's
going to be personalised and unique
something also to throw into the mix
that even based on your device you are
going to see different results primary
reason is because if you're using a
smartphone it knows your location and so
you're going to have location results
mixed in also based on contracts with
different search providers with
different you know licensing from Google
licensing from YouTube the results will
be different based on the phone you use
based on the provider that you have and
based on simply just being mobile as
opposed to desktop so results are
different based on the device so
hopefully if anyone was hoping to run a
simple ranking report as an SEO campaign
metric just this little sidelight here
has shown it's really a non-starter
anymore the traditional ranking report
is extinct and we have to move beyond
that so how do we move beyond that
because there's also now that I just
shared the difficulties of a traditional
ranking report we also have a couple
other obstacles thrown at us that are
specifically both from a search engine
standpoint and from a user standpoint
the first obstacle that we're running
into is from a search engine standpoint
this is what Google is doing if I do a
search for top car reviews and
17 at the very top of the results I get
a snippet of information pulled from
consumer reports now what's happening
here and you may have seen this as well
if you type a question or something like
that that Google is not only displaying
websites but they're displaying the
answers and they are pulling the content
from these websites now when they do
that that does not show up as a visit
and it doesn't show up as a ranking to
Consumer Reports Consumer Reports has no
method of tracking this visibility and
it's incredible visibility so at one
point Google is providing information to
the searcher but the owner of this
result is having its content displayed
by Google without any knowledge that
it's happening unless someone has gotten
in in order to see that so this is a
significant amount of visibility that
right now goes unreported because
there's no way to integrate this into
any metric calculation other than a
visual inspection to see what's
happening with this we're going to see
more and more of this google is
presenting more and more answers through
the search engine results page rather
than just the website the main reason is
Google has seen the more they do this
the more they deliver the answer in the
search engine results page rather than
having people click through to go to a
website they find that people are more
likely to come back and use Google again
and what's happening here is that Google
essentially is eliminating the
click-through they're trying to keep
people on the search engine results page
as long as possible
think about some of the searches you've
done recently if you search for weather
information if you search for flight
information if you search for sports
scores on Google uh
those types of things you're going to
get
your answer in the search results page
you don't even have to click anywhere
else to get the information it's right
there this is going to not only grow
under Google but this is really the big
question mark as to what is the whole
purpose of Google and what are they
doing and how does it benefit me as a
website being in these results when I
can't track this and when Google is
trying to keep people on their site on
their property as long as possible this
is the big question mark moving forward
for SEO metrics the other side of this
is from a consumer standpoint and this
is what we call dark search dark search
our searches that originated from a
non-traditional search engine for
example if you do a search from your
computer for example Cortana or if you
do a search from your operating system
in an apple you can do a search almost
on the the desktop through the spotlight
search and it will bring up search
results if you go through that it's
using basically the search engine
capability built into the operating
system but it doesn't get reported as a
search engine referral instead what's
happening is it's sending you to that
site as a direct traffic so anything
that's from an operating system a search
that comes through an app now if you're
using the Google app this is kind of a
kind of a gray area but it does happen
so you basically have to install the
Google Search app or use something in
the browser but if you're in an app with
a search function and that app is not a
search engine app it will show up as
direct traffic your voice based searches
that's using the operating system now
you can use a voice based search in the
Google Search app and that will show up
as a search referral I know this might
get a little confusing
but this also is you know this is sort
of the dark search of what's going on
and then also Amazon like I said is
stealing a lot of business away from
Google but there's no way to really know
what your Amazon ranking is for a
specific product or query so in that way
you're kind of losing some of whatever
Amazon is taking we're also losing some
of that data so those are some of the
obstacles that we're running into in
terms of getting a big picture of
campaign metrics so like I said we need
to start with the business goal when we
start developing campaign metrics this
is where the expectations need to be
very very clear and I kind of like the
acronym of clear here that we need to
clearly state what is the business
purpose what are we trying to ultimately
accomplish and how will search help to
accomplish that based on that we create
a set of goals we lay out the goals of
the campaign what do we want people to
do and then carry that over into how
does that accomplish the purpose we then
explain how then define success explain
how success is accomplished as people
meet those goals how does that fit into
the customer journey where is that in
the customer journey how does it move
them from one stage to the next how do
we measure that
and how do we define that as success
then we align metrics to that strategy
we don't just start with the metrics we
start with the purpose the goal defining
success and then aligning metrics as we
have our strategy and then the final
stage is the ideal customer experience
how do we relate that through these
metrics how do we explain that our
customer has seen this and then they did
this or they looked for this information
and it was a successful visit now what
will they meet
this is where we look at the overall
customer journey and how search is a
part of that journey now getting into
some very specific metrics that will
assist this one of the things that I
like to look at and this can be a part
of the reporting if I'm looking at just
the cold hard facts of SEO campaign
metrics one of the first things I'm
going to look at is that audience
overview and I'm going to look
specifically at my organic traffic now
one of the things I need to caution is
making sure and I'm I'm surprised I
still have to say this is comparing like
time frames you can compare a year over
a year if you're comparing the entire
year quarter-to-quarter example is I'm
looking at first quarter 2017 compared
to first quarter 2016 I want to compare
like time frames I am amazed at how many
businesses still look at month to month
to month to month and there's such a
drastic difference between month to
month you have to compare this quarter
to the same quarter last year this month
this year to Latin as you have to
compare the like timeframes going month
a month is is a is chasing your tail so
from here I want to specifically just
look at my organic coverage at this
point what I'm looking at here is with
the audience overview I'm looking at my
total number of sessions this year
compared to last year and I can see that
it's higher and in some areas I'm seeing
some dips but then when I want to go
look at specifically in Google this year
or this first quarter compared to first
quarter last year where am I at in terms
of sessions new users bounce rate
conversion rate and transactions that's
what's going to help me as far as
getting the first step in my SEO metrics
the next is looking at
total organic visits this is anything
that comes through search now again this
is part of the conversation this is
everything we can track because there
are things that are completely outside
of this this might be a good time to say
this I was talking to an analytics
provider a couple of years ago and in
comparing different analytic systems and
I asked them what makes your analytics
more accurate than your competitors it
was very interesting because this is the
lead engineer and he sort of shushed me
this was on a trade show floor he says
in analytics we don't talk about
accuracy he says what I like to say is
that our analytics are less inaccurate
than our custom in our competitors and
that is really the case when it comes to
analytics
if you've ever compared analytics from
two different systems and looking at the
same metrics they never agree I'm always
amazed at how many people try to make
their google analytics line up with
their amateur analytics and it will
never happen or they'll look at multiple
different packages or they'll tell me my
agency is reporting these numbers but
these numbers are what I'm seeing and
they're using two different systems
that's because analytics it's tracking
what it can track and what is unclear an
algorithm tries to organize it or an
algorithm tries to assign things that
are unclear to different areas so each
analytics program kind of has its own
methodology of organizing the
information and interpreting it based on
that that's where you come up with the
we're less inaccurate than our
competitors so when we're measuring
organic coverage we're measuring what we
can based on this system it may not
agree with another system don't try to
make it agree because it just simply
won't now here I'm looking at my total
organic search visits and I can see
compared to the
year prior this quarter is up 18% in
visits I can look at total conversions
and I can see that it's up 30% and then
also what I want to do is look at
landing pages and my keyword concepts
now this is a sense because the search
engines don't provide us any keyword
data what we can do is look at our
landing pages and the amount of visits
those landing pages are generating then
it doesn't take much to kind of look at
those landing pages and see what what
are they basically about what are those
keyword concepts now you can go to a
Google search console you can go to Bing
Webmaster Tools and you can see which
keywords are driving traffic to your
business through those webmaster portals
and you can get the concept of what
keywords are driving traffic now one
thing I do like about Bing Webmaster
Tools is that Bing Webmaster Tools will
not only show me which keywords I'm
ranking for and which ones are sending
traffic to my website but they will also
show me which pages are the recipients
of those keywords so they are able to
tie together the keywords in the landing
pages and so I'll do that in Bing on
also Google search console will do that
to an extent but to some degree this is
still a manual process of looking at my
landing pages and comparing them to the
keyword concepts as I said Google's
trying to push everything together into
intent and so evaluate your landing
pages in terms of intent what would
someone be searching on in order to get
to this page and utilize Google search
console and Bing Webmaster Tools maybe
some Weaver analytics in order to figure
that out
also what I like to look at are
comparative metrics when I'm looking at
the success of an SEO campaign as tied
to
other types of campaigns I also want to
show the value of search engine
optimization and what it's providing and
so in looking at a source medium I'm
using Google Analytics here what I can
do here is for this time frame look at
the overall numbers of sessions
generated through each channel as you
can see there Google on its own is about
67% of all visits Yahoo is providing
about one point two eight percent of
visits and then we can see a little less
than 20 percent our direct visits so
comparatively I can see where my search
engine optimization is contributing in
comparison to all the other channels and
I can get a sense there in terms of I
can run a revenue report by source where
I can see where my search is responsible
for the greatest amount of revenue for
the greatest amount of orders and also
when I look at when the interesting here
I can also do a value per session
breakdown and what this shows me is the
email campaigns those by far have the
highest value per session visitors
coming through the blog our next in
value procession and then we can see our
search visitors showing up there as a
significantly high value per session and
one thing it might jump out to you there
as you can see that Bing has a four
pound twenty seven value procession
compared to Google with a one pound 77
that's normal I over the past 15 years
it has been a really interesting
phenomenon that visitors from Bing or
MSN have a higher value even though I
will get just sheer numbers and higher
revenue from google but they are a
higher value visitor than Google
visitors that's just a phenomenon that
we've just observed for more than about
15 years and really kind of interest
they're so from a metric standpoint I
like doing comparative metrics to see
here's how search compares to your other
channels here's what it's driving
compared to your other channels in terms
of visitors in terms of engagement in
terms of revenue and revenue per user
and again I kind of mentioned this
associative metrics using Google search
console to see some of the keywords that
Google is driving Google my business I'm
gonna show that as we get into here but
before we wrap up Bing Webmaster Tools
as I said they will show you the
keywords as well as The Associated
landing pages analytics getting into
analytics and looking at your organic
traffic I showed you a few reports there
but that is where people need to live in
order to understand what's going on with
their search traffic and more and more
alongside analytics I'm seeing a CRM
integration with analytics really
becoming a a different standard because
within the CRM integration I can then
look at the entire customer journey I
can track the initial touch point of a
consumer I can then see how that spreads
into different searches so maybe they'll
find me first from a paid ad but then
how does a subsequent organic searches
contribute to different touch points and
then maybe there is a retargeting touch
point and so I really like what I'm
seeing with modern CRM systems in
tracking more of the customer journey
and how search is a part of it and that
really then gets to the point of looking
at that customer journey that ideal
customer experience and it immediately
puts it in the context of the purpose of
the campaign and the goals of the
campaign focused around the user
experience when I'm talking with a
client
laying out expectations really my first
question is what makes you money because
that's what we want to track there's our
purpose we want to look at sales and
leads and
so we want to look at this prioritized
outcomes this gets back to what is the
purpose of the overall campaign then we
need to look at what our performance
goals now not all of these goals carry
the same amount of weight what I mean by
that are inquiries support people
viewing videos online chat subscribes
downloads those are all a different
level of engagement than a typical like
or retweet or a pin that's what I call
you know it these are much more active
if someone makes an inquiry that's a
lead if they contact support if they're
viewing videos about new cars that's a
performance goal that means I'm engaging
somebody and I'm answering their
questions we can look at people
subscribing and asking for more
information downloading brochures
downloading information this is where
we'll attach different value to
different actions because some actions
will contribute much more in terms of
value in the customer experience than
others and so we want to look at the
performance goals and establish a level
of value around them and then explain
clearly the difference between a
performance goal and a performance
indicator performance indicators
visibility visits time on site pages
viewed bounce rate these are all good
performance indicators but they are
removed from a direct impact on the
business goals it's an indirect factor
in fact they can even be misleading if
that's what you're using because you
could see that business goals are
excelling while these numbers might go
down or they might go up and business
goals go down because it's what are you
doing with the information and how are
you focusing your efforts I want to
focus real quickly before I wrap up here
on Google my business and this is
something that Google has done more and
more of I'm using it actually a local
landscaper that I've been helping out
simply because I love the numbers that
are showing up on this
and it's really cool because you just
put your business in and then you set
the service area so it can be a zip code
it can be a radius and then you can view
the insights this is just on the left
side is the login panel and it will show
you how many searches your business has
shown up for in the past month as we can
see here we Rovers
we're almost at about six and a half
thousand searches where people searched
for their business we we can see about
8.3 thousand views of their local
listing and about sixteen thousand
actions so we can see here this now this
probably right here is probably going to
be I think the future of SEO metrics the
main reason is this is what happens when
you do a search for local business and
the business box shows up in the results
in that business Fox has a picture of
the business a description ours pictures
and phone number and what can happen
here just like with the information
where Google is showing all the
information and you don't even have to
click through it
this is tracking that type of visibility
this is showing you how many times
simply your business information showed
in the search results and so now from
here we can look specifically on what
customers how they viewed your business
and we can see how many times the
business showed up in search and how
many times it showed up on maps in the
top graph in the lower graph and this is
where I think this is I think this where
reporting is really going to be moving
is from that business box in the search
results we're now showing in the past
month how many total actions people have
taken and that is how many people
visited the website from the impact
information box how many people
busted directions and how many people
called from that business listing and
the far right graph shows you how many
people the dark green so maybe a little
over 1/4 of people we're looking for the
specific business name a little more
than or a little less than 3/4 of people
were looking for related keywords and
because of that saw the business
information so from a visibility metric
standpoint within Google search results
I love what Google my business is doing
because it's providing me a view of how
many people are seeing my listing
without even clicking on it but then
because of the interactions available
through smartphone searches local
searches map based searches I can track
a lot of this local activity and how
people are then integrating or engaging
with my local search result on
google.com uh so reporting has changed
it will continue to do so that is the
only that is the only hard and fast rule
here and so metrics need to focus on
emphasizing conversion rates optimizing
landing pages and it requires analytics
expertise much more than ever and
ultimately what we want to get to is a
measurement of the user experience like
I said that big picture of the user
experience did they find what they
wanted doing task based user testing
where they have to find a specific bit
of information from the search to the
site and from that you can gather an
understanding of how quickly they're
able to find it how they can navigate
they're both in a desktop and a mobile
and this gets to the the micro moment
assessment when people are searching for
things such as can I afford it show me
the new cars where can I get financed
those types of micro moment questions
that people type in
to the search box or speak into their
phone that's where we went to assess the
experience of what do they see what do
they find how easy is it for them to
accomplish their objectives and then
integrate that into a campaign
measurement reporting scheme on behalf
