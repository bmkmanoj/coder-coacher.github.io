objectives of the service desk now let's
look into the responsibilities of a
service desk like the other operational
processes responsibilities of service
desk would remain the same like logging
incident requests categorization and
prioritization service desks
responsibilities also include
identifying the issue performing initial
diagnosis to understand the series of
occurrences resolution closure
functional or hierarchical escalation
execution act as a communication channel
to users conducting user satisfaction
surveys and CMS update let us proceed to
learn those structures of a service debt
in our last slide we discussed about the
responsibilities of the service desk
this slide explains the various types of
structures of a service desk when it
comes to organizing the service desk
there are many ways of structuring
service desks and locating them and the
correct solution will vary from
different organizations the primary
options of service desk structures are
local service desk centralized service
desk virtual service desk and
follow-the-sun
these options are discussed in the later
slides but in reality an organization
may need to implement a structure that
combines a number of these options in
order to fully meet the business needs
let us go ahead and learn more about
service desk structures
let us start with our first structure of
service desk the local service desk this
is where a service desk is co-located
within or physically close to the user
community it serves local service desk
often aides communication and gives a
clearly visible presence which some
users like but can often be inefficient
and expensive to resource as staff is
tied up waiting to deal with incidents
when the volume and the arrival rate of
calls may not justify this there may
however be some valid reasons for
maintaining a local desk
this might include one language and
cultural or political differences to
different time zones specialized groups
of users for the existence of customized
or specialized services that require
specialist knowledge 5 VIP criticality
status of users as we are now aware of
the local service desk structure let us
move to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
