waterfall it's top down
we in in waterfall we can have templates
imposed on us methodologies imposed on
us reporting imposed on us all kinds of
heavy documentation kinds of things
imposed on us from the PMO or from
senior management or whatever and then
those of us that are working on the
waterfall team we have to comply with
that and I'm not saying that's bad there
are projects where that's the best way
to run the project but that's not how
it's done an agile the team itself
decides how they're going to actually
deliver the product of the project and
the team is going to be empowered to do
that and then the team becomes in
responsible and how they're going to
actually own that and fix problems and
improve going forward with just enough
ceremony now ceremony okay let me show
you here if we go to our pairwise
connections ceremony shows up so when
you see the term ceremony think meeting
or event so those of us that have some
experience in an agile you know that
there's such a thing as a daily stand-up
and that's a meeting so in agile that's
also referred to as a ceremony so
meetings or events in agile we do just
enough we're going to eliminate waste
we're going to do the least amount of
work and meetings to deliver high
quality software
now we will find when we get into
estimating that agile even though it's
done iteratively and in small increments
is actually going to be more
cost-effective and also faster when we
get into some of the techniques and
approaches to doing that estimating if
you're like me the first time you're
exposed to it you're like I don't
believe that this could actually be more
accurate than the waterfall approach but
it ends up being the case in waterfall
you know there's change you know you
have your change control boards and you
have change requests and you have
processes you go through to manage
change it's more difficult and it's less
nimble it's less agile so agile is about
embracing change okay so how's that for
an overview so those of us that are new
to agile pretty cool stuff right and
those of us that have been at it that
was probably more of just a review but
it might be a good reminder especially
when it comes to thinking about actually
having to pass a test okay when it comes
to best practices in the agile world
we've got eight things here I just want
to touch on briefly every one of these
things by the way team we will be
drilling down on and spending
significant time exploring let's see
navneet is chatting here we also need
control as it easily becomes fragile
from an agile point of view yes that's
right and we're going to cover all of
that so that is a good comment and when
it comes to control we're going to talk
about information radiators feedback
opportunities etc etc which is in agile
how we control projects so those of us
that are you know the P&amp;amp;P we have that
background the way we do change and
control monitoring
is quite a bit different in agile
very effective but different okay so
let's go over these eight things here
first of all face-to-face communication
in agile face-to-face communication is
favored and meaning that agile favors a
team being co-located we will talk about
using agile tools which allow us to
accomplish face-to-face communication
virtually but remember that agile favors
face-to-face and if possible colocation
shorter development cycle so rather than
working on the project and the
delivering the whole thing at the end of
the project in agile we deliver in short
cycles and at the end of each cycle we
should actually be delivering working
software that the customer could use and
could deploy if the customer wanted to
business and developer collaboration
okay we talked about the collaboration
that goes on throughout the project
rather than just at the beginning now
when you see the term business right
here i want to just chat about this that
can mean two things it can mean like
senior management meaning the business
interests of our organization that want
to make money because we're doing a
project right we have a customer the
customers buying something from us our
business folks want us to actually make
money for the company
I mean let's put that on the side this
is a little bit beyond administrator
developer or administrator your app
builder so I mean you guys can get on
there and learn but let's try to do
something that might actually be on one
of the cash like maybe this building an
app with the Lightning design system
we did put it up shake advanced it over
yeah scroll down for me there more to
let us check Oh watch it
there's a build a suggestion box app
with no code they have hit begin a
developer and I'm in that pretty good
one okay blue reports and everything
cool all right so you're learning how to
build an application are not plowed from
start to finish without writing any code
if you need to upload the goal is to
introduce you to the basics of a
building at this point the point and
click skills apply whether you're not 20
red clothes on platform if you're
familiar with the episode admin teachers
managing is insecurity customizing
standards objects and so long the goal
is to apply the excuse to developing new
applications I think that is I want I
think said she I think we chose the
wrong one yesterday you went from the
beginning though yeah I mean being able
to build the junction object you know
figuring out how to build a jump shot
expand what it wouldn't actually look
like yeah I think that was all good
exercise yeah and it's interesting when
you actually practicing because it's
fine where the junction object but the
right junction object and the way I
should go it's very important it's not
just like just writing things about no I
can you got to know what you're doing
yeah and that's where there's one to
many relationships come in you know
there's one what was it one session
going to have many and then one was the
other one I forget but you know it's
that one to many relationship that if
you know that'll help yeah he was
working well David you're Daria's are
going to be unlike anything i managed to
complete Dolan okay let's let's go here
you'll get a situational management
after a large purchase of messages and
attractive 30 years ended sets great the
apps definition and data model
application simplification required
not only one person object notify user
interface on the browser and no pills
for salon models using bleach layout
compact layouts and global actions
ultimate calculations data quality and
database updates to improve the user
experience using formalized validation
rules and process the others define
before the charts and dashboards she
tracked excited obstetricians and
analyze how well the company manages to
judge instead of creating a suggestion
crystal objects you could use cases a
third force service close standard
object when you'd example your one trips
for building and pick them up without
using the successful okay are we going
to do wait for Stockholm acting with
standard collaboration and analytics
features similar is yourself with the
app users interface in the browser and
in the first question on mobile app
alright so developer edition from
force.com homepage click on ring as a
present the Quick Start wizard oh yeah
the little one you gonna so let's go or
step thank you Mario what are the
benefits of the QuickStart AB other than
the president will use it to acceptance
well it doesn't a lot of close-ups you
can create the app and then there's also
an object is getting created and then
after it adds a bunch of other stuff
reporting and attachments that you don't
have to mess with to create your tab
that creates an app that it creates an
object yeah i think this course when you
go to admin the first thing you do in
admin beginner it will trailhead is
great or not yep if you're at the car
garage same garage and vehicle yeah yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
