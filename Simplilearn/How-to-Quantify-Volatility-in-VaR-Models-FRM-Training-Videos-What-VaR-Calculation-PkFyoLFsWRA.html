financial risk manager frm part 1 of the
frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
quantifying volatility in var models
welcome to the last session of the
quantitative analysis module
this session is devoted to estimating
the most important risk parameters
volatility we have learned in the
previous sessions about the calculations
of var and the estimations of volatility
and correlations you must have noticed
that we have most often used the
volatility in our calculations so it is
important to accurately estimate this
parameter for calculations of risk using
var some of the concepts like
exponential smoothing and Gosch have
already been discussed in the previous
session let us now begin our discussion
agenda the main agenda of our discussion
will be estimating the volatility using
different approaches we will begin the
session by discussing the real
distributions of return in practical
scenarios in reality the volatilities
change with time resulting in non normal
distribution with fat tails we will
learn how these fat tails underestimates
our simple var calculations done
assuming normal distribution we will
also introduce a regime switching model
in which the volatilities exhibit
normality during phases or regimes and
then change to a new level our
estimation techniques for volatility
estimation would include parametric
nonparametric and hybrid approaches
under parametric approaches we will
learn about historical standard
deviation exponential smoothing garsh
and risk metrics we'll also learn about
the hybrid approach using exponential
and market value weights
finally we'll
and the session by learning about
implied volatility and the concept of
mean reversion fat tails in practice the
distribution return is not normal there
are deviations from the normal behavior
such as fat tails skewness and
instability in the return distributions
from the chart we see that the curve
becomes fatter at the tails if the
volatility or the mean return varies
with time this is known as conditional
distribution that is a distribution that
changes with changing conditions such
curves exhibit fat tailed distribution
with higher than normal probabilities
and the lower end of the tails</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
