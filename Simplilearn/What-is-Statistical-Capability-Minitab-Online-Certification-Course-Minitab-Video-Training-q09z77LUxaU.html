minitab statistical capabilities hello
and welcome to simply learns elearning
course on Minitab owing to the
importance of this session and the
number of tools that will be discussed
here this session is broken into two
parts this is the part one of the fifth
session there are quizzes at the end of
every session and you're strongly
advised to answer them before you move
on to the next session this session
takes you through the statistical
capabilities of Minitab and how we can
analyze our data statistically agenda
let us now look at the agenda of this
session in this session we learn how to
analyze and interpret our data in
Minitab using the following tests
normality test process capability
analysis comparison tests like to sample
t-test and pair test contingency tables
also known as chi-square anova including
one-way anova main effect test and test
for equal variance in two parts of this
session we will learn about design of
experiments and control charts before we
look at each test in detail let us first
look at some business scenarios in which
these tests are used business scenarios
in this session we will study the tools
which will help us in the following
business scenarios test whether your
data is normal or non-normal data
understand the capability of your
process and evaluate whether it is
meeting the organization and customers
requirements conduct tests to compare
two kinds of items and identify if they
are similar or significantly different
evaluate the impact of set of factors
on the response or output from a process
compare variation between two data
series to evaluate if they contain the
same amount of variation normality test
let us start by looking at how to
analyze data using normality test in
Minitab normality test helps to
determine whether your data follow a
normal distribution a normal
distribution is bell-shaped curve that
is symmetric about its mean the normal
distribution is the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
