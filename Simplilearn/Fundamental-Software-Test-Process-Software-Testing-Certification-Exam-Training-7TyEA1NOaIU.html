test planning and control in this phase
we need to make sure that we understand
the goals and objectives of the
customers stakeholders and the project
we also need to evaluate the risks of
the system which are intended to be
addressed by testing based on this
understanding as part of test planning
we need to specify objective of testing
determine scope of testing risks in
testing come up with test strategy
identify resource requirements schedule
test analysis and design tasks plan for
test implementation execution and
evaluation and also determine the exit
criteria for testing as part of planning
we also need to plan for test controls
which will help in measuring the
progress against plan and take
corrective actions as and when required
we will cover test planning more in
detail in session fine the second phase
in the test process is test analysis and
design this phase involves review of
test basis and identification of test
conditions let us take a closer look at
both of these activities review the test
basis includes review of the product
requirements architecture design
specifications and interfaces between
the products it also includes examining
the specifications for the software we
are testing all these artifacts are
called test basis as these are used for
defining what and how we should test we
use these test basis to help us build
our tests we can start designing
blackbox tests before the code exists as
we study the test basis we often
identify gaps and ambiguities in the
specification because we are trying to
identify precisely what happens
each and every point in the system this
helps us in preventing defects that may
appear in the code after understanding
the specifications we identify test
conditions based on analysis of test
items their specifications and their
behavior this gives us a high-level list
of what we are interested in testing in
testing we use the test techniques to
help us define the test conditions we
will learn about different kinds of test
techniques in the latest sessions we
also evaluate testability of the
requirements and system in this phase
the requirements may be written in a way
that allows a tester to design tests but
may not be testable for example if the
performance of the software is important
van should be specified in a testable
way if the requirements just say the
software needs to respond quickly that
is not testable because quick may mean
different things to different people a
more testable requirement would be the
software needs to respond in two seconds
with ten people logged on the test
ability of the system depends on aspects
such as whether it is possible to set up
the system in an environment that
matches the operational environment and
whether all the ways the system can be
configured or used can be understood and
tested in the planning phase we also
identify the design of the test
environment and identify any required
infrastructure and tools this includes
testing tools see chapter 6 and support
tools such as spreadsheets word
processors project planning tools and
non IT tools and equipment this should
include everything we need to carry out
our testing work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
