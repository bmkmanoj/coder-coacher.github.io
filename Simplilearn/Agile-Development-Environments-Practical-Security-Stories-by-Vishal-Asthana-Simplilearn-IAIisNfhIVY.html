symantec I work my prime area of work is
on software security side of things and
the reason I am standing here in front
of you is because in the past year and a
half there is some work that has been
done in the area of software security as
it ties to agile environments okay and
this was done under the banner of there
is something called safe code which is a
nonprofit organization it's called
Software Assurance forum for excellence
in code and about as I said about a year
and a half back pretty much some of the
bigger biggest firms such as semantic
and Microsoft and we had Nokia and we
had EMC so senior security professionals
kind of got together and we were trying
to solve one problem which is specific
for agile environments which is in agile
typically security is not given a given
an upfront thought as we have seen since
the morning even if you look at the
agile manifesto things which you need to
deliver etcetera etcetera I could not
find a single slide where there was a
mention of we want to deliver working
and secure software so we realize this
is a problem and the reason why this was
a problem i am going to cover and what
happened is we had almost a one-year
collaboration okay and that
collaboration resulted in a white paper
so I was the lead author of that white
paper and then after we got the white
paper out we went to our respective
organizations and started working with
product teams actual product teams who
were either already on
as I or who were thinking of
transitioning to a gel to see if we
could help them imbibe security as part
of the agile development process itself
because fundamentally as i mentioned
agile and security do not go together so
that is what i am going to cover as far
as my background yes i have been in the
industry for a while about about 12 or
tears I have a bachelor's and a master's
degree in engineering and other than
that these are the kind of things which
I do I am NOT going to read the whole
paragraph but I give you an idea I do
things like threat modeling things like
penetration test things like secures
software code reviews okay or things
like helping QA teams with their
security test plans or helping them get
started how what is the thought process
which goes when you are looking at use
case versus abuse cases okay because
that's a common thing if you are from
the QA side of things those of you who
are here are probably from I am guessing
bid management and above so you would be
knowing that QA teams typically have
that thought block right or development
teams say that hey my code is perfect
it's working fine what could be the
security impact or what are the holes
why should I worry about writing secure
code so those are the kind of things
which I do on a daily basis okay so this
wasn't sort of a extracurricular effort
and that effort bond fruit it was it has
been received very well in the industry
I was made to understand by the safe
code people that when we released the
paper when it got published and there
was a press release that went with it
there were some I think 26 or 27 hundred
downloads in the first week itself so
that tells us that there is a problem
which this paper attempted to solve and
hopefully people found it useful okay
now the reason or the way I am going to
take this presentation is not to throw
this paper at you I do not want to
insult the intelligence of people here
you can look through the peep paper in
detail it's about a 40 45 page paper
but what I am going to cover today is
how to consume that paper and in a
nutshell what was the design philosophy
that is one second is how has it been
used inside symantec thus far and what
are the key takeaways we have found so I
will also try and cover some fa cues as
in what are the kind of questions which
have come up from agile teams when they
have tried to consume this work ok so
feel free to bring up questions as we go
along I am open to that and no I do not
get derailed with that even if there is
a mobile that rings that's absolutely
fine we can sing along as long as there
is a good quality so
and like the previous speaker of the
shower who mentioned I'm although i have
a few slides but i am not strictly a
slight person so i am here to have a
kind of a collaboration or a discussion
in the true spirit of agile so feel free
as i said feel free to initiate some
related topic or i think in the morning
for example someone brought up a problem
is they were facing with defect
management so i am ok to try an address
if I know if I have seen it i will try
and help you out with respect to
incorporating security in your agile
environments just by a quick raise of
hands this so i know that my assumption
is right or on the right track how many
of you here actually proactively take
security stories into your agile
environments one two three okay so on a
percentage basis i am going to say that
percentage is still low okay and that is
that is the reason this work came about
we have actually come up with what's
known as security focus stories not user
stories and i will talk about what was
done and how how we came up came up with
the stories so yes these security focus
stories were created along with
associated tasks whatever are your
backlog tasks right the way they were
derived is that we looked at so as i
said this was a cross-industry
collaboration so we already had these
four big organizations each having their
own products and product teams right and
each each of them has their central
security teams so while people from
these security central security teams i
am part of semantic central security
team ok so the issues which we saw while
working with other products and when I
say issues i am talking about strictly
vulnerabilities i am not talking about
functional issues those issues which we
saw we considered then we also looked at
what's known as cwe top 25 now CW is
common business enumeration for people
here who have raised their hands with
back to the stories that they use this
is most probably a central reference
that you already use now what it does is
that across the world it takes
applications into account and for each
such application it lists down what are
the most common commonly seen or the top
25 list of wonder abilities that are see
okay we took that into account then
those of you you hear who work on
developing web applications you may
already be aware of avast top 10 so of
ASP is also a non-profit body and every
couple of years I think every three
years it comes up with the top 10 list
of weaknesses or vulnerability seen in
web applications okay so we combined all
of that and that became our threat
landscape so we just didn't want to
restrict to our knowledge of things k or
just to see w top 25 or just 20 verse
top 10 okay combine all of that turned
it around and that became our central
landscape okay second thing we did was
as I said we came up with security focus
stories ok not user focus stories why I
why I have a specific reason for that
user at the end doesn't care whether the
code which you have written is free from
let us say SQL injection he wants the
functionality your customer wants the
functionality of the end product is it
working is it doing what it's supposed
to do the only thing customers typically
would worry about nowadays is privacy is
my data being private but how you make
sure that it is private is not their
concern I use the latest and greatest
hashing cipher that is available the
customer would draw a blank so weren't
you supposed to do that as part of the
fixed bid contract okay so that would be
one of those high value things right so
what we did was we once we came up with
these security focus stories we derived
them
based on roles in agile teams and the
roles were the ones that we considered
were either the stories would be done by
architect or the developer or the QA
resources and the definition of done
criteria for these stories meant that
both these parties had to do the
respective tasks for each story in order
for it to be completed okay so that was
the that is how the design came about
then we also created what's known as
operational security tasks ok smallest
laundry list for example people here I
think someone gave an example of I think
Scala based application that that was
tried right and there were some
technology risk because people weren't
aware of what Scala is doing or whatever
it might be right so 11 item in the
laundry list talks about keeping a track
of third-party patches and this third
party could be your OS if you have the
next let us say windows 2k eight r2 is
not supported anymore although it is but
let's say or let me take a real example
windows 2003 server is not supported
anymore for a lot of I mean Microsoft
itself has announced end of support life
right so if you develop something which
has a dependency on windows server 2003
that in itself is a it's going to be a
functional problem for you so instead of
looking at that we said what if or there
is a line item that says or there is one
operational task that actually says keep
a proactive track of the security
vulnerabilities in your third party or
the OS components right then I have
another task in there which says for for
example people sitting here who have a
security mindset versus people sitting
here who do not know what what what I
mean by a security mindset what do you
think they need the second category what
do you think they need
any guesses
though so what I am coming to is those
who do not have a security mindset need
to be educated about it right so what do
they need they need some sort of
awareness or training so training your
developers on secure coding training
your QA guys on secure testing and
training your managers about your
software security program is something
which is needed but it doesn't tie in
into any story is it a value add
absolutely right but does it can I say
that there is a security focus story
that ties into that know that sumo would
not care if you had a team of 100
there's NQ is customer would not care
whether all of them have been trained to
write secure code or trained to test
code securely but it is a laundry list
which you need right so this laundry
list is what operational security task
is all about and then all of us so there
are 55 authors of the paper that I am
talking about all of us also realize
that tasks which are being done for the
first time by agile teams and when I say
tasks these are security tasks lot of
these would actually need hand-holding
for the first few iterations I it is it
is very easy for me to say run a let us
say a security static code analyzer I
sound big the term sounds big and then I
go home right what happens you go back
you I give you a tool then I don't tell
you what to do with the results how to
do the false positive analysis how to
identify the valid issues which your
code may have then what is the net
result that activity flops so we also
identified a bunch of activities which
need guidance or hand-holding from your
in-house security experts or consultants
depending on how your organization
functions you may already have somebody
in house who is let's say somebody who's
a senior
member of the team again from an agile
perspective like what I what I have seen
is typically people who are very senior
devs or architects tend to take that
role of security architecture as well or
being security architects right so you
may have a go-to person inside your team
or you may have a central security team
in either case you would require help
for some of these tasks to be explained
how to how to be done effectively from
these people okay I am I making sense
thus far or is everybody still in post
lunch so I am trying to wake myself up
as well so let me know if I am like
goosing somewhere in the middle right
yes and all this was combined into a
single document which I think I'll open
as soon as I get a handle on the mouse
got it
it will wanted
take it open drain that is it
so I'm sorry I am a security
professional so I just may have caused a
denial of service hold on this is I just
see the loop going and it should not
take this much time to open there you go
yes
because the file can be found so this is
the paper which is already available
published online you can find it on safe
codes side and what I just talked about
is section to a B and 32 a is the actual
stories and the tasks to be are the
operational security tasks the laundry
list and
beautiful
stay here right all right and then the
third three is the one which I just told
you about there is a certain bifurcation
and there is also this concept of
residual risk which you guys already
deal with when you are doing your
regular agile planning you always
account for this is the technical risk
that exists to our projects and this is
how we will handle a tour will handle it
in the next version 2 dot over 3 dot
over whatever the case might be this
residual risk again is in terms of the
stories which you pick up but you don't
get to do them for whatever reason or
you do them in completely as in there
are each story has certain tasks and out
of those certain tasks let's say your QA
guys could not get certain tasks done or
your def could not complete a certain
task so the story cannot be considered
as complete so your product owner or
whoever is representing the client would
probably give a sign off saying that yes
I can live with this for now or they are
going to say no we can't live with this
this is something which has to be fixed
the moment they say they can live with
it you are building what's known as
residual risk and it piles up right and
then eventually you have whatever may be
certain sprints just to handle that
that's up to your operational model
right so obviously as I said I am NOT
going to focus too much about exact
details these you can look into I'll
give you an idea of what a story has the
way the story has been worded it has
been written in a way which is friendly
for you to put in your requirements
tracker as in your story tracker
whichever whether you have excel-based
or you have some custom software or you
have some proprietary software that's up
to you but if you look at the wording
this is there and actually ties both the
rules so it says as an architect or a
dev okay I want to ensure something
right and as a QA I want to verify
certain things
and what is that certain thing that
certain thing here is allocation of
resources within limits or throttling
now this is the high level definition of
the story now next obvious question is
okay this is great this sounds like a
rosy story very much like what customers
do rea requirement one line requirement
I want this ray go figure I want this
right so instead of that you have one
story now each story has these
Associated backlog tasks and what we
have done is for each one of those
backlog tasks we have prepended
prepended it with the role who needs to
take care of this so if I am looking at
throttling what does it mean what what
should be your architect or whoever is
your acting architect see some teams do
not have the luxury of having a
dedicated architect somebody doubles up
as an architect this guy has been with
us for five years he knows I shall very
well and he can deliver product product
so blah blah blah and so let this guy be
the architect for this set of sprints
right so whether it is your designated
architect or you're acting architect
these are the things which that person
needs to take into account regard with
regards to your products architecture so
think things would be clearly
identifying resources what are the
number of simultaneous connections okay
what is the file size that can be
uploaded right so so on and so forth if
I come down to testing right so you
conduct performance or stress testing to
ensure that the numbers chosen are
realistic and then we have also tried to
give a corresponding mapping of the cwid
for people as I said those who are new
to or getting used to security or even
for those of you who are used to
security it would be a wise idea to look
at a story and maybe look at the
corresponding weakness so if you want to
understand what what is throttling
resource throttling all about what are
the potential issues that it can throw
you can go here so on and so forth there
are some I think I recall a system 30
three or 36 odd stories that we have
come up with these are like the default
list not all 36 will apply to the
product of which you are working okay
but that does not mean that choose the
first 10 or choose the next n no I will
come to that why i am saying that is you
have to carefully spend time the first
time around to identify the stories
which are applicable to your technology
and your application okay so i will give
you a quick example right here if i go
to this one second one right so i want
to verify that the application has
appropriate encoding for output context
right what if i do not have a web
application if i do not have a web
application how do I care what is being
given back from the UI because the UI is
not going to render anything back to the
browser so this story would not apply to
me or if there are some things around
the fur overflow Prevention's right I
have a c-sharp base code base or the
Java code base so you don't have to
worry about buffer overflow related
stories or format format string issues
right so that is that's the diligence
which I am talking about first time it
needs to be done by the team because the
scrum team knows or is supposed to know
what what you are wanting out of it in
your sprint 0 as was being mentioned in
the morning sprint 0 you have identified
the technology how you are going to
deliver what are the kind of stories
you're going to pick up etcetera
etcetera so during that time you would
ideally want to understand that what is
the security posture of my application
all these breaches which you hear about
our vulnerabilities or this data got
hacked that data got hacked and all of
that are because no proactive measures
work being done by those companies as
into their applications when I say
proactive measures I am referring to
software security measures
you
right so I think it's a 36 then yes 36
and then this is the operational
security tasks one additional thing we
have done is we have also given a
whether it is a requirement or
recommendation okay so as I said like
configure your bug tracking to track
security vulnerabilities you already do
that for your functional issues why not
do it for your security issues do not
put in that many details in there but at
least have placeholders in place so
laundry list and then this is a small
list of 10-12 tasks which typically do
require help from experts so 11 common
area is performed network first testing
good to say good to hear what do I do
what tool do i use how do i configure it
how do i interpret the output so all of
those things someone needs to help you
with for the first time and then this is
the residual risk acceptance part so as
I said five of us have had got together
so there are these are the people
mentally if you have to map this is how
you will map the paper in your mind oh
this is how you can visit this would be
a thing to remember if you want to
imbibe security in your existing agile
environment okay think of it this way
that there is there is an overlap of
section 3 with 2 a and B 2 B is
obviously the operational 12 a is the
focus stories and these two examples
which I have given are things with which
you would typically require help but not
always so once you are comfortable with
first testing you do not need inputs
from your expert you already know how to
do it or once you've got the training
done maybe from a consultant turn from
or form an in-house expert you are done
maybe you do not need it for the next
couple of months right and at which
point you can figure out whether you
want someone internal to do it for you
or you again want somebody external so
that's your current so I am hoping
everyone is clear on the word part right
what why I am standing here and what was
being done and the way you could use it
now why was it it done this is the these
are the kind of problems we heard from
agile teams when we interacted with them
we realize that they come up with these
kind of things timely has printed astute
and I am referring to scrum environments
because at symantec mostly the teams are
on scrum so they said our sprints are
very short two to four weeks there is no
time I would love to incorporate
security but don't come to me with a
list of 500 requirements best practice
document lakid please do not come to me
right come to me and this is what
specific thing which came out of the
team's was come to me and talk to me in
a language which I can use if you come
to me with a big security requirement
and I do not know how to tag it where to
use it how to track it and tag it I will
not use it I will get to it when I have
time
which is never right so these
requirements or these kind of things is
what led to this work what we had seen
was that the these specific agile teams
not not all of them because lot of them
were not even looking at security
proactively right but the ones that were
ended up doing a compromise and you may
have done it for your clients as well
your client comes and says we need to
have a secure this is a banking product
it has to has to be secure okay you will
ask him what is the kind of compliance
you want it should be PCI compliant fine
you go back to your security team you
ask them is there some tool that can
give me PCI compliance say yeah there is
this XYZ tool ok let's just get this
tool get the run clear the report report
may there should be zero defects and
we'll paste it to the customer that we
are bcat a very very normal bandage
approach which is taken so these are
some of the tools which are used
internally these are enterprise-wide
license that are in our organization so
they are being used so they would
usually be a mix of tools or taking one
off requirements so let us say your item
is not that busy for whatever reason
sprint 0 is the lighter one so there is
this thing about like them go and have
some training employee engagement there
is the security training which the
security guys are doing them
today's it they will have that feeling
of having training again if it's not
strategic if it isn't isn't well thought
of that if you are going to have your
guys trained in sprint zero or randomly
you need to you need to make sure that
they use the information in their actual
day-to-day work else it is nothing but a
check mark so there are lot of trainings
even I have been subject to that there
are some trainings I go to some sessions
I go to where I do not want to go but
it's a man date even I report to someone
right so someone says you have now shall
do that ok so I'll go I'll mix
nodes do something something hear their
take home I I to come I went oh that is
the best take on my head right so you
don't want to do that okay so this is
what we found was being done they the
biggest problem with this is that that
the approach which I talked about is
reactive so why all of this work came
about and why it it has gained momentum
or it's slowly gaining acceptance is
because the prior approach is reactive
when you throw me out of the room only
then I will question you why you threw
me out of the room right instead of
saying i am going to not do i am not
going to do anything which gets me
thrown out of the room in other words
replace the phrase which I have just
said with you being the vendor and your
customer throwing you out because of you
delivering and insecure application and
some single vulnerability getting
exploited and let's say the customer
sensitive data got leaked and then you
are in a huddle mode trying to figure
out what happened why because the
proactive thought process wasn't there
despite the fact that you were on agile
everything is there but the thought
process wasn't there that I have to
deliver secure code not just working
code and I am alluding to this the
speakers in the morning accepting
freelance speaker both the speakers in
the morning did not have any specific
mention about security aspects in a jail
and I was stunned stunned not because
they didn't have extent because I
realized that the problem was actually
existent it is still there it is very
much in your daily grain of doing things
this reactive approach causes what's
what we have termed as security debt you
guys probably already high as I said you
already have this concept of technical
debt right in as I we're in the
functional stories which didn't get done
or there was something residual risk was
so there is this debt that you pile up
so instead of technical debt we realize
that this is more appropriately called
security dead right and needless to say
over your releases that will pile up it
is like credit card swipes right so if
you do not actively monitor the swipes
that you are doing on your credit card
yourself eventually you will end up in
what's known as in the financial terms
it's known as a debt trap okay where you
realize that it is big it's impossible
to even pay the minimum amount to your
credit cards and you go for settlements
and you would say please wave this off
please wave that of blah blah blah so in
our analogy or in agile analogy this is
a costly mistake you cannot afford to
make because what this basically implies
is that the cost and the constraints
which were being alluded to earlier the
constraints would reach a stage where if
you had a security issue or a breach in
your application the client is not going
to come back to you they will give you a
chance to try and address it if you
can't then you have lost that client now
depending on the size of the revenue
that can make a big impact so as I have
referred here you can refer to section 1
of the paper I showed you that as well
now we cover some of the points as to
people who may want to explore this work
see if this is applicable to your
environment you can even think of adding
that to your contracts if so if that is
not I am guessing that's probably not
the case so this could actually tie in
very well with the value thing which the
shower was mentioning about is this is
an a a direct value which you are giving
to your customer secure software not
just software or not just functional
software so anyway what will happen is
in line with the agile manifesto or the
agile principles rather this kind of
adoption proactive security actually
encourages a proactive culture
of security inside your teams so you
have people who are more engaged on the
security bit as well and this applies
for your devs and q is your data
obviously reduces substantially why
because C for me to stand here and say
that imbibe these stories and your
product will be absolutely bulletproof
is a false statement security in itself
is reasonable like quality no matter how
many number of functional tests you do
they will always be some something which
is there which is spending something
maybe on the regression part or
something on the integration part which
was not covered and is it that the QA
team did not do a good job no because at
that point it is just reasonable
whatever they could do in a stipulated
time with the given set of things they
did right so eventually your debt would
reduce it why because you use it's not
that I saw the hand hands being raised
for from a couple of people in the
audience who said that they are already
using security or their imbibing
security in some form or the other right
so this work does not imply that you
throw that out the window this work
implies that you kind of complimented
you add it and so you supplement it you
do not replace it so if you are using
security tools great if you have been
having some central stories around
security some broad stories but you have
not known till now how to make it more
granular then this is your way to become
granular if you knew the story but you
don't know what what in details could be
the associated backlog tasks then here
is your answer central tracking as I
said T and I showed you an example that
the stories have been worded in a way
where they can readily fit into your
trackers excel-based or whatever tools
you have
and then one another benefit is that
there is the general tendency or the
culture is to do security when there is
a compliance push internally on your
organization or your customer demands it
they're usually that is that is how
things typically function a security air
we can over look at what's the big deal
right but if you do any of these things
or the things which i am telling you
about and when you go for compliance of
your products it will actually end up I
mean it will result in speeding up of
your compliance efforts right and you
might be going for any of these like in
India have seen lot of firms go for ISO
27001 we are ISO 27001 certified right
or we are building as I said we are
building a product for the banking
sector and it has to be PCI compliant if
you look at the requirements of PCI
there is a section 6.5 or PCI which
talks about putting specific controls in
your development lifecycle these are the
kind of controls the kind of stories
which I am talking about are nothing but
your controls HIPAA for people who may
be working on the health in health
sector as such may be developing
products for the health sector list 853
is more of a US federal government
requirement but it is very critical for
lot of us customers I me know if you
have customers who are based out of the
US and are under the edges of the
federal government some way or the other
they will say that do you comply with
this so you don't have to say no we
don't comply can say yes not direct
compliance but this is what we have and
that itself kind of guarantees you
complaints next obvious question is yeah
all this sounds good now I would want to
try it what do what should i do what
should be my takeaway from this when I
go back if I want to look at your paper
or you have told me how to consume it
but what are the exact steps
so this is what you would do you would
obviously need to review the
accompanying document which have shown a
glimpse of you will have to spend some
time identifying the stories that apply
to your product I cannot emphasize the
importance of this particular step okay
this is one time one time as in the
first time before your set of sprints
are starting you need to review this
other time you review it when you have
significant changes in your applications
so one example is let's say you were
building a web application which or a
set of web applications which did not
have single sign-on right so when it did
not have single sign-on there was a set
of requirements which you picked up the
stories right but at a later stage maybe
after your first release at r1 you
decided that now the customer says I
would like a single sign-on for all
these five applications that is a
significant change right so then you
would need to go back to the selection
process of the stories make sure that
you are accounting for stories which tie
to the single sign-on bit of things then
you obviously i dint next step would be
identify the list of task you would like
to pick up for a given feature or
release in my interaction with various
product teams i have seen most of them
have something or the other kind of sort
of in place it may be patchy it may be
iffy it may not be formal but something
or the other from that laundry list is
already in place so one time i had
someone from the product team who was
the designated we refer to them as
security leads not really a role in
itself but it's like a pseudo single
point of contact within that for that
team for security issues and i was
questioning this person and i said how
do you keep track of certain patches and
let us say this this this team had heavy
reliance on java technology side so they
had this Tomcat being used and actively
I so tom cat was an a very active
component and so i was just asking mcc
tomcat has this issues all the time or
java has certain patches which it comes
come
with what do you do he says oh well
nothing every morning I come the first
thing I do is first half an hour I go to
the vendor site and check whether there
are any patches or not so he was already
doing it it's just that he didn't
realize the importance of that simple
step so that would be the next thing you
would do then identify the list of tasks
requiring health and security experts
which is section three add them once you
have done that add them to your list of
functional stories the user stories per
se p I have come across themes which do
it differently some might just tag it
separately as in here as my set of user
stories here are my set of security
focus stories some have actually nested
these security focus stories with the
relevant user stories so there is an
application which is helping me meet
certain objective as in there is one
story which is helping me meet certain
objective and here is a security story
tied to that feature behind the scenes
so one is what the customer sees versus
what of what additional thing are we
going to do behind the scenes and then
whatever are your definition of them
guidelines right then you complete the
stories and tasks as per your definition
of done guidelines manage the dead again
I have seen teams tie it with technical
debt or you can say this is my technical
Darrell this is my security did so this
depending on how critical security data
is for your organization you can have
your product manager take a call on that
product owner product manager product
owner whoever is your designated product
owner for different projects yes is
everybody awake do we want to do that
dance thing that I mean now I I did
suggest that after lunch because that
would not have been a good idea so we
did there was no point in getting the
lunch out you know so okay good now I'm
going to cover some of
no let me give a slide back background
of that so once we had this work in
place okay all of us when I say us I am
referring to all the authors from
different organizations we started going
back to our teams agile teams inside the
organization and we said guess what we
heard you loud and clear the last time
around when we came to you and we said
can you imbibe security in your giant
development you said I am NOT going to
translate your requirements into stories
get me stories we will top them right
guess what now I have the stories and I
have the operational tasks and I have
the task from which you need our help
okay now do you want to take it so the
response change response was very
positive right so what has happened is
while helping teams with this
implementation there are a bunch of FA
cues which have come up till now some of
them are very small which I am NOT going
to cover but here what I am going to
discuss our the broader ones or the most
common ones which have come up ok ok now
I am implementing now should I do this
ever forever or should I not do this
those kind of things right so that will
give you an idea and this is data
gathered from on the field
implementation tests so this is not
theoretical this is not made up one
common question which comes is do i need
to select these stories every sprint
valid question right so you have a set
of sprints now oh my god are you wanting
me to do the selection of 36 stories in
every sprint no I just covered this
previously that you would do it may be
in your sprint 0 is when you would do
the selection and then then you have any
major changes to your application after
your set of let us say five four five
six prints are done you are done with a
certain feature development or whatever
you were committed to and then there is
something major SI raja mentioned in
Roger a the first speaker right so he
mentioned in the morning about
architectures right about the fact that
agile obviously has emergent
architectures as in it is not something
which would draw on the board right now
and you just sit and sleep over it it
keeps changing or it is ideally supposed
to be ever-changing right so with that
respect when you know that there is a
change that is coming up in your next
sprint and which is going to be a major
change let us say the customer changed
some major requirement right that time
you would need to do the selection if
that is not the case if everything is
going as per let us say you planned for
the next six prints and there is no
change in the design as such and you are
just doing it no major change so you are
fine with the set of specs that's what I
mentioned here this diligence needs to
be done once and whenever major changes
are made will I need to adhere to the
selected stories every sprint so there
are some wise people in our product
teams who came up with what if I do it
in this print not in sprint to maybe
i'll do it in sprint 3 i will do some of
them instantly but not in sprint for so
my obvious answer was that then then bye
why do you want to use it to begin with
right so once you have committed see
understand this that because of the way
the threat landscape has been arrived at
and based on that the kind of stories
that we have come up with we have it
tried to beef up the numbers these
stories were not intended to be that let
me let us come up with 95 stories teams
would have thrown us away right so we
have only kept requirements which we
felt or stories which we felt actually
are needed across applications of
different types so will you need to
adhere if you decide to pick it up yes
how do another question which comes is
some of the teams are at least in a what
we have seen at Symantec is some of the
teams who have been on typical waterfall
and who have transitioned there is this
concept of threat models are you guys
aware or have you come across some
variant of it
okay a show of hands I just want to
quickly understand so I can give a quick
brief you have okay so threat models is
nothing but as the name suggests you
look at the architecture at the point in
time and you try and identify put
identify potential threats in that
design itself as simple as that so some
teams came up with we are doing threat
modeling now we have moved to agile now
do I need to do threat models know if
you have consumed these stories properly
as in if that selection process has been
diligent enough you do not need to do
explicit threat modeling because those
stories are nothing but threats so out
of 36 as an example if there is a
banking application for which you picked
up 20 stories you realize that 20 are
applicable those 20 are the potential
threats which your architects your
developers and your testers are anyway
going to address so do you need specific
threat modeling know what you do need is
what's known as in functional terms you
may have I am sure you would have come
across data flow diagrams right so yes
data flow diagrams need to be retained
but explicit threat modeling is not
commanded then this question also gets
us should or are the stories part of our
acceptance criteria of course why are
you doing them if you are not going to
hold them in addition to other
acceptance criteria that you have then
what is the point of doing them if no
one is going to have accountability then
no matter how many stories you have how
many operational tasks you have none of
them if they do not matter to the end
result then what is the incentive to the
team to do them to your devs or to York
us or for that matter to even your scrum
master if you like yeah why should I
pick it up if it is not going to make a
difference to the delivery why should I
pick it up and then yes
this also ties in with the ones which
you do not do actually cause security
date another question which comes up is
all this is fine but I have cloud
applications or I have mobile
applications will these stories apply
there yes so the threat landscape itself
which I shared in the beginning that
threat landscape takes all of this into
account cloud is just a delivery
mechanism you take conventional
application development and add rules
around privacy data they're basically
handling of sensitive information and
privacy and you have a cloud-based
application now there is a big who have
our cloud applications but come to think
of it when hotmail was there when people
used to jump on that bandwagon look I
high signed up here and I have a free
email account what was that did you know
where the hotmail server was sitting
none of us knew but it was exciting so
it has been there since that time it's
just that it's become more glorified
with addition of things like
virtualization and the desktops will go
over your laptops will go away whatever
the case might be so are they applicable
yes as I have been insisting since the
beginning product teams or in your case
you guys would need to pick up relevant
stories based on whatever is your
existing application are you working for
a thick client or are you going to give
your customer thick client then look at
those kind of stories what are the
underlying technologies so based on that
you need to identify is the most
important slide thank you I am reachable
via email and I forgot to give my phone
number but usually if you email me I
mean if you need any help with the
implementation or further investigation
I'd be happy to help you guys out yes
no application integrations and so on
where yes it was part of it however now
other applications which may not really
require those stories to be very part of
it how how do we really motivate team
that certain to pick them up yeah that's
a loaded question so I have I have
begged borrowed steeled so I have done
all sorts of tactics to some people i
have given business cases and talked
about what I did right so I face the
same problem when I went to the teams
for the second time by the way not the
first time first time they threw me out
they said you don't have the stories you
have these bunch of requirements I do
not understand go go next when I had the
stories I went back now with each team I
had to understand him why are they
resisting accepting the stories so for
example teams which already had some
level of security tools and a bit of
security diligence in place their
immediate thing was what is the value
add why should I pick up the stories
that same classical roi question right
why should I my sprint cycle will
increase it will go from two weeks to
two and a half weeks and blah blah so
what i would do is i would probably for
such a team i have done business cases
where i have tried and gave them the
value aspect that this is the benefit
you will have your debt security debt
will be less if you have a proactive
approach which you don't have at the
moment because of that i am saying that
you should consume that is one you will
be surprised there is a team which asked
me this
exact question and I am quoting the dev
manager so what are you trying to sell
me like what I am not trying to sell you
anything No so what is your sales pitch
so I have I do have those questions
right so as I said like for each one of
them have tackled them on a case-by-case
basis one team was extremely cautious
about our extremely concerned about
various types of compliance that their
product has to go through so for that
particular team I had to repair a case
to tell them that look compliance means
controls controls means you will have to
go back and figure out how to meet those
controls here i am giving you the
stories and the tasks are the ways to
meet those stories and those stories are
your actual controls ok so i do not know
how it is in your specific team but it
varies sometimes i get a quick Buy in
from the management right away as in a
product manager straightaway gives a buy
in and says we are going to do this we
have been looking for a proactive way to
do this we like it we just don't want to
rely at what's known as a security
assessment at the end when you are ready
just about ready you have picked up all
the features and you have said ok now we
are going to ship it to the customer
let's get a security assessment done if
they cannot find it then a product must
be secure right teams have that logic as
well so what I am coming to is there is
no bullet a silver bullet answer i have
found yet i have had to work to try and
it's all it to an extent it's almost
like a sales pitch where I have to try
and understand what is it that is
blocking them to pick it up in another
case I had to give them a sample I said
okay out of these 36 can you pick up few
will pick up five fine pick up these
five what about the operational tasks we
can pick up the only these three fine do
something at least once you start doing
it that is when it's NHL that is anyway
the guiding principle right you you
learn by doing you get the feedback you
do again you get the feedback and all of
that is quick it's not like you just say
stories and then I disappear no
so throughout I have had to collaborate
with them I have had questions where
people have asked me about does this
story specifically apply it doesn't seem
seem to apply and then you have to help
them with the justification yes this
applies in your case because right so
does that answer your question I mean
you have to look at your specific
environment and think why people would
not be motivated and that answer to that
vibe will result into my mind in some
sort of business case customized to your
organization and that that will move
things through like right now I know
almost all agile teams in semantics have
been bothered by me one time or the
other and they are consuming it in one
way or the other and some are even to
the extent when they see me the vended
directors or senior managers or managers
dev managers or so service delivery
people they see me they're like a fish
stories takaya okay I can't help it
either you tell me you're not going to
do it give me a justified reason if you
can't look at my business case and
consume something bo ba that's another
thing there is a persistence element as
well so I hope it kind of answers yeah
it sure yeah yes
yes yes absolutely you can make it a
checklist yes yes absolutely
correct
mapping of the client is there usually
ok so again you are coming from user
stories perspective I am NOT coming from
user story these are not users will not
see these the way they have been worded
they are modeled around actual
vulnerabilities which have been seen in
applications users will not be
interested in knowing that that example
which I gave of throttling p like end
user would not be worried about whether
your application guides against
throttling or not end user will say you
have given me a login form when I try to
login does it take my password and allow
me to seamlessly log in and view
whatever screens you promised or not
behind the scenes what did you do to
sort of fortify that or secure that is
not the users concern which is the which
is actually incidentally the exact
reason we decided to come up with user
with security focus stories meant for
devs meant for architects and meant for
testers users will not be seeing this
directly but yes as tushar had mentioned
elaborate properly and if it is
obviously coming from the top then the
collaboration does not need to worry too
much right it's like karma had to cut my
end of story or start of story rather
yes yes
you
it's a perception in actuality it's not
a overhead I will tell you why you are
anyway your guys are anyway spending
time in getting the functional bricks of
functionality you are anyway working on
right this is just piggy banging on that
it's saying that when you develop the
functionality you develop it securely
when you test the functionality you test
it securely so ideally if you have
consumed this properly you would be in a
situation where all these stories would
map with one of your user stories your
regular user stories so what would
happen is as an example if I am a
developer i am writing some peace i am
on a scrum team and i am under it's a
sprint one or sprint 2 and i am doing
something towards a feature completion
right now when I'm writing that line of
code or I'm writing logic in that logic
I am making sure that i am using the
security i am having my security hat on
as well it will become part of that so I
said so it's never of overhead it's a
perceived overhead right and this
happens this is a cultural thing it
takes time to sort of four teams to
imbibe because there is this obvious
thing right this this is an NFR
non-functional requirement so
immediately the thing is NFR overhead no
need to do right but you change the
perception and you say wait a minute you
are anyway going to spend time in doing
these things why not do it securely
that's it so as I said it's it's a
perception okay since we are hard
pressed for time you can take some
questions you know after the sessions of
epic and mr. pankaj so any any more
questions you want to ask fish are still
the lunch effect okay
