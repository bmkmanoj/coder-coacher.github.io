in the future exam it is similar to a
survey conducted by PMI of the 200

point for every question answered
correctly there is no negative marking
for the incorrect ones you may also mark
a question for review and revisit it at

discipline is divided into five broad
process groups when a new project starts
it is first in the project initiation
phase moving to planning phase then to
execution followed by monitoring and
controlling and finally it is closed
project execution and monitoring and
controlling processes go hand-in-hand
therefore when a new project is
initiated all processes of project
initiation process group should be
applied to the project similarly when
the project is being closed all
processes of project closing group
should be applied for instance identify
risks is a process of project planning
group so when the project is in planning
phase you must identify all the risks of
the project next let's see what

knowledge area is a set of specific
processes performed to meet a project
objective let us now consider processes
