and switching course offered by simply
learn in the previous lesson we focused
on networking topologies and Ethernet in
this lesson we will look into layers 7 3
&amp;amp; 4 of the OSI model let us begin with
the objectives of this lesson in the
next slide by the end of this lesson you
will be able to discuss layer 7
application types and protocols describe
the operation of TCP and UDP explain the
purpose of ICMP and ARP describe ipv4
header let us begin with the three types
of layer 7 application in the next slide
there are many ways to measure the
quality of data communications delay
jitter and loss tolerant delay
corresponds to response time it measures
how quickly a response from input is
expected jitter refers to the variation
in delay an application can respond
quickly to one input but slowly to
another if tolerance for jitter is high
for example a constant delay on a
telephone call is not as annoying as a
variation in delay with a jitter
involved in the call if an application
is lost tolerant data losses are
acceptable this assumes in the case of
interactive and batch applications that
the data would be retransmitted in VoIP
and videoconferencing the data would
just be dropped the next slide shows the
performance requirements for various
layer 7 application types the table on
the slide shows the main protocols used
at layer 4 which are TCP and UDP data
from higher layers are broken into
segments for efficient transmission
transmission control protocol TCP is
connection oriented this means it keeps
track of a data flow once a TCP session
is established it is maintained until
the sender or receiver terminates the
session just like a telephone call TCP
keeps track of segments that have
matching source and destination port
numbers TCP also provides reliable
transport of the segment if the source
does not receive an acknowledgment that
the segments have been received at the
destination the source pre transmits the
segment's user data protocol UDP on the
other hand does not provide reliable
transport UDP is faster than TCP because
acknowledgment is not required also UDP
does not keep track of a data flow it is
a connectionless protocol now let us
look more closely at TCP header in the
following slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
