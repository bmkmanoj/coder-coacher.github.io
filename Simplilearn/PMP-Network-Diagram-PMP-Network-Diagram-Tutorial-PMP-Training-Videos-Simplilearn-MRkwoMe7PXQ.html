the project time management knowledge
area to plot the activity dependencies
this is a graphical representation of
the project activities in the form of a
network there are two ways to draw a
network diagram in precedence
diagramming model PDM or activity on
node Aon boxes represent activities and
the arrows indicate the dependency this
type of network can have all four types
of relationships between the activities
in arrow diagramming model ADM or
activity on arrow
AOA the arrows represent activities the
relationships and sequences can be
inferred from the direction of the
arrows and linkages between the
activities and such types of network
only finished to start relationships can
be shown such diagrams may need to make
use of dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities there
may be questions in the PMP exam based
on the network diagram so create and
work with the diagram this will make
answering network diagram based
questions easy and fun in the next
screen let us look at a network diagram
a simple network diagram is shown on the
screen activities a and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both a and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on arrow network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
reporting purposes in the next screen
let us look at a few important terms in
time management
