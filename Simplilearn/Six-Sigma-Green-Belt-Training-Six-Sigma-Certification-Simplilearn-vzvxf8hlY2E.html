organization lesson simply learns Lean
Six Sigma Greenbelt certification course
the purpose of this lesson is to
introduce you to the concepts of Six
Sigma and lean and how it benefits an
organization what do you see on the
screen well it depends on your
perception or how you see the world if
you are pessimist you might think the
glasses have empty if you're an optimist
you might think the glass is half-full
if you are a realist you might think the
glass is full with water and air however
the Six Sigma practitioner sees a glass
that is bigger than it needs to be
assuming the current water level is what
the customer desires as we begin our
journey to learn more about Six Sigma it
is important to know that applying Six
Sigma is the way of seeing and analyzing
the processes around you we will talk
more about what Six Sigma means and how
the viewpoint impacts organizations in
the screens to come let's begin this
lesson by defining quality quality is
defined as meeting the requirements of
the customer well what features do you
look for when purchasing a car what
facilities do you want in your house or
apartment when buying one what do you
expect from a premium chocolate candy
bar answers to these questions will tell
what quality means to you for each of
these items here's a snapshot of the
quality journey with a few key
milestones in the 1930s the idea of
statistical process control was
conceived by Walter Stewart to monitor
and control a process using statistical
methods this was used extensively during
World War two to quickly expand
industrial capabilities of the u.s. in
the 1960s quality circles were
formulated a quality circle is a
self-improvement workers group that
performs similar work meets regularly to
identify analyze and solve work-related
problems
in 1987 the International Organization
for Standardization designed ISO 9000
this is a set of international standards
on quality management and Quality
Assurance for organizations to implement
the quality management systems in 1987
the Baldrige award criteria was
developed by US Congress to raise
awareness of quality management systems
and recognize US companies that have
successively implemented quality
management systems in 1988 the concept
of benchmarking was introduced
benchmarking is an improvement process
where an organization measures its
performance against the best
organizations in its field determines
how such performance levels were
achieved and uses the information to
improve its own performance during the
1990s the balanced scorecard or BSC was
introduced it is a management tool that
helps managers at all levels to align
activities to the strategy of their
organization and to monitor the multiple
results obtained in their key areas
in 1996 the concept of re-engineering
was introduced reengineering is also
known as business process reengineering
which involves restructuring an entire
organization
the term Six Sigma has different
meanings or implications depending on
the context Sigma is a Greek letter used
in the statistical world to represent a
measure of variability the Six Sigma
process is an important method of
quality principles and techniques also
Six Sigma is a business strategy to
change company culture with top
management support the Sigma level is a
measure of performance for a business
process or service
so when you say Six Sigma there are
several definitions that are all correct
quality is defined as the degree of
excellence of a product or service and
conformance to customer requirements
taking a process to Six Sigma level
ensures the quality of product and
increase in profits as a primary goal in
other words Six Sigma signifies quality
in 1986 Bill Smith and Mikhail Harry and
Motorola started the Six Sigma
initiative to improve performance in
1995 Jack Woltz initiated Six Sigma at
General Electric who improved the entire
business system and became the global
promoter of Six Sigma in 1998 a light
signal saved a half billion dollars with
the use of Six Sigma in 2000 General
Electric
saved 2 billion annually with the use of
Six Sigma and in 2001 Motorola saved 16
billion cumulative Li with the use of
Six Sigma Six Sigma is a business
methodology that employs a
customer-centric fact-based approach to
reduce process variation and waste this
helps us dramatically improve customer
satisfaction increased shareholder value
and strengthen employee commitment the
methodology is designed to make
companies rethink the way they do
business and generate improvements and
processes and services
following are the benefits of
implementing Six Sigma and an
organization it eliminates the root
cause of problems and defects in a
process creates robust products and
services reduces process variation in
waste ensures customer satisfaction
achieves process standardization reduces
rework by getting it right the first
time
addresses key business requirements
helps gain competitive advantage and
helps achieve organizational goals
following are the three reasons why
organizations are successful with Six
Sigma it is a proven systematic
problem-solving methodology that follows
a tried and effective process known as
DeMeo which improves productivity and
efficiency by eliminating defects Six
Sigma is customer focused this
methodology ensures businesses align
their projects to customers needs it
allows organizations to produce better
products and services and improves
customer loyalty
lastly Six Sigma achieves long-term
improvements based on data-driven
statistical analysis to prioritize
issues and fix root causes
the Six Sigma process is known as de
Mayock de mayic comprises five phases
define measure analyze improve and
control these phases are the roadmap to
problem solving and improving our
processes the effectiveness of Six Sigma
method is derived from its structure
each phase has an overarching objective
and specific deliverables that need to
be completed which helps us achieve the
objectives the purpose of the define
phase is to document the problem the
desired outcome goals and deliverables
the purpose of the measure phase is to
obtain baseline process performance
levels and quantify the problem the
focus of the analyze phase is to
identify the key root causes for process
variation and defects the purpose of the
improve phase is to develop test and
implement the solutions the goal of the
control phase is to monitor the key
factors and maintain the gains you learn
the aspects of the dimag process now
we'll look at the tools use in each
phase the list of tools corresponds to
the domain phase in which they are used
the user application of these tools
gives the expected deliverables in each
domain phase for a green belt some of
the tools listed are not required in
every Six Sigma Greenville project these
tools give us an insight into the
problem and lead us toward the real
issues in our processes that is with
more experience you are likely to know
the tools you need for your projects and
the define phase we use Sai POC voice of
the customer or vo C critical to quality
C T Q the quality function deployment or
qfd failure modes and effects analysis
known as the FMEA or the família and
the cause and effect C any matrix in the
measure phase we use measurement system
analysis or MSA control charts process
capability and normality plot and the
analyze phase we use simple linear
regression or SLR Pareto charts fishbone
diagram Billy Moe's and effects analysis
from the
multi-varied charts and hypothesis
testing in the improve phase we use
brainstorming piloting and also the
failure modes effects analysis and
design of experiments do e in the last
phase control will use control charts a
control plan and measurement system
