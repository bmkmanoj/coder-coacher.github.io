knowledge of the evidence collection
techniques observation inquiry
inspection interview data analysis
forensic investigation techniques
computer assisted audit techniques used
to gather protect and preserve audit
evidence
now what this means is first and
foremost your audit must be supported by
objective evidence it cannot be a matter
of opinion so the next question becomes
how do you collect and preserve such
evidence for your CSUN exam you need to
know the various techniques used to
gather and preserve evidence there are
several ways to gather information
inquiry is one of them literally
conducting surveys of key personnel in
an organization to discover if
particular control objectives are being
met
this is particularly effective when part
of your audit is checking on compliance
with certain policies and industry
regulation observation this involves
observing people and systems to see if
control objectives are being met
interviews can also be used we interview
key personnel and ask them specific
questions now in both the interview and
the inquiry options you need to ensure
that you've carefully selected the
questions to get optimal information
though just do ad hoc questioning and of
course we have analysis using
computer-assisted auditing techniques
we've listed a few here it's not
critical that you know the specific
computer-assisted auditing packages
however you should be aware the
computer-assisted auditing techniques
are very common particularly when you
have to sample large amounts of data
normally you'll store and retain audit
evidence in some sort of electronic
media USB drives hard drives that sort
of thing and there should be retention
policies established ahead of time that
show the requirements for storing such
evidence how long it has to be stored
that's sort of a thing
the main area is covered
College statement are particularly
computer assisted auto techniques but
also evidence now evidence we've
discussed in other lessons and we're
going to continue to discuss it because
it's a key part of auditing interviewing
and observing personnel and the
performance of their duties continuous
auditing now remember continuous
auditing or processes that ensure that
audit goals are still being met
even between audits and of course audit
documentation
remember evidence is the information
that you're going to base your
conclusions on the information systems
auditor gathers conclusive objective
data in the course of performing and is
on it the idea of evidence is to have
objective data to support your audit
findings now evidence has to directly
relate to the objectives of the audit
tangential information or
inconsequential information is not
pertinent to an audit we need evidence
or data that directly relates to control
objectives now how you gather that
evidence is a key issue remember the
very standards we looked at at an
earlier lesson s6 performance of audit
work talks about evidence and evidence
gathering in addition to gathering it
you have to appropriately organize it
and document it in order to support
findings and conclusions
how reliable is the evidence though just
like with a criminal case that you might
have seen on some sort of television
drama or movie different types of
evidence have different levels of
reliability what are the factors that
determine if a particular piece of
evidence is reliable first of all
whoever provided the evidence be that a
person or a system are they independent
do they have no particular stake in the
outcome independent evidence is what you
always want the qualification of the
person providing the information or
evidence is that person qualified to
make the observations and conclusions
they're providing you objectivity is the
evidence clearly objective it's not
biased in any particular way either for
or against the audit target and of
course the timing of the evidence
now there are different characteristics
that were concerned with with evidence
the confidence level of evidence is
based on its value you also look at
audit evidence and consider the
following is it complete adequate and
convincing in and of itself in other
words with this particular piece of
evidence or group of evidence pieces
lead another information systems auditor
to form the same conclusions you have if
so then that evidence is sufficient now
if it wouldn't if other data is required
to come to the same conclusion in this
evidence in and of itself is
insufficient is it useful does it assist
any auditor in meeting the audit
objectives you can come up with a great
deal of information during an audit
you'll learn a great deal about their
information systems their business
processes and practices all kinds of
data will come into your hands however
not all of it assist you in meeting your
audit objectives it may be evidence but
it's not pertinent to the audit it has
to be reliable it has to be valid
factual objective and supportable if
it's not reliable none of the rest
really matters you can deal with
evidence that in and of itself is not
quite sufficient an evidence that may
not be useful may not help your on up it
doesn't hurt it but evidence that's not
reliable is a deep deep concern is the
evidence relevant that's very similar to
useful does it pertain to the audit
objectives is there a logical
relationship to the findings and
conclusions that you're basing on this
piece of evidence in other words if your
conclusion is based on a specific piece
of evidence that's piece of piece of
evidence needs to have a specific and
clear logical relationship to your
conclusion
there are lots of ways to gather
evidence we start with reviewing the
organizational structure as it relates
to information systems this will give
you a clue as to who to interview who to
inquire with who to observe you'll want
to review is documentation if the
information systems documentation
doesn't adequately describe or meet
control objectives that it's very
unlikely that the practices of the
information systems department will meet
those objectives review the information
system standards are they based on
well-known well-established third-party
standards or are they internal standards
if they're internal standards do they
meet the control objectives reviewing
policies and procedures how does this
organization handle a security breach
how does it handle data disposal of old
media what are their policies and
procedures free to these issues frankly
it's impossible to do an adequate audit
if you don't know what the company's
policies and procedures are now and this
is based on the previous review of the
organizational structure you can
interview appropriate personnel you want
to make sure those personnel are in a
position to give you reliable and
sufficient evidence you may wish to also
observe processes and employees actually
performing their duties this can really
let you know whether or not the policies
and procedures are actually being
implemented on a regular basis you can
always reaper form a particular task to
see if it meets or fails to meet control
objectives and of course a generalized
walkthrough can be helpful any of these
methods or in fact all of them you can
use on any given on it to try to gather
as much evidence as possible my personal
feeling is you should always err on the
side of gathering too much evidence and
then leave out extraneous or irrelevant
data from your final report but it's
better to have data that you have to
pare down then to discover you didn't
gather enough data
audit documentation it's really
difficult to over document an audit now
I'm talking about the documentation that
you personally gather not necessarily
what goes in your final report your
audited documentation should at a
minimum include a complete record of the
following things the planning and
preparation of audits go to put
objectives how did you select the scope
how did you choose the objectives how
did you plan your audit if you're doing
walkthroughs let's have a description of
those walkthroughs well let's actually
do a walk-through of any particular
audit area do we have an audit program
exact plan for how we're going to do our
audit what tests we'll conduct what
tools we'll use and then we also
absolutely must document the steps that
were actually performed in the evidence
gathered you may use the services of
other auditors or experts one example
might be let's assume that as part of
your audit you have to gather
information regarding the security
policies as implemented on workstations
however some of the workstations or
Macintosh computers and you don't have
adequate Macintosh experience you might
use the services of a Macintosh
professional to do that portion of your
audit or to at least advise and assist
you of course you'll need to fully
document whatever you found your
conclusions and your recommendations it
really cannot be overstated that
recommendations are a critical part of
an audit it's inadequate to simply tell
a customer what gaps they have in their
security coverage you need to give them
recommendations to remediate those and
of course audit documentation or
relation with document identification
and dates what documents did you get
order the dates and those documents how
are they used all of these items should
be part of your audit documentation that
concludes knowledge statement 1.7
see is a knowledge statement 1.8
knowledge of different sampling
methodologies and other subjective data
analytical procedures
in this knowledge statement we're going
to look at two things first comparing
compliance to subjective testing and
then looking at sampling methodologies
compliance testing involves gathering
evidence in order to test the
enterprise's compliance with control
procedures now what we're talking about
here is any sort of requirement be it
legal regulatory industry norm or
internal requirements we essentially
look at various security controls to
determine whether they do or do not
comply with the specific requirement
this generally involves looking at the
overall performance of the control not
specific transactions substance of
testing is evidence gathered to evaluate
the integrity of individual transactions
data or other information but another
way with substance of testing you're
going to be looking at specific
transactions or specific data records
obviously this gives you a better basis
to draw conclusions but just as
obviously it's much more resource
intensive throughout this lesson we'll
consider a hypothetical ecommerce
company will call Acme e-commerce that
had 100 thousand records 100 thousand
transactions during the audit period
which was last calendar year now the
presence of internal controls can
minimize the number of substance of
tests that have to be done how do we
know there are adequate internal
controls
well that's established via compliance
testing if the controls past compliance
testing and there is less need for
substance of testing conversely any
weakness or inadequacy and internal
controls will increase the need or
number of substance of tests we still
don't want to check every single
transaction and that's where we use
something from Statistics call sampling
sampling is done when it's not logical
or practical or even possible to test
all the transactions this is usually due
to the time and cost needed again we
have 100,000 transactions in our
hypothetical scenario obviously it is
too cost-prohibitive to look at all of
them
again we have one
a thousand transactions in our
hypothetical scenario obviously it is
too cost-prohibitive to look at all of
them so once again we'll be looking at
compliance versus substance of testing
and we'll be looking at sampling
so what is the sample first let's look
at what a population is a population
consists of the entire group of items
that we need to examine and draw
conclusions on in our scenario it's
100,000 records that took place last
year a sample is the subset of that
population that we use to infer
characteristics about the population
those inferences are based on examining
the characteristics of the sample and
extrapolating those results to the
population now because of this the
sample has to represent as closely as
possible the characteristics of the
whole population let me explain that
with another hypothetical scenario let's
assume that you've been tasked with
determining the average height for males
in France
you're not going to measure every single
male in France that's simply not
practical not even possible so you're
going to get a sample of males and
France but you chose your sample from a
convention for horse jockeys men who
ride horses and horse races now horse
jockeys tend to be abnormally small men
much smaller than average so all of the
conclusions you draw don't really apply
to the population because you used poor
sampling methodology all of the
inferences you draw are going to be
inaccurate that same thing applies to
every audit you do when you're sampling
records if you make the wrong selection
in your sample then your conclusions
will be wrong in some cases even the
exact opposite of what the reality is
for the general population so you can
see that sampling methodology is very
important
sampling can be either statistical or
non statistical let's look at
statistical first statistical sampling
uses objective methods to determine
first the sample size let's pause and
comment on that we have 100,000
transactions to consider without any
reference to statistical methodologies I
think you already intuitively know that
selecting five records for your sample
is not enough and I think just as much
you're aware that you don't need to
select 50,000 records so we use
objective methods to select sample size
our selection criteria is based on
objective methods the most obvious is to
randomly select but are we sure we
randomly select it are we sure we
selected in such a way as to not skew
our results and that gives us the
precision of our sample all of these
things are going to impact the
reliability or confidence level we have
in our sample now for just a moment
let's reflect on confidence levels and
statistics the term confidence level has
a very specific meaning within the world
of statistics for the purpose of the
cisa exam you don't have to know
statistics there will be no questions
wherein you have to perform statistical
calculations and I know that's quite a
relief to some of you however let me
state that in my opinion the better
knowledge you have with statistics and
the more you apply statistics the better
auditor you will be but for our purposes
prepping you for the sisa you don't need
to know statistics and I say that
because the word confidence level is a
very specific meaning in the world of
statistics now statistical sampling can
be used to infer population
characteristics from the sample and so
it's the preferred method well you might
be wondering if it's the preferred
method why do we have an alternative
method why not just always use
statistical well let's look at that
alternative method and I think that will
answer that question non statistical
sampling does not use any objective math
it's purely subjective judgment to
determine the method of sampling sample
size and sample selection non
statistical sampling cannot be used to
infer population characteristics and
it's not the preferred method so when
might you use it well let's look at that
first statement it cannot be used to
infer population characteristics so non
statistical sampling can be used when
you don't wish to infer population
characteristics let's assume that of our
100,000 transactions the overwhelming
majority are all roughly 100 dollars in
amount or less I would like to look at
the small handful of transactions that
exceeded $1,000 well I already know that
these are not representative of the
population I already know that any
conclusions about this very small sample
cannot be extrapolated to the population
I don't intend to infer population
characteristics from the sample in that
scenario it's possible to use non
statistical sampling
sampling method serve two types
attribute sampling and variable sampling
let's look at attribute first sometimes
this is called proportional sampling we
will select some specific attribute and
look for either the presence of that
attribute or the absence for example I
might look at those transactions that
had sales tax or did not have sales tax
this is often used in compliance testing
our sales tax scenario is a great
example if you did not apply sales tax
did you comply with regulatory
requirements for scenarios where sales
tax is not required the conclusions are
often expressed in rates of incidents
how many transactions per 100 per 1000
or per million actually meet or fail to
meet that presence or absence of the
attribute lots of ways to do this you
can simply sample all the transactions
grabbing those that have the attribute
or you can pick a fixed sample size or
you can pick a frequency another way to
do this is stop or go sampling let's
assume you've determined that the
appropriate sample size is 1,000
transactions you first examine the very
first 1,000 transactions in the database
if they have the attribute you're
looking for you stop and that just
became the sample you'll work with if
not you go to the next 1000 and look
again to see if that attribute exists
you'll continue this until you find a
group of 1,000 that has your attribute
and that's your sample discovery
sampling is even less common essentially
you have an item that is so uncommon so
rare that you're basically waiting until
it's discovered now in addition to
attribute sampling we have variable
sampling variable sampling is often used
to estimate some quantitative measure
like dollar value or weight dollar value
is far more common so this is often
called dollar estimation usually we're
going to calculate a statistical mean
for whatever measurement we're looking
at for example dollar so it's also
uncalled mean estimation sampling or
quantitative sampling this is often
applied in substance of testing and it
provides conclusions related to any
deviations from that norm there's
basically two main ways to do this
unhhhh stratified or stratified
stratified simply means we've already
divided up the population in two ranges
such as all transactions ranging from
$10 to $100 all transactions ranging
from 100 $1.00 to 200 all ranging from
201 to 300 so on and so forth so we have
stratified or unstrap ID
computer-assisted audit techniques are
often used for gathering and analyzing
data from computer systems to meet some
audit objective now you can probably
realize that with sampling of large
number of transactions used in substance
of testing a computer assisted on a
technique is almost a requirement it's
almost impossible to do this effectively
by hand
computer assisted audit techniques
involve a few things in the process
first you have to understand the client
the client's needs and their goals
that's going to help you select the
appropriate computer assisted audit
technique now you have to ensure that
that technique will obtain effective
evidence you have to ensure that it
provides data analysis I mentioned
previously that you're not going to be
asked to do any sort of statistical
calculation but your computer assisted
audit techniques should be able to and
it should be able to report on findings
now these techniques are going to vary
and they're based on differences in
hardware software data structures record
formats the general IT environment and
the processing functions there are lots
of examples of computer assisted auto
techniques first of all we have
generalized audit software like idea and
ACL then we have utility software your
transactions are undoubtedly stored in a
database most database management
systems have a variety of report writers
and even the ability to extract specific
elements of data as a side note the sisa
exam does not require you to know
structured query language or SQL however
in your actual audit practice if you're
going to rely on database management
systems particularly relational database
management systems a basic knowledge of
SQL structured grade language will allow
you to extract data with all kinds of
formats with all kinds of criteria and
even to perform some basic statistical
calculations such as calculating the
mean debugging and scanning software is
often used in auditing the IT systems
themselves
in many cases test data is important you
want to be able to test to ensure that
your computer assisted audit technique
is functioning properly expert systems
rely on elements of artificial
intelligence and essentially the issue
with expert systems is that they're able
to answer more questions than you asked
with normal techniques like SQL commands
that we've already mentioned you have to
ask a specific question I want all
transactions in this date range with
this dollar amount expert systems can
look at the complete body of data and
often are able to pull out specific
relationships you didn't know to ask for
they are less common and far more
expensive third party access control
software can use to audit the access
control process any application software
tracing and mapping will allow you to
map out exactly what particular software
is doing and therefore out of it many
systems have all kinds of options built
in them including reporting all of these
techniques can be used to assist in your
audit
the functional capabilities of all the
generalized audit software should be as
follows file access your data is going
to come to you in a variety of file
structures and record formats you need
to ensure that your audit software is
capable of accessing all of the record
formats and structures that you need to
access it should also provide you with
reorganization so you can sort merge
link and index the data as you see fit
it should give you a wide variety of
data selection options filtering data
selecting data that sort of thing it
should have built into it a number of
statistical functions including sampling
stratification frequency analysis and
computing basic statistics such as
statistical mean mode standard deviation
variance that sort of thing there should
also be arithmetic functions and
operators within the software
this concludes knowledge statement 1.8
see is a knowledged
1.9
knowledge of reporting and communication
techniques including facilitation
negotiation conflict resolution audit
report structure issue writing the
management summary and result
verification communication needs to be
effective and clear in order to improve
the quality of the audit and maximize
results the final product that you
produce from any audit is essentially
communication there will be a written
report along with an executive summary
and usually a verbal briefing at the end
of the audit no matter how effective and
how high a quality your audit was if
your communication of the results and
findings is inefficient then the audit
itself will be less effective
put another way your reports going to
have to give clear and concise this was
a detailed information regarding your
conclusions your recommendations and the
basis for those conclusions and
recommendations it's also the case that
your verbal communication can either
improve or be a negative impact have a
dilatory effect on the audit outcome
when an argument ensues between the
auditor and the oddity during the final
findings report presentation it's
usually over the accuracy of the
findings and the report this makes the
audit process counterintuitive perhaps
even counterproductive and quickly
dilutes the audit process and its value
now you may be wondering an argument
ensuing when might disappear
you have to consider the perspective of
the oddity many oddities will consider
any deficiencies documented in your
report as essentially an attack on the
quality of their work because your
report is essentially stating that
current existing Aya's controls fail to
meet requisite standards they're
substandard they're not effective and
that is often taken as a criticism of at
least certain members of the Oddity
staff a natural and common reaction is
to reject your findings to question the
accuracy of your findings and that's
where disputes will occur now
you will look at some techniques both in
your written report and your verbal
communication that can ameliorate this
situation audit findings will often be
ultimately reported to stakeholders
before that occurs they need to have
appropriate buy-in from the oddities
this is the only way to have a
successful audit process and add value
to the oddity organization in other
words it's a good idea to get the
appropriate audit EIT staff members
involve before you present to
stakeholders in other words if you can
get the IT staff to agree with your
conclusions and your recommendations
before presenting to stakeholders it's
much more likely that these
implementations will be agreed upon and
will be affected throughout your entire
audit good communication and negotiation
skills are required and it's not
possible to overemphasize this point you
might be the most excellent information
system auditor on the planet and you
might conduct a perfect audit from a
technical point of view but if you have
poor communication skills that alienate
the oddity or at least members of the
Oddity staff you will decrease the
efficacy of your audit communication
skills determine the effectiveness of
the audit reporting process so our main
areas of coverage are how to communicate
audit results along with the information
technology assurance framework section
2600 reporting standards in addition to
the material in this lesson it's
probably a good idea to refer to that
specific standard prior to taking this
ISA exam during the exit interview
that's your final briefing with the
oddity the is auditor has to ensure
several things first and foremost make
absolutely certain that the facts you
present in your report are accurate you
must be aware that anyone can make a
mistake including you or me so first
double-check your results particularly
any results the point - any flaws in the
oddity systems particularly egregious
and significant flaws you need to double
check your accuracy now part of your
report will be to recommend remediation
steps make sure your steps
that you've recommended are both
realistic and cost-effective it's not
helpful if your recommendations are too
expensive maybe too vague or simply
unrealistic then recommend specific
implementation dates for those
recommendation that they have agreed
upon in other words once you get the
oddity to agree on a specific step to
remediate an issue recommend a specific
date to implement and again make sure
that date is both realistic and
cost-effective there's lots of things
you can do in your presentation you
should always include an executive
summary an executive summary is
essentially an easy-to-read concise
summary of your report it lacks some of
the detail and supporting evidence but
gives the overall picture you may choose
to use visual presentation aids such as
slides or computer graphics I often like
to include charts wherever possible
before you communicate any results of an
audit to senior management it's a good
idea to discuss the findings with the
lower level management staff and perhaps
even the IT staff of the audit identity
that way you can work out any
discrepancies or issues prior to
informing senior staff the purpose of
this is to ensure that all relevant
parties agree on both what you found and
the corrective actions you recommended
now it's a good idea if you become
familiar with the IaaS seven reporting
and s eight follow up activities prior
to taking the C's the exam both those
are important to know let's talk about
communication skills we've already
indicated that poor communication skills
can have a negative impact on the entire
auditing process particularly on the
reporting and recommendation phase let's
start with facilitation there are a lot
of techniques you can use to facilitate
clear communication the first at least
in my opinion is to put yourself in the
other person's perspective if you are
for example going to list an issue with
network security that impacts the
gateway router how would you react to
this news if you were the network
administrator responsible for that
router and how can you phrase the issue
so as not to be accusatory and not to
engage in conflict that's one step to
facilitating good communication another
one is good listening skills now a lot
of people overlook listening skills
clearly you're capable of hearing what
the other person said but that's not the
same thing as listening you need to
fully understand the factual information
they're communicating to you in their
emotional tone the idea of communication
is to take information from party a and
get it to party B anything
that degrades the communication received
is adversarial to communication let me
put that another way when you're
listening be engaged be focused don't
simply be waiting to talk listen
carefully to what the person is saying
but also listen to their tone of voice
their posture facial expressions and try
to imagine how you would feel if you
were in their position another thing you
can use is called active listening where
appropriate either ask a clarifying
question brief or restate it in your own
terms and see if you're hearing what
they meant you to hear make absolutely
sure you fully understand by
facilitating your communication it's
also important to not use any language
that's accusatory
let's not come across as if we're
blaming the oddities IT staff now in
most cases you're not in most cases
they're simply human beings they
executed very good procedures but
something was missed that's okay that's
why we have audits in a few rare cases
the IT staff is egregious ly mismanaged
security and it is perhaps really their
fault
but you still don't want to come off
saying that you want them to support
your audit goals and recommendations and
to be on board this also could involve
negotiation and conflict resolution
negotiation you have to be willing to
give up something in return for
something for example you may be
recommending a remediation step that the
IT staff opposes see if you can find a
common ground that don't compromise to
the point that
you've impacted negatively on network
security your idea of an audit is to
improve the organizational security
controls not to damage them so
negotiation only goes so far but you
have to be actually involved and
actively interested in compromise for
negotiation to work
conflict resolution often involves some
of the exact same steps I've already
mentioned looking at things from the
other person's perspective communicating
in such a way as to not inflame any
negative emotions not being accusatory
certainly not talking down to the person
or anything of that nature you are
equals your colleagues and you all have
the same goal in mind that's to have a
robust security posture for the
organization you're auditing you're all
on the same team you may have different
ideas of how to get there you may have
different opinions on the specific
deficiencies that need to be addressed
and how they need to be addressed but
you do have the same goal if you keep
that in mind and you communicate that
through your words your body language
and your expressions you're going to go
a long way to resolving conflict when
you write up issues make sure you write
them up in a positive light not an
accusatory or negative light when you're
writing your report you're going to have
individual issues that you believe are
substandard and need remediation think
about the use of words for example I
just used the word substandard that
tends to have a negative connotation
instead of talking about deficiencies
talk about room for improvement talk
about ways to make the situation better
not necessarily how bad it is now I do
not suggest that you take this to such
an extreme that you're glossing over
real issues real issues need to be
clearly and concisely described but be
careful in your language so that you're
not using terms that are almost
guaranteed to enflame a negative
response from the oddities IT staff your
report we have a lot to say on the
report let's start with the essentials
that should be in there obviously the
organization you're auditing who
should receive a copy of this audit and
any restrictions that them may sound a
little odd but audits contain a lot of
confidential information
we shouldn't be distributing them to
just anyone are there restrictions on
circulation what was the scope of your
audit specifically what was it you
audited and I like to add anything that
was expressly excluded I want to be very
clear in my audit that these items were
not audited and here's why what were the
objectives of your audit this should be
numerous there's not just an objective
and not something generic like to test
security you had very specific issues we
wanted to find out if the web server was
vulnerable to these specific attacks we
wanted to check to see if the
authorization and access control
mechanisms were resistant to these
specific attacks we wanted to find out
if the database integrity steps met
these regulatory requirements those are
specific objectives the period of
coverage often times years a month 12
months is a common one a one-year on it
but you may do a six-month auditor
quarterly out of the two-year audit
whatever what was the period of coverage
the nature of your audit the techniques
you used the overall approach that sort
of thing the timing and extent when did
you do the audit and how extensive
wasn't obviously your findings this
needs to be quite detailed exactly what
did you find how did you find it and
what does it mean conclusions what are
your conclusions and more particularly
your recommendations for follow-up and
particularly the conclusions need to be
supported by solid evidence there needs
to be a clear reason for these
conclusions it's not enough for it
simply to be your opinion do you have
any reservations or qualifications for
example you might be saying that a
particular security control is adequate
as long as a second security control is
also kept in place there are two
security controls in our hypothetical
situation let's say a firewall and an
intrusion detection system in your
opinion the firewall is good enough it
meets standard provided the intrusion
detection
system is operating normally because it
can make up for whatever the firewall
lacks now that's just a hypothetical if
you have any reservations or
qualifications to your conclusions or
recommendations at all
make sure you clearly state them in your
report now you can take these finding
and conclusions and organize them in a
variety of ways one way to do that is to
group them by materiality in other words
what is this relevant to how material is
this specific conclusion or finding or
you might group them by attended
recipient you always want to mention the
specific false and constructive
construct Corrections but you want to do
it in a non-threatening way yes you have
constructive Corrections yes there were
faults but you want to phrase it in such
a way as to ensure that the IT staff
doesn't feel like they're under attack
you must have evidence to support your
results and in many cases this will be
many pages of detailed data so it's
commonplace to put those in a separate
appendix you of course have to have your
overall findings conclusion and opinion
and absolutely this has to be signed and
dated make sure you keep in mind and you
go over again and again appropriate
communication techniques now the test
will ask you something about these and
about reporting but there's a limit to
how much the test can cover in a written
test regarding listening and verbal
communication skills if you feel you
have any lack in any of these areas it's
worth your time to take a class in
appropriate listening conflict
resolution or business communication
this concludes knowledge statement 1.9 C
is a knowledge statement 1.10
knowledge of audit quality
systems and frameworks
this lesson is the beginning of our
discussion of audit quality we will
revisit that issue in subsequent lessons
and it will be met again and again
throughout the course this one will be
just an introduction here
remember that auditing standards are the
minimum parameters or minimum
requirements to be taken into account of
when performing an audit and keep that
term minimum in mind it's always
appropriate to exceed these standards
but audit standards give you a minimum
level that you must achieve it's
important for any information systems
auditor to understand the impact of the
information systems environment on
traditional auditing practices and
techniques this is to ensure that audit
objectives are achieved
put another way there are a number of
auditing techniques and practices some
of which have been borrowed from other
domains outside of information systems
you need to know your specific
information system environment that
you're working with and how it might
impact your practices and techniques
control self assessments this is going
to be a major part of this particular
lesson in this process the auditor is
basically acting as a facilitator
facilitating the business process owners
in assisting them in defining and
assessing appropriate controls now the
is auditor doesn't actually conduct the
control self-assessment the process
owner does the auditor helps them to
take into account the risk appetite of
the organization and how that control
fits into the overall organizational
strategy this is done because process
owners are often in the best place to
define appropriate controls because they
have an intimate knowledge of that
process consider controls designed to
protect your database who understands
those needs better than the database
administrator
however the IRS auditor can help that
process owner in our scenario a database
administrator understand the needs for
controls based on business risk what is
the business appetite for risk what are
other controls in place outside the
database domain that might impact it
there are a lot of broad
factors the is auditor can assist with
so the main areas we're going to
look at under this knowledge statement
or we're going to start looking at audit
programs and methodologies we'll revisit
that again in more detail in later
lessons we're going to take a look at
audit objectives we're also going to
start our evaluation of audit strengths
and weaknesses the major focus of this
lesson is control self assessments now
let's stop right there what does the
control self-assessment have to do with
Quality Assurance well let's assume this
organization in question does a full
audit every year that may be inadequate
control self assessments allow business
process owners to evaluate specific
controls within their domain of
influence and to assure compliance with
various standards at any point during
the year they can do a quarterly monthly
or as needed that's always going to
impact positively the quality of your
audit we're going to look at objectives
advantages and disadvantages of the
control self-assessment we're going to
examine the auditors role in a CSA and
we'll talk about using the services of
other auditors and experts we'll also
look at the traditional vs. CSA approach
now before we move on let's discuss
using the services of other auditors and
experts this is a relatively brief but
important subsection of this knowledge
statement first of all we might rely on
other auditors particularly if an
auditor came in and recently did an
audit of a specific system let's assume
you're doing a general audit of an
enterprise but just last month they had
a PCI compliance on it it's probably not
cost-effective for you to repeat the
same things that we're done in the PCI
compliance on it so you might include by
reference that on it in your audit
report and use the conclusions of that
audit to help you conduct your own on it
now obviously there's always a concern
that you're relying on the product of
another auditor depending on the scope
and the level of reliance this doesn't
need to be too great a concern normally
you do this when a very specific audit
was recently done for a specific purpose
and your only real
a little bit on that auditors results
you also may frequently need to rely on
experts let's assume in the process of
your auditing you have to check
compliance on a web server the web
server is a Linux based server running
Apache you are strictly a Windows person
you know nothing about Linux or Apache
other than the names it's probably
inappropriate for you to audit that
system without some assistance from
someone more knowledgeable in Linux and
Apache this is a frequent thing in
audits you cannot know everything so
from time to time you're going to have
to rely on an expert in a specific
technology field
now let's start looking at si si this is
a methodology used to review key
business objectives let's start with
that si si s are limited we have a
specific business objective in mind we
have risks only those associated with
that specific objective and only those
internal controls designed to mitigate
those specific risks
now the si si takes that very narrow
view and gives us a formal documented
process to collaborate on assessing that
specific control think for a moment
about the name control self-assessment
we're going to look at a specific
control or at most a grouping of very
closely related controls we're going to
assess the efficacy of those controls as
compared to some standard and this is
going to be a self-assessment it's going
to be conducted by the process owner
that owns those controls this can be a
management technique used to assure
stakeholders customers and any other
relevant party that the internal control
systems are reliable it's helpful in
between audits if you do an annual audit
you may wish to quarterly monthly or as
needed do a quick CSA it can also be
used to recheck very specific critical
processes because it's a self-assessment
it ensures employees are aware of
business risk and that they're
conducting periodic proactive reviews of
controls the term proactive is critical
we would like these to be done on a
periodic basis not only done in response
to an incident let's not wait till
something negative is occurred that
indicates some gap in our controls
let's proactively evaluate let's not
even wait for the annual review if we
have a concern let's conduct a CSA and
evaluate the concerned controls now now
CSA and can involve any number of tools
or techniques on a continuum of
sophistication could be as simple as a
questionnaire could be a facilitated
workshop involving tools techniques and
these the simple questionnaire let me
give you an example of that
perhaps you're doing a control
self-assessment on a policy that's meant
to control some issue a simple
questionnaire sent to relevant employees
can help you ascertain whether or not
the policy is being applied or not in a
facilitated workshop a little more time
is required because individuals related
to the group of controls or the specific
control in question get together the
process is usually facilitated by an is
auditor but still the process owners
work together through this workshop to
do a control self-assessment
what are the objectives of a CSA well
let's start with leveraging the internal
audit function we should have some level
of internal audit functionality even if
we periodically routinely do extensive
external audits with the CSA we're
taking some of that internal audit
function and shifting some of the
control monitoring responsibilities out
to the functional areas this does two
things it distributes the workload more
evenly but it also gets the line
managers who are directly working with
the processes and systems and questions
directly in charge of monitoring the
controls within their sphere of
influence this can also be used to
educate management on control design and
monitoring now the Cobra standard
provides some guidance on the
development of a CSA let's take a brief
look at covent first and foremost you
should know that COBIT was designed and
developed by aisaka given that the cisa
exam is also designed and developed by
osaka it should come as no surprise to
you to expect a great many COBIT
questions on the exam what we're doing
in this particular lesson is introducing
you to Co but you're going to see much
more in depth details on Co but as we go
throughout this course COBIT is an
acronym for control objectives for
information and related technology ISACA
first released the standard in 1996 it's
been revised several times in 2005 it
became an international standards
organization standard called ISO 1 7 7 9
9 2005 the current version as of this
video was published in 2012 and its
COBIT 5 there are 130 for detailed
information security controls based on
11 areas now you're not going to have to
memorize all 134 information security
controls but you will need to have a
general understanding of COBIT and I
would suggest beginning by memorizing
these specific facts you see on the
screen now
first and foremost you should
COBIT was designed and developed by ice
hacker given that the sea is a exam is
also designed and developed by Osaka it
should come as no surprise to you to
expect a great many COBIT questions on
the exam what we're doing in this
particular lesson is introducing you to
Co but you're going to see much more in
depth details on Co but as we go
throughout this course COBIT is an
acronym for control objectives for
information and related technology ISACA
first released the standard in 1996 it's
been revised several times in 2005 it
became an international standards
organization standard called ISO 1 7 7 9
9 2005 the current version as of this
video was published in 2012 and it's
cove at 5 there are 130 for detailed
information security controls based on
11 areas now you're not going to have to
memorize all 134 information security
controls but you will need to have a
general understanding of COBIT and I
would suggest beginning by memorizing
these specific facts you see on the
screen now
you
now as an auditor you might be a little
suspicious of the control
self-assessment isn't an external
auditor more objective well usually they
are they're also more experienced at
auditing so what are our advantages of a
CSA put another way why do people do
them early detection of risk may be the
most important comprehensive audits can
be very effective but due to their
resource and sense of nature they don't
happen quickly enough you're lucky if
they happen once a year sometimes not
even that often a CSA can be conducted
much more frequently providing early
detection of risk as opposed to waiting
for the next full audit this will lead
to more effective and improved internal
controls because the process owners that
understand those processes and controls
better than almost anyone else are the
ones assessing their controls their
better position to give feedback and
perhaps recommend changes this gets
employees involved in the auditing
process which creates a more cohesive
team the employees and the auditors are
working closely together the employees
now have a sense of ownership of the
controls they are directly auditing or
at least assessing their own controls
and they feel more part of the process
because in between major audits you're
doing CSAs you're finding and either
correcting problems or perhaps
establishing and confirming the controls
are effective in between the audits this
is going to improve your audit rating
process and it's going to reduce control
cost we don't wait until an incident has
occurred and we don't wait till an
extensive audit to identify any control
deficiencies we can do that at any time
via CSA this is also going to cause an
increase communication between
operations and top management because
the operations personnel conducting the
CSA will have to be discussing the
results with upper management this can
lead to highly motivated employees since
they're involved directly in their own
control assessment
they have much more mistake in it
they're much more motivated much more
engaged this also provides assurance to
both customers and other stakeholders
that you are routinely checking critical
controls and that's a point we haven't
discussed deeply enough yet how do you
pick the target of a CSA you don't just
check any system because although a CSA
is quicker and easier than it actually
ought it it still does take some time
and resources the way you select the
target for a CSA are those systems are
those controls you have the most concern
over based on prior risk analysis
there are some disadvantages some people
may think well for doing these CSAs do
we really need a full audit well a CSA
is not our replacement for audit
obviously the people doing the CSA are
going to perceive this as additional
workload they may already be taxed to
the limit of their capabilities if the
employees take the time to be fully
engaged fully motivated conduct the
self-assessment come up with improvement
suggestions and they're ignored that can
be damaging to employee morale they can
begin to view their self assessments as
a simple wasteful exercise and become
less engaged and they'll become less
effective inadequate motivation will
limit the effectiveness and discovery of
weak controls if the people doing the
self-assessment are not motivated to do
it or not totally engaged then it will
be uneffective now remember in a CSA the
auditor is not conducting the assessment
the process owner is so what is the
auditors role in CSA as a control
professional and assessment facilitator
basically the management staff and the
process owners are doing the CSA now the
auditor all you can do is provide expert
consulting and to facilitate assessments
as needed answer questions recommend
tools or techniques that sort of thing
so let's look at the CS
in traditional approach in a traditional
audit approach tasks are assigned as
some of those extent tasks may be
assigned to employees in the
organization most will be done by the
audit staff in a CSA the employees
themselves are empowered but they're
also accountable for the results
traditional audits are driven by policy
requirements period CSAs are a
continuous improvement learning curve
you do them whenever it's necessary you
learn and you improve with the
traditional audit there is very limited
employee participation with the CSA
there's extensive participation and
training that is probably the most
obvious difference between a CSA and an
audit in a traditional audit there's
limited stakeholder focus the
stakeholders are simply initiating the
audit and the CSA there's more broad
stakeholder focus the traditional audit
is done by auditors and other
specialists the CSA is conducted by
staff at all levels anyone who is
directly related to the business process
or the controls that business process
can be involved in a CSA this concludes
knowledge statement one point ten
seize the knowledge statement 1.11
knowledge of various types of audit
internal external financial etc and
methods for assessing and placing
reliance in the work of other auditors
or control entities
within the scope of this knowledge
we're going to examine the nuance
differences between internal and
external audits when one of the other is
appropriate and the weaknesses and
strengths we're also going to take a
look at specific domain audits a
financial audit a PCI compliance audit
audits that have a very narrow scope
we're also going to look at criteria for
relying on the work product of other
auditors
now we've looked at the strengths and
weaknesses when our good times to use an
internal audit first of all is a pre
audit if you have an external audit that
could have severe repercussions if you
fail it such as regulatory compliance
audits legal compliance audits you might
wish to do a pre audit several weeks in
advance
so you have an opportunity to identify
and correct issues before the formal
audit you may wish to check periodically
to ensure that you're in compliance with
various regulations laws and industry
norms if there's been an incident such
as a cyber breach or virus outbreak it's
often a good idea to do at least a
limited post incident audit that allows
you to identify the extent of the breach
or problem or incident and to look and
see if there are other vulnerabilities
that could lead to a repetition of the
same incident if you have specific
processes or systems that are often
targeted those might require internal
audit what about external audits what
are their strengths and weaknesses the
first obvious strength is they're
totally unbiased another strength is
presumably these are audit professionals
their primary job function is to conduct
audits they've learned a lot from all of
the other audits of other organizations
they've conducted things that your
internal team could not possibly know
due to their limited exposure the
weaknesses of an external audit our
first and foremost cost it's expensive
it costs a lot to bring in external
firms or teams to audit your systems
it's also not as easy to schedule these
audit teams are always conducting audits
all over the country or world you may
have difficulty scheduling it exactly
when you need they're often used to
absolutely ensure you're in compliance
many industry standards many legal
requirements require that you have an
external audit so do many regulatory
requirements they insist that they
oughta be done externally also a general
overall auditor of your system from an
unbiased professional auditor
can be an excellent way to check to see
if your system is actually in compliance
it's not a case of whether you should
use internal or external you should
actually use both it's a case of when to
use one or the other
specific domain audits you might have a
financial audit you're looking at those
systems directly involved in financial
transactions there are sometimes
regulatory audits if you're in a
business that does banking or healthcare
you have specific regulations and you
must have audits to see if you're in
compliance with those regulations if you
process credit card payments the payment
card industry data security standards
require periodic PCI audits so you have
to have an audit and the sole goal of
that audit is to determine whether or
not you're in compliance with the PCI
data security standards you might have
specific IT audits for example you may
wish to audit just the web and
e-commerce systems or maybe just the
database systems or just network
infrastructure any item that requires
attention outside of that of a general
audit there are lots of occasions where
you might do a specific domain audit the
last category looked at IT specific you
might do a risk analysis and determine
which of your systems is most vulnerable
and periodically do an internal domain
specific audit for that specific system
there are occasions when you need to
rely on other auditors work it's always
a good idea to look at previous audits
if their reports exist that will allow
you to see if the items listed for a
remediation and those audits have since
been addressed it will let you see if
there's been a persistent problem that's
existed throughout many audit periods it
will allow you to compare and contrast
what you find with what past auditors
are found it may be the case that you
need to incorporate other audits into
your audit report for example if two
months ago there is a PCI audit or an
internal database specific audit rather
than repeat those audit processes and
steps you might wish to incorporate them
within your own audit that's usually
more cost effective now one of the
things you want to look out for is
ensuring that you're not incorporating
or relying on a past audit or other
audit that wasn't appropriately done any
experienced auditors should be able to
review an audit report and determine if
it was appropriate complete and reliable
you do that by looking at the evidence
presented take a close look not just at
the other auditors conclusions but the
evidence he or she used to base those
conclusions
there are several factors to be
considered in any audit whether its
internal or external domain-specific it
doesn't matter what is the audit subject
what's the area to be audited this seems
to be quite specific you can't say I
just want to audit all my systems what
specific things are going to be checked
this will often be a detailed inventory
of the systems and processes to be
audited what are your objectives now
this is normally not a single objective
it's a list of sub objectives and in
some cases that can go many levels deep
you might have sub objectives to sub
objectives to sub objectives for example
your goal is to preserve the integrity
of financial transactions that's a high
end high level objective beneath that
since you do e-commerce you want to
ensure the security of your web server
and the integrity of web base
transactions beneath that you want to
specifically test to see if your
ecommerce site is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting so you can see how
we have sub objectives audit scope is
also important what are the constraints
to audit the specific system function
unit or period of time in other words
you've been given a scope that may limit
the time period of the audit what
systems you're going on it how much you
can audit how disruptive your audit can
be all of these are issues that should
be taken into account when conducting
any audit this concludes knowledge
statement 1.11
we're going to talk about some examples
for domain one and we'll talk about
these for all the domains do keep in
mind that I'm not saying that this is
all you need to know for this domain I'm
saying these are points that are so key
that if you don't know them you have no
chance of passing the test so I'm going
to read some of these I won't read every
single one of them because you can read
them yourself
but some bear a little comment the
auditor is a facilitator and a control
self-assessment that's listed first
because it's an important point to keep
in mind and you'll definitely be asked
about it control self assessment
enhances audit responsibility in other
words individuals are basically checking
their own controls now these are two
different points about the control
self-assessment you should expect to see
quite a few number four is one of my
favorite if you don't have
authentication and identification as
part of your access control you just
don't have accountability at all
responsibility and accountability can be
established by use of audit trails
that's point number eight very important
to keep in mind that the whole point of
an audit is checking for responsibility
and accountability now again it's not
important that I read these to you
you're certainly capable of reading I am
simply pointing out a few key ones that
are of most importance identifying those
high risk areas should be one of the
first things to look at when you're
going to start auditing and monitoring
because those the areas you need to
audit now this next few points are all
talking about risk and risk based
auditing is an important part of the
season and you should expect to see
questions about it knowing about risks
such as inherent risk known threats and
their impact things like that are very
important for the CC exam detection of
risk can be minimized by use of
statistical sampling what we mean is the
work you put into detecting risk not the
actual detection so statistically
sampling things allows you to take risk
without having to look at each and
everything the
just a few pointers really make sure you
know all of the major concepts of domain
1
you
now you've completed domain one let's
summarize what we covered in domain one
we outline the framework for performing
an is on it we look specifically at
mandatory requirements what an is
auditors mission is what they actually
do what the best practices are to have
an effective is audit and the basic
process of auditing this is a
fundamental lesson that gets you
comfortable with the basic process of
auditing this will form the basis in the
foundation for the additional lessons
we'll cover in the other four domains
this concludes domain one
