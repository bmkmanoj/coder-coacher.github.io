management and the theories that
underlie their use fundamentals of
commodity markets welcome to the 34th
session in the preparation for frm part
1 exam in the previous session you have
learned the basics of commodity markets
in this session we will go on to more
detail and introduce the pricing
principles based on a no arbitrage model
this will be your last session on
commodities and by the end of this
session you will be able to price
commodity forwards based on the spot
price convenience yield lease rate and
the storage costs the basic concepts of
hedging will also be discussed agenda
the main agenda of our discussion will
be to determine the price relationships
between the commodities forwards will
begin with a brief discussion about
forward curves and synthetic commodities
the pricing is based on the same Arbor
church free valuation model introduced
in previous sessions when we discussed
stock futures we will learn to price
commodity for words considering the
lease rate the storage costs and the
convenience yield we will also introduce
you to commodity spreads and hedging we
will again encounter the similar basis
risk which was introduced in the

commodity forward a commodity usually
has many forwards trading in the market
each with a different maturity for
example rice futures might trade at
twenty three point four dollars over
bushel expiring in a month or twenty
four point five dollars over bushel
expiring in two months or twenty five
point two dollars over bushel expiring
in three months a set of forward prices
is called a forward scrip and the curve
showing different forward prices for
different maturities is called a forward
curve instead of purchasing a commodity
one can construct a synthetic commodity
by purchasing a commodity forward and
zero coupon bond that pays the forward
price at maturity deducing from the are
British free concept the present value
of the forward price should be equal to
the present value of the expected spot
price the mathematical expression for
this equilibrium is given in the slide
