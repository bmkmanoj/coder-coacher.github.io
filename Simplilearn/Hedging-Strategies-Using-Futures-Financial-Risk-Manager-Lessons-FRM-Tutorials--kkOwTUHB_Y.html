future markets including the settlement
and delivery procedures in this session
we will learn the basic concepts of
hedging the term hedging means
protection from uncertainty for example
a trader ensuring his shipment is
hedging himself against loss due to
unforeseen events such as a theft etc we
will learn how futures can be used to
hedge a position and reduce risk
let us begin our discussion agenda the
main agenda of our discussion will be
learning the various concepts used in
hedging with futures contracts in this
session we'll begin by learning the
basic concepts and types of hedging we
will then introduce the concepts of
basic risk which arises due to a
mismatch between an underlying price and
its futures contracts we will learn how
to quantify the number of contracts for
an effective hedge we will use this
concept of hedging for adjusting the
systematic risk of a portfolio finally
we will end the session by briefly
discussing about rolling a hedge hedging
basics in financial markets any trader
can be in a long or a short position in
a long position the trader has a
requirement to sell any asset on the
future date while in a short position
the trader needs to purchase the asset
on a future date for example a farmer
who has yet to harvest his crops is in a
long position as he will need to sell
the crops on a few
date when the harvesting is complete
there is always uncertainty associated
with future dates and traders usually
hedge their uncertain positions through
purchasing or selling futures contracts
in a short position traders enter into
long hedge by buying futures contracts
this is done to protect them against
chances of rising prices for example an
oil company buys crude oil futures to
hedge against rising prices in a long
position traders enter into a shorter
hedge by shorting futures contracts this
is done to protect them against the
chances of a decline in prices for
example a farmer sells rice futures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
