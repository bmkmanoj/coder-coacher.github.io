day-to-day professional life so let's
get ready to start learning unit 1 which
is the introduction to service
management life cycle introduction to
service management life cycle this is
the first learning unit of the course
here we will introduce what is ITIL the
structure of the library in the latest
version of ITIL otherwise known as 2011
the ITIL qualification scheme and the
exam format also in this learning unit
we will introduce you to the concept of
IT Service Management and the basics of
processes functions and roles we will
also introduce how ITIL 2011 defines the
service life cycle and what each of the
phase of this lifecycle looks like this
learning unit is broken into three
lessons or chapters with each lesson
clearly stating the learning
outcomes expected at the end of the
lesson make sure that you get it right
before you move on to the next chapter
now let's look at what is IT Service
Management IT Service Management could
be described as managing IT in a way
that is recognized as a key contributor
to the business objectives of an
organization how does that happen is
what will get introduced to in this
course and what has ITIL got to do with
IT Service Management ITIL provides the
structure or the framework on how to
make IT a valued contributor in an
organization so if you know and follow
ITIL you as an IT person can contribute
to your organization achieving its goals
in better and efficient way let's start
at the beginning by understanding what
is ITIL the objective of our first
lesson in the next slide the learning
outcomes or lesson objectives of this
lesson are to understand what is ITIL
what is a service lifecycle how is the
latest ITIL version structured what is
the scope and components of the ITIL
Service lifecycle and different
interfaces across the lifecycle
this lesson will also introduce you to
the ITIL qualification scheme which is
aimed at increasing your expertise
across the service management lifecycle
and the different paths you can take to
progress your journey towards the
expertise in service management
we have used this term ITIL a lot by now
but what is ITIL and what's the added
value for any organization adopting ITIL
ITIL is an abbreviation for information
technology infrastructure library a
library because it is a set of books
focusing on the area of service
management for the IT industry with
guidance captured from practicing IT
professionals so what is service
management for the IT industry we just
explained that on a previous slide if
you are still not clear no problem
this concept is explained again later in
this learning unit in detail to give
some background ITIL was published
between 1989 and 1995 by Her Majesty's
stationery office or in short HMS owned
in the UK on the behalf of the central
communications and telecommunications
agency also known as CCTA
which is now a part of the office of
government Commerce or the OGC
in short its early use was principally
confined to the UK and Netherlands a
second version of ITIL was published as
a set of revised books between 2000 and
2004 in 2007 ITIL version 2 was
superseded by an enhanced and
consolidated third version of ITIL
consisting of five core books covering
the service lifecycle and in July 2011
the third version of ITIL upgraded to
ITIL 2011 with some changes in the
processes which consists of the same
five core books ITIL is not a
theoretical view of how to manage IT
services it is a documented practice it
is easily adapted to irrespective of the
organized
in size or complexity it emphasizes
quality management approach and
standards supports quality systems such
as ISO 9000 and is guided by total
quality frameworks such as European
framework for quality management or e
fqm in short and the Malcolm Baldrige
National Quality Award or the MB n QA in
short since the time of the introduction
of version 2 ITIL has become a worldwide
standard for IT Service Management this
is reflected not only in the large
number of people following ITIL training
courses and getting certified but also
in the adaptation of ITIL by the British
Standards Institute this involved the
incorporation of the ideas behind ITIL
in the British Standards Institute
standards bs 15,000 which is now ISO
20000 standard the ITIL goals have been
to provide a consistent yet flexible
best practices framework for IT Service
Management having a standardized
vocabulary and platform-independent
processes
let's now understand what makes up this
ITIL library there are three basic
components first being the ITIL core
which is the best practice guidance
applicable to all types of organizations
who provide services to a business the
core consists of five lifecycle books
and a glossary the second component
being the ITIL complimentary guidance
which are additional books providing
specific guidance based on industry
sectors organization types and so on the
third being the web support services
which represent the information
available from contributors from the
industry and other channels these
together form the basis for developing
and maintaining the lifestyle
whose strategies depicted in the call
volumes this is made available via the
wwii TI l - live - portal comm website
now let's look at what is at the core of
the ITIL 2011 the ITIL call library is
composed of five books or publications
representing each of the service
lifecycle stages the first book on
service strategy focuses on design
development and implementation of
service management so that the IT
services are able to provide value to
business service strategy basically
helps an organization identify what IT
services should be offered and to whom
how do we differentiate ourselves from
competing alternatives how do we create
value for our customers
the second book on service design
provides guidance for the design and the
development of services and processes
covering design principles and methods
for converting objectives of IT
organizations into portfolios of
services and service assets so the
service design basically deals with
design of new and changed services that
an IT organization wants to offer to its
customers the third book on service
transition covers the development and
improvement of capabilities for
transitioning new and change services
into the live production or operating
environment so the service transition
ensures that a new services or a change
to an existing services is properly
tested and deployed into the live
production environment
the fourth book on service operation
takes a look at the different practices
in the management of service operation
and includes guidance on achieving
efficiency and effectiveness in the
delivery and support of services meaning
service operation takes of coordinating
and carrying out day-to-day activities
and processes to deliver and manage IT
services the fifth book on continual
service improvement is focused on
creating and maintaining value for
customers through better design
introduction and operation of services
the aim here is to continually align IT
services to changing business needs by
identifying and implementing
improvements so in other words the aim
is to continuously look for ways to
improve efficient and cost effectiveness
as part of ITIL 2011 foundation course
one learning unit is dedicated to each
one of these ITIL core books so we have
learning unit two on service strategy
learning unit three on service design
and so on knowing about these five books
is our entire syllabus of ITIL 2011
foundation core we now take a look at
their certification levels or otherwise
known as qualification scheme for ITIL
there are four levels within the ITIL
scheme first is foundation level which
focuses on the knowledge or
comprehension to provide a good
grounding in the key concept terminology
and processes of ITIL the foundation
exam carries two credits second is
intermediate level the certification at
this level assesses an individual's
ability to analyze and apply the
concepts of ITIL this level can be
approached only after clearing the
foundation level this is again composed
of two Street
James first is the intermediate
lifecycle stream this consists of five
individual certificates built around the
five cause ITIL books such as service
strategy service design service
transition service operation and
continued service improvement
individuals who would prefer to stay on
the management side of IT can choose the
stream to progress their IT Service
Management knowledge the exams in the
stream carry three credits for each life
cycle second is the intermediate
capability stream this consists of four
individual certificates focusing on
detailed process implementation and
management within cluster groupings
these cluster groups are operational
support and analysis also called OSA in
short planning protection and
optimization also called PP o in short
release control and validation also
called RCV in short and service
offerings and agreements also called
SOA in short these certifications are
meant for individuals who would like to
deepen their knowledge in skill sets in
specific areas of IT Service Management
the exams in this stream carry four
credits in each stream third level
within ITIL scheme is ITIL expert
certification which demonstrates that
the individual has successfully
completed a number of intermediate units
in addition to the mandatory foundation
level and they're managing across a
lifecycle
capstone course which has five credits
this certification requires that the
individual has 22 credits across the
qualification scheme as a mandatory
requirement
the fourth and final level is of the
ITIL master which is a senior level
service management certification which
allows experienced IT service managers
to demonstrate their knowledge of ITIL
and its application in the real world
more information on the above
qualification scheme can be obtained
from the ITIL official website now let's
take a look at the exam format of the
ITIL 2011 foundation exam in the next
slide ITIL 2011 foundation is an online
