can be divided into four sections one
menu bar two toolbar three session
window four worksheet data window now
let's look into each of the sections in
detail the first section is the menu bar
of Minitab where you can open menus and
choose commands all the key menu items
like file edit data calc stat graph
editor tools windows help and assistant
are present here each menu in turn has
many other commands in them which can be
assessed through the menu bar there are
multiple short keys that are also
available within Minitab
to access these commands the toolbar
provides a quick shortcut to issue some
Minitab commands by clicking on toolbar
it performs an action or opens a dialog
box the toolbar displays different tool
buttons depending on which Minitab
window is active session window is the
area that displays the statistical
results of your data analysis and it can
also be used to enter command all
textual non graphical output will appear
in the session window as appropriate
headings will reflect the commands that
you have actually created while the
session window is active click on editor
and then either select or deselect
enable commands worksheet data window
also referred to as data window is a
grid of rows and columns used to enter
and manipulate the data this area looks
like a spreadsheet but will not
automatically update the columns when
entries are changed you can open
multiple worksheets
each in a different data window Minitab
works with data in a worksheet of
columns and rows usually a column
contains the data for one variable with
an observation in each row columns are
denoted by C 1 C 2 C 3 and so on
rows with in columns are numbered 1 2 3
and so on a project will have one data
window for each of its worksheets but
only one worksheet can be active at a
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
