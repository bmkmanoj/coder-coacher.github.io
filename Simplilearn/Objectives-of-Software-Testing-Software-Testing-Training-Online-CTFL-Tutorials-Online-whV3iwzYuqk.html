and importance of testing let us move
ahead and understand what would be the
main objectives of software testing
first and the foremost objectives of any
testing is to find defects thereby
preventing the probability of occurrence
of defects in production and gaining
confidence about the quality of the
software application another objective
is to provide information that helps in
go /no decision-making to next phase
analysis of defects found in one phase
can also help in identifying root causes
of defects and hence also lead to
prevention of defects in the following
phases each type of testing also has its
own specific objective to be met let us
look at different types of testing and
its respective objectives the objective
of development testing also known as
unit testing or component testing will
be to find as many defects as early as
possible fixing these defects at this
stage will save in defect leakage cost
and time user acceptance testing has an
objective of confirming if system works
as expected by the end users of the
system this is the final stage of
testing before we deploy the code to
production maintenance testing objective
is to ensure that no new defects have
been introduced especially in case of
enhancement and/or defects fix
operational testing objective is to
ensure reliability and performance
software should be tested to check
whether it works fine even with maximum
expected workload and will not break
down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
