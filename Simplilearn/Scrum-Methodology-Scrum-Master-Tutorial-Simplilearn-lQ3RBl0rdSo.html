framework that utilizes principles and
practices that assist teams in
delivering working software in short
cycles to the customer enabling rapid
feedback continuous improvement and
quick response to change it promotes
delivering value as in working software
to the customer in an incremental and
iterative way it is not a process or
technique for developing software rather
it is a framework within which various
processes techniques and practices are
employed in scrum the iterations that
deliver working software to the customer
are called sprints in each iteration or
sprint results in potentially shippable
software this slide is a graphical
representation of an agile project using
scrum starting at the left you can see
that the product owner owns the product
backlog and in collaboration with the
team develops the user stories or
requirements for the project the product
backlog is prioritized with the higher
priority items occupying the top of the
product backlog in collaboration with
the product owner the team decides how
to group the user stories into releases
based on the product roadmap once the
release planning has been completed the
user stories are then selected for a
sprint the duration of the sprint is
going to be two to four weeks once the
sprint backlog has been determined the
team then disaggregates each user story
into tasks during each sprint the user
stories are developed as the code is
written it is integrated into the system
and daily scrums are held at the end of
a sprint there is a sprint review where
the working software is demonstrated and
presented to the customer for acceptance
the team then conducts a spring
retrospective during the retrospective
the team looks at primarily three things
what went well what did not go well and
what should be done differently going
forward the team's velocity is then
updated as are the information radiators
which transparently display the status
and progress of the project and then the
cycle repeats itself until the project
is complete a sprint is an iteration in
scrum at the beginning of a project the
scrum team determines the duration of
Sprint's for the project
most Sprint's are going to be two to
four weeks in duration
factors affecting sprint duration
include the stability of the product
backlog once a sprint has begun the
duration is never changed nor are any
user stories added or removed therefore
if many changes are expected a shorter
sprint duration would be best however if
the product backlog is relatively stable
a longer sprint duration may be
appropriate overhead there are overhead
costs associated with each sprint for
example every spent is going to have a
sprint planning meeting a sprint review
and a sprint retrospective if a team has
been able to lower these overhead costs
by automated testing continuous
integration etc these costs can be
absorbed Marlies aliy making shorter
Sprint's more desirable however if these
overhead costs remain high the team may
need to use longer duration sprints a
team may be tempted to extend the
duration of Sprint's in an effort to
hide their inefficiencies remember agile
projects favor shorter duration Sprint's
and it is the scrum masters
responsibility to coach and mentor the
team so it can reduce waste
irregularities and overuse and make the
Sprint shorter the goal of a sprint is
to deliver working software at the
conclusion of each sprint the team
should be able to deliver near
releasable or potentially shippable
software this is not easy especially for
an existing product with a lot of legacy
features but it can be done with the
right technical practices
and mature development processes once
the sprint duration has been determined
and the user stories for the sprint have
been selected the duration of the sprint
cannot be altered nor can any user
stories be added or removed the Sprint
will end at the appointed time
irrespective of whether the team has met
the sprint goals or not this allows for
effective continuous improvement if the
team is unable to deliver the working
software as planned the team will have
to figure out why that happened and then
make changes to improve going forward
the product owner may choose to cancel
or terminate a sprint in specific
situations for example a significant
change in priorities or a mid-course
correction may render the current sprint
backlog invalid given that we are only
talking about a couple of weeks of work
the cancellation of a sprint would be an
extremely rare event a sprint will begin
with a sprint planning meeting and end
with a sprint review and retrospective
there are three backlogs used in scrum
the product backlog the release backlog
and the sprint backlog the product
backlog is the master container of all
the user stories for the project the
product backlog is continually pruned or
prioritized so that maximum value is
delivered to the customer the release
backlog is a subset of the product
backlog releases support the product
roadmap and each release is populated
with user stories necessary for that
release the sprint backlog is a subset
of the release backlog and contains the
user stories to be developed in the
sprint as we said the product backlog
contains the user stories for the entire
project and it is the responsibility of
the product owner user stories are
features functions or requirements that
deliver value to the customer however
the product backlog will also have to
contain technical or non-functional user
stories necessary for the system to work
properly the product backlog may also
include risk or defect related user
stories
the product owner is responsible for
keeping the product backlog current and
up-to-date this is accomplished by
pruning the backlog which is
prioritizing and reprioritizing the
product backlog must also be continually
groomed this is the process of adding
and removing user stories based on the
needs and desires of the customer there
are four scrum ceremonies the sprint
planning meeting the daily scrum the
sprint review and the Sprint
retrospective let's take a detailed look
at each of these ceremonies the sprint
planning meeting is time boxed at two
hours for each week of the sprint
if the Sprint is going to be two weeks
in duration then the time box will be
four hours if the Sprint is going to be
four weeks in duration then the time box
for the sprint planning meeting will be
eight hours it should be attended by the
complete scrum team including all roles
the most important aspects of this
meeting are the team's capacity and the
definition of done there are two
approaches to selecting user stories for
a sprint one is based on the velocity of
the team the other is commitment driven
team buy-in is critical and the goals of
the sprint should be clearly understood
and the desired outcome should be
clearly articulated with the definition
of done then there's the daily scrum the
time box for the daily scrum is 15
minutes regardless of the duration of
the sprint length the entire scrum team
including all roles should attend the
daily scrum each development team member
individually answers three questions
what did i do yesterday what am i going
through today
and what are my impediments this is how
the team members coordinate their work
and the scrum master learns of the
impediments he or she should be taking
care of the Sprint review takes place at
the end of the Sprint and is time boxed
at one hour for each week of the Sprint
so if the Sprint were four weeks in
duration the Sprint review
meeting would be four hours it should be
attended by the complete scrum team
including all roles plus any other
stakeholders who are interested in
project success the purpose of the
review is to demonstrate working
software and obtain and assess feedback
feedback may range from full acceptance
of the completed software to complete
rejection the Sprint retrospective takes
place after the conclusion of the Sprint
review and is time boxed at 45 minutes
for each week of the sprint so if the
Sprint has two weeks in duration then
the retrospective would be one and a
half hours in length it should be
attended by the complete scrum team
including all roles however the product
owners attendance is considered optional
during the retrospective the team
answers for questions what worked well
what did not work well what should be
done differently and what still puzzles
us one or several problem detection
techniques may be used in the
retrospective and this ceremony is a
vital part of continuous improvement at
the conclusion of the retrospective the
teams velocity and the projects
information radiators are updated then
the next sprint planning meeting takes
place and this cycle continues until the
project is complete the definition of
done is an important artifact for a
scrum team it is the primary reporting
mechanism for team members and there may
be a different definition of done at
various levels definition of done for a
feature or user story the definition of
done for a sprint and the definition of
done for a release it's really just a
checklist of activities that add
verifiable and demonstrable value to the
product it's created by the scrum master
in consultation with the team a sample
list of the items for the definition of
done criteria is given here
the story is fully implemented or code
completed as described automated unit
tests have been developed with at least
80% code coverage automated unit tests
and acceptance tests in the story are
passing high priority test cases have
been automated and added to the
regression suite note this is only meant
to be an example each team's definition
have done will vary slightly depending
on the maturity of the team and the
specific situation of the team hi there
