introduction hello and welcome to the
lesson on valuation modeling of the
financial course by simply learn this
lesson is about valuation modeling
valuation modeling is the study of the
basic elements used for financial
modeling and financial analysis it is an
introductory path to business valuation
models and advanced models based on
sophisticated projections in
probabilistic environments the
presentation we will go over today
should give you a broad overview of the
important aspects of valuation modeling
with some concrete practical examples
now let's move on to our agenda
understanding integrated financial
models we will start our presentation
with the discussion on basic valuation
techniques there are three types of
primary sources that we can use when
trying to give a value to a business the
first source is the past financial
performance this means for example the
revenues from sales in the recent years
the level of profit when related to
sales the capacity to serve debt
interest and so on the second source of
information is the current structure of
the company's balance sheet this informs
us of the key financial ratios that can
provide a quick diagnosis on the
company's financial health finally the
current structure of the cash flows
enables us to relate the value of the
business to how it is expected to
continue during its business let's now
move on to the next slide and analyze
each aspect in more detail
let's look in more detail at the
analysis of past financial performance
the main aspects we're interested in
when looking at the history of a
business are the following profitability
solvency leverage turnover level and
cash flows profitability tells us
whether a company has been generating
profit historically a company that
generates profit is other things being
equal more valuable than a company that
is not equity holders expect a return on
their investment and will pay more for a
company that provides them with a good
return on capital profitability is a key
concept in company valuation because
everything is driven by profit profit is
the number one reason why a company was
created in the first place to try and
create profit we're not saying that
profit seeking is the only driving force
between companies and the people
creating companies but every business is
trying to create profit when a business
does not produce profit which means that
it loses money
one can infer that something is wrong
even if it is only temporary bad
economic climate the absence of profit
makes companies less attractive and
therefore less valuable let us go to our
next slide where we continue to explore
the main aspects of relevance in past
performance
so 1z is our next topic so woodsy
related to the capacity of a business to
endure tough environment a solvent
company usually holds enough capital to
be able to suffer some losses or a
severe reduction in its net asset value
called
nav so the concept of solvency is very
close to the concept of strength or
resilience it is a capacity of a company
to absorb unpredicted shocks and
difficult situations leverage which is
the ratio between the assets value and
the equity value is the next aspect that
we want to look at when analyzing past
performance leverage relates to the
relative scale of equity compared to
liabilities it can also be looked at in
terms of the ratio between assets and
liabilities given the fundamental
accounting principle that assets equal
liabilities plus equity here is a simple
example to understand the role of
leverage assume we create a company
today with a capital of 1 pound and
borrow 99 pounds from a bank assuming
the bank will accept we will therefore
have 100 pounds worth of cash that we
can invest in various assets here the
risk of default of our company will not
be the result of the large leverage but
the result of how we decide to invest
this cash if we buy risky assets and
create the risk that we may not be able
to pay debt interest then we have
created a solvency problem if we invest
the 100 pounds into a risk-free bond
paying 10% whereas our interest on debt
is only 5% then our company bears
virtually no risk despite having a 100
to 1 leverage ratio let's continue our
discussion on the next slide
turnover level is a next aspect that we
want to investigate in relation to past
financial performance despite being very
useful the turnover level is a very
misleading piece of information on the
fundamental level a large turnover is
good as it means the company is selling
yes selling is not everything because
selling is somewhat pointless if no
profit is generated anybody can do that
indeed what we need to understand is
that turnover levels in isolation are
not a good measure of profitability the
turnover is a measure of activity cash
flow is a last aspect of historical
performance that is of interest cash
flow management is a very important part
of company's life because money flows in
and out on a regular basis and a company
must adopt a cash flow management
strategy that allows financial stability
and safety while not being overly safe
in order to allow some cash to be
redirected to business growth as opposed
to making the business more secure
financially balanced activity level and
financial safety is an art let's now
move on to our next slide where we
discuss a new topic
the value of a company has two main
aspects the first aspect is the proven
track-record sum which can be measured
by looking at the historical performance
as we saw in the previous slide the
second aspect of value is potential if
we were to group companies into two
different categories the first group
would be companies with established
mature business and proven track-record
or stable profit but limited growth and
in the second group we would have
companies that do not make a profit yet
but have a large potential value is an
immediate component related to existing
profitability as well as a company
relating to potential potential is a lot
of different things put together but
mostly it is the possibility for a
company to transform customers into
profit through the telecom age in the
late 90s and early 2000s we saw this new
business model of companies with large
amounts of debt used to create massive
client space to create massive client
bases before any profit was generated
most of the value given to these
companies was the result of their
potential to turn this large client
basis into profit let's try to compare
those two aspects of value immediate
profitability is relatively easy to
measure compared to potential when a
business generates profit there is data
to use an extrapolate past profit
patterns into the future and try to
infer what the corresponding present
value of the future profits is unlike
proven profitability potential is vague
and difficult to measure assume that a
company provides a huge number of
clients with free phones and monthly
phone subscriptions how do we measure
the potential profit that could result
from the company's ability to conceive
people to start paying for the service
this is tricky and any valuation would
only be a model relying on several
assumptions
business with potential only our
businesses investing money in the hope
that the investment in research
marketing etc will generate profits
sometime in the future enough profit to
make the risk worthwhile it is important
to understand that materializing profit
potential is difficult and requires
companies to rely on debt and private
investment those important levels of
risk can end up sinking a business when
the potential fails to be materialized
one measure followed by analysts and
relating to our discussion about
potential versus immediate profit is the
price earning ratio PE or sometimes
called PE AR it is the ratio of stock
market value to the annual earnings per
share if the stock market price is $100
and the annual earnings per share is $2
then the PE is $100 divided by two
dollars which is equal to 50 the PE
provides with a measure of how expensive
a company is for companies making very
little profit or even a loss the PE can
reach either very large numbers or worse
negative values showing that the profit
is a loss this is what we say during the
early 2000s with many telecom companies
let's move on to our next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
