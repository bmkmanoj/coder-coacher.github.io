waterfall model is the most common model
of all software development lifecycle
models it is very simple to understand
and use in a waterfall model each phase
must be completed before the next phase
can start at the end of each phase a
review takes place to determine if the
project is on the right path and whether
or not the project should be continued
here phases do not overlap with each
other
Waterfall model is a sequential design
process in which progress is seen as
flowing steadily downwards through
conception initiation analysis design
construction testing production stroke
implementation and maintenance phases
let us go over each phase to understand
the waterfall model in more detail
system conceptualization refers to the
consideration of all aspects of the
business with the goal of determining
how each of these aspects relates to
each other and which aspects will be
considered in the software development
in this stage the overall vision and
need of the system is identified and
high-level objectives are determined the
purpose of the initiation phase is to
conduct an initial high-level
investigation of the business need and
come up with a recommendation for the
solution in this phase the sponsorship
commitments are secured budgets
timelines are finalized and objectives
for each phase developed and signed off
the core team for the project including
the project manager is also identified
here analysis refers to the gathering of
system requirements with the goals of
determining how these requirements will
be accommodated in the system extensive
communication between the customer and
the technical team is essential to
understand the possibility of
implementing the require
into the software the signing is about
identifying the details of how the
system will be developed to perform
necessary tasks to meet the user
requirements
more specifically the system design
phase focus will be on what information
will be processed in the system
how will the software be constructed and
how will the system look like what
standards will be followed and so on
construction is also referred as
programming or development stage this
involves the creation of the system
software requirements and system
specifications from the design phase are
translated into machine readable
computer code in the construction phase
testing is performed to ensure that the
software created and added to the
developing software is working correctly
and efficiently testing generally
focuses on two areas internal efficiency
and external effectiveness the goal of
external effectiveness testing is to
verify that the software is functioning
according to the system design and that
it is performing all necessary functions
or sub functions the goal of internal
testing is to make sure that the
computer code is efficient standardized
after successfully completing the
testing phase the software will be made
available for real-time use after it has
been implemented on the production site
this is where the actual users will be
using the system maintenance and
management is a last phase and is needed
to ensure that the system will continue
to perform as desired in summary the
waterfall model is meant to function in
a systematic way that takes a production
of the software on the basic step going
downwards towards detailing like a
waterfall which begins at the top of the
cliff
and goes downwards but not backwards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
