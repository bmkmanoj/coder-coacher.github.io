management training by simply learn
before we proceed let us recap what we
have learned in the previous lessons
lesson one gave us an introduction about
lean lesson two was a study of types of
waste lesson three discussed about
various tools used in lean lesson for
detailed about lean in manufacture while
lesson five talked about lean in service
and lesson 6 talked about lean in the
office this is lesson number seven and
here we will talk in detail about lean
metrics the next slide we'll start with
the agenda of what we are going to cover
in this lesson and then cover in detail
lean metrics
here is the agenda we will start with an
overview of lean metrics covering why we
need metrics and how to build one after
the overview will cover oee called as
overall equipment effectiveness which
evaluates and indicates how effectively
a manufacturing operation is utilized
then we will cover the metrics fpy first
pass yield this measures ratio of output
versus input and rty rolled throughput
yield is the probability of the entire
process producing zero defects the next
metrics days in inventory measures the
average number of days the company holds
its inventory before selling it other
critical metrics are scheduled adherence
attainment and lean accounting in the
next slide we will start with an
overview of lean metrics
in their section we will cover an
overview of lean metrics it seems too
often to be the case that as the
manufacturing operation grows the
measurement of the efficiency of
performance becomes even harder when
sales orders go up work in progress
increases when inventory builds
turnaround diminishes all to the
detriment of grasping how efficient or
profitable each process is some
assessment of financial behavioral and
cool process performances should be made
on an ongoing basis to provide mutually
supporting testimony to the total
continuous improvement efforts of the
company for this reason lean metrics
have been established to allow a company
to measure evaluate and respond to their
performance in such a way that it does
not sacrifice quality to satisfy
quantity objectives or increase
inventory levels to achieve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
