considerations apply in respect of the
way in which the release is deployed the
most frequently occurring option for the
rollouts of releases are BIGBANG versus
phased push and pull automated or manual
big bang approach means the new or
change service is deployed to all user
areas in one operation this will often
be used when introducing an application
change and consistency of service across
the organization is considered important
the negative aspect of the big bang
approach is that it increases the risk
and impact of a failed of release phased
approach means the service is deployed
to a part of the user based initially
and then this operation is repeated for
subsequent parts of the user faced by a
scheduled rollout plan this will be the
cause of many scenarios such as in
retail organizations for new services
being introduced into the stores
environment in manageable phases the
push approach is used when the service
component is deployed from the center
and pushed out to the target locations
in terms of service deployment
delivering updated service components to
all users either in Big Bang or phased
form is using the push approach since
the new or change service is delivered
into the users environment at a time not
of their choosing the pull approach is
used for software releases where the
software is made available in a central
location but users are free to pull the
software down to their own location at a
time of their choosing or when a
workstation restart automated means that
we use technology to automate releases
this helps to ensure repeatability and
consistency the time required to provide
a well-designed and efficient automated
mechanism may not always be available
viable manual approach is using manual
activities to distribute a release it is
important to monitor and measure the
impacts of many repeated manual
activities as they are likely to be
inefficient and error-prone
this marks the end of release and
deployment management process the next
process in service transition lifecycle
phase is knowledge management and so is
