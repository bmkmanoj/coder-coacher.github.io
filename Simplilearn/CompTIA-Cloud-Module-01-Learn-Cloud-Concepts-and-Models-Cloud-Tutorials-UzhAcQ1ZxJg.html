model for enabling ubiquitous convenient
on-demand network access to a shared
pool of configurable computing resources
for example networks servers storage
applications and services that can be
rapidly provisioned and released with
minimal management effort or service
provider interaction let us understand
this definition by focusing on the
keywords ubiquitous means irrespective
of any type of network or any type of
web enabled device we can access the
services subscribed from the service
provider cloud computing takes the
technology services and applications
that are similar to those on the
internet and turns them into a
self-service utility the latest version
of n is T definition states that cloud
computing networks must use
virtualization and multi-tenancy it also
states that the customer must be able to
provision his or her resources with
minimal management effort and service
providers interaction in the next slide
we will discuss essential
characteristics of cloud computing n ist
states that there are five essential
characteristics which are achieved by
the service providers so that they can
call their service as a cloud service
the five essential characteristics are
on-demand self-service rapid elasticity
measured service resource pooling and
broad network access let's understand
each characteristic one by one in detail
the next slide will introduce us to the
concept of on-demand self-service
on-demand self-service means that a
client can provision computer resources
without the knee
the interaction with the cloud service
provider personnel the customer gets the
complete privilege to select the
resources and decide it's quantity based
on their business process without any
formal consultation with the service
provider the customer can access the
dedicated portal anytime and from
anywhere
however he needs to comply with the
limitation of regulatory concern to
perform changes in configuration of
current setup
also the upgrade or downgrade of
resources is committed in just a few
seconds in the following slide we will
discuss rapid elasticity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
