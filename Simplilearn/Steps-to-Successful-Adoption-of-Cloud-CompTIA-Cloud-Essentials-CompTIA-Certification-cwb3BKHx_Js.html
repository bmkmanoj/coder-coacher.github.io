we will have to choose vendors who can
offer us services as in any business a
new vendor relationship carries with it
some amount of risk cloud is no
exception we will have to choose from a
long list of vendors and these vendors
are not like any random person offering
some service a cloud vendor is someone
very critical to the organization since
we are putting the server's applications
and data in a public cloud if this
service provider goes down the
organization can lose millions or even
chances of running out of business there
is a long list of vendors from which we
need to choose the right ones they
include IaaS providers SaaS providers
paas cloud consultancy services which
are companies will be helping in making
the move to the cloud besides there are
auditors will be auditing the virtual
infrastructure and the network providers
who will help in staying connected
across locations as mentioned earlier
moving to cloud is not merely replacing
single software with another or opting
for service but it is moving the
complete data center on to the cloud
which is not like replacing one brand of
servers with another physically as a
result cloud in foals far greater risk
additionally we are connected to the
network typically through the internet
we could be connected to cloud by means
of a secure VPN at the headquarters or
we could host the e-commerce site on
public cloud where thousands of
customers connect to it from different
parts of the world it could also be just
a private network connecting the
developing team in the u.s. to the
infrastructure team in the UK it is
important to question ourselves in order
to understand clearly the Bender's roles
and responsibilities we should ask
questions such as who is going to run
one aspect of the public cloud GU is
going to provide server management
patching licensing who is going to offer
deployment of new servers and
applications backup or recovery security
and auditing just like any of the
business the cloud to succeed it is
important for all the parties to
understand clearly their roles and
responsibilities the next slide
introduces to the essential skills for
success in adopting cloud</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
