training by simply learn this training
is about lean management and it will
provide you with details on what it is
and how you can use it in your
organization in this section I will
provide you with an introduction to lean
management this will act as a foundation
for the remaining part of this course we
will start with the agenda and then move
forward with the training content
here is the agenda we will start with a
background of lien and service industry
then talk about lean implementation in
health care service industry with some
examples and success stories in the next
slide we will start with lean in service
industry background
in this section we will cover how to
enter production system yeast lean
manufacturing to come up with lean for
service industry while all the
principles hold true we need to
understand that there are some specific
details for lean for service industry
that might not be the same as lean for
manufacturing industry service in this
context is not limited to the office or
administration but also wider service
situations that are not necessarily
repetitive where tack time is not
applicable and where task times may be
both long and variable service in this
context could mean anything from a
hospital to a university from an office
process to a consultancy and from a
warehouse to field service maintenance
it is important not to confuse service
operations with the economic definition
of service sectors as distinct from
manufacturing sectors since many service
sector organizations have manufacturing
like operations in that they produce
regular outputs along value streams
instead service refers to the service
concept or product service bundle which
are all the activities that provide
value to the customer along a value
stream one of the central concepts that
distinguish lean services from lean
manufacturing is a distinction between a
value demand and a failure demand value
demand is demand for service from
customers while failure demand is the
demand caused by a failure to do
something right for the customer failure
demand is thus demand that only exists
because initial demand was not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
