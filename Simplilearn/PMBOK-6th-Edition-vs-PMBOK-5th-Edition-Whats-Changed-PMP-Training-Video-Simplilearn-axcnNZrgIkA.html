first I'd like to introduce one of my

management expert to Brian Campbell all
right Brian
are you there ready to go
so I think hopefully that I muted Nate
can you hear me now okay great well good
morning you good evening everyone thanks
Amanda
for the overview and obviously we're all
gonna be here to learn a little bit more
about what's coming up with the new
project management body of knowledge and
the sixth edition so where where am i
from what am I doing here in Houston
Texas I'm coming to you live in sunny
Texas I've been in the project
management domain for about 25 years
I've mostly focused on the information
technology space I've worked in a large
number of different organizations and
industries visibility across a lot of
those different verticals I have a
number of my own PMI certification so
I'm very familiar with going through the
process beginning PDUs the maintaining
my certifications I can definitely
relate to the activities a lot of other
project managers on the specimen
Experian thing I have my PMP obviously
as well as my program and administered
occasion and the add down certified
professional certification and I've been
working with simply learn now about for
about five years teaching courses around
the world I specialize in project
management but also do a lot of work in
the ITIL space Lean Six Sigma and do a
lot of active delivery and I've been
excited about spending some time
reviewing this material we've done a
full revamp of all that simply learn
project management certification courses
updating them for the new
EMT empok and it was a great opportunity
getting exposure to that you're thinking
about taking the exam and they're not
just you so in the webinar here we're
going to spend some time first officers
talked about what the PMP certification
is
and how can help you in your career
we'll look specifically at the 6th
edition update and talked a little bit
to how not those are the affect existing
project management professionals
certified project managers and then
we'll take a little closer look and
actually what's changing between the
fifth edition and the sixth edition
we'll talk about the steps necessary to
move forward with taking an T based on
the 6th edition exam and then we'll open
the floor up to a few questions like
navitat so let's get started we'll talk
a bit about project management what are
some of its benefits so what is project
management well the P Minds find it as
including project program and portfolio
management as well as all Accords of
livery mechanisms that are going to help
organizations leverage and grow and
adapt to the business environment so one
of the things that I think most of it's
been being the global economy has been
growing rapidly organizations want to
take advantage of that growth projects
are a natural extension to allow them to
do that so this is a great opportunity
for project managers and again involved
grow their career because just how much
demand that's coming from this global
economic growth but it's also more than
just you know taking advantage of growth
it's also means for organizations to
control their spending and ultimately to
improve their project result because it
helped define a scope and its ribs and
then align our schedules and budgets to
the goals of the organization so one of
the things that project management helps
do is introduce a strategic value team
and that allows organizations and
companies get that competitive edge in
their markets and industries
it connects those ideas some opportunity
that we market
all the way to implementing that and
taking getting value from that bucket
implementation so one of the things
organizations are seeking right now is
project managers there's a lot of
project a lot of initiatives out there
organizations are expanding and growing
so this is a great time to be in the
industry and in the profession so um we
can see here from this graph and this is
sort of interesting because the empty
income
the very large global consulting company
they worked in a very cheap pasty with
most of the largest countries world and
they've conducted a number of surveys
but one of the more recent ones that
they reported on talked to two
interesting findings the first is during
an economic expansion the things are
going well and Kalani's growing senior
executives report the developing project
management skills are a top three
strategic priorities sixty percent of
the seniors as you speak much management
skills mean in their top three
strategies during the time of expansion
methods but the great methods for anyone
considering getting into project
management or anyone who currently into
Punk management Rebecca now if you look
at the next bar below that we also see
that during a recession project
management skills are also very valuable
senior executives report that project
management has a core competency help
them remain competitive during the 2008
recession remember that was a very
widespread global recession and the
senior executives identified project
management's one of the reasons that
they were able to remain competitive
during that cycle so great nuts on both
sides of the equation
both times are growth and in times of
recession yeah that's a great question
and in fact if you can probably see that
slide
you know there's there's lots of
opportunities during a during a growth
during an expansion but over the across
Japan it's just a great career and it
provides a lot of talent a lot of
variety and it's also very resilient
during downturns the economy now one of
the trends that the PMI has recently put
it on is that there's a lot of
retirement expected to occur and many
project managers were baby boomers are
now at that point where they're able to
require in fact we see some of the
statistics around this a very
interesting one is 90% of front has an
opening in the manufacturing industry
our
spectre-2 come from requirements alone
so that really tells us that there is a
lot of demand for this profession and
either during times of growth times
recession this was a great time to get
indeed involved project manager and it's
not just because there's the
opportunities for work but a whole lot
of fulfillment as well well let's take a
little bit of time looking at reasons to
gain a PMP certification if we just talk
pretty couple pretty compelling ones you
know job opportunities but to get your
PMP if you get your PMP
one of the first things you'll know this
is you're gonna have an opportunity to
earn more in fact there's a 23% more
earning for private managers with the
certification than those with hounds but
that's pretty compelling reason right
there make the investment to get your
certification in addition over the last
12 months PMI is reported that PMP
holders have seen a 70% of the PMP
holders have seen an increase in their
compensation so if you've got a PMP
organizations are interested interested
in keeping that talent and innovation
and they're prepared to increase
compensation to keep that skill set
within their organization another set of
I think pretty compelling numbers are
the ones in the third bullet in average
salaries so if you're working in the US
the average salary for a project
managers a hundred and twelve thousand
dollars and it goes all the way up to a
hundred and thirty thousand if you're
living in Switzerland so these are
six-figure salaries these are user you
know definitely a you know the type of
salary that very Stephen senior
professions often receive so it's a good
space to be in and the other really
compelling statistic is another one that
came out the PMI project management and
the project man's profession has the
highest level of job satisfaction
amongst leading professions with doctors
and lawyers and accountants so that's I
think really interesting too the big
reason for that is project managers that
has so much diversity and it's
intellectually challenging and demanding
work and the other part of
really get an opportunity to connect
solutions to real-world problems and I
think that's up that's a face a lot of
people can find a tremendous amount of
fulfillment from so there's a really
good reason to look at getting your PMP
certification but I was a little
background on project management and the
PMP let's talk a little bit more about
what's changing in the inbox itself now
what is the first thing that I'm using
the octave in box I think a lot of us on
the line sessions here ignored the term
that it stands for the project
management body of knowledge and this is
the guiding force of quality management
professionals for planning executing and
managing their projects now the pin box
manage on a project management institute
and as one might expect every few years
the project management is it's going to
take some time to make sure that the
PMBOK reflect what's going on in the
market what's going on in the in the
profession so they updated about every
four to five years and they have a
specific kind table but this is
generally what we've seen since it was
released 1996 now they determined that
they might determined now the date
update based on what's called the role
delineation survey so you might hear a
little bit about this when you're doing
some exploration about getting your PMP
you might see that reference to the RDS
and how the PMBOK reflects these role
delineation surveys and just like you
might expect they're a survey that's
conducted among practicing project
managers anyone read through the BMI as
well as organizational leaders just
really understanding what trends they're
seeing in the market I will treasure
this thing in the profession and then
they use that to look at the pin box and
Peaks for Duncanson update so the last
thing we saw was back in 2013 so it has
them close to five years now and we
follow the if the initial release but
this Fixodent back in September of 2017
and the PMI done that so training
organizations expect to learn get an
opportunity to look at the changes make
adjustments to their training material
and it also gives an opportunity for
anyone that might have been previously
studying in the repetition
complete the studying take their
certification exam the four things roll
over into the new stick division content
so a very important date if you're one
of those individuals that has been
already spending some time on their
studying and practicing and preparing
for the Quran shal be March 26 2008 een
so it's coming up this month
three plus weeks the exams will no
longer reflect the fifth edition content
so that's the date at which everything
whip is over to the sixth position so
that's sort of your your your deadline
if you're interested in the it is
example number that date March 22 fix so
let's take a quick look at what some of
these changes are and one of the first
things you'll notice if you've had a
chance to look at the newspaper is
there's a big emphasis on advil
practices and techniques these
techniques are now inserted across all
of the different knowledge areas and
process groups within the PMBOK and it's
very exciting and in fact in addition
there's a whole new document that comes
with the amount of the agile active
types separate book for reference but a
package jump with the PMBOK now in
addition there's been three new
processes that have been added to the
BIM Bach we've got a process called
matted process knowledge where the
executing process group implement risk
responses part of executing again and
then control resources under the
monitoring controlling process groups
three brand new processes of your
existing TMP person you know it's not
your certification for the fifth dition
is a little time looking at these really
positive areas to get a little more
familiarity with those in a distant it
removed the process so the closed
procurement process is now no longer
part of the PMBOK framework it doesn't
mean we don't close for German but the
p- recognizes that that function is now
transitioned to other part during the
beta tear macGruber the accounting group
will have more responsibility for
closing out
Yanis it is and we're seeing some
updates to a number of knowledge areas
and crosses names so we're doing some
fine tuning on the naming and in
addition they've added a special segment
on just the project management role and
it's been updated to reflect a lot of
current trends in the printer market
itself how that my sure you know the
PMBOK has seen a lot of changes
particularly from its original inception
back in 1996 but increasingly over time
we're seeing that those changes are a
little bit more about how informations
structured and how the processes are
defined than the addition of a lot of
new content
now if the bigger releases interesting
as you saw we've got three new processes
of they've added and one that's been
removed so the past there were 40 step
processes now there's 49 but not a big
big changed in new content there but we
have seen the addition of the new agile
practice guide and I think this is a
really exciting new direction for the
PMBOK it adds a lot of flexibility for
project managers how they deliver their
project now of course the PMI have a
separate certification specifically for
agile projects called the Izone
certified professional or ECT so this
new version of in Bach and Handel
practice type sort of provides a bridge
between being more predictive and
traditional project management that
means that were pretty familiar with and
a lot of these agile project management
approaches that are dealing a lot of
transcendent implied the basically
across the industries so in fact that
maybe you had a great segue into this
next slide talking about the bulk diet
is going at home so again we've got
there's a separate document the agile
practice tied in and of itself but is a
pretty sizable document it's it's a
really important resource that to be
leveraged to understand evaluate and use
agile techniques as well as hybrid agile
approaches and I think one of the things
that those of us have been working in
the project and in spades for a number
of years and then exposed to have no
techniques one of the things we've
discovered is that it's often difficult
in global enterprise organizations to
apply not on technique exactly as they
might need to find by you know tens
Walker is from large global enterprises
often have a lot of other requirements
that need to be managed as part of the
five delivery so it's difficult to
introduce their implant ad know exactly
it's defined in something like scrum or
programming to get this hybrid and
there's a lot of great guidance in the
Americas guide on how to apply these
hybrid techniques and which techniques
bit better in certain circumstances so
there's a lot of how you just have space
alone with this advertisers guide gives
a big emphasis of practical application
and agile techniques and again
emphasizing larger enterprise
environments but the focus is mostly at
the project or team levels you're not
going to get a lot of direct in on how
to apply these techniques and be the
enterprise or how to transform a large
organization to move more into a dumb
but it will get a really good feedback
and direct on how to apply through the
consent means of the project and team
level so up it's a really good reference
it provides guidance of selecting what
the best agile lifecycle for your
project so the great companion to build
with a pin lock in addition there's a
lot of new tools and techniques that are
being included
so each knowledge area now have agile
adaptive techniques that can be applied
and a kind of collection of tools to
draw upon it gives us a lot of great
references on how these techniques in
the introduce and it also gives us a
little more specifics on these hybrid
techniques and where to apply those in a
project what's the best way to introduce
these techniques so lots of good
information there again remember that
the PMBOK is sort of our reference the
center practice guide
input into that but if you're studying
crazy tea do you want to get your hotel
certified professional certification
this would be the book need to be
looking at almost exclusively so though
that we seem you know agile how that's
getting inserted let's look at some of
the concepts area ages that are going on
now the good news there's no changes in
the PMBOK process groups to notice
initiating planning executing
controlling monitoring closing all those
famous names they're not interests but
we have seen the addition of three new
processes as we just turns out earlier
manage project knowledge implement risk
responses and control resources but for
renew processes and then we've also seen
one get removed that's the clothes
procurements and again it doesn't mean
clothes for parents is important chip
means that you know the role delineation
services conducted demonstrated that do
a lot of quality managers they weren't
that involved in closing out the
procurement the different functional
area of the organization a to date
they're a management team the contract
the accounting organization they took
more responsibility for closing out
those procurement now another thing
that's happened is we're seeing some
some name updates and I think these are
helping a lot in terms of communicating
more effectively what you need to these
olive areas you'll see that project time
management has changed to project
schedule management and we have project
team resource management is now project
resource management again these are
reflective of the fact that you know
both of us as park managers know with
start a project for being at you know
how much this is gonna cost and when
will it be done that when will it be
done question is really targeted at
their schedules but they talking around
schedule is a lot easier to relate to
for a lot of stakeholders in
organizations I think that's that's a
good change there and the other stage of
course is project there are more than
just human resources we have to be
concerned about equipment and material
supplied so project managers really
respond
well for all the resource management
that goes into a crud
now we also see some changes in the
process of themselves member knowledge
areas this technology is there pretty
broad there's a lot of the processes
with changes within the process names
themselves so planned stakeholder
management is now planned stakeholder
engagement and that reflects the fact
that we're not really managing
stakeholders were really engaging them
stakeholders are I have independent a
lot of times big piece pretty senior
executives or very large groups of
people so difficult to manage them as a
project manager but we are expected to
engage with them
human resort methods and we just heard
the fact that living a transition to
refer to that as the source management
control communication is now monitor
communications role risks is monetarist
that's Cola stakeholder engagement is
monitor stakeholder engagement I'll be
picking up a little pattern there the
team is aware that project managers
aren't necessarily controlling a lot of
these processes but they're responsible
for monitoring and adapting and
responding to let this team be monitored
and then finally we've seen a change
from perform quality experience just
managed quality and it was an area that
there was a lot of questions in the past
I knew and I did a lot of instruction
well stove it a little bit but what's
the difference Quality Assurance and you
know quality itself so I think this is a
better way to describe you're
responsible for managing the quality of
a project the project manager I think we
help save them updates and adjustments
to the input tools techniques and
outputs the ITT oh so a couple examples
project documents now are used as a
reference to any document created in the
course of a project lifecycle some
groupings around data gathering data
analysis data representation so that's
intended to simplify the reference to
those tools and techniques in each of
the processes and we have a new section
admit earlier for describing the role of
the project
responses important leadership and
strategy of ties to the PMI talent
triangle and that becomes important
because after you get your PMP you then
have to support it by reporting your
professional development unit so these
these are all sort of time together
whole project managers really focused on
how they're adding value to ground
leaders that strategy is learning about
tools techniques outcomes for each
process will these changes make it
easier or harder to prepare for the next
exam right you know you're you're a
playwright
Vava gating these IDT OHS they're these
forty nine caucuses is difficult even if
you have the pin box sitting in front of
you but obviously the PMP the closed
loop exam so you not have that
opportunity and that really make
memorizing IPOs uh very very challenging
the good news is I think this new
release of the pin lock is going to help
this a lot by using more generic term
for a lot of the implement tools and
techniques for each process so now we
have a very reverent like project
documents and instead of having to
itemize every party document created in
the debug very work we have a container
called project document so it gets a lot
easier to talk about what's an input
into a process with one of the fun
continents being produced that part of
yeah the project management lifecycle so
I think this is going to make it easier
to prepare for the exam and I think
really a lot easier to set a reference
and abstract some of these building
techniques they needed a manager or
project as a result
okay so a little deeper analysis gears
we look at you know what what what are
some of the changes were seeing the
PMBOK how does it reflect changes in the
market and the profession itself you
know for what I'm interpreting in this
at least is it really this new edition
reflects some really broad societal
changes in particular is expanding
access to Millennials and I think tough
this is now kind of a really exciting
certification option for their career
path that many in the beginning engage
both the market and finding kind of
career paths into the profession in
addition these societal changes I think
are very feeling the younger project
managers clearly with the addition of
the dental practice design and the agile
techniques that we've seen and I think
as a consequence this is going to apply
or be much more interesting to a more
diverse range of attempt upon to answer
is preventable so this is going to
tenant in complete access I think that
the project NASA profession to
particular minorities and other often
underrepresented groups Millennials and
in the workforce dictionary word of the
year was youthquake new work for me but
it's defined as a significant cultural
political or social change arising from
the actions or influence of young people
is the PMBOK experiencing the impact of
this oh yeah I know that that's
absolutely right we can see the effect
that all these young minds are having in
every area of the economy and the
political world so it's no surprise EMI
is adapting to reflect these changes
this definitely isn't your grandfather's
in Bach anymore the PMI is working hard
making accessible the diverse range of
individual it really it's if they'd be
part of a profession that can embrace
and support these changes so I'm kind of
excited to be part of that myself and
then I'm at a point in my career
I'm excited to get some new perspectives
new inputs and I think this is this is a
great time for my to be introducing
these changes ok well now uh let's make
up a little bit of time on what's
involved in the PMP certification itself
so good news again there are no changes
in the exam content outline itself for
the new six position relief the duration
of the exam is still our there are 200
questions that will be asked and of
these 25 questions are considered green
test questions so we'll use these for
future tests
so only a hundred and seventy-five
questions are going to each sport that
you don't know which 25 questions are
considered pretest in all questions are
multiple-choice questions there's only
one correct answers so you'll have four
answers only one of those could be back
but there might be a question of which
is the best answer sometimes you'll have
a pop questions that feel like they're
pretty close you better people on this
path the most correct answer again the
prerequisites haven't changed we still
have a couple past with a bachelor's
degree you'll need 4,500 hours directing
and leading project tab in addition to
the 35 contact hours of training you
need to receive and you'll need to have
35 month band experience over the last
can eight negative years and it you've
got a high school graduate degree
diploma again you'd have a 35 contact
hours but 7500 hours directing leading
project nap and that needs to occur over
60 months within the last eight
consecutive years you can see how
questions are distributed to those 200
questions are are distributed along
these process groups that's the
information that the PMI
provides healthcare for the exam so not
surprising if the areas again the
heaviest emphasis services around
planning executing monitoring
controlling areas of the project
managers actively involved in but there
will be questions are around initiating
how projects get started and closing how
it wraps up
so um what exams should you take during
that space where they say well I've got
a couple paths I could follow like to
take the fifth edition' orbiting six
addition
if you've already invested in training
you own the pin box in submission and
you're ready to take the exam
well your deadlines very clear you have
to get it completed by March 26 now that
means you need to register the PMI org
site at your application pay your
examination fee and schedule your exam
you really need to do that immediately
remember there is a possibility your
application could be selected for audit
in which case you'd have to nonesense
additional information to validate that
what you submitted was accurate you need
to exclude a little that time so really
if you're on this call right now if
you're in this category I'd really
encourage you as soon as this session is
done log in the PMI org site and get
your apps case submitted pay your exam
fee and get that exam scheduled before
March 26 now if you're not in that space
or maybe you are just starting out your
journey to get your PMP certification
this is a great time to really make the
investment early in the release of the
payment tricks edition because this
could be the basis of the dam for next
three to four years you can be very
current very contemporary with your
certification so this is a great
opportunity to really kind of start
diving into this and as I mentioned
there's lots of really compelling
reasons both where honey market in
general is going how this profession is
getting engaged
I felt techniques let's make it very
diverse and exciting okay I think there
was a great time to get your PMP
certification okay so that's that bit of
and I think that covers the ground of
what big changes were seeing with the
recent release of the PMBOK and some of
the reasons to pursue your PMD
and thank you everyone for joining we

difference between PMP and change
management okay well yeah that's a good
question the pin he talks a lot to
change management all of these are be
janitors or implementing things just
only be our products isn't it there's
changes to the organization to the
people going to use whatever loosing
representing so there's a big aspect of
what you learn in the PMP now that said
change management organizational change
readiness is it's a space you can also
really specialize deeply and there's a
lot of other great training offerings
there and you know yeah to learn have
some good complements to that but really
the big difference between the two is as
a project manager one of the
possibilities you will have managing a
project is incurring the change
management is executed as part of your
project now a change manager would be a
role on the project who would be
responsible for ensuring these changes
are communicated and effective
implemented so the product manager may
make sure of that role is well-defined
its resourced and budgeted and scheduled
appropriately and the change manager
would actually do the work involved with
communicating something changes next
question for you Brian actually you know
what I'll take this one does this
presentation count for PD use and if so
is activity listed with PMI not some Joe
Joe no the session is not a PD you but
we do offer plenty of them if you want
to just check out our project management
category on the web we're happy to help
you out with okay Brian
next question understanding with the
previous version of PMBOK how much help
do you think people need to understand
the new version that's prashant on
youtube yeah so I think with with the
new version you know some of the old
versions they give you a little bit of
context that you need the book yet it's
close to a thousand pages so this is a
this is a big tome we're going to be
referencing so you can probably
appreciate you know everyone even a
pretty experienced project manager is
gonna need some assistance navigating
through this very large book and
successful in order to successfully pass
the exam so I'm you know my guidance
would be and if it's been this ways and
really I took the big block early on and
it's life cycle and it was that probably
a little smaller version of over
kneeling now and but even then the
emphasis was you need to get training
from someone who has been delivering
this an organization that's not credible
like simply learn and leverage that once
you finish the training have your own
project schedule we can identify how
you're gonna
prepare with some practice exam 2 one of
the things I love about them since learn
is they've done seven simulation exams
bullying the blazing examiner hours in
duration did you go through you and half
of those you will be in great shape to
take this advance these screens on my
schedule you built out take your
painting
prepare for your practice exams take
your practice exams and then rapidly in
your your your EMT certification exam so
the guy this is definitely a you will
need support and turn to an accredited
organization we just had to learn to get
the training you need someone has
finished the PD years do they need to do
it again I think he's asking if they've
gotten their their fifth edition yeah so
if you've already taken your contact
training that was a thirty five hours of
contact training that's required to just
take your PMP certification then you're
fine I mean that that training come a
number of ways you know you could be
taking a some college courses you're
taking a graduate degree in MBA and
there's a course you're taking on
project management those contact hours
can also be included so if you've
already taken those contact hours those
35 training hours you're you're covered
and you would just submit that as part
of the application you can move forward
if you if your little concern thing gosh
you know I've done all my training in
the fifth edition what are the deltas
between the 10th edition six edition
really you just solve they are you
focused on those three new process areas
take a look at the agile practice nine
you know your content there and you know
still be in good shape for taking that
to six position admit
I've got two more questions for him one
from Dale what is the best strategy for
me to retest back Shak hurry up and
learned that six position changes and
retake the test is in a possible after
March well should I take my time over
the next twelve months to relearn
everything right so if you uh if you
need to retest you kind of need an
attempt at exam and let's go back in and
do it again
you know honestly if you can get it in
here between now and March 26 it really
encourage you to do it you've already
made the big investment you probably
feel a little more confident because
you'll feel though the contents nothing
you're too different but again you know
put your mind a little bit of these
these these are huge seismic changes
we're talking about here they're more
calibration so I think you know armor
that you could go in you could revisit
the fixative and I remember the PMI
member I'm a p.m. I remember you will
get a PDF version of this book in Bach
you can download it right now even
though it's done if you go to the PMI
tonight right now so you know take a
look at these you would you think but
you know if you're in that situation
just described I'm probably encourage if
you feel confident justjust take the
next week really bone up on the bureau
on pocket of diffidence and give your
exam book just make sure you get exam
completed or March 26
so KJ and actually KJ this is a good
question I started simply learned
trainings I'm going to take the exam
after mark when will your training
videos be going going to be updating
excuse me
going to update to reflect a sixth
version of the PMBOK KJ that should be
updated today when you go into the video
you should have a option to download the
newest version the PMBOK sixth version I
will get with you offline and just make
sure you got that time one more question
if for you Brian if we have to renew the
PMP certification then should we have
knowledge of team the changes that
happen in the sixth edition that only
can be renew it or should we can we do
without it and then along those lines
also do they need to have an agile
experience to take the sixth edition
yeah two great questions so in answer to
the first one if you're renewing your
certification identify a few this is
this is a great way to get them PDUs
download the PMI the mark and I'd review
read it and you'll be able to claim some
credits for the time you that's good
getting familiar with it but it's not
mandatory you don't have to do it
there's another way to get PDUs but a
nice way to get them quickly do you need
agile experience Pat no you do not not
for the PMP certification so that
there's going to be an input and most of
us in the parchments profession have
already started to see a lot of Evangel
techniques get introduced to a project
delivery so the student be unfamiliar
but there's no requirement that you have
agile specific experience you just need
to have project management it's great
that could be a belt but it doesn't have
to be
and Brian one more question if I've
taken the PMBOK five training but I'd
like to appear for the first exam should
I should I already should I is there an
advantage to doing that okay and so that
they've already taken the fifth edition'
training and now they're asking if they
want if they should take the fifth
edition' exam okay wealthy yeah
generally because a devotee made the
investment and taking training that's
specific to the definition and you're
familiar with the structure content of
that in addition in Bach you know I
would encourage you just to pull the
trigger maybe really concentrate for a
few days reviewing the material get your
examination book just make sure you do
it before hard to 26 and gonna get this
behind your dystrophy empties birthday
however if you haven't taken the
training or maybe took it a while ago
and it's not very fresh in your mind
anymore you know I think there's a
little bit more time you know take a
look at the new pin box that just got
released to practice guide and the areas
that have changes focused in that space
your little snores but the differences
are and then you can get out your your
campi for the second edition twice how
can I get help to write my application
again to answer that question one of our
global teaching assistants is going to
reach out to you we're happy to assist
with that if you need if you need help
writing it not going to be able to write
it for you but we can give you some
pointers and how to get your application
approve
yeah yeah just to echo that an analyst
of this trade on station yeah I've read
many many many those applications all
the system instructors are quite annoyed
this so I just care it with with one of
the learning professionals if you're
working in simplify they will get into
the hands of someone like myself and
we'll be happy thank you so much Brian
