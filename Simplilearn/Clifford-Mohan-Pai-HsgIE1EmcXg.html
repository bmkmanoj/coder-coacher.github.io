the next next speaker for you is
Clifford moon pie he heads the here and
business process for her child infosys
BPO and he's gonna speak on accelerating
high-performance build or buy
you
up in fact to sharon i actually have
just two things in common one is that we
both wear glasses and the other thing is
that he happened to work somewhere close
to where i worked can be i've had a
background in cadburys just give you a
brief about myself I i have about 19
years of experience in human resources I
I have been responsible for at least
three startups worked very closely with
Clyde Cooper and blue dot six years
their work very closely with Mukesh
Ambani himself for a start-up
organization called reliance life
sciences worked yeah I then went into
Cadbury's again from from an HR I are
kind of scenario I then moved to an
international role with glenmark
pharmaceuticals and for the last six
years I've been in the BPO industry with
infosys BPO so basically had a
cross-industry experience never been in
the same same industry five jobs 19
years I'm going to be talking about
accelerating performance yes I am going
to be talking about whether we will to
buy but I think what's most important is
I think what I'm going to talk about is
talent I'm going to be talking about for
the next few minutes I'm going to be
dabbling on the subject of talent what
this the CEO has as the great challenge
what are the expectations of our clients
or say from whichever industry and
finally I'm going to be sharing about
something about my own organization
itself
just to note that whatever I am going to
be talking about are my own statements
and not my organization's just to ensure
that i am not miss coated Steve Jobs
once said the foundations of a great
company our talent and culture and I
think what's very important for you
today is to is to focus on just these
two words talent and culture and for the
next few minutes I'm going to be
dabbling on just these two words talent
and culture like this one comma I am
sure you will appreciate and agree that
there is a strong interplay between
talent and culture talent manifests
itself in differently in different
cultures we all know from experience
that those folks who've got an
enterpreneur 'i'll mindset an employee
who actually is creative find it very
difficult to get into an organization
which is hierarchical which is
structured however he does very well in
a in a very creative environment in an
unstructured environment and in a
start-up organization if you just look
at some research and I'm going to be
showing you some statistics here one
thing that bothers CEO most is talent
after business growth talent is on the
CEOs agenda and for all practical
purposes the CEO has a challenge in
finding talent engaging talent growing
talent retaining talent and finally
rewarding talent some more research in
fact the top five talents strategies
that CEOs today talking about is all
about enhancing effectiveness
it's all about growing talent internally
it's all about training and development
it's about succession and finally it's
about raising employee engagement in
itself and that's why organizations like
galloped get wealthier this will take a
look at the fact that doesn't today is
the most grossly used words I don't know
how many definitions of talent available
but the fact that today corporates use
it academia use it the number of papers
the number of theories the number of
books and articles whether profitable or
non profitable organization doesn't
really matter but they talk about talent
what does this Talent actually mean the
fact that there is a lot of mind space
that's been used on talent and that
challenges faced on talent itself is
something bothering to the industry to
every industry actually it's actually
becoming more demanding with clients
getting more demanding in fact I haven't
said in Berg who was the ex chairman and
CEO of verizon communications he made
the statement once and I think it's a
very important statement for this
presentation for me the primary job of
an industry leader is to redefine and
reinvent the industry to its advantage
otherwise you just end up defending
market share in the old game each
industry has its own growth trajectory
we've got to focus on two words here
redefine and reinvent and I think at the
end of of this 45 minutes one other i am
going to be spending i'm hoping that we
should be able to understand how we
would need to redefine and reinvent
ourselves and our organizations with the
kind of challenges that exist today you
look at the automobile industry I
everybody is talking about fuel
efficiency you have the nano in the
Indian context that continually trying
to reinvent itself you look at Apple
yeah tushar talked about apple an apple
today is supposed to be the leader in
innovation but the big s is following
close behind right samsung look at the
honda honda car i mean they would swear
by petrol at one point of time today i
understand that they are launching a
diesel car right sorry yeah so whatever
yeah the fact that these are these are
islands of excellence islands of
excellence and and it's all happening
because the customer the client is
becoming more demanding this is true of
the indian industry it's animal actually
in every emerging industry in the
knowledge industry to some of the words
that we are all talking about is
sustainability we're talking about cloud
we're talking about analytics we're
talking about Big Data right everybody
wants to redefine themselves reinvent
themselves and now coming to my own
industry I belong to this industry for
about six years now and just like any
other people into intensive industry
this is an industry which is driven by
people the industry has evolved over the
90s 90s when it was all about
transaction it was about keeping your
brains at home and coming to office yeah
today in the two thousand we are talking
about domain expertise and today much
further we are talking about moving from
transaction to transformation the client
now is telling me boss you tell me how
is it that you're going to be adding
value to my business first of all are
you understanding my business you've got
to master my business tell me how to run
my business and then finally transform
midas
yeah now all that is going to be putting
pressure on all of us is going to be
putting pressure on talent yeah because
the demands of performance is obviously
going to be a stretch today the client
wants us to partner in the business
that's what that's what we talked about
meeting essays is usual what is written
in the esso w taken for granted cost
abbott raj business as usual the client
expects to you to know the business
understand the business and finally
today the big word is client value how
am I going to be adding value to the
client or else why shouldn't the client
go somewhere else just across the wall
yeah why should he stay with me and in
all of this the only game changer is
talent talent is not just about head
count as I said it's the driver of
business today and we're talking about
highly skilled talent and that's why
when I talk to my employees I keep
telling them guys including girls
obviously guys is a generic word please
bring your brains home to work yeah
don't give them at home today we are
talking about business and we're talking
about BPO we're talking about finance
and accounting we're talking about
sourcing and procurement we're talking
about knowledge services we're talking
about legal services we're talking about
analytics so we are talking about niche
products for our clients and we are
hiring cas doctors phd's yeah so we not
talking about low ended stuff you're
talking about high end it's tough very
clearly and that brings us to the
subject of performance of talent in in a
particular context yep how does talent
behave in a particular context
as I said there is all possibility that
a particular individual performs in one
context and does not perform in another
context and come back to a definition of
what talent talent is all about but
before that client is talking about
transformation try and is talking about
outcome bottom line yeah and you tell
him about all the things that you are
doing great boss enough tell me what am
I getting out of it what's the bottom
line yeah I think never before it's
bacup I mean has it been so challenging
for any industry and much more in my
industry so what's talent all about
talent is about knowledge tolerant
talent is about skill but talent is also
about intent and attitude yeah and
without that intent an attitude
knowledge and skill is of no use you
know talking about hardwiring with what
tushar talked about I remember the story
and some of you may have heard it very
common we heard about the story of the
Scorpion and the and the frog the
Scorpion wanted to cross across the
other end of the water and he said most
were you telling the froggy can you take
me across I'll jump onto your back I
think I go crazy you a scorpion jump on
my back you kill me you'll bite me but
it is why why would I do it I mean I
also want to cross if you die I'm going
to die and that made some logic for the
Frog so he's looking hopin the scope and
jumps on the Frog and as the Frog
reaches the middle of the river there
goes the scope in and bites the frog and
the frog goes down and he comes up he
goes down and he comes up and finally
bring it up he says but why did you do
it and he talked about it why did you do
it want you to bite me the Scorpion said
because i am a scorpion and scorpions
bite and that's all I know to do
expecting something otherwise we'll
obviously set us for disappointment and
I think that that's exactly what talent
is all about without intent without
attitude all you know and the fact is
that you know some of us manager senior
managers I am sure we do recruit for
knowledge and skill yeah and then we
realize the mistake that we've made and
the total package is about experience is
about availability that's what talent is
all about when we talk about context
we've all seen many examples around us
of people how this they succeed in a
certain context and they don't succeed
in a certain context while building or
buying talent it's important to consider
an organization culture and that's why
you just can't you know you just can't
hire it's obviously very important and
you know that's that's when when we talk
to consultants and consultants who who
don't understand your organization
culture and just try to give you skills
and knowledge that's where the problem
lies without understanding an
organization culture and the second most
important piece that I don't like to
talk about is the stage at which an
organization is looking at the context
it's important for you to understand
culture of an organization whether it's
a stable organization if it's a growing
a fast growing organization because
while you may have the knowledge and
skills that's required the kind of
individual may not be able to survive in
a culture which possibly is a
fast-growing culture and fast-growing
culture obviously also it would demand
greater amount of rewards and you know I
mean you look at you look at
organization from your you look at
organizations recruiting people from
your organization's right at some times
one hundred percent of salaries how can
they do that here I mean we're talking
about margins eventually right and you
say oh you know boss you go to the HR
guy said boss they go he is recruiting
at one hundred percent im's are going to
go and go ahead and you see that those
folks actually are playing that risk
model and I'm man it's it's coming down
to every industry today it will borrow
for us there for
to understand so as to help you whether
to decide or two with the to whether to
buy or to build and that's why it's
important for you to understand culture
and the context because it is this
knowledge and context which is going to
help us in accelerating performance yep
yeah yeah so I'm going to talk about
that I'm going to talk about it
specifically I'd like you to ask me
questions if after i have if i have not
done justice to it I like you too you
know I'm going to be talking about it
yeah in terms of you know whether to
build or buy and let me tell you frankly
that NASSCOM recent said recently i'm
quoting nasscom okays recently said that
the i.t i.t is industry today in india
is about a hundred billion u.s. dollars
a hundred billion u.s. dollars okay and
which is a combination obviously of
domestic as well as international yeah
and we want to differentiate it i mean
as an organization every organization
wants to differentiate themselves and as
an organization infosys technology is a
great differentiator it is the people
who will make it happen and we need to
bring in the right people to achieve the
two again another water crossing example
that i have two sanyasis walking across
the water just about to enter the waters
and their gums a lady she says you know
can I can I can you help me cross the
water because i am wearing a sari and if
i get into the water i will get wet can
you help me cross the waters and this
one sannyasi very nice said yeah why
don't you just sit onto my back and I
will take you across the waters and they
land across the the other side and she
goes her way and these two sannyasis go
their way and the other Sanyasi was not
carrying the lady he was very bugged you
know how come this colleague of mine
first of all I'm not supposed to be I am
supposed to be celibate
I'm not supposed to be looking at a
woman here this guy not only touches a
woman he also holds on to her so he's
too bothered in his mind and he goes
back and finally blood sorry says you
know how could you do that you know via
sannyasi Xandra celebrates how can you
do that and this other sannyasi was very
pleasantly said he said you know I
carried this lady from one end of the
bank of the river to the other bank
unfortunately we are still carrying her
i think that's that's exactly what
talent is all about can we reinvent and
redefine that strategy of us yeah and
before I actually I actually get into
you know telling you whether as an
organization we build or V by or both I
think very important for you to
understand the context of an
organization that's ours from an
organization perspective GDP is at the
heart of our strategy that's growth
differentiation and people when talking
about growth as I said it's about 100
billion market today as an organization
we are a 500 million US dollar
organization talking about infosys BPO
25,000 employees 132 clients more than
18 centers that's what we are market
size obviously is not a concern for us
because the market is a rake is going to
grow big we are just about 500 million
u.s. dollars and we're talking about 100
billion US dollars
I am going to be talking absolutely i am
going to i am going to there and you can
ask me questions if i don't address it
in any case definitely be talking about
differentiation and we are going to be
talking about technology led
differentiation here we got to be
different whether it's eventually its
talent is going to make the difference
it's the people which will make it
happen this is something in fact you
know is the month of our of a CEO gdp
and you know different from the
knowledge gdp that you know so as a no
as an organization what do we do do we
do we build or we do by obviously we
also this build and by yeah i don't
think that's great rocket science to
understand but what's i think very very
important for us to understand this when
do we buy when do we build why do we buy
how do we buy and how do we build i
think that's an important question
because through these questions i'm
going to be addressing both your
concerns here and then you can ask me if
I don't address it infosys BPO is an
organization is the talent nursery and
you know by now we are already a brand
in the market a great band that you know
in a position to actually attract the
best talent talent obviously comes from
the university's most of the title comes
from the university also get laterals
it's we leaders who actually nurture
this talent in the crater and the
demography of India is changing and
folks now know whom to come to Andrew
not to go to yeah so when do we buy
Talent yeah so it's all day out for you
be facing critical times we buy Talent
when there's shortage in house we buy
Talent when there is an unusually large
requirement obviously we've got a bike
talent when there is a just I mean just
in time requirement when we are
expanding businesses when we require a
new set of skills and domain expertise
and finally when we require a breath of
fresh air
that's when we buy talent and when do we
build talent when very clearly that the
talent that we require is go to our
business in any case when we want to
have more of the products that we
already have in terms of talent when we
have the right cultural fit and that is
more important than performance only
when we believe that we can develop
in-house talent when we have enough time
on hand in spite of all the urgencies of
business when a succession planning is
in place to give a give a message to the
organization that you can grow with us
when the long term is more important
than the short term because I know a lot
of organizations today live from month
to month and quarter-to-quarter rather
than looking at the long term and
finally when an organization is in
consolidation mode that's when you build
talent just to give you an idea in terms
of gesture an overview a bird's eye view
of the entire talent management strategy
attraction no different again from a lot
of organizations hiring the right person
for the right job that's a recruiters
mantra equipping the individual to
perform growth talking about careers
focus on careers and ensuring that the
employees build a long-term career
within the organization talent
management we're talking about a formal
management at all levels in the
organization when we talk about talent
reward we're talking about focusing on
the reward strategy and how to motivate
people and we're talking about retention
we're talking about focusing on your
retaining your talent as well as
reducing your attrition levels self this
the bird's eye view but as we go along
I'll tell you something more of each of
these while as an organization we've
already you know we have a unique
selling proposition but
fact that today we have an employee
value proposition which which is a
combination of the financial the emotion
and the learning we are talking about
the financial we believe that a fairly
competitive in terms of salaries and
there is opportunity for asset and
wealth creation in an organization like
us when we talking about the motion
we're talking about creating that
connect where leaders are actually
monitor on a month-to-month basis in
terms of their connect with people on
the ground and that's monitored by the
CEO himself on a month-on-month basis
and obviously through providing a fair
and rewarding working environment for an
individual with a great culture and
ethics we're talking about learning
learning opportunities and exposure to
technology with some of the world's best
clients we also talking about an
external brand perception and that's
something which comes with whether the
external recruitment or the internal
recruitment that you do and just for
your just for your knowledge we have a
target today as the HR function to
actually have seventy percent of all
internal positions filled all positions
filled by people within that's the kind
of target and incidentally we been able
to meet that target in this in the last
financial year we're talking about
competency-based selection process we're
talking about making the recruitment
pipeline and finally I'm going to be
talking about inclusivity itself how do
we hire yeah these are some of the
unique strategies that we do manage and
I believe you're unique in that sense we
have something called project Genesis
where we talking about enhancing skills
and increasing employability in B and C
town so we catering to some of the lowly
towns we obviously want to become an
employer of choice and because of which
last year alone we connected with about
400 colleges and about 30,000 students
through
the project Genesis itself the youth of
today obviously require these programs
to help the nation and there is a
rigorous training program that we
organize for them on their campuses
besides that we also have something
called the campus ambassador program
where in we go down to campuses we
select some of the best we get them to
our campuses we get them to acclimatize
with our culture with our working
environment and then we send them back
to colleges because they are through
their curriculum they go back and they
are ambassadors so they I mean the word
of mouth obviously spreads faster than
all the advertising that you do and one
more thing that we do is adopting a
university itself and therefore
university obviously has a lot of
colleges and we adopt a university p
influence the curriculum we also ensure
that genesis as well as the campus and
ambassador program is also activated in
these colleges and finally we have
something called a spark we're in on a
regular basis we actually have students
both from colleges and from schools come
into our campus on a weekend spend an
entire day understand what the BPO
industry actually expects from them and
this helps them help them understand
what infosys BPO is all about and so we
are talking about the long-term we are
not talking about short-term here we are
talking about future in phocians future
folks who want to join the industry to
help them understand and have clarity on
the industry itself last year we we did
about 17,000 401 faculty and we covered
about 3 lakh 6605 and students itself
that's the kind of scale you are talking
about
again talent sourcing by period a great
network of graduate schools and that
something which we did we've been doing
actually all these years in last year
itself we connected with about 750
graduate schools again from a B and C
schools CA B and C towns we've also got
a network of business schools that we
attend we've also got a corporate
internship which is not only for our
students in India but we also have
students internationally who come down
to India because a lot of folks
internationally actually want to have
India on their CVS today I hope you
understand that today with the kind of
reach that we have across 77 cities and
32 countries each of our development
centers actually become a hiring hub for
us that's the contact of scale that
we're talking about we also into
diversity hiring and the fact that i'm
happy to announce that we actually also
won the helen keller award some time ago
for the most disabled friendly company
last year alone we had about 138 people
and with with diversity and the fact
that we also have an environment that is
supportive within the campus itself
because a lot of people a lot of
organizations do do recruit but the fact
is to create an environment to create
that support system for diversity is
obviously a great challenge also and in
fact attrition in this particular sphere
is almost zero percent we also have a
program called Ivan which is which is an
enforces women inclusivity network
incidentally we have about forty one
percent of
our workforce as women creating common
ground we are talking about 95
nationalities and our which seven
percent of our workforce are all locals
we are talking about global centers
obviously like any other organization
we've got maternity paternity but
besides that we've also got adoption
they've got part time we've got flexi
working and we've got selective
commuting also telecommuting in terms of
all the support system that we provide
to our diversity counseling Health and
Safety workshops Family Days satellite
offices 24 by 7 mbbs doctors available
on the campus around the clock and
nearside day cares for our women
employees and one last slide in terms of
the kind of recruitment that we do which
is inside out we also have an employee
referral program which is something like
the multi-level marketing model that we
do so it's if I refer an individual I
get a reward but I also get a reward if
my referrals referral joined us so
that's the kind of network and that
creates a great amount of excitement for
an employee to actually make references
obviously I can't refer people for my
own function but i can do it for other
functions and it obviously it's also
it's also level based it's not for
senior management and then finally we
have something called I said seventy
percent as a target for internal job
posting in fact for the last three you
three CEOs that I have seen my
organization which were all selected
from within the organization itself in
the last six years I've had ample
opportunities to to move from location
to move to global centers and also to
ensure that if I want to look at adding
value either into operations into
quality in two HR that's the kind of you
know USP that's provided here
in terms of the strategy by type of work
itself not not such a great thing but
very important for you to note that
we've been able to successfully be skill
all the work so as to make it as very
simple processes so that you don't
require only great minds to work on
processes but a lot of our complex hire
jobs are actually simplified or
automated in this manner we've been able
to map the candidates skills to the
required process more aptly yes we've
got a great campus today we've got
something called mysore campus which is
a 35 acre campus which is one of the
world's largest and the best training
center in the world at at at one go we
are in a position to actually train
15,000 train as well as accommodate but
it's not about infrastructure Rooney
it's also important that we have a
strategy a talent strategy in place and
that is what we talked about with
relation to your own response today's
youth they want challenges and if you're
not providing healthy strong challenging
jobs to them then obviously they're not
going to be excited enough and I think
while all of us in our own organizations
have have a very goal very very
structured goal-setting process that's
something we also do after putting all
the effort an employee needs to know how
he is doing and in order to encourage
him to his high performance he also
needs to know how he is doing we have a
just like a lot of organizations we have
a biannual performance assessment model
we also have something called a
performance improvement plan
specifically to help bridge the
performance gaps for middle management
and top management we also have
something
called a personal development plan which
supports an individual at the mid
management level creating a talent
pipeline as I said while we have
something called the internal job
posting we obviously encourage promotion
today the internal job posting itself is
a way for you not to need to grow
horizontally but vertically also with
something which we did just about a year
ago talking about careers of life for
life are very important for each one of
us to have great pride in the
organization that we belong to and I
think that's some great lever very
important to have leadership focus
itself it's important to have
performance-based compensation see a
management at my level would actually
have about fifty percent of our
compensation which is a variable piece I
know today from a farmer from an
industry perspective there lots of
organization who actually want to scale
down the variable piece of compensation
but today as it exists fifty percent of
compensation at senior levels is
actually a variable component which is a
combination of organization performance
as well as individual performance
comfort with working environment and I
think that's that something which is
very unique for us I think while a lot
of things are available everywhere but I
think creating that environment becoming
about that context culture that's
something which is unique for us we do
invest a lot in mentoring career
development in fact each of our HR may I
mean I've got about held 100 HR folks in
my team and each of them are trained
career counselors and obviously we also
have a counselor 24 x 7 available to
manage stress to manage broken marriages
to marriage interpersonal relationships
and finally something which in fact very
very very recently none with yours
talked about
saying that we need to continue to to
make a meritocratic society something
which as an organization we need to we
need to build more and more and I mean
NR and obviously has seen that there is
a weakness there and we need to invest
in creating a meritocratic society so
just to repeat and to summarize in terms
of the internal job posting the
competency-based training the higher
education program today we've actually
tied up with some of the im's we've
actually got some of the great
institutes teaching on our campuses on
weekends and certification programs
we're in an individual actually cannot
go to the next level if he does not
complete certain certification programs
I just skip this one slide we're in
training here is is actually whether
operations training whether it's quality
training whether its domain training
whether it's risk training all this is
something which is mandatory for an
organization like ours and for an
employee to move to the next level can't
do it even if he is selected by a panel
he will not be able to move until he
completes that basic training that's
required to move to the next level and
for all practical purposes in fact today
and OGG an employee if he wants to know
what are the skills that he requires to
move all the knowledge required to go to
the next level he can see it all on his
on the portal sorry
yeah this is about training this is
about training days and for ya for for
every employee in the organization for
that level for that level / you
absolutely and just to summarize I mean
not to in fact one slide to showcase all
that we do we've launched something
called fuel which is talking about
future emerging leaders wherein we have
very very selective individuals guys who
potential guys who who show great
promise for the future and who are
provided mentoring who are provided
specific training and taken through
various developmental initiatives we
also have tie up with the Harvard
publishing wherein we have 25 modules of
Harvard itself they're available free of
cost for every individual besides
downloadable material about 105
downloadable material for an individual
150 videos that are available for an
employee to add value to himself and
that's the building part for talent
finally from from from a geopolitical
scenario we've also identified folks
internationally who actually come down
to india at mysore go through a specific
program on intercultural grooming it's
something which actually is helped in
building leaders for our international
centers higher education program have
already talked about we also got
something called the junior management
leadership development program which is
something which we launched at a time of
recession when all organizations put a
freeze on all training that's the time
in 2010 when we actually landed up
launching this program for
our people as a very clear message to
our people that we actually want to
build yeah and while we will continue to
buy the fact that we want to build you I
think it takes great guts for an
organization at that period of time to
actually make those decisions which are
long-term and not short-term I'd like to
end my delivery by just two small quotes
John Quincy Adams he once said if your
actions inspire others to dream to learn
more to do more to become more you are a
leader and I think that's something
which you know I think as an
organization being we've been able to do
in terms of weather in terms of leaders
in terms of the external world or in
terms of our own CSR that we've done
we've been able to get people to dream
and to a great extent today we have
quite a few employees who moved out of
the organization to be enterpreneurs and
finally I'd like to quote something from
Ben Franklin when you're finished
changing you're finished and I think as
an organization and I think as as as
individual professionals if we don't
continue to reinvent ourselves redefine
ourselves reinvent the very value
systems of our organization question the
way we do things it's going to be a
difficult progress for us ahead so I
wish you all the very best in
reinventing and redefining your own
couriers and your organization check
please feel free to ask questions any
great question see what cha I have a
very basic question I think how do you
spot the right talent sometimes what
happens you know you interviewed a
candidate yeah you thought he's the best
guy but well comes to performance he's
actually not doing it good so where was
the gap actually was it in the interview
process screening process or into the
management that he we are not able to
know
the best of appreciation yeah so this
there's no one hundred percent right
here okay let me tell you frankly yeah
and in recruiting but what I can tell
you when I've used it myself for years
today I think the behavioral event
interview is something which has been
able to do to support us in our hiring
to a great extent the behavioral event
interview there's no right or wrong
answer to a question behavioral event
interview talks about how the individual
has already performed so when you ask
him questions you're asking him to be
descriptive of his past performance and
then you grill him there I think that's
been something which we've been able to
be very successful in fact all our
recruiters all our managers who are
recruitment talk about operations
managers who are recruiting managers are
trained in the behavioral meant till
date I found that as a methodology as
very successful but as I said there's
nothing like 100 100 percent proof
because human beings are so dynamic in
nature obviously so but then i can i can
only suggest and that you try out the
behaviors i meant if you can actually go
through a program on behavioral event
interview i think it is it's one of the
I mean I I enjoy doing the behavioral
interview and I myself continue to
specialize on on that area to ensure
that I am better in the position to hire
there is a standard GM for the
cost-saving measurement methodology is
given to to all the all the all the
individuals and second part is is
attitude and this leadership and is you
know how acceptable is as a people
manager you know those are very soft
skill oriented things and it is very
difficult to measure that part of it so
I just wanted to know your thoughts in
terms of when when from an organization
perspective when how you emphasize or
tell your managers that when they
evaluate any individual you know what
should be important or you know there's
some balance or some percentage on the
measurement part and the soft skill part
okay so for us very clearly as an
organization it's it's a it's a downward
scorecard yeah so the CEOs co card comes
down right all of us every employee even
down to the employee who's joined you
know two months ago at the fresher level
soon after college has got hard bound
carries okay that's one thing second
thing is performance evaluation is not a
one-time exercise or two-time exercise
it's a monthly exercise for a so which
we've actually been able to end the fact
that we have 25,000 employees in infosys
BPO we actually been able to to
institutionalize something called the
one on one which is you know very normal
right one on one where a supervisor and
employee has a discussion every month
we've been able to actually
institutionalize it okay our evaluation
criteria is only based on carries very
clearly definable even for example as an
HR I am I've got numbers right that I am
going to be judged upon and there is
competi competition is something which i
will do a self-evaluation and my boss
also deserts there is an evaluation and
that's where that feedback comes in so
we've got a very clear different
definition of all the soft soft skills
which are talking about
certain sees is a very clear definition
so when I am evaluating myself in the
appraisal form it is very clearly
defined what is it that is expected of
me and I would rate myself on a five
star where do I see myself act and where
is my boss seen yet and what is the
difference in fact there we've generally
seen that there has been there has been
a difference but at times we see a very
large difference between what the
supervisor evaluates and what actually
does itself about I mean of course you
know we all know it the way we are we
evaluate ourselves right we always I
mean there are there is a strategy where
some evaluate themselves on a higher
levels over the boss you know goes a
little you know on a five so that you
can the boss can go on a four at least
right which is I rating there are some
folks who read themselves 102 so the
boss can you know go on a three but for
all practical just to answer your
question yes it's not something which is
a hardbound for us very clearly every
individual in the organization has got
numbers and your evaluation is on
numbers okay from a competencies
perspective as I said there's a self
immolation in the supervisor and we for
for our managers we also have but
360-degree appraisal yeah so we're in we
have you know we have other folks who
evaluate Dana so might my peers my
juniors my boss would evaluate me and
that's something which today as of today
we have it very voluntary to share it
with my supervisor but very soon we'll
possibly make that mandatory also so I
have to actually share my 360 do
appraisals with my boss so I think
that's that something which we can do
yeah yeah yes
I'll take a few more questions made
because I'm not going to be there after
lunch shall be moving on talked about
moving from transaction to
transformation yes so that means you
have to focus lot on customer centricity
you know the you have to know customer
so what say what investment you make
because traditionally culturally maybe
we are not be able to go to in western
country when the bus driver tells have a
nice day what your steps maybe that's
the way it's a mechanical but they are
trying to do that cash from the guy that
we are not so we are not that type of
service oriented and that no you're not
so friendly with people so how do you
what do you invest what you trained to
make people more customer-centric so
that they understand customer business
better because that I believe a
fundamental skill which is needed
absolutely absolutely see in fact I
think one of the and one of the usps is
that you know v.v teller you know
candidates for example is that yours an
organization when you can make a career
for yourself I can't make a career for
you I can't do that for you if you got
to do it for yourself right from the
start so for example for a fresher for a
person who's a graduate comes on board
with us he goes into training for about
30 days in Mysore ok there he goes
through what we call the seven essential
skills in terms of writing in terms of
reading in terms of computer skills in
terms of data entry so basics so it's
about polishing the fact that here's a
guy who has never been to a corporate
who's generally notes knows only the
college canteen right here he comes into
a corporate into a very stiff atmosphere
and suddenly 25,000 in front of him
right such as its large scale and poor
guy when I joined this organization in
2007 it came across to me as you know
obviously I got no this on my day one so
most of for him after he comes you know
if he does his training and obviously
this is a certification they you know
program there if you certify this with
us it is not des LT is not with us
anymore then comes to location to base
location there he goes through process
training what we call a process during
which can start right from three months
to about six months where he goes
through an elaborate process
training what is expected from him from
the client itself okay plus brushing him
on domain knowledge itself whether it is
an fna space sourcing and procurement
legal processing whatever it be so
that's the kind that's just the
beginning of it all after which he is
ready to get on to the client space
before even complete six months there is
all possibility he would have gone
through some kind of a competency-based
training yeah there's something which we
very recently we landed up with a tie-up
with the British Council itself where we
have something called we've launched
something called communique so lot of
folks today I mean how many of us
actually speak English at home right
they're all coming from vernacular
backgrounds the fact that we also have
folks and we've got to get them to speak
and to speak at the fact that you know
even when tushar was standing here when
we were not even speaking because as
well as as a culture we don't speak so
quickly right and here are folks who are
immediately coming to the corporate and
the supposed to be speaking to clients
world's best clients yeah so to give
them that confidence and that's
something you know vivi kind of clients
have come back and said what's the kind
of change that you've done just a small
module of about three months that we do
with them what we call project
communique it's something which we've
been able to actually change their own
communicate forget about communication
skills confidence to speak in front of a
crowd like this so I think so I'm saying
I'm just giving you plus of course we're
talking about junior management
leadership development programs where we
have a nose there's a lot of investment
and I believe that as an i mean i wish i
would have joined this organization on
you know at the beginning of my career
because i think i would have possibly
got a greater enhancement in terms of
development yep you somebody else old
what a question my question is related
to retention of the employee in
financial aspects so one of the scenario
that maybe I don't know that how you
handle or how it should be handled one
of your employees they can approach you
saying that we have got offer of sixty
seventy eighty percent higher and they
are ready to negotiate if you can match
that offer they will stay so how you are
or how it should be handled yeah you
know it reminds me of this one story
you'll have to give me some Liberty mesh
you know Karthik Karthik rate was the
treasurer of the gods all right coo coo
bates oh yeah kuwait yeah where is the
treasure of the gods you know once he
went into she was of course I'm telling
you sorry was you're the expert I am NOT
the expert so you know he went into
shivers house and he you know he had
ganpathi there and he said you know you
know why don't you he seems to be hungry
why don't you give him some thing to eat
so shyama says don't worry boss I'll
take care of him at the right time don't
worry about it she's uno I'd take him to
my house okay fine no problems so Kobe
it takes confetti to his house takes him
into the kitchen puts in there yeah and
they're in the kitchen he gives them all
the food and you know a great appetite
that he has everything done so you know
cubera mean he gets panicky goes out in
the you know in the world gets all the
food again comes back again and again
then he says my Lord and my god I'm
sorry you know I try to do you think at
any point of time anyone in this room is
happy with your salary most it is my
birthright not to be happy with my side
with my salary is it not I mean I ask my
co are you happy with this already know
first where are you going to end it
where are you going to end it tell me
frankly in the kind of an organization
that we are talking about margin the let
me tell you very frankly as an
organization we are a target is
twenty-four percent in terms of margins
there are BPO organizations big ones who
are operating on a two percent margin
what is the point in being in business
was so let's face it we will never end
this you up your Muppet somebody else
will do better than you so for all
practical purpose IV the best famous as
we not but we will provide you value as
an organization will provide you value
you want to get rich rich
you know you know you remember I don't
know if you've read it you would have
read it Aamir Khan after launching the
three idiots how many asked him key boss
what's the secret of your success you
know what did he say he said my focus is
on sarasvati actually comes by so you
know I tell all my employees boss you
focus on sarasvati you focus on learning
money will come by I mean tell me anyone
in this room who leaves their organizes
it will not get a higher salary any all
of us will ya the biggest question and
at all levels and I mean I question
myself you would have seen on my profile
I have done my GPA charge just about two
years ago it was important for me to do
it it's important for us to reinvent and
redefine ourselves it's important that I
continue at whatever level that I am I
continue to learn because tomorrow my
boss is going to ask me what's the
difference between you and your
colleague on the right and the left and
what is different than I bring to the
table suppose money is something which
you will never end up let me tell you
frankly all of us leave our jobs today
we'll get a better better compensation
but i also know one thing that i can in
cash the Infosys check only once just
once if an organization provides you
with learning opportunities if you are
adding value to your career if you are
continue to learn I don't believe this
any reason for you to leave your
organization if money is the motivating
factor boss there is a problem then the
and I can I can well understand your
question because today I face employees
on a daily basis telling me that but
where will the end you will end up like
a rolling stone gathering no moss and at
the end I mean that's that is my biggest
fear then at the age of 40 and 45 you
suddenly questions whatever been doing
what am i doing all these years have I
been able to add value to my career or
just been getting more money I think
that's the answer
so yeah last my second glass absolutely
factor so can you tell us how do you all
do that monitoring the connect yeah see
in fact in fact is something which I
introduced about two years ago and this
is one thing that we do a lot of
connecting with people we have you know
today we try as an organization we we
continue to be an Indian organized let
me tell you frankly but we are a global
organization we have very conservatives
and organization you would have heard it
yeah and and we try to avoid anything
that's not Indian for all practical
purposes okay let me tell you but
something that we very very rigorously
do where so whether it's p models
whether it's floor walks whether what we
call meet your leaders somewhere you
know whether it's town halls it's
something that we do at the end of the
month one of my colleague shoots out an
email to all senior management asking
them details of the number of people
that they met and what is it that they
did and that is sent to the CEO every
every month on the fifth of every month
CEO receives a report connecting and
today for all practical purposes the
target that we only two months we met it
at a target that we've kept is to
connect with 10,000 employees in a month
yeah we met it only two months we are
hovering around seven eight nine
thousand because I mean that's something
which we feel and trust me I mean while
you know most of us are in this room are
fairly senior today we are dealing with
a very dynamic workforce an average age
of about twenty eight yeah folks who
would like to make a pic back folks who
who would not want to work hard yeah who
would want to eat fast food everything
fast but a motion fast progression fast
everything fast and I think that's where
be
senior leaders have to connect with our
jewel otherwise what's going to happen
to India yeah and that's one of the
reasons we're you known arundathi was
very clear that we will not recruit
employees who are undergraduates because
we don't want to create in India which
is an uneducated India very clear at
least graduate is the minimum that's
something which you are looking at so I
am saying that and we realized it and in
fact through our employee satisfaction
surveys through our benchmarking service
we've realized that folks on the ground
are actually expecting leaders to
connect with them and I'll tell you one
thing which again be we've already
complete about a year and a half today
we call this Gurukul live logs Gurukul
wherein we realized that the first six
months is when an employee moves into
the organization he suddenly see such a
large environment he is not connecting
with with people as yet he still groping
understanding learning yeah and that's
what we said that so every leader so I
have about 25 folks who I mentor and i'm
not talking about skinny amend that's a
different we have a different mentoring
program itself i am talking about folks
who've just come into the organization
at the fresher level so I meant every
month I have a program office who
manages and is not about me I am talking
about all my senior leaders have got to
meet 25 employees every month that same
batch so there's a Gurukul backs that is
that is in connected with me these 25
folks I meet every month and that's when
I not only connect with them I
understand their issues their concerns I
guide them I one of the things that I
told them give us the moment before you
even think about putting in your papers
you got to talk to me first and folks
have actually done that so i think
that's that's the connect that I think
it's very important for all
organizations to continue with this and
specifically with our the age group that
we are dealing with today thank you very
much folks thanks thanks a lot mr.
Clifford for being in spite of your busy
schedule I would request vasudha HP has
