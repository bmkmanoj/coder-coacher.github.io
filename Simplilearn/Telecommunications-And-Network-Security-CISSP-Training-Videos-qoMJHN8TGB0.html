introduction hello and welcome to lesson
five of cissp certification course by
simply learn this lesson is about
telecommunications and network security
telecommunications and network security
is one of the ten domains of the common
body of knowledge cbk for the CISSP
certification exam the
telecommunications and network security
domain includes these structures
transmission methods transport formats
and security measures that provide
confidentiality integrity availability
and authentication for transmissions
over private and public communications
network and media this domain is the
information security domain that is
concerned with protecting data voice and
video communications and ensuring one
confidentiality which is making sure
that only those who are supposed to
access the data can access it
confidentiality is the opposite of
disclosure to integrity which is making
sure that the data has not been changed
by accident or malice integrity is the
opposite of alteration 3 availability
which is making sure that the data is
accessible when and where it is needed
availability is the opposite of
destruction the telecommunications
security domain of information security
is also concerned with the prevention
and detection of the misuse or abuse of
systems which poses a threat to the
tenants of confidentiality integrity and
availability CIA
agenda the agenda for this lesson is as
follows we start with the understanding
of objectives set by ISC - for this
domain this will be followed by
understanding the concept of secure
network architecture and design
networking components are discussed next
with the emphasis on its security
securing communication channels will be
discussed next finally we will discuss
some of the major attacks on the network
and its countermeasures
objectives according to the ISC to
candidate information bulletin a CISSP
candidate is expected to demonstrate an
understanding of communications and
network security as it relates to data
communications in local area networks
lands and wide area networks lands
remote access internet intranet and
extranet configurations use of firewalls
network equipment and protocols such as
TCP IP VPN and techniques for preventing
and detecting network based attacks
