topic 1 security architecture and design
introduction hello and welcome to lesson
3 of cissp s-- defecation course by
simply learn this lesson is about
security architecture and design
security architecture and design is a
third of the ten domains of the common
body of knowledge cbk for the CISSP
certification exam security architecture
and design describes fundamental logical
Hardware operating system and software
security components and how to use them
to design architect and evaluate secure
computer systems understanding these
fundamental issues is critical for an
information security professional this
domain addresses the concepts principles
structures frameworks and standards used
to design implement monitor and secure
individual systems and the IT Enterprise
it focuses on the architecture of
security services used to enforce
various levels of confidentiality
integrity and availability in key
information assets security architecture
and design focus on the translation of
security requirements into useable
designs for security controls security
architecture and design is a three part
domain the first part covers the logical
models required to keep the system
secure the second part covers evaluation
models which quantify how secure the
system actually is the third part covers
the hardware and software requirement to
achieve a secure computer system
objectives according to the ISC to
candidate information bulletin a CISSP
candidate should understand security
models in terms of confidentiality
integrity and information flow system
models in terms of the Common Criteria
technical platforms in terms of hardware
firmware and software and system
security techniques in terms of
preventative detective and corrective
controls
agenda before we begin I will first
briefly introduce you to the list of
topics which will be covered in this
lesson we will start with the
introduction to the architectural
frameworks next I will introduce you to
the security models this will be
followed by understanding the
information classification which helps
us in determining the level of
protection required for a given data set
next on our agenda will be evaluation
criteria which will be followed by
enterprise security architecture and the
concepts of system security architecture
finally we will discuss common security
threats and countermeasures at the end
of this lesson you'll be able to meet
all the objectives set by the ISC to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
