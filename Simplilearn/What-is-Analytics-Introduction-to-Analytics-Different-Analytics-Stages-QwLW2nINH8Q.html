science of wisely acquiring meaningful
results from the given data using
various methods and technologies and by
which a pattern of variation is observed
by studying this pattern we can
understand the future and predict the
uncertainty that is related to business
various sophisticated models and
techniques are used like statistical
mathematical and economical models so
how do you go about analytics first you
gather data for example for a commercial
entity you collect data from enterprise
social media internet forums etc second
you Club all the data together and
consolidate and organize it in a form
from which you can analyze through
visualization statistics etc which is
the third step in the process in the
next slide we will see the different
stages of analytics there are major four
stages in any analytics work the first
stage is called descriptive analytics
where data or information is gathered
and summarized this stage usually caters
to questions like how many students
dropped out last year the next stage is
called diagnostic analytics where data
is analyzed and insights are generated
which help in answering the questions in
the first stage here the question that
comes up will be why has the dropout
rate increased in the last one year with
the help of the analysis done in the
previous two stages the next stage tries
to answer unforeseen phenomena like
which students are most likely to drop
out the stage is called predictive
analytics finally the last stage known
as prescriptive analytics tries to
analyze the type of action required to
be taken to support or avoid the
unforeseen phenomena predicted in the
previous stage in this scenario
prescriptive analytics has queries like
which students should I target to keep
them from dropping out next we will look
at
of a few popular tools used in analytics
these are some of the commonly used
tools for analytical purpose to get
meaningful results our revolution are
