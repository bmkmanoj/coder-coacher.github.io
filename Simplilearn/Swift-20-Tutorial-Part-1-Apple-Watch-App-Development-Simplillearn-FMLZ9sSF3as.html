for the Apple watch lesson 2 learning
Swift 2.0 in this lesson we're going to
first understand how Xcode playgrounds
work because we're going to be using
playgrounds extensively as we learn the
Swift programming language and number
two and this is a big one we're going to
understand the Swift to programming
language and syntax by the time we
finish this lesson so there's a lot of
material in here it's not to be taken
lightly
but I will make this as painless as
possible and in fact Swift is very easy
to learn so you will find whether you've
coded before or not that it is actually
pretty easy to pick up on so let's get
started
in this video we're going to learn how
to start an Xcode playground and we'll
be doing this throughout the rest of the
lesson so I'm not going to go over this
each time we do it just know that each
time a new less a new video in this
lesson occurs that we're going to be
starting with a new playground so let's
jump over to Xcode and see how we start
one
so Xcode is open and we've briefly taken
a look at this screen before and
basically this is just the welcome
screen and the first thing that it
actually gives you the option to do is
to get started with a playground so what
we want to do on each of these videos
within this lesson is to go ahead and
start a new playground so we're gonna
get started with a new playground by
clicking it and just move this where
it's supposed to be here so we're gonna
start the playground and I'm just going
to call this intro because it's not
really going to have anything and click
Next and then we save a spot for our
playgrounds here and we just save our
hit create where we want to save it and
our playground comes up and there we go
so when we start each lesson there'll be
a new playground and I will have the
playground already running so we're not
wasting time each time we do this but
this is the basic playground as you see
it has first a comment and then it
imports the uikit
and then it has a variable declared here
and we're going to get into all the
details about what all this means and
what the left side and the right side
does and in fact there is a bottom to
this as well so we'll get into what that
says so or not what it says but what
it's useful for so we'll see you in the
next video
in this video we're going to start
learning Swift and we're going to open a
playground and we're going to start
learning the swift basic syntax
variables and constants so we're going
to start right at the beginning here and
we're going to show you the basic syntax
and explain what a variable and a
constant is and we're going to take it
from there so let's jump over into a
playground so we're in our playground
and I first actually want to start
talking about the playground I'm
actually using the playground that I
created in the last video so when you
open a playground it automatically has
this text in it and basically the
playground works like this on the left
side is where you put your code and on
the right side is what's compiled by the
code compiler and it spits out whatever
the value is so in other words this is a
variable called STR and it's set equal
to the value of hello playground which
is a string and you can tell that's a
string because it's in double quotes
okay so all does is it spits out that
it's hello playground on the right-hand
side now if we did other things with it
it would show the modified version of it
like if I were to re-evaluate STR and I
set STR equal to just hello then you'll
see the STR on the right hand side now
equals hello and I was able to change
that because that's a variable but just
real quick on the big picture the left
side is where we put our code and the
right side is where it's evaluated okay
now this first line is a comment and you
can tell it's a comment because number
one it's in green but number two it
starts off with these two forward
slashes now anything that starts off
with two forward slashes is going to end
up being a comment so this is a comment
this word variables constant semicolons
type declarations whitespace they're all
comments and they are for human
readability only so the code compiler
just completely skips that it says okay
this is a comment let's skip ahead
there's nothing there this is a comment
let's move on you know it doesn't do any
thing with them okay so let's talk about
variables for a second this is a
variable this is maybe the first time
you've seen code or maybe the first time
you've seen Swift so in order to create
a variable we start off with the VAR
keyword so I'm going to create a new one
here I'm gonna say var and then we give
it a name and this one I'm actually
gonna call name and I'm gonna say equals
and I'm gonna put my name in there okay
so the fact that I put my name in
between two double quotes means that
it's a string now you may be wondering I
didn't declare that it's a string so how
does it know that it's a string well
it's pretty obvious that it's a string
because it's in double quotes and Swift
uses something called type inference so
if it's brutally obvious that something
is of a certain type then there's no
need to specify it if I were to specify
that this was a string I would say name
and that colon means of the type looks
like been string and then say equals
jason but notice there's no difference
on the way that that gets compiled on
the right hand side so there's no need
to type in that type declaration okay
it's actually poor form it's considered
poor form if you type in a type
declaration and it's brutally obvious
what the type declaration is okay so
just keep that in mind now as a variable
I can also go down and change the value
of that variable so as I did with STR I
can say name equals and then I'll put my
full name in so name equals Jason Rybka
and now when I pull up name anywhere so
if I just type in name here it'll
evaluate that and it'll put the value of
that on the right hand side there you
see how that works so that is a variable
and variables are meant to be changed so
when you create something that is a
variable that means you're expecting the
value of it to change now
name you don't actually expect to change
much do you so what you would do is you
would set it as a constant and four
constants that means that they can't
change and use the electi word in order
to declare a constant so we would say
let name two equal and we would set that
to I'll say Eric okay so now to is Eric
I cannot come down here and say name two
equals John because you'll see I
automatically get an error here and what
this error is saying is change let to
var to make it mutable so it's saying
change this let value to a variable
value so that we could change it but we
wanted to stay Eric because we know Eric
doesn't want to change his name to John
so we're just gonna leave it that way
okay now there are a couple things that
you may be wondering one of them was the
type declaration if you're coming from a
different language is that you know I
know point did I say that it was a
string but as I showed you above there's
no need to so if I create a variable and
I say that it's age there's no need for
me to say integer equals 40 because 40
is a whole number without a decimal
point so it's definitely an integer so
there's no need for me to say that when
I can just say variable age equals 40 so
it's kind of redundant so we don't need
to do it now in addition you may be
wondering where the semicolons are so if
I create a variable and I call that
school and I set that equal to Mount
Pleasant
for example and I put the semicolon at
the end so I can go to the next line
you'll see on the right-hand side once
again no effect on it at all and in
essence what the compiler does use end
of line characters to go ahead and
detect when a line of code has been
completed so basically the semicolon
acts as a period in a lot of different
languages to say that okay this is the
end of the command but in Swift there's
no need for a semicolon because it uses
end of line characters so we could take
that out or leave it in if you're if you
really you know used to leaving it in
then go ahead and use them but there's
really no point in using them because
they're not required and why waste the
time to you know I mean we're coders
let's face it you know we try to do
things as simply as we can possibly do
them so and another thing you may be
wondering is about whitespace so if I
say of our dog name equals my key then
you might be wondering if there's a
problem if I put space here and indeed
there's not Swift doesn't act like
Python in any way it doesn't use
whitespace as a hierarchy the only time
you need to worry about whitespace
literally is when you're using this
assignment operator which is the equal
sign and if you have a space on one side
then you must have a space on the other
side you see I'm getting an error here
and the error is because I have a space
here and then I have equals my key now I
could do it like this and say dog name
equals my key and that would work but
notice how much more readable it is this
way so this is the standard convention
this is how you should do it and right
now we're gonna leave it at that and
we're going to go into more depth about
numbers and how variables and constants
operate in the next video
in this video we're going to talk about
number types in Swift and there's
basically three different number types
you have integers floats and doubles and
we're going to take a look at all three
of those right now so let's jump over to
a playground and we'll do just that okay
so in our numbers playground here and
we're going to talk about integers
doubles and floats now one thing that I
failed to mention in the last video was
this import uikit and as VAR STR string
that pops up there every time we don't
need that so I'm just going to get rid
of that and I'm just gonna leave it at
this so integers are whole numbers so if
I create a variable called a and I set
that equal to 32 then that's an integer
okay and that's inferred as an integer
okay because it's a whole number has no
decimal point now interestingly doubles
have decimal points and floats have
decimal points so when I say variable B
equals 32 point two then Swift
automatically infers that as a double
notice that if I say down here variables
I'm sorry
variable C I need to specify that this
is a float otherwise it will think that
it's a double so 32.3 will say alright
now you don't see a difference in the
right hand side I understand that but
let me show you what actual difference
is between doubles and floats because
the fact that they're made for 64-bit
systems or they're made for 32-bit
systems really is inconsequential to us
if you if you think about it and when
you're programming you're not thinking
about whether they're on a 64-bit or a
32-bit system you're really not so it
really doesn't matter but you will
encounter floats when you code and you
will be using doubles when you code so
it's important to actually know the
difference and the difference really is
how accurate they are so doubles are
twice as accurate as float
and when I say that I mean down to the
decimal point so if we actually need to
create different variables here so I'm
going to say variable number one and I'm
going to set that equal to 32 point two
and then I'm going to say variable
number two I'm going to set that equal
to two point four and then I'm going to
say variable result is equal to number
one divided by number two and then if
you look on the right-hand side you'll
see how many decimal places that goes
over now that's a double now if I did
the same thing but I specify as floats
so if I create some new variables here
so if I say variable number number three
and I said that I'm gonna set this equal
to the same thing so 32 point two and
then I say variable number four is equal
to two point four and notice I have also
forgotten to specify that these are
going to be floats so we need to specify
they're going to be floats so we can see
a difference here otherwise it's going
to think that they're doubles and we're
going to see exactly the same thing okay
so then now on our variable result two
we don't need to specify because it's
going to be number three divided by
number four which are both floats so
it's going to come out to be a float so
now you see that only goes five decimal
places over where as the double goes
about I don't know how many that is
maybe that's a 12 or I know it goes up
to like 15 or 16 depending on how
accurate it can actually be but notice
the accuracy is different it where it
goes to four point one six six
seven at the fifth decimal place whereas
result will go much further and give you
a much more accurate number or
estimation of what that actually is
okay so that's the difference between
floats and doubles and why would you use
the float versus a double well really
you wouldn't but there's certain parts
of programming where you need to use
floats because it's so ingrained in the
system so when you need to use the float
you're going to need to specify that
it's a float or a lot of times it will
be specified for you and you'll just
need to use a float and the same thing
with the integers so an integer is a
whole number so I can't this is
important I can't go ahead and then read
declare a and say a equals 8.9 because
then that would be a double okay and I
can't say that an integer is now a
double and this is what's called type
safe and type strict so once I declare
something as an integer it always has to
be an integer
once I declare something as a float it
always has to be a float once I declare
something has a double it always has to
be a double and the same thing goes for
a string I can't set a string to the
name of Jason and then say that that
string is equal to 45 or 44 or any other
number or value because it just won't
work once you set a variable it's set as
that same type okay and it has to remain
that type throughout the remainder of
the program okay all right so I think
that's going to be it for numbers now
with numbers if you notice here I had
number 3 divided by number 4 you can use
you know mathematical symbols the way
you normally would so you know I could
easily use variables to do this but if I
did 4 plus 3 it'll evaluate on the
right-hand side
and tell me exactly what it is so you
can do all sorts of mathematics just use
the the hyphen
and if you want something done first so
if I wanted to say 4 plus 3/4 then this
would take three divide it by 4 and then
add 4 to it now we're not getting a very
accurate answer over here but it is
doing the calculation it's just we don't
have the remainder okay so because this
is or these are integers so it's not
giving us any remainders it just gives
the float values I mean the integer
value which is 4 because you know 4
divided by 3 or 3 divided by 4 is you
know just about 1 and it just doesn't
work out so that we get a more accurate
number okay but I'm going to show you
how to deal with that in a future video
when we talk about the modulo operator
and things like that
I just won't want to bombard you with
things right here at the very beginning
of the lesson so we're going to take it
kind of step by step and as we come
across things I'll explain them a little
bit more in depth ok so that's going to
be it for this video see in the next
okay so in this video we're going to
start talking about control flow so in
other words controlling the way our code
flows based on the value of something or
based on the status of something so
we're going to start off with if-else
conditional statements and we'll move on
from there so let's jump into a
playground and tackle these if-else
statements so if else statements are
very common in programming and they're
one method of control flow so in other
words they're one way to determine the
way that your code flows through your
program depending upon the value of one
you know one variable or depending upon
the status of something so we'll create
a variable here and we'll call it temp
for temperature and we're going to set
that equal to 32 degrees okay and then
we're going to set another variable and
we're gonna say variable is freezing and
I'm going to make that a boolean and
initially I'm going to make that true
okay so a boolean just to touch on that
real quick a boolean is either a true or
false statement and yes this is kind of
poor form where I'm declaring that it's
a boolean and setting it to true at the
same time because if I said is freezing
equals truth and it's clearly a boolean
but I just put that there so you know
how to declare something a boolean if
you wanted to okay so what we're going
to do is we're going to take a look at
the if-else statements now and we're
gonna basically set the variable is
freezing based on what the temperature
is so we're going to say if temp is less
than or equal to 32 then we're going to
say is freezing is true
and then otherwise and we could just say
else here or we could say else if temp
is greater than 32
that's not greater than that's greater
than 32 then what we would do is we
would set is freezing equal to false and
then just to finish this off then we're
gonna say else so if it can't determine
those two we're just going to do a print
line and the way you do that is you just
say print we'll put a string here and
we're gonna say could not get
temperature okay so now you'll see that
this if-else statement is already
evaluating things okay so basically it
says freezing is true over here based on
this temperature 32 but if I set this to
36 or 35 then it'll automatically
evaluate to false and if I well there's
no way for me to set it because I don't
have as an option when we haven't gone
over optional so I don't want to get
into that right now but basically what
it's doing is if it's less than 32 or
equal to 32 then it's gonna say is
freezing to true which is already set to
true but if we had set it to you know
equal a boolean without setting the
value then we could have we could have
done that but I want to wait until we
get the optionals to show that to you
and then if it's over 32 then we're
gonna set is freezing to false so right
now it's 35 and that's evaluating to
false and if none of those would
evaluate we could actually go ahead and
print a line that said could not get
temperature now we can also instead of
just setting it is freezing we could
also do a print line here with a it's
freezing
okay so we'll get that print line going
and then here we would say it's not that
cold we'll say and you'll see that that
also evaluates over there on the right
hand side now the if you look here
closely you're getting this newline
character at the end of here that just
happens in a playground don't worry
about that that won't happen in your
real code and anything in a print line
would just go in your console at any
rate anyhow
so that would be down here so it's
saying it's not that cold this back
trace and everything is just because of
the beta so don't worry about all that
but it's just saying it's not that cold
down there because that's what it's
evaluating to now if I change this to 32
again or anything under 32 really then
it says it is freezing it is freezing
and is freezing is set to true so you
see how that works
it's it basically goes off of the
variable and it evaluates it and if this
is true it runs what's in between these
two bit blocks of code and then if we
have an if else if statement then if
this is true it runs what's in here and
if we didn't have this else statement
here then we could have just said else
is freezing is false because it wouldn't
be under 32 so we could make it that
simple and that would be you know the
optimal way to do it if you because you
don't really need to declare you know
that if it's 33 or above you know what I
mean
so that's really all there is to say
about if-else statements as you use them
you'll become much more familiar with
them and you will grow to love them
because they are very very valuable in
your code and you'll get to know that
very early on all right so we will see
it in the next video we're going to talk
about another conditional statement
which is called the switch
now we're going to take a look at switch
statements and switch statements are
another type of control flow statement
that basically evaluates a variable or a
set of variables or the status of
something and then switches what is to
be done based on what that is so let's
take a closer look in a playground so a
switch statement is very similar to an
if-else statement in the fact that it
evaluates something and if one condition
is met it runs a certain set of code and
if another condition is met runs a
certain set of code and as you saw in
the if-else statement example you have
the if else if and then else statement
which could technically go on forever if
you wanted it to you could have that
meet an unlimited number of options if
you needed it to but it's a little
easier to do that with a switch
statement so what we're going to do is
we're going to say that we have a
variable called score and we're going to
set that initially to an 85 so imagine
this is a paper in school or a term
paper or something and the score was
initially 85 but you're the teacher and
you know you're smart enough to program
so you made a little program to make
things easier for yourself so now what
you're going to do is you're going to
switch lawns the score so you're going
to evaluate the score and you're gonna
open up a code block and in here we're
gonna put what are called case
statements or cases for each score so we
could say in the case that it's a
hundred then we're gonna go ahead and
print that your score your your score oh
my god can't type your score was perfect
okay so that's in the case that it's a
hundred but what if it's not a hundred
what if it's somewhere between 90 and
here's a range operator
for you the dot-dot-dot someone between
1999 then we could do a print line and
say you squirt an a right so notice that
we're getting an error here and the
reason for this air is because switch
statements have to be exhaustive so in
other words this is an integer so I
literally have to cover in the case that
this is any number imaginable which is
going to be pretty hard to do right so
what we do in that case is we put a
default case in here and it's literally
you say default and then what we're
going to do is break which just means
when we say break we mean go ahead and
get out of the switch statement okay
so let's finish adding our cases there I
just wanted to show you how to get rid
of that error and and the reason for
that error which is because you need to
cover all your bases when you do a
switch statement okay so now let's say
in the case that it's a 80 to 89 then we
would print that they score to be okay
and I'm missing one period there that's
why I'm having that error pop up okay so
now what it's doing is it's evaluating
to the right and it's saying that I
score to be because it's recognizing
that the score itself is actually 85 and
that would be the proper case to run in
that particular circumstance so we're
going to make another case for we're
going to make another case for 70 to 79
and in that case we're going to say the
score to see
and we'll make a case for 60 to 69 and
in that case we'll just print and say
you squirt a D and then what we can do
is we can make a case for 0 to 59 and we
can just say that your score wasn't so
good okay so now if you look at this
what we have covered is if they get a
hundred they're gonna get one thing
printed out if they get in you know
ninety nine or ninety two ninety nine
they're going to get an A 80 to 89 you
know just like you would expect but then
in the case that it's anywhere from zero
to fifty nine your score wasn't so good
and then the default would break out of
here so in other words if I put this at
let's just do a couple examples if I put
it at forty five then it'll show that
your score wasn't so good but if I put
it at 100 then this show that my score
was perfect and then what happens if I
put it at 101 nothing
you notice that nothing happened on the
switch statement but in fact something
did happen is that it evaluated that it
was 101 and it went to our default case
and broke out of the switch statement
okay so those are switch statements
pretty much wrapped up and you know
they're very useful you're gonna find
that you're gonna use switch statements
quite a lot and I tend to use switch
statements more than if-else statements
because you can do more options in a
more concise type of language but if
else statements definitely have their
purpose and you'll see me use a lot of
those but you'll see me use switch
statements whenever I can okay so try to
get into that habit of using switch
statements because they're a great tool
next we're going to talk about the
ternary
operator so we'll see that in the next
video
in this video we're going to talk about
Swift's ternary operator and it's a
little confusing by the way it says
ternary operator because it's more of a
statement than an operator itself so but
we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at it and what it does is it
allows you to write a simple if-else
statement on one line so something that
generally would take about four lines of
code we can do in one line and let's
show you how that looks like in a
playground okay so as you see I have
this if statement that we worked on
earlier and it basically evaluates the
temperature and if the temperature is 32
or below then it sets the is freezing
value to true and otherwise it sets it
to false and excluding the print line
statements that takes about four lines
of code to do but we can do it in one
line of code and the way we would do
that is we try to read Eclair that is
freezing variable and we say that that's
equal to the temperature which is what
we're evaluating which is going to be
less than or equal to 32 and question
mark if that's the case then we'll set
it to true and colon otherwise we'll set
it to false so that one line although at
the very first time you look at it may
seem a little confusing that one line
does exactly what this whole if
statement does with the exception of
printing those lines because you don't
seem you print those lines I'm just
setting the is freezing variable okay so
it can be useful will you see me use
this a lot in practice not really
because it's not as readable
and as someone who teaches code I like
to have the emphasis on readability
rather than short code even though short
code is nice readability is much better
when it comes to the coding world in my
opinion so as you'll see right now it's
evaluating the false just like this is
but if I set this to you know 23 then it
will evaluate to true on both the if
statement and on the ternary statement
okay so pretty simple stuff we can also
set a variable based on it and as you're
declaring it so
I could say of our statement and I need
to declare this as a string and then i
could say equals temp less than or equal
to 32 and if that's the case then my
string is going to be it's freezing and
then otherwise it's gonna be it's not so
cold so you'll see right now it's
evaluated it's freezing and if i set it
to something above freezing like a nice
balmy 89 then you'll see that it's not
so cold
so a couple of different ways to use
this this is actually if you look on
line 20 this statement is actually
pretty cool because it's like a property
observer and i'm going to show you what
a property observer using a getter and a
setter is a little bit later but it is
pretty neat line of code it does do a
lot in a very little bit of space but
readability does come into question now
if you can grasp this great you can use
it in your code but just keep in mind
it's only good for either/or situations
so it's only good for a if else
statement that literally has an if and
an else not an if-else if-else statement
and definitely not something that would
be more complicated like a switch
statement so but that's swift ternary
operator it can be useful at times for
you when you're doing your own code and
just you know weigh the possibility of
whether it's readable readable or not
okay and that's it on the ternary
operator
in these next few videos we're going to
go over collection types in Swift and
there are in fact three collection types
they are arrays dictionaries and sets
and I also like to include tuples in as
a collection type because other than
they're not technically classified as a
collection type they act as a collection
type so we're gonna go over those and
we're going to start with arrays so
we're going to jump into a playground
and take a look at arrays in a little
bit more detail so arrays are perhaps
the number one collection type for just
about every programming language and
what do I mean by collection type well
so far we've been dealing with variables
that hold one single value so to hold a
string or to hold a number or you know
any anything else really
but now we're talking about collection
types and like I said we're going to
start with arrays and arrays are an
indexed type of collection which means
that when you put something into an
array it returns the array as you put it
in in the order that you put it in and
let me show you an example here so I'm
gonna say let names and let that equal
and and in order to start an array you
do the square bracket and you end with
the square bracket and inside the array
you put the items that you want so this
is going to be an array of strings and
it's going to have my name and then I'm
gonna put Christina and I'll put Lenny
okay so now this is a collection of
three names which we refer to as an
array and specifically it's a string
array because it has all strings in it
now one thing to note about arrays and
the way they operate is that once you
Claire if once you specify the first
item as a string then the rest of the
items also must be strings so we can't
mix and match we can't have Jason and
and the number two and then Lenny it has
to be you know Jason and then Christina
and then Lenny you know they all have to
be strings now let me show you how this
is indexed because it's in a zero bass
indexed is zero base index rather so the
index goes something like this for Jason
that would be at index zero because
these are zero base index Christina
would be at index one and Lenny would be
at index two okay so that's how it's
indexed and that's in fact how you go
ahead and pull something out of an array
so if I wanted to pull Christina's name
out of the array well she's in slot
number two or index one so I would say
names and then in order to go ahead and
grab that I would put a square bracket
put the number two and put another
square bracket and then I mean number
one for Christina rather and it would
say on the right hand side what the
value of that is on the right so what I
created there when I said let names
equal and then those three names that
was called a array literal and the
reason it's called an array literal is
because I specified what's in the array
at the time that I created the array so
in other words let me show you one way
that we could create an empty array so
if I create a variable and I call that
empty array and then what I would do is
I would say that's going to be of the
type string array and so that's just the
string value inside of the array
brackets and then I would set that equal
to an empty array okay so this is how
you create a array that doesn't have
anything in it okay now I could also
create an array in a different way
we create an array called dog names here
and we're going to set that equal to and
we'll say an array of strings and then
we'll use these parentheses to go ahead
and activate that array so you see the
empty array and dog names array on the
right hand side are simply empty arrays
okay now suppose I wanted to go ahead
and refer to that names array again and
I'll just type in names here so on the
right hand side we have a clear reminder
of what's in there now let's say I
didn't want Lenny in there then all I
would have to do is say names dot remove
last and that would remove Lenny from
the array and then if I pull up names
again you'll see on the right hand side
that it's my error here oh yes when I
created that I created it as a constant
so let me change it to a variable so we
can modify it so then you see where I
say remove last and that takes Lenny out
of there and then the names array simply
has Jason and Christina basically the
way it's supposed to be so now we've
seen how to create an array literal
we've seen how to create an empty array
and we've seen how to remove something
from the last area of an array now let's
just say that we wanted to know how many
items were in the names array we just
had names dot count and on the right
hand side it would tell me how many
items are in there now there's only two
but if we do dog names count that would
be zero so how do we add something to an
array well it's actually pretty simple
there's a couple ways to do it actually
the first way we could do is we call up
the array and then we could say dot
append and the new name that we're going
to put in there we could say my key okay
so there we have the array and if you
look on the right-hand side it shows the
array has just the one item in
which is my key okay so we could also
add to this array by saying the array
name and then going plus equals and then
adding basically a couple array items
like ah say lot a and Bianca for two dog
names so now if you look on the right
hand side you'll see that the dog names
array has three items in it and it's my
key
Lotte and Bianca okay so let's say now
we wanted to and I don't want to get too
much into this but if we wanted to go
ahead and cycle through the items in an
array we could do a for loop where we
cycle through the names in the array and
we could just say four and we make up a
name like name in names and then every
time it comes up with the word name that
comes up goes through that every time it
iterates through that what we're going
to do is we're just going to print the
variable that we just created name and
you'll see that it does it two times on
the right hand side because there's two
items in there and if I hit this eyeball
or it's coming up where you can't see it
so if I hit this you'll see that has
Christina and there used to be a way to
show the entire thing but now I guess it
just shows one so but it also shows
jason in there as well so basically
that's how you do that but don't worry
about the for syntax because we're going
to get into for loops and for in loops
and repeat loops and whatnot later okay
but that's arrays and arrays are
actually they're pretty simple so as you
see it's easy to go ahead and add
something to an array it's easy to
remove something from an array
and it's easy to get something directly
from an array based on its indexed
location okay now and keep in mind that
arrays
when returned are returned in the way
that they were put in so when you put
something in index 0 it stays in index 0
until it's removed ok so that's going to
be it on arrays next we're going to take
a look at dictionaries
in this video we're going to talk about
another collection type in Swift and
that is the dictionary now dictionaries
are somewhat similar to arrays in the
way that they look but they are very
different in the way they store values
so in other words they use a key value
pair and let me show you what that's all
about we'll jump over into a playground
right now so with dictionaries you have
a key and a value and I'm going to
demonstrate that by creating an empty
dictionary so I'm going to call this
items and I'm going to make that of the
type string string so string and string
and I'm going to set that equal to an
empty dictionary okay so you see on the
right-hand side there that it shows that
I have an empty dictionary now now the
more common way that this would be done
would be I'll just create another
variable just called items to the more
common way it would be done to create an
empty one would be to say items two is
equal to a string string dictionary and
then use parentheses to go ahead and
activate that dictionary but you see in
the right hand side there's absolutely
no difference on the output so either
way you decided to do that that's fine
now the thing about dictionaries are
once you create them then they need to
stay the way they are in regards to the
setup of the key and the value pair
coding types so let me explain what that
means so I'm going to create another
dictionary I'm gonna call that products
I'm going to set that equal to and I'm
just going to create this array here so
I'm going to make the key of 123 and a
string of we'll say apples here so
there's an item in our products array
called apples and it has a key
associated with it of 123 and if I you
know make another one will say 234
and that is will save bananas then
you'll see that he adds bananas to the
dictionary as well now as I said once I
added that 123 here I can't go ahead and
say that this is 123 point too because
123 is an integer so this needs to be an
integer this is a string on the value so
this is a it needs to be a string now
notice on the right hand side here that
even though I put it in as 1 2 3 first
and 2 3 4 second it's returning it
backwards and it just happens to be
backwards because there's only two
values but in fact the dictionary when
you call upon it doesn't return it in
any order at all it just returns it in
some kind of random order that it you
know just picked up first when it went
into the memory and that's really it so
if I have this on products array and I
want to add a new product to it I would
just say products and then I would go
into the key and this will go into the
key 3 4 5 and we'll set that equal to
oranges okay so now that's oranges but
if we go ahead and we type in our
products array again or not array but
our our products dictionary then you'll
see here that we have 3 items in there
so it's 2 3 4 bananas 3 4 5 wine days
and 123 apples and you know that's
that's a typical use of a dictionary you
know this would be basically you know if
you were storing SKU numbers versus
items that you sold that would be a good
way to do it so what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to create a string string
dictionary and I'm gonna just copy and
paste this because we can save a little
time that way so I've created a
dictionary called States that uses the
addiction that uses the abbreviation as
the key as a string and uses the long
name as the value so you see we have New
York in New Jersey New York Pennsylvania
and
California and that's all well and good
but let's say that we realized that
Pennsylvania isn't technically called
Pennsylvania it's technically called the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania so we could
say states dot update value and the
value is the actual value so that would
be the commonwealth of pennsylvania and
now before the key you need to know the
key of PA now notice now when we call up
states that it says Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania there okay now we can also
just pull up any of them so let's say I
wanted to get the value that's
associated with the abbreviation and why
then on the right hand side it would
just tell me that that's New York now
one other thing you can do also with
dictionaries is get the count so you can
understand how many items are in a
certain dictionary so if I say states
dot count then we'll get four and then
how do you remove something from a
dictionary let's say I wanted to remove
Pennsylvania completely then what I
would do is I would say states and I
would go into the key of PA and I would
set that equal to nil now if you're
coming from Objective C nil in Swift is
not anything like a nil pointer or
anything no literally means nothing so
now that I've set this the key of PA
to nil I've set the value of the key to
PA - no that doesn't mean that PA still
exists in there in fact it's completely
gone so if I just type in States again
just to prove this
you'll see that PA just simply no longer
exists in there so it didn't just set
the key or the value of the key to nil
it removed the value and the key
completely now one other thing I want to
show you and this will finish up with
States is and I know we didn't get into
for loops but one thing that we can do
with here is we can iterate through a
dictionary like we can iterate through
an array using a for loop so if I say
for and then I make a tuple and I'm just
going to say this is abbreviation and
state oops
and I say in States and then what I can
do is every time that goes through I can
do a print line that says abbreviation
and this is called this is how we pull
out a variable you see these there's
three characters and now I would put
abbreviation in there and say is short
for and then our pull out state and
you'll see that that's doing that three
times and what it's doing is hopefully
to let me show you here it's saying for
example New Jersey is short NJ is short
for New Jersey and it's doing that three
times we just can't see the third time
or the second time we're only seeing one
iteration of it but this here where we
call out a variable within a string is
called string interpolation and you'll
see this used quite a bit this is very
very commonly used and there's also
something called string concatenation
which uses a plus symbol and spaces and
things like that and I think cat nation
is a little less readable and
interpolation so we're going to use
interpolation don't worry about the term
interpolation because when we use it
we're not going to say now we're going
to interpolate weirdoes
go ahead and do it uh-huh so don't worry
about that too much and don't worry
about this for statement too much but I
just want to show you this here what we
made here is what we're going to talk
about in a little while and that's
called a tuple so I quickly made that
tuple with two temporary variables so
that I can make this print line within
this for loop okay so that's going to be
it on dictionaries for the moment and
what we're going to do next is talk
about sets so I'll see you in that video
now we're going to talk about sets and
sets are the third and final official
collection type that Apple has put into
Swift and we didn't originally have sets
in Swift when it was originally released
sets came with version 1.2 but sets are
nothing new to programming they've been
an objective-c forever and they've been
in plenty of other programming language
as well so let's take a look at sets and
see what makes them unique from arrays
and dictionaries so sets basically are
an array of items and they're so similar
to arrays in fact that when you create a
set you need to declare that it is a set
otherwise the Swift compiler will infer
it as an array that's how closely
together they are so I'm going to show
you real quickly how to create an empty
set and the syntax for this is a little
bit different so if I say variable teams
and I'm gonna make that of the type set
and then I'm gonna have that be a set of
strings okay that's how we actually go
ahead and create you don't need that
that's how we actually go ahead and
create an empty set okay so but to
create a new set literal and I'm going
to create something that we all have and
it's going to be called my bills and I
need to specify this is going to be a
set and the reason is when I say equals
here I start out with these two square
brackets and inside here is where I put
my information for my set so this is
going to be a set of strings and as soon
as I said it's a set of strings that
means that it must contain all strings
so one of my bills is going to be
electricity okay and then another bill
would be my cell phone and another
whoops whoops whoops
and I got there another bill would be
water Wow
and then let's say I have to also pay
for my internet access great and then
let's say I mess up and I put water in
there again this is what makes sets
special you see how I have water in
there twice but if we look to the right
here water is only in there once and the
reason for that is that everything in a
set must be unique so if I have water in
there once and I try to put water in
there again it won't take it it will
allow you to do it but it won't do it on
your return so keep that in mind and
that's what sets are really useful for
so if you have a set and you want to you
know or if you have a set of data and
you want to make sure that all the
values are unique let's say you had
account account numbers or vehicle
identification numbers or something like
that and you want to make sure you
didn't accidentally enter the same one
twice then a set would be ideal for that
because you could literally enter it the
second time but it wouldn't show you
that it's entered in there okay so now
just like with arrays you can say my
bills dot count to find out how many
items are in there and you'll see that
it says four items now note that we have
entered five items but since water is
only being shown once it's only going to
count it as one thing so how do we add
to a set adding to a set is actually
pretty simple you just type the set name
in and then you say insert and you put a
new bill in there so we could say that
one of our bills is car insurance right
okay so and then let's say we wanted to
remove electricity because now our
landlord pays for our electricity we
could say my bills dot remove and we
could type in electricity and it would
remove electricity okay so now we could
just go ahead and see what my bills
looks like so we have cell phone
internet water car insurance and notice
that sets don't return in order so here
it's saying cell phone internet but
technically it should be saying cell
phone water Internet and it's not so
they don't return in any order that sets
them apart from arrays as well so
difference between sets and arrays their
syntax is exactly the same but they act
a bit differently they don't return in
order they're not in indexed they're not
in an indexed location so they don't
return in any order and they must be
unique values now one cool thing about
sets and you can do this with arrays as
well but I think it's neat because these
are my bills and I can say remove all
and then I have no bills which is
perfect for me because you know I love
that another way to actually do the same
exact thing would be to say my bills and
just set that equal to an empty set okay
now I don't have to declare that that's
a set there when I set it equal to an
empty set because my bill is already a
set so now we would just go ahead and do
whatever we only would one thing I want
to point out and this has nothing to do
with sets but I don't think I mentioned
it in the course so far is you see where
I'm writing my bills and I have the be
capitalized because that's a new word
well variables start with the lowercase
letter
so whatever the first word is it's all
lowercase and then when a second or
subsequent word pops up you would say
you would capitalize it and it's
camelcase so if i just create a regular
variable and i call that my dog name
this is how it should be done and you
know and i would set that just equal to
my dog's name okay so but that's how it
should be done camelcase and there are
cases where this should be capitalized
in the front like classes structures
enumerations things like that but we'll
get into those details as well
but I just wanted to point that out to
you because it just occurred to me that
I hadn't pointed out camelcase to you
before and you've probably seen me doing
it this way and wondered if that was a
normal convention and as indeed the
expected convention in programming in
Swift okay so that's going to be it on
sets actually and what we're going to do
now is we're going to look at the
unofficial collection type which is a
tuple
okay now we're going to talk about
tuples and tuples are not officially a
collection type but they act so similar
to a collection type that I decided to
include them here swift language just
recognizes a tuple as a type not a
collection type but they are in fact a
collection type and I'll show you what I
mean by that when we hop into the
playground now don't get hung up on
whether it's tuple or tupple just say
however sounds normal to you for me I've
just been calling them tuples ever since
I've you know been using them so they're
you know they're not this they're not
specific to the Swift language they're
also in other languages so I've always
called them tuples and we're gonna see
what they're all about right now when we
jump into a playground okay so on the
screen we're looking at a product index
which is a dictionary and it's a integer
string dictionary and this is the nice
thing about tuples now this is the
actual tuple here and you've seen
something similar to this when I talked
about dictionaries I showed you an
example of a tuple in a for loop with
the States if you recall so this time
we're just doing it with the SKU and the
product and the nice thing about this is
that the SKU can be an integer while the
product can be a string and everything
will work out right so if I go ahead and
I look at what this is returning says
the SKU for pairs is 9 6 7 and you know
it's doing that 4 times but we can only
see the 1 but that's the really cool
thing about tuples is that they can
contain multiple value types in one
tuple so using a tuple to iterate
through a dictionary is something that's
very common and something that's not as
common but it probably should be is to
just go ahead and create a tuple so if I
were to say let tuple 1 and I say equal
now to create a tuple we got to go in
parentheses and I'll say that one value
is going to be my name
I'll make another value of my age and
then I'll make another value just $12.99
just for the heck of it and then I'll
say true so if you if you look here we
have values that are a string an integer
a double and a boolean and they're all
okay being in that tuple now
interestingly if you look to the right
here you'll see that point zero is Jason
0.1 is forty point two is $12.99 and
that's how you access those values out
of tuple one so now tuple 1 actually has
all those values so if I say tuple 1 dot
0 then that will give me Jason
but if I say tuple 1.3 then that'll give
me true so it's just another way to get
things out of that tuple and to show us
that information now one really common
use for a tuple is when you have a
function that returns more than one
value type you would return it as a
tuple so I know we haven't gone over
functions yet but I like to get you in
the mode of seeing things beforehand
because we really haven't gone over four
loops yet either so to create a function
we use a func keyword and then we name
it and then in here we would put any
types that would come into it and then
we put this arrow looking syntax in
there and we say what we're going to
return so in here I'm going to return a
string and integer and a boolean and
then I just open up my function block
the block for the function and here I'm
just literally just going to set some
variables so I'm gonna say that name
equal Viper
I'll let speed equal 165
and I will let is convertible equal true
and then we need to return those values
so we're going to return name speed and
is convertible okay now now what we can
do is we could set the car to have those
values so we could say variable car is
equal to get card details and now we'll
be able to access that using the car and
dot notation so car dot one or zero will
give us the name car dot two will give
us the value of whether it's convertible
or not so we have a Viper and it's
convertible now the other thing that we
could do is we could create since we
have that function there we could create
something like this we could say let and
we'll make a tuple and we'll make our
own name so the name the miles per hour
and the top and we'll set that equal to
get car details I just make a little
room here and then when we call up name
you'll see that it shows Viper and miles
per hour and then top and it shows all
those values that we got out of there
and that's really what the main use case
is you'll see these a lot on completion
handlers in functions and I know you
know under you're not familiar with what
that is but you will see this a lot in
what's called a completion handler in a
function and you will see this a lot you
know in any function that returns
multiple value types they will be
they're kind of forced to use a tuple or
not necessarily force use a tuple but
that's the best-case scenario is to use
a tuple when you're doing something like
that because as you see you have all
this functionality so now I mean with
this information I could do a print line
and I you know I could pull out
dynamically pull out these these values
so I could say the name goes at least
and then I'll pull out the miles per
hour and I'll say miles per hour so the
Viper goes at least 165 miles per hour
so you can see how useful tuples can be
and I'm not gonna spend much more time
on them but they are important to
understand because you will see tuples
quite a bit in the code as you're
working with different frameworks okay
so just you know keep that in the back
of your head that tuples are going to be
there for you and we're going to go over
to polls again when we go over through
loops but just wanna you know have you
see this at least once now and then
you're gonna see it again when we do
functions probably and then you know
this way it kind of gets ingrained and
it kind of becomes second nature to you
all right so tuples excellent collection
type they can use multiple value types
and they're not officially a collection
type but as you see they work just like
a collection all right so we'll see you
in the next video
now we're going to switch gears and
we're going to take a look at loops and
there's three kinds of loops there's a
for loop and a for in loop there's a
while loop and there's a repeat loop and
don't get confused if you're not
familiar with what the repeat loop is
because the repeat loop is basically
what replaced the do-while loop okay so
you're still only three types of loops
and we're gonna start off with the 4 and
the 4 in loop right now and playground
okay so if you've ever programmed then
you're probably familiar with what a for
loop is and the first for loop I'm going
to show you is where we declare the
variable and set its value and then we
go off of that and it has three sections
and this is more than likely the for
loop that you're you know most familiar
with if you are coming from a coding
background so what we do is we say for
VAR and we create a variable in this
case I'm going to create a variable
called I and I'm gonna set that equal to
one and then we put a semicolon and then
we say what the what under what
circumstances do we want to evaluate it
so I'm gonna say if I is less than or
equal to ten then I want to go ahead and
evaluate that and I could leave it like
that but I'm going to just face it out
so it looks correct and then we want to
say how we want to increment I so in
this case we're going to take I and
we're gonna go plus + + + + just means
add 1 to it it's shorthand for I plus I
basically so and then all we're gonna do
in this case as we go through this loop
is we're going to plant a statement and
we're going to say that I equals and
we'll pull out the value of I okay and
you'll see that it goes through that
loop ten times and to give you an idea
of what that shows it would say I equals
10 so the last time it goes through its
going to say I equals 10 because at that
point it's equal to ten but once it goes
one more it's no longer
than or equal to ten so it stops okay so
that's your basic for loop and then for
a for in loop you need to have something
to go ahead and loop through so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create an
array real quick and I'm gonna say let
names equal and I'm just going to create
an array of names so I'll say my name
Ravalli and barnali and of course
Christina so now what we want to do now
that we have that is we want to loop
through that and we want to let's say we
want to go ahead and print the names so
for a for in loop you say for and then
you create a variable and it could be
anything you could name n you could name
it name which I'll do now because this
makes the most sense so I'll say for
name in names array then what we want to
do is open the code block and all we
want to do is go ahead and print the
name is and then we'll pull out the name
dynamically for that variable that we
created so you'll see that that goes
through four times and the reason it's
four times because there's four names in
there so if we look at that said the
name is Christina so let me just put a
period here to make that look a little
bit better so says the name is Christina
okay now the only thing else I want to
show you here about for in loops is
going through a dictionary so first we
want to create a dictionary so I'm gonna
say like inventory equal and we're just
going to make a dictionary literal here
so we'll say 1 and that'll be
TV and then we'll say - and that'll be
radio and we'll say three and that'll be
a newspaper so I should have probably
made that media types or something but
you get the point so then what we would
do is we would do a 4 in loop using a
tuple so we would say 4 and we'll just
say index because they're numbered and
then item in inventory and we're going
to loop through that and we're going to
go ahead and now you know what we're
going to do is we're going to print our
value now normally you would do
something additional than printing on a
value but we would say item and then
pull out the index is a and then pull
out the item so you'll see that on the
right-hand side it does that three times
and if we go ahead and take a look at
one of them says item 1 is a TV ok and
would say item 2 is a radio item 3 is a
newspaper
okay so for loops very useful I'm
actually gonna use the same I'm gonna
use this same playground to go through
our while loops and our repeat loops so
you have reference to them all in one
spot so I'm just going to create some
room down here and the next thing we're
going to be talking about is gonna be
the while loop so I'll just put a
comment there and when we come back in
the next video that's exactly what we're
going to do we're going to talk about
the while loop okay
in this video we're going to continue
our discussion on loops and we're going
to go into the while loop so we're just
going to jump back into that same
playground that we had open for for
loops so a while loop runs as you might
expect while a certain condition is met
so basically in order to use a while
loop we need to have a variable set so I
want to set variable X equal to zero
and then what we can say is while X is
less than or equal to 10 then we open
our code block and just move that up so
we can see here then what we would do is
we got to do two things in here first we
want to run some code and then we want
to increment increment X okay and I
usually increment X first because if you
don't what you'll end up getting is a
never ending loop because if you don't
increment X it'll always be zero and it
will continue to run and run and run
until the memory on your machine runs
out and it finally crashes or the memory
and the device runs out and the device
crashes so in this case we're just going
to go ahead and print the value of X
okay so it does that 11 times and that's
because it's starting at zero okay but
what if we want to do something a little
bit more interesting and we already have
this method to do that here because we
have a names array up here so we could
say while X is less than or equal to
names dot count and that would pull out
the count of those names then we could
go ahead and do something in there we
could print instead of printing that we
would print so we would still print that
but we would print names and then we
would go into there and put the value of
x in there and it would print that out
and what am I getting an error in there
for let's see no it should be no problem
but I don't really know why maybe we
need to just interpolate this a little
but this is five times let's see what we
got names axe yeah so let's just we'll
do it interpolation on this and now we
should get the correct no still not let
me do that so it's not let me do that
for whatever reason I think this is an
error in the playground because this
code should work without these should
work just like this and it's not out we
got one extra in there it's still not
working
but the whole idea is that we could do
something so let's just print out the
value of x in here again but really we
should be able to pull the name out of
there by going into that array and it's
just not letting me in this playground
for whatever reason so five times it's
just going to print out the number so
you know it goes up to four so 0 through
4 is 5 all right but that was really
just to show you that we don't have to
go by a specific number we can go by a
number that's you know dynamically
changing like the array of names you
could have names being added you know to
your array every couple seconds and this
while loop would still run and it would
change and it would do whatever code you
have in here to go ahead and do okay so
really that's all in while loops and
next we're going to take a look at the
repeat while loop which is very similar
to the while loop and now we'll go over
the difference in the next video
now we're going to take a look at repeat
loops and repeat loops are very similar
to while loops with one subtle or
actually one major difference and in
addition I also did figure out that
error we encountered in the last video
and I fixed that so I'll show you that
as soon as we hop back over to the
playground okay so that error was
occurring because I had an equal sign in
here and we need to have it just say
less than names count because the count
is always going to be one more than the
index so it encountered an error when it
got two names dot count and it tried to
pull out the index set let's see how
many are there are the index three when
it tried to pull out index four it
encountered an error so we need to just
have that as less than and then this
works as expected if we take a look at
it
not that way but if we take a look at
well it's not showing its not letting me
show looking at the increments sorry it
just prints out the name there so it
pulls the name out of the array so it's
going into the array and pulling the
name out at the array where the value is
X which is within the names dark count
so it pulls out of aleck name every time
okay so let's just close that up and now
we're going to take a look at the repeat
loop and the repeat loop is very similar
to the while loop and basically what we
do is because I have X set at zero
already we can just go ahead and repeat
based on X so we do a repeat loop by
starting it with the word repeat and
then we immediately open up a code block
and then this is where we put the code
to run and then this is where we
increment X
in this case and then after this we're
going to say while X is less than or
equal to 100 okay so what we're going to
do on the incrementer is we're going to
go ahead and we're just going to say X
plus plus and I don't want a big X just
want a regular X so the X plus plus and
then the code to run we're just going to
go ahead and print now it's only running
97 times because the variable X has
already been modified by our while loop
above okay so don't let that throw you
off but you know if I had commented out
that while loop it would run you know a
hundred times so what we want to do here
is we're just going to print the value
of X and you'll see as that does just
does it 97 times because we're already
at 4 so we'll do 101 from 0 to 100
normally okay so basically the
difference between a while loop and
repeat while loop is that the repeat
while loop will run no matter what
notice there's no check of anything
before this runs and then it says while
X is less than a hundred so X could be a
hundred and thirty so matter of fact
let's make X 130 right now and I'll just
comment out this while loop and a quick
way to comment things out is did you
highlight it just highlight it and then
press command question mark okay and it
repeats that while loop out all right so
now you'll see that even though it's 130
it goes ahead and prints out 130 here
but that's while X is less than a
hundred so it's only running one time so
if I go ahead and make X 1 again or 0
then it will print out you know the
correct amount of times and it's just
printing out the value of x okay so
really that's it I mean I'm gonna leave
all this in here for you so you can look
at all the loops and differences between
them basically a for loop you know you
create the variable you set it and you
give it a value and then you set the
amount where you want to evaluate it so
in this case while I is less than or
equal to ten and you set your increment
or decrement mind you this could be a
decrement ur could be - - but that's not
going to be good because you see on the
right-hand side that just keeps running
and running so let's just make that an
increment again and as soon as my
playground gets back to normal
you see that's what I was talking about
when we have infinite loops but - - is
you know short code for minus 1 and plus
plus the short code for the plus 1 all
right and then we just do whatever we
want to run it in this loop now the for
in loop is a little bit different we say
for and we create a variable and we say
in the names array and then we're going
to print the name is name and you see
that runs four times and then if we do
it through a dictionary then we put a
tuple here to go through those items in
the inventory and we print those values
out now the while loop I had commented
out but I believe I can uncomment this
because and to uncommon it you just do
the same thing highlight it and press
command question mark now it's going to
do this three times but it does
increment X also so that affects our
code down here but it doesn't really
matter so hopefully you can see the
difference between these loops and
understand where they may come in handy
and all of them do have their place in
code I must say that I've used every
single one of them and you know I don't
necessarily use one more than the other
well probably probably used for like for
name and names or for tuple in whatever
more often than anything but you will
use while loops and you will use repeat
loops so it's good to know all of them
and this is just a handy reference sheet
for it ok so next we're going to move on
to functions and functions are going to
be pretty exciting because functions are
going to be the first time we're
actually going to be able to do
thing with our code aside from direct
the flow or print out a value that
already exists okay so the functions are
something to actually do something with
our code and we're going to take a look
at that next
