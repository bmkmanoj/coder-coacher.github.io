syllabus there are 5 process groups 10
knowledge areas and 47 project
management processes to understand the
syllabus you need to understand the
following terms process groups knowledge
areas and processes let us first discuss
process group the project management
discipline is divided into five broad
process groups when a new project starts
it is first in the project initiation
phase moving to planning phase then to
execution followed by monitoring and
controlling and finally it is closed
project execution and monitoring and
controlling processes go hand-in-hand
therefore when a new project is
initiated all processes of project
initiation process group should be
applied to the project similarly when
the project is being closed all
processes of project closing groups
should be applied for instance identify
risks is a process of project planning
group so when the project is in planning
phase you must identify all the risks of
the project next let's see what
knowledge area is as per pin bug ID
there are 10 knowledge areas a knowledge
area is a set of specific processes
performed to meet a project objective
let us now consider processes there are
47 processes these processes might be
accomplished in the project planning
process group and a few others in
project monitoring and controlling
process group for example develop
schedule one of the processes is a part
of the planning process group and the
project time management knowledge area
