welcome back to the simply learned
studio and with us today is Jamie shanks
author educator and CEO of sales for
life Jamie's at the forefront of the
social selling movement that's taking
over the sales and marketing process in
leading companies today I'm your host
Michael Stebbins and today we'll be
discussing the balance of power between
marketing and the sales department Jamie
welcome to the studio and for those of
us who haven't started serving this wave
tell us what social selling is and why
it's important to up-and-coming
professionals today Mike it's a great
pleasure having you what I want you to
do is picture a buyer's journey and the
reality is is that the buyer is learning
without you whether you like it or not
and statistics from ceb corporate
executive board would say that
fifty-seven percent of that buying
journey on average and a b2b company is
happening without your sales
professionals so all that social selling
is is meeting the buyer halfway meeting
them where they're conducting due
diligence which is online and leveraging
digital insights and assets to strike up
conversations and help them along that
journey so as an expansion of that Mike
what I want everybody to do is picture a
Venn diagram of three different circles
intersecting together and all that
social selling is a mixture of trigger
based selling insights based selling and
referral based selling except that it's
being mechanized through tools like
LinkedIn to help speed up that process
for salespeople all right Jamie so some
of us know about these areas of social
selling but really what does it look
like in the day-to-day if we're talking
about in the trenches what does a sales
rep do every day to take advantage okay
perfect so first and foremost I want you
to think of it as an additive process
this is not a replacement don't cut your
phone line off stop sending emails this
is a
of an additive approach I like another
arrow in the quiver that you should
think about how do i apply social every
deal every account that I'm managing
every single day for no more than 30 to
60 minutes a day because if I like spent
a big Stelling more energy than that
then it's detracting from other sales
activities so as tactical examples three
tactical examples and again that Venn
diagram which is research our insights
triggers and referral so let's go to the
first one insights every single account
that I'm working I need to if I'm using
a football analogy move the ball 10
yards I need to consistently get first
downs so as an insights based seller I'm
working with my content marketing team
to find a very specific asset to
leverage at a very specific time within
my customers buying journey and I'll
share these insights with them on a
weekly or bi-weekly basis to help them
through that process so they think of me
first as a trigger based sales
professional you can mechanize linkedin
to provide you job change alerts on all
of your name two counts people that are
being hired into that account or people
that are leaving that account to open up
doors at future you know you're using
one advocate to open up another door so
that's trigger based selling but mean
mechanize through tools like linkedin
and then the third is referral based so
i found in sales for life based on this
simple concept called the sphere of
influence which is roadmapping the
relationships of one person to the next
person using tools like linkedin to ask
for introductions or to open doors based
on that you know shared common life
experience Jimmy you mentioned that
content is important to be able to
empower the sales reps where is the
balance of control I mean the marketing
team doesn't want sales reps taken over
the social channel in the content and
the email marketing manager should have
a panic attack if 500 sales reps are
emailing content without compliance
who's in control yeah so I'm the biggest
believer and maybe this is a guy's
analogy but I'm going to use a military
analogy the best is that marketing is
the general that controls
the artillery shells okay so marketing's
job is to help the organization create
organize distribute and then evaluate
the engagement of that in a continuous
loop they control all of the digital
assets in the development and production
of creating those the you know the
arsenal the sales professionals are your
distribution army we can't just rely on
the social media networks of the
corporation linkedin twitter facebook
and so forth you want to leverage the
tens hundreds or thousands of sales
professionals you have to be brands
within a brand so a great come so a good
company thinks of it as the general 22
soldier analogy a great company thinks
about it as in a consistent feedback
loop we call the IP transfer loop
Intellectual Property Transfer loop and
what that means is that the sales
professionals take insight from the
field they're hearing customer
objections and problems they then go to
the content marketing team and they say
these are the three objections I keep
getting let's build a objection handling
you know why and how based infographics
ebooks podcast whatever it is to help
answer the questions that our buyers are
having the marketing team builds it
brings it back to the sales team which
then distributes it to the market that
market provides new feedback and the
loop continues and it continues a great
company sees it as sales and marketing
integration or alignment and so both are
responsible but I think in an average to
good company you'll see it as a general
too you know soldier at allergy it
sounds like it's symbiotic it sounds
like the marketing team is producing the
content and they're asking sales to use
the channels to distribute it you
mentioned earlier no more than 60
minutes a day is that right correct so
when we have our reps under pressure
under that quota pressure a sales
professionals we know that this is often
the priority the sales manager is going
to come in and say hey deliver now today
I want to see what you're going to be
doing
this week how do we come at them and
tell them to take this time even if it's
60 minutes to have a social conversation
with their audience yeah that's
a--that's I I would say the number one
question that a regional vice president
district vice president or chief sales
officer has about social selling and I
think many times let's look at it from
short tail and long tail so there is no
question that many of the activities of
social selling are a long tail pipe line
driver that sets yourself up for one
quarter from now or one year from now
that's that doesn't mean to say that
there aren't short term activities you
could be doing such as job change alerts
I mean that's a very simple but I think
one of the problems of why companies
don't make it a priority even under the
gun of the last 30 days before the end
of the quarter is because they don't see
the empirical evidence and relationship
between the activity of sharing content
and that content going into the market
and creating net new incremental inbound
leads into the system because they
promoted you know an e-book or a webinar
or whatever it is that attracted new
potential buyers back in the system it
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and I
think that companies that get it don't
slow down their social selling
activities even during the impact
periods of time of and whether your
mutton your measured monthly or
quarterly they don't slow it down
because they know it's not only creating
net new inbound leads today but those
net new inbound leads are going to fuel
my my quota attainment as a sales
professional 90 days 180 days from now
so unfortunately I believe it's a lack
of education sales sales leaders think
they could take a magic pill and social
selling is like a widget let's just
let's install it and let's let's just
make it work well no no this is like a
behavioral change that never stops once
you turn it on you don't stop it you
don't even slow it down and what it does
is hockey
stick growth quarter by quarter over
time I know the jet doesn't that
probably doesn't give every RVP the warm
and fuzzies that's just the reality of
any new you know behavioral change it
within your business if we are in sales
we're not looking for the warm and
fuzzies anyway right what we're looking
for is something that could replace or
perhaps is already replacing the callout
section if somebody's making a call
block of 30 calls and you come in and
say look take 60 minutes to address your
audience online where they will pick up
your communication is this a reasonable
replacement I'll give you a real life
example so it's Monday and on mondays we
do a round table within our organization
and everybody talks about their Franklin
Covey rocks there are three rocks
they're driving for the quarter one of
our STRs that sales development
representatives who's responsible for
taking the inbound leads and converting
them from marketing qualified lead to
sales qualified lead and also doing
outbound campaigns fifty percent of that
sales professionals pre-qualified leads
or sales qualified leads have been
because of social conversations number
that's number one number two it's it's
definitely not a replacement of the
phone that same SDR talks to every
prospect via the phone emails every
prospect leaves voicemails with every
prospect but also as an additive
approach has connected with them on
LinkedIn once a week shares content with
them introduces them to other people in
their network that they are within his
network that they might not know so
socially surrounding the buyer happens
along side with the phone so what I do
find is that every sales professional
can always look at their own time
management and strip away some of the
useless stuff social is just part of
this the same cadence though the calls
going to go out to that inbound lead
anyways but they're also leveraging
social along that process okay so it
doesn't replace it goes alongside and
enhances is that what I'm hearing yeah
it goes alongside the only part that
replaces is the word cold in cold
calling you know why you don't need to
even if these are named accounts that
you've been given based on a geography
or these are outbound accounts you want
to touch you don't need to approach them
cold you can you can strike up a social
relationship first or most importantly
you can add value first leveraging
insights and content before you pick up
the phone and then call the people that
you've seen that have created engagement
all the sudden the calls not cold
anymore it's a little bit warmer simple
statistic corporate visions and
foresters did a joint collaboration they
found that seventy-four percent of
customers choose the buyer or the sales
professional that was first to provide
value and insight in the deal let's
think about this I teach you something
new the probability is that three months
six months down the road when you need
something you'll come to me because I
helped you I taught you I didn't just
sell you your trusted advisor your
trusted advisor and our sales
professionals are trained to make sure
that every interaction they're adding a
little bit of value and before you pick
up the phone call we're either calling
people that are engaged with us or we're
going to start the conversation with
content first then make the call that
makes sense so most areas of sales 20
we've seen technology playing a bigger
and bigger role what are some of the
technologies and the tools behind social
selling and specifically I want to know
the tools that you see as applies to a
small and medium business who's new to
this or an enterprise because I know
you've seen both yeah so our company's
15 employees so i'll talk about it from
the SMB the small business standpoint
and then our customers our enterprise so
then i'll talked about it from that
perspective at our business there are
the spine and the heart or the spine in
the brain or whatever you wanted the
analogy is your CRM and your marketing
automation platform right like must must
must no matter how small your business
is you need to leverage marketing
automation specifically because you
originally thought marketing automation
was for
bound email campaigns it is not the real
value is attaching UTM parameters as an
example which is a technical term for
tagging content and social platforms and
everything that you do so that you can
then dissect what we call the content
consumption story of all of your buyers
all of the customers that buy I can see
the digital fingerprints of what they
were reading what pages they're on our
website what is the volume velocity and
frequency that they're doing all of this
so I can extrapolate trends and those
trends allow me to create prescriptive
antidotes to improve in our process so
the marketing automation platform and of
course a CRM are your backbone above and
beyond that we because we use hubspot as
our marketing automation platform we
then use sidekick as a sales tool that
shows us real time alerts whenever a
buyer or a prospect of ours is touching
any of our digital assets and based on
those touch points we're calling them
talking to them in real time that I mean
you don't have to blow your brains out
from a tech stack standpoint and you can
use LinkedIn free or premium you can use
Twitter you can use buffer to up a
buffer or feedly to be able to not only
aggregate third party content but to
also disseminate that content in the
market or you could use HootSuite or
Hulett these are all tools that a small
business can acquire for free but then
you'll also you're going to need the
marketing automation platform and of
course of CRM at an enterprise level
where you start bolting things on our
two major text acts a two major
technologies one is you need to now
scale and mechanize social activity
primarily in our customer base that's
business to business linkedin is the
power player so companies will get
linked in sales navigator which is
incredible for account based sellers to
be able to tag their accounts and
contacts and be able to socially
surround those accounts contacts the
other is called employee advocacy
because when you start having 5s are 50
100 500 5
and sales professionals you have an
engagement problem and you have sales
professionals that aren't engaging the
market and you know that if you've got
1,000 sales professionals sharing your
digital assets you create a massive
inbound lead generation machine so
you'll mechanize it by getting them
employee advocacy tools that make it
dead simple for them to disseminate
content in the market strike up social
conversations and you can gamify it and
of course you track engagement all those
you know nice things so those are like
them yet companies go crazy with tools
and I'm a huge believer that you first
change the mindset then you change the
skill set and then you change the tool
kit so that's some people first right
people in process first then the tools
come up you know it sounds like the the
technology and the tools that you're
describing go into two categories one
that collects the implicit data of
somebody's likes needs wants and then
the second category where we're picking
up when they're most excited about
moving through our funnel so when
they're engaged with our website when
they're reading and this empowers the
rep to know when to respond to folks and
the implicit data tells them what to
respond with the combination sounds
absolutely powerful Jamie guy I totally
so this podcast has been helpful for an
overview but beyond this what resources
do you recommend for people to get help
when setting up social selling I find it
like LinkedIn sales solutions has a blog
great blog to read on the topic there
are marketing organizations like I find
that social selling and digital content
marketing like digital content marketing
is a byproduct of successful social
sellers or vice versa you know whichever
you look at it hub spots got a great
blog Heinz and marketing has got a great
blog you and you guys create tons of
great concept market motives so now what
we do at sales for life is if you read
our ebooks that are infographics all
that we've done is we've distilled it
down to a prescriptive process and it's
that the how do you get from A to B in
90 days and scale it but
globally that's all that we've done so
if you're interested in learning the
roadmap of implementing social song you
know across the Americas or globally
check out some of our new ebooks and we
have an incredible library now Jamie
you've been generous and sharing and
light light folks to know about your
company tell us who should check you out
and what they'll get from sales for life
yeah so as you mentioned I'm the CEO of
sales for life and what we've done is
we've built the world's largest social
selling training curriculum for
business-to-business sales professionals
and marketing professionals it's a
crowdsource model with 60,000 students
in our system and it's constantly
evolving as social does so to answer
your question there are three types of
people that should check us out your
sales leader and you're looking you walk
the floors of your sales force and you
say to yourself I have some serious
random acts of social going on I see
Johnny who's incredible with LinkedIn
and Sally never turns the thing on so
that random acts of social we need to
start standardizing we need to sell as
one unit so that's the Sales
Professional then you have the marketer
the digital content marketing team has
real problems with whether it's a
creation process or a distribution and
engagement problem it just can't figure
out why I what's the statistics
sixty-seven percent of content is going
on shared I think that's a serious
decision statistic that's what social
selling helps change you need to change
the mindset of the sales professionals
to help power up that content marketing
through marketing and then the final one
is sales enablement you're the glue
between sales and marketing you're part
of the operations the text stack the
training and engagement and enablement
and you need to figure out how to
interweave social into your current
sales methodology we've we clearly crack
the code here you know with 250
engagements in 60,000 sales and
marketing professionals trained so
that's those are the three types of
buyers that would approach us well done
