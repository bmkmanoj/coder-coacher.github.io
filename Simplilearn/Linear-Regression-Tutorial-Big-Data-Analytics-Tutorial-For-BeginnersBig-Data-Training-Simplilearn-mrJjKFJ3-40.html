that illustrates the concept of linear
regression in this graph the dependent
variable y is plotted on the y axis and
the independent variable is plotted on
the x axis the dots in orange are the
observed values of the dependent
variable the fitted linear regression
line is drawn in blue let us now look at
the graph in detail for the given
scatterplot data a regression line has
been fitted the regression line is the
line with the smallest possible set of
distances between itself and each data
point as you can see the regression line
touches some data points but not others
the slope of the line is given by the
coefficient beta is shown here as a blue
dotted line the intercept alpha is the
difference between the origin and the
regression line as shown in the figure
the line is fitted using the equation
mentioned in the previous slide that is
y equals alpha plus beta times X plus
Epsilon for an input X I the predicted
values shown here from the line the
observed value for X I can be seen from
the orange dot the difference between
the observed and predicted value is
denoted by epsilon or the random error
in the next slide we will look at the
coefficient of determination for linear
regression the coefficient of
determination denoted by r-squared is a
measure of goodness of fit that is how
well a statistical model like a lion
or curve fits the data r-squared is
calculated in different ways for
different models for a simple linear
regression r-squared is calculated of
the square of correlation coefficient
between the observed and predicted
values we will now look at how different
values of r-squared are interpreted in
the first figure the line is perfectly
horizontal and the r-squared is 0 which
implies no linear relationship in the
second figure the r-squared value is
minus 1 implying a negative linear
relationship the last figure denotes an
r-squared value of +1 denoting a
positive linear relationship in the next
slide we will look at ways to determine
the goodness of a model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
