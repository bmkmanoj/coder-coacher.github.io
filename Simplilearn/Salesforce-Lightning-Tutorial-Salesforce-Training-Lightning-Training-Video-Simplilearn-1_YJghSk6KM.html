developer hi Brian recently I started
exploring the various features of
Salesforce I think it'll be a great
platform to showcase my apps I couldn't
agree with you more
Salesforce is a great platform to
showcase your apps however I'm unable to
understand the concept of lightning
components
I'm also unable to grasp how it is
different from visualforce then you are
at the right place at the right time in
this lesson we will explain the concept
of lightning components we'll also
discuss how it differs from visualforce
awesome let's begin right away the first
topic will be installing lightning
components remember the following points
when installing lightning components
components are found on the app exchange
components are free or paid users can
view popular or purpose specific
components and each component is rated
for mobile devices tablets or desktops
in short a lightning component is
similar to that of a widget if you're
familiar with the concept of a widget a
component is something that can be
installed modified changed and used in
different ways from within Salesforce
lightning so when you install a
component think of it like a you know
task specific app just for that purpose
and then you can assemble and put those
components together in Salesforce so
let's jump over to the app exchange and
see the process of installing a
component a component
so here we are on the Salesforce app
exchange first click on components
and you can see here there's a list of
components that are available now if you
scroll down you can click on any of
these and see some additional details
about the component itself for example
we're looking at this currency
conversion tool doesn't have any ratings
yet and it's free so you can install
this lightning component to convert
amounts and currencies in Salesforce
or let's say for example you want to you
know capture signatures you can use this
signature capture component as well in
this case we're going to scroll down
here and check out the multi view
calendar component I'm going to go ahead
and click on it here
so at this point it's going to look very
similar to an app on the app exchange
except this is considered to be a
component as you can see there here you
can also see what devices are supported
phone tablet desktop etc and you can see
that it's used in the app builder so
over on the right-hand side I'm going to
click this get it now button and I'm
going to be prompted to log in so I'm
going to click on login to the app
exchange so at this point have the
option to choose installation and
production or sandbox I'm going to
choose sandbox
so now I'm going to agree to these
conditions and I see that it's a free
app so I don't have to pay anything and
I'm going to click on the confirm and
install button
at this point I've got my credentials
loaded in so I'm going to click on login
to sandbox
now on this page I can choose who I want
to grant access to this specific app
here I can choose install for all users
specific roles or admins only I'm going
to choose install for all users I want
everyone to be able to see this
component so I'm going to click on the
install button here so now we can see
that the installation process has
completed and we're going to be taken
directly into the Salesforce lightning
view here so now that Salesforce
lightning has loaded we're going to jump
over here into the setup area under
quick fine we're going to check out
install and check out our installed
packages here you can see that the multi
view calendar component has been
successfully installed
so if you want to actually see what's in
this component you can click on the view
components button and then when the page
loads you'll be able to see what
actually was included with this
component here you can see we have a
lightening component bundle a few static
resources and some apex classes so as
you can tell it's very simple to find a
component on the app exchange and
install it into Salesforce
the next topic we'll discuss is
lightening component capability keep in
mind the following points components are
effective for managing and visualizing
data such as report graphs and charts
feeds can be displayed from chatter or
other updates in Salesforce components
are great productivity enhancers with
shortcuts and action buttons components
are used by salespeople to quickly
create leads in Salesforce one so the
major difference between you know with
component capabilities is that you can
quickly install these pre-built pre
bundled you know many applications into
Salesforce and then aggregate them
together so the lightening components
allow you to create a modular system of
building apps and so you can install
those into Salesforce and use them to
create a larger more functional
application so the Lightning component
capabilities as they stand today are
largely used for managing your data and
visualizing your data and pretty much
anything that relates to you know
insights into or seeing information in
Salesforce for example you can quickly
view charts and reports and you can also
you know create your own custom screens
in Salesforce using those components so
as far as lightening components goes
developers need to create them and then
they upload them to the app exchange
where app builders and system
administrators can then download and
install those into Salesforce and use
them as they see fit hi there if you
