event and what happens during the
different stages the event life cycle
starts with event occurring once the
event has happened it is detected
filtered according to the importance of
the event and a notification is issued
which could be an email and SMS logged
in a tool or simply a flag on the
monitoring dashboard once the event
notification is issued it is classified
either as informational warning or an
exceptional event we have discussed the
classification of event earlier in the
key terminology lesson after
classification the events are correlated
which is to say a correlation engine
usually part of a management tool
compares the event with a set of
criteria and rules in a prescribed order
for example number of similar events for
example a business application report
that there have been an unusual pattern
of usage of a mobile telephone that
could indicate that the device has been
lost or stolen whether the event
represents an exception it could be a
comparison of utilization information in
the event with a maximum or minimum
standard for example has a device
exceeded a threshold categorization of
the event and may be assigning a
priority level to the event if the
correlation activity recognizes an event
a response will be required the
mechanisms used to initiate that
response is called a trigger this
response is the next step in the event
life cycle some of the responses might
be to log the event and observe or
automated responses for the event well
understood like for example server
reboots or it may be that an incident
needs to be logged or it could be that a
human intervention in the form of an
escalation is required for example
security events
and so on with the response selection
the event is typically passed on to
other processes and is managed there on
but the final step in an event lifecycle
is closure before the event is closed
selected events are chosen for review to
see if the process is working fine or in
other words if the event has been
handled appropriately some events will
remain open until a certain action takes
place for example an event that is
linked to an open incident however most
events are not opened or closed
informational vents are simply logged
and then used as input to other
processes such as backup and storage
management auto response events will
typically be closed by the generation of
a second event for example a device
generates an event and is rebooted
through auto response as soon as that
device is successfully back online it
generates an event that effectively
closes the loop and clears the first
event these concepts are illustrated and
explained in the next slides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
