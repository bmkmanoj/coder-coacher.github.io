financial risk manager frm are one of
the frm exam covers the fundamental
tools and techniques used in risk
management and the theories that
underlie their use black skulls Merton
model
welcome to the fortieth lecture in your
preparation for the frm exam in the last
session we learn to price the option
using the binomial model however we have
used discrete steps of only six months
or one year for each change in the price
of the option in this session we will
learn about the black skulls Merton
model that is based on a continuous
change in the price of the option agenda
the blank skulls Merton model will be
the main agenda of our discussion will
first begin by discussing stock price
and return distributions we will then
discuss the assumptions underlying the
model we will then learn to compete the
European option using this model we will
also see how blanks approximation can be
used to evaluate American options that
pay dividends finally we will end the
session by deriving the value of the
volatility implied by the market value
of the option using the same blanks
goals of Merton model stock price and
return distributions
let us begin our session by first
learning about stock price distributions
we have earlier studied that the stock
price follows a log normal distribution
a log normal distribution is shown in
the slide it has a positive skew the
property of a local function is such
that its logarithm follows a normal
distribution as in the second chart the
logarithm of the stock price follows a
normal distribution with the parameters
as given in the slide which is a
function of the stock price at the
initial time the expected return on the
stock the volatility of the stock
and the time to expiry the expected
return from a stock is given by the
formula on the right side which is the
initial stock price multiplied by e
raised to the power of Nu T the mean
return on a stock is a function of the
expected return on the stock and the
volatility realized return and
historical volatility realized return is
calculated as a geometric mean return
across the period for example we can
compute the geometric return of the last
five years stock return to arrive at the
annualized realized return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
