about physics or typically how it works
and what are the different models we are
having a baby we'll be learning about
those things and will be knowing
horrible between for this but before I
start talking about a 50 Let Me Silly
Walks tftp because we need to understand
both the RTV then we can move on to
understand for a 50-piece to keep our
see dr filiz enterprise resource
planning to easily what happen leave how
dependent models for different effects
of applications in the city to
illustrate with PRP east and first
anyways well above ordinary see our tent
both reported significant difference if
you text me in the studio my name is in
smartest to hear what happened normally
be still housing status the business we
will be having the ability to do this
for example we have 5 m for every
release we start of the mid money then
we need to have money then we need to
have mercy then we need to have
materials where we can convert into
facebook then we need to have the market
will resent them work b2b whether it
will support your family planning for
every reduce you have a particular model
for example for months we have the 30
persons with the current formerly we
have finance and progress with each
people for machines we have TV for the
plan then force materiel we have
material management the baby for market
we have healthy and fear so yes impress
me as well established organization
resources whatever reason we're having
both book together planning we left off
that way for a particular bull or less
profit
so here's we planet so EF is a business
of baby where we work mon amour
resources and all those built over was
bc v8a d stands for system of the beetle
and forest will be the boxes at the
general standard company to believe it
baby if the dimensional somebody hazards
abuse the transport system of the uses
and products will be the processes so
normally system since our regular
computers application since distant
distant morally good morning Peter
welcome to building them as people go to
fly the let me introduce myself and take
this and hamper 53 responses of the
pages today we will be talking about
what they see pts and how it is useful
to us and what are the different
mortgage emergency before we start
talking about 50p let's begin with we
have been to enough hands wat BR TT BR
peace and forth and comprise the good
planning say something like a business
up with babies were founded sleep and
for taking fright well established
organization registered for example to
start up any dessert v5n money runs must
be material market these are the result
of graves with we leave the start of a
particular business see sample plan so
when we a well established organization
and taking all the resources we plan for
a particular goals for less profit now
here
whatever the resistance we are having
like we have money money material men
wrestle decision together baby how the
particular model police reduces for
example for money we have demand which
is people for when we have a sir it is
the term human disease management for
material without but we'll management
the same before markets we have SD and
here we how many we have built in the
market you have the same differently at
this is a massive and a 15,000 years so
what hospital are most diseases why is
difficult i mean number one in the
marketing normally what happened
different we are pleased by this vest in
11 more disbelief particular model like
some is BS we might be buddhist plans
and eps might be good business SD and
all the things but when the question
comes of integration is not terms so
perfectly in other gear they began with
a good juices talking about acp taking
what happens when we litigate the other
models you get an accurate results and
your work is done very perfect you and
your results are very good so that's why
i say to expanding number one in the
massive so let's try to understand so
try to know about this easy i see these
tanks for system applications and
product news with the prophecy I say P
the german spanish company it is one of
the number one we have beaten the
massive the system consists of complex
degrees of different modules firm of the
TV is the Byzantines the basic business
process as i said you hear what happens
whenever you want it is English the
other model for example we have crm
integrative is being billeted with crm
and PA
to the VA so whenever you are working
when you integrate this particular
module we get an accurate results and
the volvo is the net very good manner
the SAV runs and of course generations
of baseball nests above programming
language Boris about and visit boilers
advance this list of leasing program how
this a city is divided will be
differences we have the TV function you
have big details you have babies ACP
function of the guys who are the work of
the painting completely about all the
business process and to work on the
point requirement so here the different
models whatever we are having Blake's
man pictured PRM mmm sd2 frm HTM so all
these are different more functional
model wave these consultants work on the
client requirement and these consultants
often work on I MVP I lv design
implementation guide with the
consultants will configure all the
configure the application according to
the point with one with the letter C
what's the next one so the second one we
have to be specific distance here the
spectacle guys are called as a buffer so
these are the guys who develop a
particular program where will design the
application according to the requirement
then we have bases the basis of the guys
who are for less trouble shooters these
are the people who are involved in
installing the software and whenever
they have a problem or they wanted to do
so many things to build it get involved
so we have many new the earth different
different models as if the dude has the
molding hasn't hasn't most important we
have returned we have as we we have crm
we have so deep into things modules and
we have the latest additions also him as
they seem to the crm if you
p m SP asaram SPM always of the new
model irregular activity so I have said
you will be talking about the
integration so normally what happens
whenever the escapees will to give it
with other model we get an accurate
result so a 50 use an interpreter place
Wizards planning of this Boris capable
of integrating multiple business of the
uses with each of the pieces
representing a specific business area
these applications of faith and process
transactions in real time just allow
slimming effortless litigation and
communication between the media's of
business say and whatever suffers beard
see every time we have different
different of nicotine for example
sometimes if government is different
another five to seventy percent so the
select different mode use the body to
the business courses here what they do
in the fac when all the applications are
integrated to the workflow is done in a
better manner and they get an accurate
result the talking about customization
so ASAP is always user-friendly layers
it satisfies all the customers we have
thousands of standard basis big for the
times with permission so in the
customization what we do this which
customized all the needs of fawning visa
slides with government whatever
requirement is with you take all the
sandwich and we customize them I still
make it visible for the client to run me
a poor manner we do that if it doesn't
meet the requirement also be developing
new things according to their
environment and see that it works for
them the to do is we use IM which is
ultimately thing guys i'll be showing
you off the BCTC wave in this recent if
you guys you can see all the systems of
time this way region customizes and
configure if and according to the client
requirement so this I only is the main
laser backbone for a 50 wave you
configure everything so here are few
things of the diesels like as I was
talking about spinnin so the finance
polar in the phone
phylidia we find all these necessary
things as I stab you every module have
exposed facility no talking about
finance so here we get all these things
simply go financial accounting
controlling interface control in English
management division management policies
the plane leaves in the human resources
we will be promoting on the Beatles
personally at least based in personal
development and all those things the
facts bills employee benefits employ
loss all these things comes in the human
resources the same is you have lodged
see here if you talk about project if
there are many modules which comes into
the Fitbit right logistics is the
largest of the green console period
salute among others the following models
which have 15 isn't this little it has
material management it has great house
management test production planning
which has similar effect and it also has
quality manager to use as a model
systems for our visa where the logistics
are using the same way view houses like
this luton models based on dismissing
model also we have different defenses we
have a master Rita will have the basic
functions steel to see all these things
are done in the tales of the sweetest
body so we have a new dimension called
less customer relationship management
everybody must be aware just the
customer base is very important room in
the business so here we have one
particular model for less if it is be
armed so CRM is a comprehensive solution
for managing your customer relationships
we supports all the focus business Vidya
from marketing to steal and service as
well as interactive panel the theorem is
one for three modules where the talk
about maintaining the relationship with
a particular customer here you'll be
studying a customer will be knowing a
customer and you'll be understanding a
customer and you will be the one way you
can satisfy the customer to every extent
the CRM plays a very important spoon the
theorem is broadly divided in the field
the marketing as well Esther be and we
have other other channels of the theorem
so the anthem with those tales and
officers also pyramid in world so after
this you see that will basically we have
defended bill model with we work on the
particular of the season and the beauty
of essays we visited the application is
user-friendly and the most important
things that integration is different
place with a very good manner and we
give an activist resistance so this is
something of all the ATP of beaters so
if we have any doubts regarding this 42
wanted to move in with me mode you can
contact me to any power mode or there if
you wanted to punish the linear so is
matters with all nations call me and to
know everything and whatever the
regarding platters and all the citizens
often now I'll show you tada I in the
epilogue on novices wave we can we
understand easily so this is a safety
logo where we log on to find hi Angie so
once we log on so this is a scream of a
50 CRM through the latest 17 dot C so
this is Paul imv implementing guys
removed with a consultant will get
involved and we will configure juicing
everything based on the point with
permit so here the goofball h3r oh my MV
so here if you wanted to configure
anything for example now if you wanted
to maintain an authorization everybody
knows it organizations to organize a
season set up of the particular
operational hierarchical month so if you
want to set up an organization so we
lose this past eight pieces imz let me
go for CRM
let the mass the leader then we go for
authorization management then we go for
organization motive so here we have to
type here we have great organization
model and we have senior management
model so whenever you're planning to
create a new organization mode is we go
for creative menacing mobile and
whenever you plan to add up we will see
this for your particular organization
and/or billeting will begin to feel your
name is a model so I a safety if you
want you can go to the bus pass also or
if you watch the Euston spurt is less
than good design universal garage for
example he goes with 13 verse FTB small
advantage sample which is a particular
cold wave between therapy is this real
fur depressed please new subject matter
for example if I wanted to go forth in
your mail if you notice I use it be both
g0n here and the fifth we r m where have
the directly going to this particular
please so we can work on sending money
then be this this was something a small
intellect novel to take you and get
behind the diversity forum at the DC so
I hope we have like this so this is one
interesting when we have seen what are
the different modules and we have haha
sighs understand more about CRM tomorrow
the data means less we'll be talking
more dvds suppose for CRM is and what is
this importance of CRM how does this
module something that you state what are
the various particular involved with CRM
and all the things and you will be
talked to be seen as received in detail
in the coming GM surface the biggest
view is Alex last time to tumors probe's
pieces and have a racist thank you
