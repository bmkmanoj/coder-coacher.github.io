minitab statistical capabilities part 2
hello and welcome to simply learns
elearning course on Minitab this is part
two of the fifth session and the last
session in this course there are quizzes
at the end of every session and you are
strongly advised to answer them before
you move on to the next session this
session takes you through the part 2 of
the statistical capabilities of minitab
and how you can analyze your data
statistically agenda let us now look at
the agenda of this session in this
session we learn the scenarios where
these tools are used and how to analyze
and interpret our data in Minitab using
the following tests design of
experiments control charts let us now
look at each of these in detail business
scenarios the tools like design of
experiments and control charts are most
commonly used in the following business
scenarios design of experiments is used
to understand the impact of various
factors to a process and also to
understand the interaction within
various factors this helps to take
important decisions on which factor to
change to have the desired changes to
the process control charts are used to
track process statistics over time and
to detect the presence of special causes
in the process special causes result in
variation that can be detected and
controlled statistical tools design of
experiments do e let us start by looking
at how to use design of experiments in
minitab design of experiments in this
topic we will cover understanding of
design of experiments or do ii how to
set up a factorial design how to analyze
the
factorial design how to use factorial
plots for main effects and how to use
vectorial plots for interactions design
of experiments do ii helps you to screen
the factors to determine which are
important for explaining a certain
process variation understand how factors
interact and drive your process find the
factor settings that produce optimal
process performance
