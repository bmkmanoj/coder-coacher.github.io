coming up with workarounds for them is
called problem management in the context
of ITIL a problem is the cause of one or
more incidents or potential incidents
the cause may not be known at the time
of incidents occurrence problems are
initially classified as incidents and
are documented in problem records a
workaround is a temporary way to restore
service failures to an operational level
example rebooting a server the reason
behind the servers failure may not be
known however on rebooting the service
can be restored workarounds are used for
reducing or eliminating the impact of an
incident or problem for which a full
resolution is not yet available
workarounds for problems are documented
in known error records and workarounds
for incidents that do not have
associated problem records are
documented in the corresponding incident
records incident or problem records are
created in the service management tool
in the next screen
let us discuss known errors and a known
error database once a problem is
identified based on its priority effort
is directed towards finding the root
cause a temporary fix or a workaround
might be used to restore services to a
usable level for the time being the
moment a workaround or an unresolved
root cause to the problem is found it
becomes a known error and IT services
are aware of the issue known errors are
managed throughout their lifecycle with
the problem management process
development teams or suppliers may also
identify known errors for example
application and compatibility reports
for Windows by Microsoft a database is
created for known errors workarounds and
their solutions this database is called
known error database or ke dB
it helps in faster diagnosis and
resolution of incidents in the next
screen we will discuss the priority of
an event and how it is calculated
priority means the relative importance
of an incident problem or change it is
used to identify required times for
action to be taken
for example the service level agreement
or SLA may state that priority two
incidents must be resolved within 12
hours priority is calculated based on
the impact and urgency of the issue
impact is the measure of the effect the
issue has on the business processes of
IT service support urgency is how soon
the issue can be handled priority equals
impact plus urgency
