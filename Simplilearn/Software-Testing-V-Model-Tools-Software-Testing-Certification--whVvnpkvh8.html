available tool let us try and learn how
they can fit into V model we covered in
Session two requirement testing tools
are used for requirement analysis
functional designs technical design and
coding activities these tools often help
in capturing requirements using
intuitive models once requirements are
recorded the tool can generate high
level architecture design and even code
the inbuilt logic of the tool also helps
in identifying gaps in the requirements
test design and test data preparation
tools can be used the once requirements
are frozen these tools can generate
automatic test cases from requirements
and also support automatic creation of
test data static analysis tools come
handy during design and coding phases by
identifying gaps in the code on the one
side of the model we can use coverage
measure tools and debugging tools during
component testing tools like test
harness and drivers and dynamic analysis
tools are used during integration
testing performance measurement tools
are used in system testing and
acceptance testing to measure the system
performance test run and comparison
tools are used in all levels of testing
to compare results of now we will try
and understand a bit more about each
type of tool and features of these
testing tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
