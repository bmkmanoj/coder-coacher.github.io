and today I'm going to try to answer the
question what is machine learning have
you guys ever wondered how Facebook is
able to perform facial recognition or
how companies are able to bombard you
with the products all over social media
all of this is because of machine
learning so in this session I'll be
taking you through some of the important
concepts of machine learning so first
we'll talk about some of the real-life
applications where machine learning is
applied some of the challenges people
faced before machine learning came about
how things change for machine learning
over time why you should be interested
in using machine learning what exactly
is machine learning some of the types of
machine learning some algorithms of
machine learning with some simple
examples some of the breakthroughs that
machine learning brought about and what
a career in machine learning entails you
all know that machine learning plays an
integral role in our day-to-day lives
now let's talk about some of the places
where it's applied I'm sure you guys
need no introduction to Netflix and it
fixes where we get our daily fix for
shows and movies now say you watch the
show like Game of Thrones now as soon as
you're done Netflix recommends a movie
like Lord of the Rings how is Netflix
able to make such a recommendation say
you uploaded a photo onto Facebook now
as soon as this photos uploaded Facebook
is able to tell who's in the photo House
Facebook able to do that but how is
Facebook able to suggest friends on the
basis of the profiles you've gone
through your mutual friends or the
locations you've been to save just made
an online transaction using PayPal now
how does PayPal know that the
transaction you made is the legitimate
one as you know there are millions of
transactions taking place at the same
time how does PayPal differentiate
between what is real and what isn't so
now that you know where machine learning
is applied you might be wondering how is
life before machine learning to help you
understand I'll take you through some of
the problems people faced before machine
learning before machine learning became
so widely used AI systems were mostly
rule-based which means that these rules
failed in real-life scenarios most of
their state representations had to be
manually code
and this manually coded was hand coded
as anyone knows hand coding is quite
difficult but the main disadvantage was
that these problem scenarios or test
scenarios would fail outside what their
roles were coded for that is they would
not be very useful in real-life
applications even though they work
pretty well inside their controlled
environments so it's clear that things
were pretty grim before machine learning
so what changed let's take a trip down
memory lane to see how machine learning
evolved over time can you think of a
time when machine learning wasn't so
much a part of our lives fifty years ago
that would have been the case that's not
to say that machine learning didn't
exist back then it was just that wasn't
so important to them as it is to us now
so things began to change in the 1950
when Alan Turing came up with the Turing
machine now the Turing test determine if
a computer had real intelligence of its
own in 1997 Garry Kasparov the World
Chess Champion was beaten by IBM D blue
which was their AI in 2010 Microsoft
Kinect was released which was an
accessory of the gaming console Xbox 360
people could interact with computers
using gestures in 2014 Facebook's deep
face or face recognition system was
introduced which could hit a mine who
was pressing in the photo in 2016
google's alphago which is there a I beat
the world champion at the game of Go so
what's next for machine learning the
possibilities seem endless so we'll talk
about this a little while later in
further detail now let's talk about why
machine learning is so important and why
you should be interested in it machine
learning has changed our lives in
several significant ways let's stop but
why it allows powerful processing which
means it can process through far more
complicated data
hence the decisions that we make will be
much more well-founded and the
predictions are much more accurate not
only does it allow powerful processing
but also quicker processing that is more
work is done in less a time the outputs
that we obtained are much more accurate
now when you think Big Data you think a
lot of data now this large mass of data
has to be stored somewhere and when this
is stored it also has to be managed so
with machine learning you can perform
affordable data management a machine
learning method is also considerably
less expensive the most important part
is as we get more and more data the more
and more complex it gets and machine
learning allows us to analyze complex
Big Data so what exactly is machine
learning machine learning is a method
that allows computers to imitate and
adapt to human-like behavior so the
machine analyzes past data learns from
that data and makes decisions or
predictions the computer is training
itself to perform the task the right way
based on everything it can learn from
the past data the computer is creating
its own logical solutions all of which
without any form of human assistance or
intervention these systems learn grow
change and develop themselves when
exposed to new data now that you know
what machine learning is let's talk
about some of its types machine learning
is divided into three major types
supervised learning unsupervised
learning and reinforcement learning ever
imagined how difficult a mail handling
would be if Gmail didn't know what was
Pam and what wasn't your inbox would be
quite the mess wouldn't it
but this is where the first type of
machine learning comes in supervised
machine learning the email clients like
Microsoft Outlook and Gmail use spam
filtering methods to ensure that the
users are kept safe from spam these spam
filters are regularly kept updated with
help of supervised machine learning the
supervised machine learning is a method
where a model after sufficient training
is able to make predictions for the
future in a way a question/answer
pattern is formed when a question and
answer are given as input the machine
learns from it and when our new data is
encountered it is able to make a
prediction
now take this image for example the past
data is shown as a box of triangles and
circles when new data which is the
circle and a triangle are encountered
the machine is able to determine that
the triangle goes in the box of
triangles and a circle goes in the box
of circles now let's talk about
unsupervised machine learning imagine
you just added a photo onto Facebook
as soon as that photos uploaded there's
a good chance that Facebook is able to
identify who's in the photo and
recommend this person be tagged in the
photo now this is done with the help of
unsupervised learning
now unsupervised learning only deals
with input data it ensures that the data
is more readable and organized it
analyzes the input data to find out
patterns or similarities or anomalies in
them this model is able to learn from
observations hence it's able to find
structures and relationships among the
input data now let's come back to
Facebook now how it's able to identify
people is by taking your friends photos
as the data set it then compares the
faces and the features of the people
present in your photo hence it's able to
identify who's in it now take this image
that you see above as an example in the
input we have a collection of circles
stars and triangles arranged in no
particular order so the machine learns
from it it's able to identify the
pattern and then organizes data as you
can see the output is still the
collection of circles triangles and
stars but now in a much more organized
manner now Netflix Amazon and several
other e-commerce websites use the same
method now let's talk about the last
type of machine learning reinforcement
learning what do you observe you see
that supervised learning is about making
a prediction an unsupervised learning is
about finding a hidden pattern but
reinforcement learning works completely
different it allows the computer to take
a decision based on past rewards for its
actions but this type of machine
learning is usually only to increase the
efficiency of a tool or a program now
there are three stages involved in
reinforcement learning there's the
decision
there's the feedback and the learning
now let me explain that with an example
of a game of chess the machine makes a
move which is the decision then it gets
to know whether the move was a good one
or a bad one which is the feedback then
it learns from the feedback the mobile
PC games that people play are also made
on the basis of reinforcement learning
that's the reason why when you open up a
game and replay a mission the same
enemies you see before aren't in the
same place each of these algorithms come
under each type of machine learning now
let's talk about some machine learning
algorithms the main objective of a
machine learning
algorithm is to solve a certain kind of
problem so to solve each of these
problems we have a particular algorithm
so under supervised machine learning we
have the classification problem and the
regression problem and under
unsupervised machine learning we have
the clustering and the Association
problems now let's talk about each of
these problems in detail a
classification problem comes from the
supervised machine learning so what we
require in a classification problem is a
yes or no prediction questions like
something belongs to a particular
category or not whether something is
broken and so on it can help determine
what category a given observation
belongs to in the simplest of terms
classification enables the machine to
classify something into a given class
now a very important use case of
classification is spam filtering now
let's talk about how that works to a
given system we provide spam and not
spam emails we are talking about
millions of emails now how do they
determine whether a given mail is spam
or not it's on the basis of how often
these mails are received how many of
them have words like lottery which are
usually associated with spam and how
many of them have been flagged as spam
by users now this is given to the
computer and it is learning from it
after it is learnt whenever new mail
strikes the inbox it is able to separate
them as spam or not spam classification
of this sort is done with the help of
the knave based algorithm now let's talk
about the regression problem that comes
under supervised machine learning now
any regression problem we try to predict
a value based on past data now you might
argue that regression and classification
sound pretty similar to each other and
you're right classification is also
determine on the basis of past data in
the differences that in case of
classification we are trying to classify
an observation into a given category in
case of regression we are trying to
predict a value based on past data also
a relation is created between the
different variables now let's talk about
weather prediction we have past data
like temperature wind speed humidity and
so on and on the basis that we can
determine how much rain was obtained but
this is given to the system and it
learns from it when new data is
encountered like temperature wind speed
and humidity the system will be able to
determine how much rain we'll get now
the most important things that you need
to remember is that the output that is
given at the end of the regression
problem is always quantitative in nature
also the output that we obtain is always
on the basis of past data the clustering
problem comes on the unsupervised
machine learning classroom is a method
where a set of observations are divided
into subsets each of the subsets are
known as clusters now the observations
inside these clusters are similar to one
another based on some parameter or the
other
now clustering has found use in several
fields such as shopping healthcare and
financial services clustering is
different from regression or
classification as both of them have some
sort of prior knowledge associated with
them but in the case of clusters all the
knowledge that's available from inside
the cluster and let me explain with an
example now say a network provider
wanted to set up towers in a particular
area what they'd be taking into
consideration would be to arrange local
geography and population now this is
given into the system the system learns
from it and then is able to divide the
area into clusters the clusters are
divided on the basis of optimal
locations where towers can be located to
ensure maximum connectivity for all the
users no popular algorithm that is used
in clustering is k-means which is used
to cluster data into K clusters based on
some similarity measures in the case of
the association problem we try to
identify patterns of association between
different variables and items now this
is commonly used in something known as
the Market Basket analysis now this is a
theory that says that if you buy a
certain group of items you're also
likely to buy another group of items now
the same concept could be applied to the
e-commerce industry say you buy a set of
books now the system learns from it and
is able to suggest a new set of books
the next time you try to do some
shopping now this is also used in the
healthcare industry before a new drug is
launched it is checked to determine what
kind of DNA it is sensitive to machine
learning is brought about some
extraordinary changes in the last few
years let's talk about some of them in
detail now ever since the dawn of AI
scientists have tried to ensure that
artificial intelligence systems try to
function like a human brain
now deepmind technologies which is a
British company is one with a similar
name the company now works on detecting
Ceaser's using machine learning we're a
digital scan of the eyes created to
determine if it has any diseases or not
when it was acquired by google in 2014
they created a computer network based on
the structure of the human brain they
also created a neural network that could
play video games on its own alphago is
an artificial intelligence system that
was created by deepmind technologies on
the basis of state of the art machine
learning techniques
alphago defeated the world's best player
at the complicated game go now the
latest version of alphago which is
called alphago zero only requires
scientists to input the rules of the
game for the system to be able to play
on its own now this is different from
the previous situations where each of
the move patterns had to be input into
40 processors for the system to be able
to play the game can you imagine how
comfortable our lives would be if cars
could travel from one point to another
without any sort of human intervention
thanks to machine learning and
artificial intelligence this dream is
becoming closer to reality now
self-driving car is one that travels
from one point to another without any
sort of human intervention
the self-driving cars have several
components some of the most important
ones are these self-driving sensors now
these detect curves in other cars while
parking there are lead are sensors that
monitor the edges of roads and lanes
there are cameras that detect a fake
lights pedestrians and other things on
the road there's a radar that monitors
the position of nearby vehicles now as I
mentioned before let's stop with the
future of machine learning in the future
you'd have deeper personalization which
means that you'd have more directed
marketing towards your interests and
advertisements based on a personal
preference self-driving cars although
it's a concept that's being worked out
right now it's not one that's reached
its completion in the future you would
have caused I can run flawlessly even on
the most crowded roads smarter
investment opportunities machine
learning could ensure that your profit
is maximized taking into consideration
your past purchases and the current
market scenario to suggest smarter
investment opportunities better medical
diagnosis although healthcare is a field
where machine learning is creating an
identity slowly but steadily it's not
reached the point where personalized
solutions can be given to patients in
the future
machine learning could change that I am
sure many of you are interested in
building a career in machine learning
let me tell you about some of the career
prospects someone skilled in machine
learning fills the shoes of a machine
learning engineer a machine learning
engineer aims to create artificial
intelligence now the program's the great
take decisions on their own without
being programmed to perform a particular
task now what are the skills of a
machine learning engineer mathematics
the concepts of mathematics help deal
with uncertainty and making reliable
predictions with the help of the tools
that they provide the fundamentals of
statistics
since most machine learning algorithms
are built on statistical models
knowledge in this field is very
important software design a strong
background in API is of various kinds
like Web API is static and dynamic
libraries are also important applying
machine learning libraries and
algorithms now understanding models the
learning procedures how packages API is
and other things work there potential
issues and how they apply to each
technology is very important data
modeling note is critical that the
concept of data modeling be understood
well to ensure that the algorithms that
are created are sound nature programming
languages since there's a large amount
of computations to be performed on huge
sets of data it is necessary that
concepts such as algorithms data
structures computer architecture and so
on understood well now what are the
responsibilities of a good machine
learning engineer data engineering that
is to ensure a good data flow between
database and back-end systems using
programming languages to run machine
learning experiments with machine
learning libraries to deploy machine
learning solutions into production
implementing custom machine learning
code and performing feature engineering
which is nothing but performing an
analysis over the data pre-processing
and several other processes
the graph here indicates the trends of
job postings in the field of machine
learning although there's a sharp dip
mid-2016 the spike indicates there is a
strong interest in hiring skilled
personnel evidently machine learning
provides greater opportunities in terms
of the job that can provide Google
Trends shown increased interest in the
topics related to machine learning the
machine learning market size is also
expected to grow from one point zero
three building to eight point eight 1
billion dollars by the year 2022 this
indicates a bright and clear future for
the individual skilled in the concept of
machine learning now let's go through
everything you learnt in the video first
we spoke about what is machine learning
which is a method where computers
imitate and adapt to human-like behavior
these systems take decisions on their
own based on past data we spoke about
the types of machine learning supervised
unsupervised and reinforcement learning
supervised learning where a model is
able to predict outputs based on past
data unsupervised learning where we
detect hidden patterns in input data and
reinforcement learning where a system's
next course of action is based on past
feedback we then went to machine
learning algorithms we spoke about some
of the problems that these algorithm
solved under supervised learning we have
classification where we determine a yes
or no protection regression where we
predict a value based on past data under
unsupervised learning
we saw clustering where observations are
divided into clusters an association
where we determine patterns of
association between different items or
variables we spoke about some of the
breakthroughs that machine learning
brought about like deep mind
alphago and cars that drive themselves
then finally we spoke of the skills of
machine learning engineer needs which
were mathematics the fundamentals of
statistics software design applying
machine learning libraries and
algorithms data modeling and programming
languages and that brings us to the end
