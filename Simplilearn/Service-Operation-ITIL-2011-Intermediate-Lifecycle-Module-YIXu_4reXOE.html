nine learning units so what are we
waiting for let's begin with the
introductory lesson agenda we will first
begin with the objective of this lesson
followed by a few recap topics that you
might have covered during your ITIL
foundation level the topics we will
cover are ITIL basic introduction ITIL
intermediate and its relevant topics
this is followed by information about
the accreditation Institute service
operation course description and its
objective we will then look at who can
attend this course next moving to the
exam section we will learn about the
exam prerequisites or say the
eligibility criteria for attending this
course exam format and the exam tips to
help you achieve this certification
lastly we will look at the service
operation course outline and the
duration required for each learning unit
and details about the quiz provided by
simply learn at the end of each learning
unit so go ahead and experience this
courseware
the objective of this introductory
lesson is to educate you on the
courseware that simply learn offers help
you on how this online course works
ensure that you are aware of all the
topics and subtopics covered in this
course let's now move on to refresh our
knowledge on ITIL basics in the next
line ITIL is the most widely adopted
approach for IT Service Management in
the world it provides a practical
no-nonsense framework for identifying
planning delivering and supporting IT
services to the business adopting ITIL
can offer users a huge range of benefits
that include improved IT services
reduced costs improved customer
satisfaction through a more professional
approach to service delivery improved
productivity improved use of skills and
experience and improved delivery of
third-party service we will study more
about ITIL under the topic foundation
basics at the end of this lesson let us
now understand the ITIL intermediate
which is the next level in ITIL
certification ITIL 2011 intermediate
level is the next level after ITIL
foundation ITIL intermediate level has a
modular structure with each module
focusing on different aspects of ITIL
they are service lifecycle and service
capability the intermediate modules
focuses more on detail oriented study
fan the foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification while
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course I am sure
the thought on how one can become an
ITIL expert must have crossed your mind
let's get the answer to this in the next
slide
let us have a brief look at the ITIL
certification path the diagram in the
slide is the graphical depiction of the
ITIL certification path ITIL
certification path is based on credit
point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage till expert ITIL foundation is the
first certification which gives you two
credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from the two streams one life cycle and
two capability the life cycle modules
have all the standard five life cycle
phases as exams which provide three
credits each capability modules are more
focused towards implementation content
and have four exams which provide four
credits each you can choose any one of
the modules from either streams or make
a combination on the basis of your
experience in industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 points plus
two of foundation that is 17 credit
points makes you eligible for third
level that is ma LC which provides you
five credit points once you have
certified ma L see your final score
credit becomes 22 to become an ITIL
expert there is no separate exam you
need to accumulate 22 credits to get the
ITIL expert certificate I'm sure we are
clear on the certification path let us
understand the service lifecycle and its
modules in the next slide the service
life cycle modules are for the
candidates who aspire to handle a
management or team lead role which
requires a broad management of focus on
ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas
the different modules and the service
life circle are one service strategy SS
to service design sd3 service transition
st for service operation so5 continual
service improvement CSI similarly let's
understand service capability in the
next slide
service capability modules are for the
candidates who aspire to specialise in
process level knowledge in one or more
processes which focuses more on
day-to-day execution the different
modules and the service capability are
one service offerings and agreements SOA
to release control and validation RC v3
operations or support and analysis OSA
for planning protection and optimization
PPO as we have an understanding of both
the streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide
here is a difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you can see that lifecycle is mainly
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also lifecycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn more about the
differences on this slide once you are
done move on to learn about MA LC
managing across the lifecycle is the
last step in achieving the ITIL expert
certification therefore it is mainly
focused on individuals who want to
become ITIL experts on completing ma LC
an individual can apply it the ITIL
knowledge and it provides skills that
can be used in the workplace in a
tangible way we have already discussed
on the credit system in the
simplification path slide however just
to mention the MA LC certification gives
you five credit points now let us
proceed to look at the accreditation
Institute for the ITIL in the next slide
the governing body for ITIL 2011
Foundation and intermediate is the
Cabinet Office UK simply learn is
accredited by APM G and tuv as an ITIL
foundation an intermediate training
provider also simply learn is an
accredited examination centre AEC by APM
g tu V and xsin to conduct these exams
so this has been a basic introduction on
ITIL let's now focus on the service
operation course description and
objective in the coming slides
service operation certificate is a
free-standing qualification but is also
part of the ITIL intermediate lifecycle
stream and one of the modules that leads
to the ITIL expert certificate in IT
Service Management the purpose of this
training module and The Associated exam

let me give you an overview of all the
learning units of this tutorial in all
we have nine learning units including
the introductory lesson which we will be
completing in a few minutes let's look
at the other learning units now learning
unit 1 is about introduction to service
operation this unit covers topics on the
purpose objectives and scope of service
operation the value to the business the
context of service operation in the ITIL
Service lifecycle and the fundamental
aspects of service operation and the
ability to define them learning unit 2
is all about service operation
principles in this unit we will discuss

and access management are discussed
learning unit 4 talks about common
service operations activities in this
unit we will discuss on how the common
activities of service operation are
coordinated for the ongoing management
of the technology that is used to
deliver and support the services
secondly monitoring reporting and
control of the services contributes to
the ongoing management of the services
and the technology that is used to
deliver and support the services the
operational activities of processes
covered in other lifecycle stages
contribute to service operation
and lastly on how IT operations staff
should look for opportunities to improve
the operational activities learning unit

operation here we will discuss on the
role objectives and activities of each
of the four functions of service
operation service desk technical
management IT operations management and
application management service operation
roles and responsibilities where and how
they are used as well as how a service
operation organization would be
structured to use these roles are also
discussed learning unit 6 is about
technology considerations this unit
discusses about the generic requirements
of technologies that support service
management across all lifecycle stages
and about the specific technology
required to support the service
operation processes and functions
learning unit 7 is about implementation

the delivery of this course let us now
understand about the quiz questions
given by simply learn in this tutorial
in this tutorial at the end of each
learning unit quiz questions are
provided by simply learn this is to help
you to assess your knowledge on
completion of each learning unit the
question pattern would be an objective
type with an explanation to the right
answer and each learning unit will
consist of sample case studies and
sample test papers from a PMG apart from
these exercises a glossary for your
reference will be provided at the end of
this course please note to move from one
learning unit to another you need to
complete these quiz questions with the
right answers let us proceed
it's a recap on some of the definitions
and terms used in ITIL the next section
is on foundation basics as explained in
the last slide the exam pattern has a
prerequisite of foundation certification
this also means that we need to have our
basics clear so for your convenience let
us go through the basics of ITIL
principles once again in this session
so before we start with s/o let's
refresh our basics of ITIL which makes
us ask this question what is ITIL well
to define in one line ITIL is a set of
publications for good practices in IT
Service Management now the next question
you might have in mind or ask is why do
we need ITIL as ITIL focuses on
descriptive guidance on IT Service
Management that's easily adapted and
emphasizes quality management approach
standards as you have understood by now
the goal of ITIL is to provide
consistent comprehensive hygienic set of
best practice guidance provide a
platform for independent discussion of
processes in a common or say easy
language or standardized vocabulary ITIL
acts as a flexible framework which is
adaptable to different IT environment
and also complement other public
frameworks in the next slide let us look
at the publication's of ITIL lifecycle
now as you are aware of basic
definitions and understandings of ITIL
let us understand what are the standard
publication that forms a lifecycle the
publication's of ITIL lifecycle phase of
the ITIL or is represented by a volume
in the library which includes service
strategy service design service
transition service operation continual
service improvement this course is about
understanding service operations in the
service management lifecycle
in the previous slides we spoke about
ITIL as a framework for service
management thus to start with we need to
understand the basics of the concept of
service and value this makes me ask a
question what is a service
what is our understanding of the service
it is defined as services our means of
delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes that the customers
want to achieve without the ownership of
specific costs and risks we can refer to
anything around us in this universe as
service let's take an example of the
room around you take anything in that
room right from the smallest item to the
biggest now start thinking about the
item you chose and see any item that you
chose serves some purpose to you and it
has been provided by seller who
manufactures this item to fulfill the
same purpose of yours here the item you
choose is your service the manufacturer
is the service provider and you who
utilize the service is the customer in
our last slide we discussed about the
service now let me ask you what does the
IT service do the answer would be they
enhance the performance of those
customer assets to deliver better or
increased business outcomes and hence
delivers business value how does the IT
service provider deliver these services
it is by effective use of service assets
their resources and capabilities so in
this context service assets are the
resources and capabilities of the
service provider service providers
assets that are utilized to deliver the
IT service to the business or customer
customer assets are the resources and
capabilities of the customer customers
assets that are used to
liver business outcomes these assets
make use of the IT services to enhance
their performance or to remove some
constraints here it is important that
the service provider has to define a
service always in connection to the
specific customer assets to which the
utility of the service is delivered to
now let's move to the next topic of the
basics which is creating value
in our last slide we discussed about
value and service assets here we will
discuss about creating the value now
when we say service is the means of
delivering value to the customers then
how do we deliver value
what does value contain can we quantify
the value we can understand this concept
with the utility and warranty model from
the customers perspective value consists
of two primary elements utility or
fitness for purpose and warranty or
fitness for use utility is perceived by
the customer from the attributes of the
service that have a positive effect on
the performance of tasks associated with
desired outcomes removal or relaxation
of constraints on performance is also
perceived as a positive effect warranty
is derived from the positive effect
being available when needed in
sufficient capacity or magnitude and
dependably in terms of continuity and
security utility is what the customer
gets and warranty is how it is delivered
customers cannot benefit from anything
that is fit for purpose but not fit for
use and vice versa
it is useful to separate the logic of
utility from the logic of warranty for
the purpose of design development and
improvement considering all the separate
controllable inputs allow for a wider
range of solutions to the problem of
creating maintaining and increasing
value remember absolute quantification
of value is not possible
let us go ahead and learn more about
value delivery to our customers in the
next slide as covered in the last slide
we have understood the concept of value
through utility and warranty model now
this slide explains as a service
provider how to deliver value to
customers the service provider has to
execute certain activities in order to
deliver the value to customers in the
form of service this starts from
understanding what the customer wants or
by understanding customer expectations
customer expectations need to define
specific set of activities which are to
be executed by the people in order to
deliver value these specialized sets of
activities are termed as a process the
process is defined as a set of
activities designed to accomplish a
specific objective a process takes
defined inputs and turn them into
defined output a process may include
roles responsibilities tools and
management controls required to deliver
the outputs we also need to learn the
basic characteristics of any process the
characteristics of the process are that
it is measurable
it delivers specific results as expected
by customers primary results as agreed
with customers are delivered to
customers or stakeholders and it
responds to specific events or triggers
now we have covered the concepts of
service value value creation model and
processes executed by the service
provider for delivering value to the
customer let us now move on to our next
topic on governance this slide explains
the concept of governance in the last
slides we covered the concepts of
service value value creation model and
processes executed by the service
provider for delivering value to the
customer but let me tell you here none
of these work without appropriate
management force if the enterprise is
not governed properly by the people
execution of any of the concepts
discussed earlier cannot be done this is
referred to as enterprise governance
let us study this in detail let me ask
you how does AI
TSM fit within organization governance
there are two parts to look at one is
the corporate governance the enterprise
level governance which ensures the
provision of strategy and business plans
establishes the corporate policies and
enables strategic direction objectives
critical success factors and key result
areas corporate governance is assessed
with corporate compliance now the second
part of organization's governance is IT
governance which is about establishing
IT policy standards and principles as
shows alignment of IT strategy to
corporate business strategy now this has
led to ITSM which establishes enables
and execute the IT strategy establishes
operations to assure high-quality and
compliant IT service provisioning
corporate compliance and IT Service
Management trigger IT compliance which
assures the design and operability
of IT policies processes and key
controls in our last slide we discussed
about governance now we will look at the
enterprise level mapping with ITSM to
understand this slide in a simple way
let's start from the top left
requirements of customers business or
other outside triggers will lead the
organization's strategic portfolio to
define the IT strategy policies
identified the recourses and constraints
and prepare a service level plan SLP on
the requirements now this goes back to
the customer or business once
organization plans strategy and agree
with customer or business the design
phase is triggered where we prepare the
blueprint of strategy that we have in
our mind
preparing solutions design architecture
and standards with a service design plan
is sent to customer
stroke business for their sign off once
the customer sign off on the blueprint
is taken the transition team brings a
blueprint to reality during this time
the team prepares transition plans
tested solutions and updated s kms sent
to the customer or business for sign-off
during transition once the live service
is functioning error-free
and the customer gives a sign of the
service control is released to service
operation for the day-to-day management
of the service during operational phase
operations plan and operations services
are delivered to the customer this is
the phase where the actual value is
realized by the customers now as we see
the service being delivered on day to
day basis we also need to keep the
service improving to the current market
scenario domain and technology changes
etc continual service improvement
provides the output for service
improvement in the form of service
improvement plans and actions to be
taken for the service improvement
this marks the end of our introductory
lesson let's do a quick recap of what we
learned so far in this lesson we learnt
about what is ITIL ITIL intermediate
definition of service lifecycle and
capability we also got some information
about the ITIL intermediate examination
format itself and looked at the
prerequisite of taking up the
examination finally we covered the
objective eligible candidates and
syllabus of service operation and
foundation basics hope you have a
clearer view of how the tutorial works
