the command line interface following are
a few basic command lines of HDFS to
copy the file simple learn txt from the
local disk to the users directory type
the command line shown on the screen the
file will be copied to user slash
username slash simple learned txt to get
a directory listing of the users home
directory type the command line shown on
the screen to create a directory called
testing under the users home directory
type the command line shown on the
screen to delete the directory esting
and all of its components type the
command line shown on the screen
HDFS commands
in this demonstration you will see how
to run a few basic command lines of HDFS
let's first learn how to run a few basic
command lines of HDFS first of all to
create any HDFS commands you need to
create a directory inside hadoop type
hadoop DFS mkdir slash directory name in
this demo the directory name is testing
as you can see this command has created
a directory inside the root folder of
HDFS named as testing now let's discuss
the steps involved to send one file from
a local filesystem to the newly created
HDFS directory type LS to view the
details of the current directory you can
see that the current directory has a
file called texts which we will send to
the directory named testing let's see
how to do that type Hadoop DFS - put
file name slash directory name in this
demo texts is the file name from the
local filesystem that is to be sent and
testing is the pathname of the directory
where you want to save the file now
let's see how to view whether the file
exists at that particular HDFS location
or not type Hadoop DFS - LS directory
name you can notice that this text file
is sent to the testing HDFS directory
let's view how to delete a directory and
its contents type Hadoop - DFS - RM /
directory name
you
this brings you to the end of the demo
you have learned how to run a few basic
command lines of HDFS such as creating a
directory sending one file from a local
file system to the directory deleting a
directory and its contents the file
browser in Hue lets you view and manage
your HDFS directories and files
additionally you can create move rename
modify upload download and delete
directories and files you can also view
the file contents HDFS access using hue
in this demonstration you will see how
to view and manage your HDFS directories
and files using hue to view and manage
your HDFS directories and files using
hue perform the following steps type
localhost colon 8080 8 8 in the UI this
command will take the page to hue
browser as shown to view HDFS browser
directory click the following
option-click on file browser
file browser will direct the page to the
default location of HDFS which is slash
root user slash user name in this demo
the user name is training you just saw
how to delete a directory and its
contents however if you want to view the
directory before you deleted it click on
the following click on root and browse
for the directory
in this demo the name of the directory
is testing currently there are no files
inside this folder as we deleted the
items in it previously
you can perform multiple operations on
the browser you can upload a file
without having to type upload on the
command line now let's look at how we
can upload a file to the directory click
on upload
click on file
click on select file and browse the file
you want to upload in this demo the file
selected is cust s-- click on open you
can view that the file is uploaded to
the testing directory which is in the
root folder you can also view the
content of the file by clicking on the
file as shown
this brings you to the end of the demo
you have learned how to view and manage
your HDFS directories and files using
