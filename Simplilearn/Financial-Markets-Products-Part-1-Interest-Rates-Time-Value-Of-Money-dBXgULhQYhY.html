techniques used in risk management and
the theories that underlie their use
interest rates welcome to one of the
most important sessions in your
preparation for the frm exam in this
session we will introduce the concept of
time value of money if you are still not
familiar with this concept we will learn
how this concept is applied in valuing
fixed income securities like bonds bonds
are instruments which pay a fixed amount
of interest this topic is going to be
very analytical and calculation
intensive you need to learn to use your
financial calculators to master the
concepts presented in the session the
concepts learned in this session will be
applied elsewhere in the course so you
are advised to spend some time in the
session and practice as many questions
as possible we have tried to visualize
the concepts so that they are easy to
understand and retain agenda we will
begin our session by introducing you to
the concept of the time value of money
which means that any amount of money and
present is worth more than the same
amount in the future that is the value
of money decreases we will learn about
the interest rates and various
compounding frequencies used we will
also learn about the different types of
bonds and techniques used to derive the
value of the bond will then introduce
three different types of raids yield
rates spot rates and forward rates and
apply them in bond valuation the concept
of forward rate agreements will also be
introduced finally we will end the
session by discussing the duration and
convexity of the bond most of the topics
will be new and therefore you must
proceed at a slow speed
pre-requisites type of rates there are
three interest rates that play a key
role in interest rate derivatives
Treasury rates libel and repo rates keep
in mind that the interest rates
increases as the credit risk of the
underlying instrument increases Treasury
rates are the rates that correspond to
US government borrowing in dollars they
are considered risk-free rate LIBOR is
the rate at which large international
banks fund that their activities there
is some credit risk with libel repo
rates of the implied rates on repurchase
agreements in the repo agreement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
