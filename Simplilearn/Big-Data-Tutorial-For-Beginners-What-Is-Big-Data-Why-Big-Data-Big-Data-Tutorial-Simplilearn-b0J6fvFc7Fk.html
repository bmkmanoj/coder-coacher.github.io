baffling tech term to most people
although it could be the next big thing
a buzzword of sorts not many can give a
definitive answer to what it is if you
happen to mention big data you could be
well subjected to question such as is it
a tool a product and is big data only
for big businesses and many more in the
same vein but what is big data it's just
the huge amounts of data both structured
and unstructured a business has to deal
with on a daily basis now that being
said why is it important to a business
or for that matter you to use this
phenomenal amount of data to its
advantage a business must fully grasp
the possibilities of analyzing big data
and thereby making informed decisions to
stay ahead of the curve there has to be
a reason why many analysts are calling
big data a new competitive advantage
right let's look at Gardner's three V's
model to define Big Data according to
the American IT research and advisory
firm Gartner incorporated big data is
high volume high velocity and/or high
variety information assets that demand
cost-effective innovative forms of
information processing that enable
enhanced insight decision-making and
process automation today the size volume
complexity variety and the rate of
growth velocity of the data that
organizations handle have reached such
unbelievable levels that traditional
processing and analytical tools fail
quite miserably are you still wondering
if you can come up with a rigorous
definition of Big Data yes then know
that you are not alone though people may
be divided on how best to define Big
Data few are likely to dispute that
these large pools of data are integral
to improve future projects but what is
certain is that understanding and
utilizing Big Data is a seriously
daunting task the sheer volume of data
that's captured and analyzed will pave
the way for a better economic
environment
only if it's effectively used to discern
patterns that enable better
decision-making big data is not just a
buzzword or a fad it's something that
will undoubtedly touch businesses and
people's lives the world over for people
who think that this is just another term
that only the tech industry seems to
care about here are a few facts about
big data that will likely convince them
that big data is a revolution in the
making read on skeptics the data volumes
are exploding more data has been created
in the past two years than in the entire
previous history of the human race
if you burned all the data create it in
just one day on two DVDs you could stack
them on top of each other and reach the
moon twice every minute we send 204
million emails generate 18 million
Facebook Likes and send 278 thousand
tweets Google alone processes on average
over 40,000 search queries per second
making it over 3.5 billion in a day
around 100 hours of video are uploaded
on YouTube every minute and it would
take you around 15 years to watch every
video uploaded by users in just one day
today's data centers occupy an area of
land equal in size to almost six
thousand football fields by better
integrating big data analytics into
healthcare the industry could save 300
billion dollars a year that's equal to
reducing the healthcare costs of every
man woman and child by one thousand
dollars a year the image here gives a
very real picture of the evolution of
big data here the data size and
complexity have been mapped against
computing timeline in the early 1970s in
fact even before that the focus was on
generation and storage of data
mainframes were used for basic data
storage during the 1980s and 90s the
focus was on data utilization for which
relational databases and other
data intensive applications were brought
into the picture in the 2000s the
spotlight was on data driven technology
for which structured data unstructured
data and multimedia were used throughout
this evolution phase we saw an
exponential growth in data volume
consider the following case study in
2011 Netflix made one of the biggest
decisions it'll ever possibly make it
wasn't anything material but rather it
was about content the u.s. headquartered
company outbid major cable networks like
AMC and HBO to win the rights for a US
version of house of cards getting them
two seasons with 13 episodes each with a
cost of four to six million dollars per
episode this two season price tag was
over 100 million dollars Netflix had
never before taken such a big gamble on
the content side so why did Netflix make
such a big bet and how did big data
analytics factor into the decision
let's find out now before making the
million dollar investment Netflix knew a
lot of users watched the David Fincher
directed movie the social network from
beginning to end the British version of
house of cards had been well watched
those who watched the British version
house of cards also watched Kevin Spacey
films and/or films directed by David
Fincher with the help of big data
analytics Netflix drew conclusions from
these three synergistic factors before
green lighting the popular show
combining these factors obviously the
popularity of political thrillers makes
it seem like an easy decision for
Netflix to make licensing movies from
Studios is expensive so Netflix uses
data which is generated from its sixty
nine point one seven million worldwide
streaming customers to help pick the
movies from the limited ones to licence
that the viewers will most enjoy do you
have data and use it to help you make
decisions if not Netflix provides a good
case for why you should so what are the
predictions for big data in the near
future market size
according to the International Data
Corporation IDC the big data and
analytics market will reach 125 billion
dollars worldwide in 2015 with growth at
six times faster than IT skills gap
according to the McKinsey Global
Institute by 2018 the United States
alone could face a shortage of 140,000
to 190,000 people with big data
developer skills as well as 1.5 million
managers and analysts with a know how to
use the analysis of big data to make
effective decisions buying and selling
data will soon become the new bread and
butter for business across the globe big
data and hadoop certification training
from simply learn is designed to ensure
that you are job ready to take up an
assignment in big data this training not
only equips you with essential Hadoop
skills but also gives you the required
work experience in big data analytics
via implementation of real-life industry
projects that span three months after
completing this course you'll be able to
master the concepts of the Hadoop
framework and its deployment in a
cluster environment learn to write
complex MapReduce programs perform data
analytics using pig and hive acquire
in-depth understanding of the Hadoop
ecosystem including flume and Apache
easy workflow scheduler master advanced
concepts of Hadoop 2.7 including HBase
zookeeper and scoop get hands-on
experience in setting up different
configurations of the Hadoop cluster
work on real-life industry based
projects using Hadoop
the course flow is as follows first
internalize the domains which includes
introduction to Big Data and Hadoop
concepts in architecture of big data
tools installation and configuration of
Hadoop components such as MapReduce yarn
HDFS Pig hive HBase zookeeper scoop and
flume and Hadoop administration
troubleshooting and security the next
step is to master the components which
includes Hadoop
two-point-seven yarn mapreduce hdfs pig
hive HBase zookeeper scoop and flume
next you'll learn to manage the
following structured unstructured and
semi-structured data Hadoop ecosystem
and complex business problems deployment
of Hadoop cluster and writing complex
MapReduce programs you'll then work on
projects the different projects in this
course include optimizing data storage
using HDFS in cloud environment using
MapReduce to sort and filter data using
pig and hive as replacement of Java
using HBase to process data in real time
using flume and a scoop to process
unstructured data and so on once these
steps are covered you are all ready to
take the last step which is to get
certified this course will facilitate
you to achieve Big Data Hadoop
development certification with Hadoop
