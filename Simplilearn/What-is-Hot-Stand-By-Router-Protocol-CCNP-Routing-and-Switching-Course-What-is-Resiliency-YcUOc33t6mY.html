and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
considerations for wireless VoIP and
video this lesson focuses on hot standby
router protocol let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide
by the end of this lesson you will be
able to describe resiliency and the
resiliency types explained supervisor
redundancy and its features explain the
concepts of FH RP including HS R P HS R
P versions advertisements and
load-balancing list HS R P States let us
start our discussion with resiliency
resiliency is the ability to maintain an
acceptable level of service when errors
occur redundancy does not guarantee
resiliency because the redundant links
do not automatically use the backup link
if the primary link fails there are two
types of resiliency required in
enterprise networks system level
resiliency and network level resiliency
system level resiliency is provided by
dual power supplies and fans extra
switches or switch modules and hardware
features that enable fast failover
network level resiliency includes
redundant links and devices along with
rapid failover in the next slide
let us discuss supervisor redundancy
the supervisor engine is the most
important component in catalyst modular
switches many features provide
supervisor redundancy they differ in
failover timings and capabilities
supervisor redundancy is provided by
route processor redundancy route
processor redundancy plus stateful
switchover and non-stop forwarding with
SSO in the next slide let us examine
failover time for catalyst 4,500 and
6500 switches with these features IP
phones and database applications would
be dropped in the failover duration
shown in the table for R P R &amp;amp; R P R
plus RP R's
failover time is two to four minutes for
the catalyst 6500 and less than 60
seconds for the catalyst 4,500 rpm Li
available for the catalyst 6500 with a
failover time of 30 to 60 seconds
stateful switchover makes a dramatic
improvement in failover times with 0 to
3 seconds and less than 1 second in
catalyst 6500 and 4,500 respectively in
the next slide let us discuss in detail
the four features of supervisory
redundancy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
