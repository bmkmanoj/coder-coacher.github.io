we are in an era of nanotechnology
technology is getting smarter smaller
and sleeker remember those one-ton
computers and the revolutionary
inventions to simpler and more efficient
ones things like laptops iPods iPads
smartphones and now the revolutionary
Apple watch indeed in evolution made
revolutionary and this is all at your
fingertips every time we use these
amazing gadgets we have ideas to
implement and show the world and as an
Apple watch developer we have the tools
to reach the world so now this is all
made easy and accessible through this
Apple watch development course by simply
learn I Jason ripka will be your guide
throughout the course I'll share my
knowledge and experience of over seven
years with you so that you can be the
best in the world
hello and welcome to how to build apps
for the Apple watch by simply learn this
is less than zero and it serves
basically as an introduction to the
course in this lesson we're going to
learn a few things first we're going to
learn how to understand the four main
learning areas of the course we're going
to understand how the course is
formatted for optimal learning we're
going to understand why Apple watch
development is important and we're going
to get to know the requirements for
taking the course so let's take a look
at those first four main learning areas
the first area is learning Xcode now
Xcode is the IDE or the interactive
development environment powers the
design and code for Mac iPhone iPad and
Apple watch apps and we're going to be
using Xcode extensively in this course
next is the Swift programming language
we're going to need to have a solid
grasp of the Swift programming language
right from the start because that's
going to be critical for us to build
Apple watch apps and we're going to
learn that step by step next we're going
to learn watch os/2 and watchkit now
watch os/2
is the operating system that powers the
watch and watch kit is the framework
that we use to interact with the watch
so strong knowledge of these concepts is
critical then we also need to learn the
iOS 9 I Phone operating system iOS 9
powers all of Apple's mobile devices
from iPhones to iPads and we need to
understand this syntax so we can develop
apps that run on both the iPhone and the
watch so let's switch gears back to why
Apple watch programming is important
right now new technology is constantly
changing the way we live our lives
whether it's a new microwave oven or new
wearable technology like the Apple watch
the Apple watch is not going anywhere
in fact Apple is pouring millions into
Apple watch development behind the
scenes to make things easier for
developers and the Apple watch is the
first wearable technology
that does more than monitor health in
fact it does so much more as you'll see
as we go throughout the course and it's
the wave of the future
so if we jump on board now we'll have a
head start now I'd like to focus your
attention on the way the lessons in this
course actually break down the course is
divided into several sections and
basically section one or lesson one is
an overview of building apps for the
Apple watch so I'll be giving you a
quick overview of how things actually
pull together and everything ties
together in section two we're going to
go in depth and learn the Swift 2.0
syntax and the Swift programming
language in section three we're going to
look at the app user interface and the
element basics then we're going to move
on to using maps in your apps and
application programming interfaces we're
going to look at adding images and
animations and more specific watch stuff
like glances notifications and menus and
then we have whole other section that
just deals with apps so let's get to
that so the first seven sections are
packed with information and knowledge
and examples and how to do things but
when we get to lesson eight and in fact
eight through 17 we're going to be
building apps hands-on building apps
that are real world type apps like we
have a what-if app which is really just
an introductory app but then we have a
watch calculator app a speed reader app
lucky numbers app a campers watch and
XML news reader app a daily quote memory
master app a random cuteness app and a
weather app I mean we're going all out
here and you're gonna love building this
stuff trust me so let's move on to what
the requirements are for taking the
course the requirements for taking this
course could not be simpler I mean we
call this simply learn for a reason
first you'll need a Mac computer with
the latest version of OS X you don't
need an
internet connection and you'll need the
latest version of Xcode installed and
Xcode is just an application that you
download from the App Store it's in the
developer area but if you just type
Xcode and search for it it'll be your
first hit install that and you are ready
to go with the rest of the course
welcome to how to build apps for the
Apple watch lesson 1 this is an overview
of building apps for the Apple watch the
lesson objectives are how to install
Xcode from the App Store to view a brief
overview of how to build the most basic
app for the Apple watch and then do you
know Swift and what you may be able to
skip which I don't really recommend and
what you should definitely watch out for
in this video we're going to look at how
to install Xcode from the App Store and
alternatively if Xcode 7 is not
available in the App Store
then we're going to do it from the
developer website so let's get started
so I have my App Store application
running and I'm here at the main screen
and what we need to do is just go into
this search box up on the top right and
just type in Xcode and it auto pops up
and just click that first one and you'll
see it here on the left-hand side just
click that Xcode and for me it says open
but for you it may say download now note
the version number this is version 6.4
and we're going to be working with
version 7 or above so if your version in
the app store is not version 7 then you
need to get version 7 from the developer
website and we're going to take a look
at that next so perhaps the App Store in
your region doesn't have Xcode 7 yet
then we need to download it from the
developer website so go to
developer.apple.com slash Xcode slash
downloads and you'll see here that
you're able to download Xcode for free
now there's two versions that you could
download 6.4 which is available in the
Mac App Store right currently and Xcode
7 beta 6 which is the current release at
the time of recording so Xcode 7 really
should be in the App Store by the time
you're viewing this and you shouldn't
have to worry about this but in the case
that it's not then just come to
developer.apple.com slash xcode slash
downloads and go ahead and download
Xcode 7 beta 6 currently but whatever
beta version there happens to be now you
will need to login with your developer
ID in order to do this so as you see I
have to login I'm just going to hit sign
in and it's going to go ahead and just
start that download for me ok and the
same thing for you just go ahead and
sign in and download your version of
Xcode and you are good to go
in this video I'm going to give you a
brief overview of the Apple watch app
creation process now don't get too hung
up on any of the details that I'm
showing you because we're gonna go
through everything in depth as the
course progresses but I just wanted to
show you by opening Xcode and creating a
project very quickly just how simple it
really is to make an application but we
need to first learn the core foundations
like Swift we need to learn about the
app UI and GUI and the Xcode interface
so real quick just going to show you I'm
going to go through it and explain it a
little bit as I'm going but for the most
part this is just for reference so you
know what we're looking forward to doing
and what we're going to be doing when
when we're done with all the learning of
Swift and learning of the technical
details about the app itself about apps
you know for the watch and you know how
we actually interact with them okay so
when you open Xcode you're greeted by
this welcome screen and it says welcome
and it says the version of Xcode that
you're using in this case I'm on 7 beta
6 and it gives you three options here
one you can get started with the
playground which we're going to use when
we actually learn Swift we're going to
use those pretty heavily and then you
could create a new Xcode project which
is what we're going to do right now or
you could check out an existing project
from a repository or there will be
applications listed here that you've
worked on previously or you could open
another project entirely by clicking
this button here so for right now we're
just going to click create a new Xcode
project and as you see on the left hand
side you can do an iOS application you
can do watch OSS applications you could
do OS X applications for the Mac or you
could do other which are you know in-app
purchases and other other things
command-line whatnot
so we're going to do a watch OS
application and that's going to be an
iOS app with watchkit app and we're just
going to click Next and I'm just going
to call this demo app and for right now
I'm not even going to get into detail
about what all this stuff means all that
I'm going to say is that you know
basically what you put in here becomes
your bundle identifier which is very
useful for you when you go to upload to
the App Store so I'm just going to go
ahead and click Next and I'm going to go
ahead and save this on my desktop here
and when it opens up you have lots of
things to look at and it can be a bit
overwhelming and we're going to go
through Xcode in-depth so don't worry
about everything that we're looking at
here but basically this demo app folder
here has to do with the iOS application
or the application for the iPhone and if
you look here where it says demo app
watchkit app this is the app for the
watch okay
so here you have your interface
storyboard and we're going to take a
look at that right now and this will go
ahead and give us what we need to go
ahead and get started so as you see what
it comes up with initially and I'm just
going to get rid of this left side here
what it comes up with initially is an
interface controller which is basically
a watch you know and that's where you
put in your graphical user interface
elements and then it has a static
interface and a dynamic interface and
we're going to get to those later in the
course as well but all I'm really going
to do here is I'm going to put a label
in here and I'm just gonna drag this to
the right here so it takes up the whole
screen here and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to click this assistant
editor button and this will actually
bring up the wk-- interface class file
that's associated
with this view so to speak so this is a
view and if I click this view controller
here you can see that it's connected to
this watchkit foundation interface
controller so I'm going to close this
right side down and I want to show you
how easy this is if we just take label
and we press ctrl and drag this in right
here above this override declaration I'm
just going to call this label so that we
can refer to it and modify it ok so now
we have this element called label in
here and what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to drag this over so we can
see the code a little bit better and in
this override awake with context mode
this is what runs when the app is
initially launched what I'm going to do
here is as you can see it says label
there but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to change that label so I'm going
to say label dot set text and I'm going
to set the text to a string and it's
going to say label has changed and
literally that's all I'm going to do now
what I'm going to do is on this area
here this is where you set the scheme
for what to run so if we click here and
we look at the one that looks like a
watch and it says demo app watchkit app
and we want to select one of these two
so I'm going to select the six plus an
Apple watch 38 millimeter and I'm going
to go ahead and click run now when that
runs it should say that the label has
changed so as you see when that comes up
it does in fact say label has changed so
I did change the label based on what I
put here in the code now one thing to
note is that we are running to
simulators this is the watch simulator
and we have the iPhone simulator that's
also running but since we didn't program
anything into the app for the watch I
mean for the iPhone nothing is running
on the iPhone so literally that's all I
wanted to show you I just wanted to show
you how we could go into X
and boom make a change and have it go
and appeared that way now obviously I
need to do something with the text
formatting because it doesn't fit into
that area and this app is kind of
useless so what we're going to do is
we're going to stop here and we're going
to move on because I literally just
wanted to show you this just so you get
an idea of the environment we're going
to be working in which is going to be
this Xcode environment with these I'm
going to press stop here with these
simulators and we're going to have all
these things to work on so this
interface storyboard was the view that
we're looking at and this interface
controller right here is the code view
that's attached to it and you can see
that it's attached to it if you look on
the right hand side and you come over
here to the third section where it says
class interface controller and this is
indeed the class called
interface controller okay so don't worry
about soaking all that up right now
it'll all come very clear to you very
soon okay so we're going to stop here
and we're going to continue with the
rest of the course
okay so in this short video I just want
to touch on one thing in that Swift 2.0
chances are you have a background if you
do have any background at all in Swift
you have a background in Swift 1.2
because Swift 2.0 has been in the beta
for quite some time now but it's just
almost out of beta and if you have
learned Swift 2.0 for the iPhone just
keep in mind that there are some subtle
differences in the syntax for the iPhone
and the watch or the iPhone versus the
watch versus the Mac operating system so
there are differences between all three
of those also I want you to keep an eye
out for optionals enumerations error
handling and also nsuserdefaults for the
watch because they are also different
for the watch in regards to what you may
have previously learned for the iphone
so just real quick that was really all I
wanted to say just keep an eye out for
those areas if you are one of the
students that do have a background in
Swift already all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
