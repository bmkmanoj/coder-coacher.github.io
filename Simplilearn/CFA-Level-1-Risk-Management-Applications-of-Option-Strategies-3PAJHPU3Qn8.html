cfa level 1 curriculum you can go
through this reading from volume 6 of
the cfa level 1 curriculum made
available to you by the cfa institute as
per the learning outcome statement after
completion of this lesson the candidate
should be able to determine the payoff
profit and loss from buying calls and
puts they should also be able to
understand and calculate the profit loss
payoffs etc from covered cool and
protective put strategies cool let's now
consider the payoff from Cole options to
understand the payoff you need to
understand that the payoff is not
symmetrical as the buyer of the contract
has the option to exercise at the
maturity date only if there is a profit
this option is associated with a premium
that has to be paid up front in the form
of option cost c 0 from the chart we can
see that the buyer of the cool option is
at a loss until the difference in spot
price and
price exceeds the premium paid up front
if the spot price is below the strike
price the buyer just walks away and his
loss is limited to the premium paid c0
if the price is in between the strike
price and the break-even price the buyer
is still at loss but some of the loss is
offset by exercising the option that is
purchasing at a lower strike price and
selling at a higher spot price any
profit becomes the loss for the seller
of the contract and vice versa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
