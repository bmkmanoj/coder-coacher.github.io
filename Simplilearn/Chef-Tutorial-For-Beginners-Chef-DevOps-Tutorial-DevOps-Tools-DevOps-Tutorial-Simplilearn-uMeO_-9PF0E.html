configuration management tool called
chef chef this was originally written in
Ruby and Erlang it was essentially
written to manage Linux but as of now
also supports Microsoft Windows in the
year 2013 February ops code released
version 11 of chef and this uses pure
Ruby to write system configurations also
referred to as recipes chef integrates
with various cloud platforms like Amazon
ec2 Google cloud platform OpenStack
Microsoft Azure drag space to name of
you it also provides support for CentOS
FreeBSD OSX Solaris Microsoft Windows
and various Ubuntu versions and it also
has additional client platform supported
including arc Linux Debian and fedora
chef server can be on CentOS Oracle
Linux or Ubuntu and chef can run in a
client-server born in a standalone
configuration called chef solo next
let's take a look at the architecture of
chef so the chef development kit has
various tools that help you develop and
test your infrastructure automation code
the infrastructure as code automation
code is developed locally on a
workstation and then deployed into
production once it has been completed
and verified and tested your chef server
is a central repository where all your
chef cookbooks reside and your chef
cookbooks in turn have information about
each and every node that is being
managed by
chef's server the chef client runs on
each node that the server is managing
and the client securely communicates
with the chef server in order to get the
latest configuration instructions for
that particular node these nodes could
be web servers database servers app
servers chef cookbooks have the
necessary code for the desired state of
the infrastructure of that node and chef
node could be a physical machine it
could be a virtual machine in a network
being managed by the chef sir hey once
