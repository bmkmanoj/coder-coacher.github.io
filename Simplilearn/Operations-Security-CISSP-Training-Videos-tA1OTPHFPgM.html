topic ten CISSP operations security
introduction hello and welcome to lesson
10 of the CISSP certification course by
simply learn this lesson is about
operations security operation security
is one of the ten domains of the common
body of knowledge cbk for the CISSP
certification exam security operations
domain is used to identify critical
information and the execution of
selected measures that eliminate or
reduce adversary exploitation of
critical information it includes the
definition of the controls over hardware
media and the operators with access
privileges to any of these resources
auditing and monitoring are the
mechanisms tools and facilities that
permit the identification of security
events and subsequent actions to
identify the key elements and report the
pertinent information to the appropriate
individual group or process objectives
according to the ICS to candidate
information bulletin a CISSP candidate
is expected to know the resources that
must be protected the privileges that
must be restricted the control
mechanisms available the potential for
abuse of access the appropriate controls
and the principles of good practice
agenda our agenda for this domain is as
follows
we start with the basic concepts of
operations security this will then be
followed by the topics maintaining
operational resilient maintaining
resilient systems protecting valuable
assets controlling system accounts
finally we'll discuss how to effectively
manage security services and key
operational processes and procedures
operations security concepts till now
we've seen that all the other domains
define some of the basic concepts and
tenants of control and a good practice
in information and business security
this domain takes those concepts and
describes how they are put into practice
in an organization operations security
concepts the term operations security
refers to the act of understanding the
threats to and vulnerabilities of
computer operations in order to
routinely support operational activities
that enable computer systems to function
correctly the term also refers to the
implementation of security controls for
normal transaction processing system
