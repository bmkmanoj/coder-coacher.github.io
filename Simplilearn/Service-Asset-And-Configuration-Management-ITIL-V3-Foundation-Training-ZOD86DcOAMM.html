of configuration baselines a
configuration baseline is the
configuration of a service product or
infrastructure that has been formally
reviewed and agreed on that thereafter
serves as a basis for further activities
and that can be changed only through
formal change procedures it captures the
structure contents and details of a
configuration and represents a set of
configuration items that are related to
each other a key concept in surface
assets and configuration management is
that of a configuration management
database or CMDB a configuration
management database CMDB is a database
used to store configuration records of
CIS one or more CMV B's can be part of a
configuration management system CMDB
provides a logical model of the IT
infrastructure as it captures
configuration items and the
relationships that exist between them
similar to CMDB there are two libraries
defined as part of the configuration
management system these libraries are
used for controlling and releasing
components throughout the service
lifecycle for example in design building
testing deployment and operations a
secure library is a collection of
software and electronic CIS example
documentation of a known type and status
as part of the secure library the
definitive media library or DML is a
secure store where the definitive
authorized and approved versions of all
media CIS are stored and monitored
access to items in a secure library is
restricted and a secure store is a
secure location where IT assets like pcs
server and other hardware
stored in the secure store definitive
spares are kept definitive spares are
spare components and assemblies that are
maintained at the same level as the
comparative systems within the live
environment these concepts are
illustrated in the next line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
