sampling an estimation volume 1 study
session 3 reading 10 quantitative
methods
hello candidate welcome bag today we
begin with the 11th lesson of the simply
learn cfa level 1 tutorial in the last
tutorial we discussed the concept of
probability and its distribution this
session is on reading 10 as prescribed
by cfa institute learning outcome
statement or LOL we learned about LOL in
the first session please go through the
learning outcome statement for a
detailed list of learning outcomes after
this lesson the candidate should be able
to explain sampling distribution and its
significance in interpreting the data we
will walk through various sampling
techniques and their applications agenda
the agenda of the session is to cover
reading 10 as prescribed by the cfa
level 1 curriculum you can go through
this reading from volume one of the cfa
level one curriculum made available to
you by cfa institute in this lesson we
will start by understanding the concept
of sampling and its significance in the
field of research we will briefly go
through the sampling process next we
will move on to two types of sampling
techniques which are simple random
sampling and stratified random sampling
next we will cover the sampling error in
sampling distribution we will then be
discussing the time series and
cross-sectional data that highlight
differences in models that study data in
time or models that judge
characteristics at a point of time after
that we will learn the distribution of
the sample mean based on the central
limit theorem we will then move on to
point and interval estimators of the
population mean under this topic we will
be covering T distribution and normal
distribution next we will cover the
procedure of the selection of sample
size we will end by discussing the
different biases of the sampling process
as per the learning outcome statement
after this lesson the student should be
able to define simple random sampling
and a sampling distribution explain
sampling error
distinguish between simple random and
stratified random sampling distinguished
between time series and cross-sectional
data explain the central limit theorem
and its importance calculate and
interpret the standard error of the
sample mean identify and describe
desirable properties of an estimator
distinguished between a point estimate
and a confidence interval estimate of a
population parameter describe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
