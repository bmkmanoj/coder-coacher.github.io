simply learns eggs an agile scrum master
workshop the purpose of this lesson is
to introduce you to agile as a project
management approach and scrum as an
agile method after completing this
lesson you'll be able to find what both
agile and scrum is you'll be able to
articulate the benefits of being agile
you'll be familiar with the agile
manifesto and it's supporting 12 guiding
principles also you'll understand the
concept of continuous improvement within
the context of scrum adoption there are
two main approaches to managing projects
there is the waterfall approach and the
agile approach we'll talk more about the
waterfall approach later in the workshop
but to summarize it involves big
planning up front in order to determine
the detailed scope of the project and
establish the project performance
baselines once
executing begins actual results are
compared to the baselines in order to
determine the health of the project the
agile approach is for projects that are
more complex and uncertain an agile
there is no heavy detailed planning
upfront rather an agile project evolves
as short increments are completed one of
the thought leaders in the agile world
Scott Ambler defines agile this way
quote agile is an iterative and
incremental evolutionary approach to
project development which is performed
in a highly collaborative manner by
self-organizing teams with just enough
ceremony that produces high quality
software in a cost-effective and timely
manner which meets the changing needs of
its stakeholders
close quote agile is a family of
lightweight quality driven approaches to
software development which evolved in
the late 1990s in response to the burden
of heavy documentation and frequent
change in February 2001 seventeen
leading developers signed the ad
manifesto the agile manifesto is a
foundational document for all agile
methods and it reads like this quote we
are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others
do it through this work we have come to
value individuals and interactions over
processes and tools working software
over comprehensive documentation
customer collaboration over contract
negotiation responding to change over
following a plan that is while there is
value in the items on the right we value
the items on the Left more close quote
let's take a look at the four main
points in the manifesto one individuals
and interactions over processes and
tools while processes and tools are
necessary the emphasis is on individuals
and the interactions between them two
working software over comprehensive
documentation documentation does not
demonstrate progress or value therefore
the emphasis is on working software
three customer collaboration over
contract negotiation rather than
creating a detailed statement of work
and then negotiating contracts
developers and customers should
collaborate in order to progressively
determine the requirements of the
project for responding to change over
following a plan rather than being
constrained by an original plan
developers should embrace change in
order to meet the dynamic needs of the
customer there are also 12 guiding
principles that support the agile
manifesto let's go over each of them one
our highest priority is to satisfy the
customer through early and continuous
delivery of valuable software to welcome
changing requirements even late in
development agile processes harness
change for the customers competitive
advantage 3 deliver working software
frequently from a couple of weeks to a
couple of months with a preference to
the shorter time scale for the
those people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project
five build projects around motivated
individuals give them the environment
and support they need and trust them to
get the job done six the most efficient
and effective method of conveying
information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation seven
working software is the primary measure
of progress eight agile processes
promote sustainable development the
sponsors developers and users should be
able to maintain a constant pace
indefinitely nine continuous attention
to technical excellence and good design
enhances agility 10 simplicity the art
of maximizing the amount of work not
done is essential 11 the best
architectures requirements and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams and 12
at regular intervals the team reflects
on how to become more effective than
Tunes and adjust its behavior
accordingly in 1986 scrum was first
introduced by hirotaka to coochie and
iku gyro no naka they described it as a
new approach to commercial product
development that would increase speed
and flexibility they actually called it
the rugby approach and then in the early
1990s this method was first referred to
using the single word scrum scrum is a
proven agile software development method
providing significant benefits over the
traditional waterfall approach for
example higher productivity and lower
development costs this is accomplished
by reducing waste and irregularities by
only developing what is absolutely
essential for the customer improved
customer satisfaction collaboration
between the developers and the customer
results in clarity about what is to be
developed
the ability to respond to changing needs
and priorities which leads to actually
delivering the value the customer wants
higher quality software using techniques
like test-driven development continuous
integration acceptance test-driven
development and refactoring can lead to
nearly defect free software improved
employee engagement and job satisfaction
by empowering a team to be
self-organizing the team is able to
determine how it is going to deliver the
value to the customer and establish a
sustainable pace forever faster time to
market and early ROI by incrementally
delivering value or working software to
the customer in short iterations working
software can be deployed sooner and the
customer can realize early return on
investment scrum is now the leading
agile method with more than 50% of agile
projects using scrum features that makes
Prem so popular include it offers
simplicity and proven results it
encompasses other agile engineering
techniques it emphasizes small teams and
team empowerment it welcomes changes to
requirements it allows working from a
single source of prioritized work items
it includes daily status meetings
it offers team commitment to potentially
shippable software at the end of each
sprint this chart illustrates how agile
methods deliver value faster in the
traditional approach the chart on the
right you can see that the customer has
to wait until the end of the project for
the delivery of the working software and
the realization of return on investment
rom delivers value or working software
at the end of each sprint looking at the
chart on the left you can see how value
is delivered clearly and incrementally
from the very beginning of the project
before we continue with the journey of
understanding the details of scrum
here are some tips that will help you
achieve a successful scrum adoption
using the acrostic adapt we'll review
five attributes required for successful
scrum adoptions one awareness awareness
that the current process or approach is
not working the first step is realizing
that change is necessary to desire
adopting scrum can require a significant
change in an organization's culture
therefore there must be a clear desire
to adopt scrum and the confidence that
will result in the improvements desired
3 ability the team must be willing to
make the effort necessary to actually
implement scrum this effort is going to
include coaching mentoring and
potentially working with senior
management to gain their support for the
adoption effort promote it's likely that
the team will have to share successes
and wins as a result of scrum adoption
with senior management in order to have
their continued support transfer last
but not least is transferring and
spreading the advantages of scrum
throughout the company adopting scrum
can be an effort that takes some time
there is likely to be some
organizational gravity that resists the
adoption of scrum so it's going to be
helpful to be able to definitively
answer some key questions like has the
investment in scrum paid off what is our
next area of improvement should we
continue with scrum are we better off
than before are we producing better
products do our products have fewer
defects are we able to ship faster than
before the answers to these questions do
not need to be necessarily arrived at
through a precise or scientific effort
however tests
and measuring the results of any effort
is necessary to discover whether or not
we've been successful when considering
outcomes we could categorize the desired
results along four different vectors
just like the balanced scorecard the
balanced scorecard concept originally
proposed by doctors Robert Kaplan and
David Norton is a performance
measurement framework that adds
strategic non-financial performance
measures to traditional financial
metrics in order to give the managers a
more balanced view of organizational
performance this framework has four
categories financial customer process
and innovation Mike Cohen suggests we
can benefit by using the balanced
scorecard concept for scrum teams by
using these four categories operational
excellence user orientation business
value and future orientation we could
define specific measures for each
category for example as part of
operational excellence we could define
predictability metrics such as did the
project end of the desired sprint or did
it require additional sprints we could
also define productivity measures such
as the functionality delivered per
release or features developed per
developer
we could measure quality metrics such as
defect found in internal tests
continuous integration tests are those
detected by customers for user
orientation we could measure the
downtime experienced by users in the
field we could also find measures for
user satisfaction through surveys or Net
Promoter scores for business value we
could measure how frequently incremental
value was delivered to the customer we
could also measure substance of releases
in terms of their visible features for
future orientation we could measure
employee satisfaction in terms of
employee complaints or employee
satisfaction scores
these would then indicate how the
organization is positioned for future
success we could also measure the
understanding and the maturity of scrum
with the key indicator being attendance
and participation in scrum ceremonies
let's summarize the topics covered in
this lesson agile is an iterative and
incremental method for developing
products scrum is the most popular agile
method scrum provides value to the
organization in the form of higher
productivity reduce costs better quality
and more engaged in satisfied employees
some results in faster time-to-market
and improved stakeholder satisfaction
scrum relies on frequent feedback and
experimentation which results in better
predictability and flexibility and as
with all other endeavors we should test
and measure the actual results of scrum
adoption
