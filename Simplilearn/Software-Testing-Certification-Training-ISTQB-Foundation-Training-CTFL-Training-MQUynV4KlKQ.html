testing and quality how can we decide
when we can stop testing okay even
before getting there let us try and
understand what exhaustive testing is
exhaustive testing which otherwise can
be termed as complete testing is a test
approach in which the test suite
comprises all combinations of input
values and preconditions testing
everything or all combinations of inputs
and preconditions is not feasible except
for trivial cases so instead of
exhaustive testing we use risks and
priorities to focus testing efforts let
us look at these in more detail we can
never test all possible scenarios as we
never know exactly how the end user will
use the product also we really never
know exactly what features have been
affected by the recent code changes even
though we might think we do considering
these facts decision to ship a product
to next phase of software development
cycle with an associated risk let us see
how we can handle these risks we can
mitigate risk with automated testing
that has significant coverage acceptance
level tests with most common used
features in the product can also help in
reducing the risk additionally testing
should provide sufficient information to
stakeholders to make decisions for the
next development step or hand over to
customers the effort put into the
quality assurance and testing activities
needs to be tailored to the risks and
costs associated with the project
because of the limits in the budget time
and in testing we need to decide how we
will focus on our testing based on the
risks we'll look at risk assessment in
