cloud computing has tremendous potential
to improve security and let's look at a
few ways of doing it
security and benefits of scale cloud can
improve security and flexibility
especially when employed in a large
scale thus better protection can be
assured with the same investment
defensive measures such as patch
management hardening of virtual machine
instances control exercised on basis of
role federated identity management are
all different kinds of defensive
measures that can be used also cloud
service providers have the resources to
replicate content in multiple locations
and helps in disaster recovery other
benefits of scale include efficient
threat management efficient timelines to
response etc
security as a market differentiator
customers choose the providers based on
confidentiality integrity and
flexibility this makes the cloud
provider or CP improve their security
practices
large players offer standardized open
interfaces for managed security services
this establishes a more open and readily
available market and the customers can
switch to different providers more
easily with low setup costs
failing of resources many cloud
resources can rapidly be scaled on
demand individual resources can be
scaled in a granular way without scaling
all of these system resources for
example storage central processing unit
or CPU time memory web service requests
and virtual machine instances
cloud providers can also dynamically
allocate resources and optimize resource
allocation methods
it's include auditon evidence gathering
timely effective and efficient updates
and defaults better risk management
through audits and SLA s and resource
concentration we will look into risk
assessment and process in the next slide
this risk is almost the same as
intercepting data in transit but applies
to the data transfer between the cloud
provider and the customer in this slide
we will explain insecure or ineffective
deletion of data
during a provider change scaling down
the resources reallocation of hardware
etc may happen and the data may be
available beyond the period mentioned in
the security policy
data deletion will be possible only by
destroying the entire disk which also
stores data from other clients this may
not be true wiping of data special
procedures must be followed for true
wiping of data which may not be
supported by the standard API level of
the risk may be lower with the use of
effective encryption</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
