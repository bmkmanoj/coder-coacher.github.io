2011 intermediate lifecycle course on
continual service improvement
certification course this is the
introductory lesson provided by simply
learn on continual service improvement
si si
I am Alex and I will be with you
throughout this e-learning session this
course consists of nine learning units
apart from this introductory lesson
therefore it is important that you go
through this lesson before accessing the
remaining nine learning units so what
are we waiting for let's begin with the
introductory lesson agenda
we will first begin with the objective
of this lesson followed by a few recap
topics that you might have covered
during your ITIL foundation level the
topics we will cover are ITIL basic
introduction ITIL intermediate and its
relevant topics this is followed by
information about the accreditation
Institute CSI course description and its
objective we will then look at who can
attend this course next moving to the
exam section we will learn about the
exam prerequisites or say the
eligibility criteria for attending this
course exam format and exam tips to help
you achieve this certification lastly we
will look at the CSI course outline and
the duration required for each learning
units and detail about the quiz provided
by simply learn at the end of each
learning unit so go ahead and experience
this course where the objectives of this
introductory lesson is to educate you on
the course web that simply learn offers
help you on how this online course works
ensure that you are aware of all the
topics and subtopics covered in this
course let us begin with ITIL definition
and its benefits
ITIL is the most widely adopted approach
for IT Service Management in the world
it provides a practical no-nonsense
framework for identifying planning
delivering and supporting IT services to
the business adopting ITIL can offer
users a huge range of benefits that
include improved IT services reduced
costs improved customer satisfaction
through a more professional approach to
service delivery improved productivity
improved use of skills and experience
and improved delivery of third-party
service we will now study more about
ITIL under the topic foundation basics
at the end of this lesson let us now
understand the ITIL intermediate which
is the next level in the ITIL
certification
ITIL 2011 intermediate level is the next
level after ITIL foundation ITIL
intermediate level has a modular
structure with each module focusing on
different aspects of ITIL they are
service lifecycle and service capability
the intermediate modules focuses more on
detail-oriented study than the
foundation level and is an
industry-recognized qualification while
on completion of your ITIL foundation
and prior choosing this course the
thought about how one can become an ITIL
expert must have crossed your mind let's
get the answer to this in the next slide
let us have a brief look at the ITIL
certification path the diagram in the
slide is a graphical depiction of the
ITIL certification path ITIL
certification path is based on credit
point system that is you need to
accumulate nine credit points at each
stage till the expert ITIL foundation is
the first certification which gives you
two credit points on certification on
completion of the foundation level you
become eligible to appear for
intermediate level where you can choose
from two streams one life cycle and two
capability the life cycle modules have
all the standard five life cycle phases
as exams which provide three credits
each capability modules are more focused
towards implementation content and have
four exams which provide four credits
each you can choose any one of the
modules from either streams or make a
combination on the basis of your
experience in the industry thus at this
level the minimum credit requirement is
15 once you accumulate 15 points plus to
a foundation that is 17 credit points
makes you eligible for the third level
that is ma LC which provides you five
credit points once you are certified
five mal see your final school credit
becomes 22 to become an ITIL expert
there is no separate exam you need to
accumulate 22 credits to become an ITIL
expert I'm sure you're clear on the
certification path let us understand the
service lifecycle and its modules in the
next slide the service lifecycle modules
are for candidates who aspire to handle
a management or team lead role which
requires a broad management focus on
ITIL practice areas it is also for
candidates who work or coordinate across
teams or manages multiple capability
areas the different modules and the
service life cycle are one service
strategy SS - service design sd3 service
transition st for service operation so5
continual service improvement CSI
similarly let's understand service
capability in the next slide
service capability modules are for the
candidates who aspire to specialize in
process level knowledge in one or more
processes which focuses more on
day-to-day execution the different
modules under service capability are one
service offerings and agreement SOA to
release control and validation RC v3
operations support and analysis osa for
planning protection and optimization as
we have an understanding of both the
streams let us understand the
differences between them in the next
slide here is the difference between the
lifecycle and capability if you observe
you will see that life cycle mainly is
phase oriented whereas capability is
process oriented also life cycle focuses
on individuals who work on the process
whereas capability focuses on
individuals who are in the process take
a few minutes to learn about the
differences on this slide once you are
done move on to learn about mal see
managing across the lifecycle is the
last step in achieving the ITIL expert
certification therefore it is mainly
focused on individuals who want to
become ITIL experts on completing ALC an
individual can apply the ITIL knowledge
and it provides skills that can be used
in the workplace in a tangible way we
have already discussed on the credit
system in the certification path slide
however just to mention the mal C
certification gives you five credit
points now let us proceed to look at the
accreditation Institute for ITIL in the
next slide the governing body the ITIL
2011 Foundation and intermediate is the
Cabinet Office UK simply learn is
accredited by APM G and tuv as an ITIL
foundation and intermediate training
provider also simply learn is an
accredited examination centre AEC by APM
G tuv and xsin to conduct these exams so
this has been a basic introduction on
ITIL let us now focus on the CSI course
description and objective in the coming
slides continual service improvement CSI
certificate is a free-standing
qualification but it is also part of the
ITIL intermediate lifecycle stream and
one of the modules that leads to the
ITIL expert certificate in IT Service
Management the purpose of this training
module and The Associated exam and
certificate is respectively to impart
test and validate the knowledge on
industry practices in service management
as documented in the ITIL continual
service improvement publication let's
understand the objective of this course
in the next slide
the objective of the CSI course is to
provide a complete management level

these exercises a go Sri for your
reference will be provided at the end of
this course please note to move from one
learning unit to another you need to
complete these quiz questions with the
right answers let us proceed to recap on
some of the definitions and terms used
in ITIL the next section is on
foundation basics well this section is
provided to help you refresh the
learnings from ITIL foundation here we
will discuss about service service
management functions and processes of
CSI lifecycle before I drill down more
on continual service improvement I will
first explain the concept of good
practices and the importance of them
organizations operate in dynamic
environment with the need to learn and
adapt there is a need to improve
performance while managing trade-offs
under similar pressure customers seek
advantage from service providers they
pursue sourcing strategies that best
serve their own business interest in
many countries government agencies and
nonprofit organizations have a similar
propensity to outsource for the sake of
operational effectiveness this puts
additional pressure on service providers
to maintain a competitive advantage with
respect to the alternatives that
customers may have the increase in
outsourcing has particularly exposed
internal service providers to unusual
competition to cope with the pressure
organizations benchmark them
cells against peers and seek to close
gaps in capabilities one way to close
such gaps is the adoption of good
practices in wide industrial use there
are several sources for good practices
including public frameworks standards
and the proprietary knowledge of
organizations and individuals good
practices permit organizations to
operate in dynamic environments with the
need to learn and adapt improve
performance while managing trade-offs
benchmark using industry good practices
to differentiate themselves against
peers to close gaps in capabilities let
us move on to our next line definition
of service in our last slide we
discussed about the concept of good
practices and the importance of them
this slide explains the term service we
need to understand the basics of the
concept of service and value this makes
me ask a question what is a service what
is our understanding of the service
service is defined as services our means
of delivering value to customers by
facilitating outcomes customers want to
achieve without the ownership or
specific costs and risks we can refer to
anything around us in this universe as
service let's take an example of the
rooms around you take anything in that
room right from the smallest
item to the biggest now think about the
item you choose and see any item that
you choose serve some purpose to you and
it has been provided by seller who
manufactures this item to fulfill the
same purpose of yours here the item you
choose is your service manufacturer is
the service provider and you who utilize
the service of the customer service
provider helps the customers to be free
and to focus on what they consider to be
their core competence from the
customer's perspective
value consists of two primary elements
utility or fitness for purpose and
warranty or fitness for use let us move
on to our next slide definition of
service management in our last slide we
discussed about the concept of service
this slide explains the concept of
service management service management is
a set of specialized organizational
capabilities for providing value to
customers in the form of services the
capabilities take the form of functions
and processes for managing services over
a life cycle with specializations in
strategy design transition operation and
continual improvement the capabilities
represent a service organizations
capacity competency and confidence for
action the act of transforming resources
into valuable service is at the core of
service management without these
capabilities a service organization is
merely a bundle of resources that by
itself has relatively low intrinsic
value for customers let us move on to
our next slide benefits of IT Service
Management in our last slide we
discussed about the concept of service
management this slide explains the
benefits of IT Service Management IT
Service Management has following
benefits improved quality of service and
service availability leading to improved
business productivity and revenue IT
service continuity procedures more
focused clear review of current IT
capability and future potential of IT
services better information on current
services greater flexibility for the
business through improved understanding
of IT support enhanced customer
satisfaction increased flexibility and
adaptability within the IT services
improvements in security accuracy speed
availability improved cycle time for
changes and success rate let us move on
to one next slide
benefits of IT Service Management in
continuation to our last slide this
slide further explains the benefits of
IT Service Management IT Service
Management has the following benefits
common language from as is - to be more
effective governance and control
improved service levels catering the
services that meet customer demands have
common integrated and centralized
processes well-defined roles and
responsibilities identifying those
processes that can be leveraged improved
strategic and financial health
competitive advantage let us move on to
our next slide benefits of IT Service
Management in continuation to our last
slide this slide further explains the
benefits of IT Service Management IT
Service Management has the following
benefits operating costs will decrease
profit margins will improve efficiency
will improve service quality will be
constantly improving the IT department
will become more effective organization
becomes more responsive to changes in
business direction let us move on to our
next slide service management pictorial
view in our last slide we learned the
benefits of IT Service Management this
slide explains the pictorial view of
service management let us understand the
concept of service assets resources and
capabilities now let me ask you what
does the IT service do the answer would
be they enhance the performance of those
customer assets to deliver better or
increased business outcomes and hence
delivers business value how does the IT
service provider deliver these services
it is by effective use of service assets
their resources and capabilities so in
this context service assets are the
resources and capabilities of the
service provider service providers
assets that are utilized to deliver the
IT services to the business customer
customer assets are the resources and
capabilities of the customer customers
assets that are utilized to deliver
business outcomes these assets make use
of the IT services to enhance their
performance or to remove some
constraints here it is important that
the service provider has to define a
service always in connection to the
specific customer assets to which the
utility of the service is delivered to
let us move on to one next slide
utility and warranty in our last slide
we learn the service assets resources
and capabilities this slide explains the
concept of utility and warranty here we
will discuss about creating the value
now when we say service is the means of
delivering value to the customers then
how do we deliver value what does value
contain can we quantify the value I say
that we can understand this concept with
the utility and warranty model from the
customer's perspective value consists of
two primary elements utility or fitness
for purpose and warranty or fitness for
use
utility is perceived by the customer
from the attributes of the service that
have the positive effect on the
performance of tasks associated with
desired outcomes removal or relaxation
of constraints on performance is also
perceived as a positive effect warranty
is derived from the positive effect
being available when needed in
sufficient capacity or magnitude and
dependably in terms of continuity and
security utility is what the customer
gets and warranty is how it is delivered
customers cannot benefit from anything
that is fit for purpose but not fit for
use and vice versa it is useful to
separate the logic of utility from the
logic of warranty for the purpose of
design development and improvement
considering all the separate
controllable inputs allows for a wider
range of solutions to a problem of
creating maintaining and increasing
value remember absolute quantification
of value is not possible
let us move on to our next slide utility
and warranty continued in our last slide
we learned the concept of utility and
warranty this slide explains the concept
of utility and warranty in graphical
format let us move on to our next slide
process functions in our last slide we
learn the concept of utility and
warranty this slide explains the concept
of processes and functions now this
slide explains as a service provider how
to deliver value to customers the
service provider has to execute certain
activities in order to deliver the value
to customers in the form of service this
starts from understanding what the
customer wants or say understand
expectations customer expectations need
to define a specific set of activities
which are to be executed by the people
in order to deliver value these
specialized set of activities are termed
as a process the process is defined as a
set of activities designed to accomplish
a specific objective a process takes to
define inputs and turn them into defined
outputs a process may include roles
responsibilities tools and management
controls required to deliver the outputs
we also need to learn the basic
characteristics of any process the
characteristics of the process are that
it is measurable
it delivers specific results as expected
by customers primary result as agreed
with customers are delivered to
customers or stakeholders and it
responds to specific events or triggers
now let us understand the concept of
functions functions typically define
roles and the associated authority and
responsibility for a specific
performance and outcomes coordination
between functions through shared
processes is a common pattern in
organization design functions tend to
optimize their work methods locally to
focus on assigned outcomes poor
coordination between functions combined
with an inward focus leads to functional
silos that hinder alignment and feedback
critical to the success of the
organization as a whole well defined
processes can improve productivity
within and across functions now we have
covered the concepts of service value
value creation model and processes
executed by the service provider for
delivering value to the customer let us
move on to our next slide ITIL history
in our last slide we learn the concept
of processes and functions
this slide explains the history of ITIL
it all started in the 1980s when the
British government determined that the
level of IT service quality provided to
them was not sufficient
thus they hired an organization to
survey to find out the best practices of
the IT service providers the central
computer and telecommunications agency
CCTA
were tasked with developing a framework
for efficient and financially
responsible use of IT resources within
the British government and the private
sector the collection of these practices
was originally called G ITIM government
information technology infrastructure
management dozens of books were
published but later it was realized that
this collection needed integration in
the 1990s framework started to gain
popularity large companies and
government agencies in Europe adopted
the framework very quickly let's move on
to one next slide ITIL history continued
in continuation to our last slide this
slide also explains the concept of
history of ITIL later in the year 2000
version 2 was published the service
support and service delivery books were
redeveloped into more concise useable
volumes in the year 2001 the CCTA
merged into the office of government
commerce OGC PS 15,000 standard was
published by the BSI in the year 2005
iso 20000 standard was published to
complement the framework in the year
2007 version 3 was published a life
cycle approach to service management
with greater emphasis on IT business
integration in the year
at 2011 version three edition 2011
published service strategy revamped BRM
design coordinator added and other
changes were included looking at the
current changes in the organization's
across the globe
let us move on to one next slide ITIL
processes functions across lifecycle in
our last slide we understood the history
of ITIL this slide explains the concept
of ITIL process functions across the
lifecycle the ITIL core consists of five
publications each provides the guidance
necessary for an integrated approach as
required by the iso/iec 20000 standard
specification service strategy service
design service transition service
operation continual service improvement
let us move on to one next slide
service owner process owner in our last
slide we understood process functions
across the lifecycle this slide explains
the concept of service owner process
owner service owner is the person who is
accountable for the delivery of a
specific IT service they are responsible
for continual improvement and management
of change affecting services under their
care example the owner of the payroll
service process owner the person
responsible for ensuring the process is
fit for the desired purpose and is
accountable for the output of that
process example the owner for the
availability management process let us
move on to our next slide ITIL 2011 core
publication in our last slide we
understood the concept of service owner
process owner this light explains the
concept of ITIL publication ITIL has the
following components the ITIL core best
practice guidance applicable to all
types of organizations who provide
services to a business the ITIL
complementary guidance a complementary
set of publications with guidance
specific to industry sectors
organization types operating models and
technology architectures the ITIL core
consists of five publications figure 1.2
each provides the guidance necessary for
an integrated approach as required by
the iso/iec 20000 standard specification
service strategy service design service
transition service operation continual
service improvement each publication
addresses capabilities having direct
impact on a service providers
performance the structure of the core is
in the form of a life cycle it is I
turret 'iv and multi-dimensional it
ensures organizations are set up to
leverage capabilities in one area for
learning and improvement in others the
ITIL core is expected to provide
structure stability and strength to
service management capabilities with
durable principles methods and tools
this serves to protect investments and
provide the necessary basis for
measurement learning and improvement the
guidance in ITIL can be adapted for use
in various business environments and
organizational strategies the ITIL
complementary guidance provides
flexibility to implement the call in a
diverse range of environment let us move
on to our next slide this marked the end
of our introductory lesson let's do a
quick recap of what we learned so far
in this lesson we learnt about what is
ITIL ITIL intermediate definition of
service lifecycle and capability we also
got some information about the ITIL
intermediate examination format itself
and looked at the prerequisite of taking
up the examination finally we covered
the objective eligible candidates and
syllabus of CSI and foundation basics
hope you have a clearer view of how the
tutorial works thank you and happy
