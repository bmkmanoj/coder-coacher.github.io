service asset and configuration item or
CI baselines across the whole service
lifecycle the purpose of the change
management process is to control the
life cycle of all changes and help in
implementing beneficial changes with
minimum disruption to IT services the
objective of change management is to
respond to business and IT requests to
ensure alignment of services with
business needs ensure that changes are
introduced in a controlled manner
optimizing business risk ensure timely
and successful implementation of changes
to meet business needs and use standard
processes and record every change the
scope of change management is to handle
changes to architecture tools metrics
processes and documentation addition
removal or modification of a service or
a CI or associated documentation and
changes to any of the five aspects of
service design in the next screen we
will discuss the change model the image
illustrates the different activities in
a change management process the change
management process starts with the
request for change or RFC the RFC is
logged in the change management system
and the information is captured and
tracked to completion an initial review
is performed to filter RFC's that are
incomplete or incorrectly routed the
rfcs are then assessed which may require
the involvement of the change advisory
board or the emergency change advisory
board for business justification impact
cost benefit and risk associated with
the changes next the change is
authorized by the change manager the
change requester in turn will ensure
that they have the approval in the
following three areas financial what is
it going to cost and what is the cost of
not doing it business what are the
consequences
is to the business both of implementing
and not implementing the change and
technology what are the consequences to
IT infrastructure following this change
management coordinates the work
performed with multiple checkpoints and
Ford's approved changes to the relevant
product experts to build and test the
changes and create and deploy releases
finally the implemented changes are
reviewed in a post implementation review
or PIR if the change is successful it
can be closed a key activity of change
management is the assessment of the
change request either by the change
manager or the change advisory board in
the next screen we will discuss the
change advisory board or CA B the seven
R's of change management a set of seven
questions forming a quick checklist to
assess the impact and risk to benefit
ratio of a change our who raised the
change what is the reason for the change
what is the required return what are the
risks involved what resources are
required to deliver the change who is
responsible for building testing and
implementing the change what is the
relationship between this change and
other changes in the next screen we will
understand how the change management
process is measured a metric or a key
performance indicator or KPI is used to
measure and report performance to manage
a process IT service or activity KPIs
are selected in a way that ensures
efficiency and cost effectiveness some
of the metrics used in change management
are for compliance decrease in the
number of unauthorized changes decrease
in the number of emergency changes
whether the integrity of the CIS is
maintained for effectiveness and
delivering value increase in the
percentage of changes implemented that
meet customer requirements reduction in
disruptions defects and rework reduction
in failed or backed out changes
decrease in the quantity of incidents
attributable to any change for
efficiency benefits gain that is the
value of the change compared to the cost
incurred to implement the change average
time to implement the change by urgency
priority or type increase in the
percentage accuracy of change estimates
in the next screen we will discuss the
challenges in implementing and
practicing the change management process
the key challenges faced by change
management are business pressure there's
pressure to immediately implement any
new business process initiatives in the
organization incomplete and inaccurate
configuration management system leading
to inaccurate change assessment
technical function areas working in
silos lack of communication channels
between the technical teams and other
teams involved in service delivery make
it difficult to execute a change
misunderstanding of emergency changes
sometimes the technical team may
misunderstand between urgency of
implementing a change and emergency
changes scalability in a large
organization is a challenge as some CIS
may not be deployable in the existing
infrastructure making it difficult for
the change management team to implement
the change vendor or contract compliance
in case vendors have a change management
system of their own they may resist from
the change management process in the
business organization in the next screen
we will discuss the service asset and
configuration management process
