and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
redistribution this lesson will focus on
ipv6 routing let us begin with the
objectives of the lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to identify the advantages of
ipv6 configure various ipv6 address
types configure stateful dhcpv6 and
slack describe the ipv6 routing protocol
including rip ng e IG RP for ipv6 and
OSPF v3 describe multi-protocol border
gateway protocol configure access lists
in ipv6 let us start with a discussion
of the advantages of ipv6 over ipv4 ipv6
provides 3.4 times 10 to the 30th power
addresses versus the 4.3 billion
addresses provided by ipv4 the increase
in the number of addresses is the
biggest benefit of ipv6 in fact in ipv6
there are multiple addresses per
interface the blocks of ipv6 addresses
are allocated to make aggregation easier
than ipv4 there is no need for network
address translation NAT or protocol
address translation Pat there are other
advantages of ipv6 IPSec security and
mobility support is inherent in ipv6
internet control message protocol
version 6 icmpv6 messages are sent in
ipv6 packets in ipv4 ICMP v4 is a
separate protocol ipv6 performs MTU
discovery in combination with icmpv6
ipv6 determines the
appropriate MTU size it retransmits the
packet with a progressively smaller MTU
until it arrives at the destination flow
labels identify packets that are part of
the same TCP or UDP connection there for
multi-layer switches and routers can
process traffic on a per flow basis this
is more efficient than processing packet
by packet since ipv4 is running out of
addresses a move to ipv6 is imminent
Cisco IOS released 12 point 2 T and
later where the appropriate feature set
is ipv6 ready
visit the website given on the slide to
test if your equipment is ipv6 ready let
us learn about ipv6 addresses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
