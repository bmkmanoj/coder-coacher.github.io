operations. It focuses on a collaboration
between developers and other roles.
Developers typically work in isolation.
They can't do this anymore.
We need to work in conjunction with the
operations people and the QA people. We
need to find out how to develop an
application from start to end from the
inception to all the way through to
production and production support. It's
about thinking about how things are
going to work in the future when we're
in the very beginning stages of the
operations. And also
great importance is on automating the
process. We don't want to do things
manually more. We want everything to be
fast, totally automated and reliable. The
number of issues facing DevOps. Software
requirements are constantly changing. We
also need to define a good path between
design, development, testing and release.
We need to decide how to package the
software, how to distribute it and how to
deploy it into production and we also
need to have ongoing operations and
running the system from the future from
once it's deployed onwards. Through a
number of deployment issues. These are
particularly true in the case of web
applications.
Traditionally developers write the code
and operations people manage the servers.
When it comes to things like application
servers there's a gap because there's a
thing called a deployment descriptor
which is neither in the developers realm
nor the operations realm we need people
who can bridge that gap if we're going
to be successful so because developers
have very little knowledge of the
application server they only know about
the code and they're only interested
really in the code the actual workings
of the application server can be a bit
of a mystery the operations team are not
usually developers so they don't know
how to interface the software with the
application server so we need people who
are both developers and operations
people to resolve the issues this is
what DevOps is partly about now the
whole process of DevOps is to use
automation and use different tools to do
the operations
number of different categories of tools
each of the categories has got its own
range of tools which each do something
similar but in a slightly different way
so for example we've got tools for
monitoring we've got tools for releasing
into production configuration management
packaging the application all sorts of
testing integration and performance
testing building the application and
initially starting with the code
development and unit testing the whole
range of tools and we'll be looking at
the whole range of these tools from one
end to the other so what are the goals
of DevOps it's about thinking about the
whole system the whole process from
start to end this involves coordinating
with the teams and involves having
feedback loops from one position to
another it's also about continuous
improvement we need to improve the way
we work by working belt well together
and using the tools correctly so that we
have fewer incidents in production which
have costly read the cushions we also
want to improve the process efficiency
so that the team learns and is better
and better each time
so some importantly improvements are
these would you seem testing time
that doesn't mean reducing testing it
means reducing the time that the tests
that she run try to reduce the amount of
changes required when there you have
requirements the conflicting or
incomplete we need to resolve those
conflicts early on we need to find the
simplest solution to meet the
requirements is not necessarily the
optimal solution but a best solution
that works well we need to use standard
tools across the organization which
integrate well together we need to have
really robust production systems which
have very low maintenance costs and are
very very reliable we also need to
produce software to the highest possible
quality and B to achieve this we need to
improve the performance of the
individuals and the teams and how they
work together now part of the process of
improvement is changing the way people
work we need to be strive for clarity we
want to challenge any uncertainties in
requirements we don't want to fill in
the gap which many people attempted to
do ask somebody who knows what the
answer is before making any assumptions
assumptions themselves are particularly
difficult to deal with we need to be
sure that they are valid assumptions and
that they haven't been put there for
some reason which hasn't been justified
we want simplicity and reliability the
optimal design is almost impossible but
the best design is what would strive for
we also want to reduce risk we need to
be able to meet the requirements with
the least risk path an important thing
is to avoid gold plating don't put extra
code in there just for the sake of it or
for some potential future change which
may never happen do the minimum to get
the thing to work and when one's an
issue
find the root cause of the issue don't
just try and fix the symptoms because
the root cause is going to come back and
bite you later on so the working
practice should be constantly evolving
and very iterative so you learn
something some new technology some no
tool you try it out work with it then
you think about it okay did I do a good
job at this put it do a better job of
this how do I do a better job of this
and then you learn some more to improve
yourself and go round and round the loop
as you improve as time goes on so that's
the end of that section and now we've
got a knowledge check
the technical challenges of which there
are many and DevOps is really here to
help solve these technical challenges so
what are these challenges well first of
all technology is constantly evolving if
we look at the IT world in terms of
software itself very little has changed
over the last 3040 years we've just got
better at it but the technology has
changed dramatically no longer we've got
large rooms full of very hot expensive
machines we have very small fast and
efficient machines these days and we
have to be able to use this technology
to its best our working environment is
changing as well we've learnt over the
time how to do things better and we've
got more interesting working practices
these days than we've ever had before
good practices five years ago are now
considered bad practices this constantly
evolving there are also external
influences over which we have no control
a new story can cause major economic
incidents there are legal effects some
industries particularly the finance
industry is very very tightly regulated
and there's also social influences as
well we need to be keep our customers
happy at all times so DevOps is the
culture which we need to build and
maintain it needs to adapt to continuous
change by continually changing and the
organization's culture needs to evolve
around it the problem is people are very
resistant to change they don't like to
have to do something in a different way
to which they're used to but also we
need to get people to work together and
not in isolation some people do not like
this they'd like to work in a box
quietly sitting there with their
headphones on not interacting with
anybody just focusing on their work we
really can't do this anymore
we have to work together we need to talk
together and get together to get a good
solution as a team now software tools
are very important for the whole process
of DevOps now individuals and teams will
have their preferred tools in a large
organization which has been formed by
mergers and acquisitions the teams will
have come from different parts and they
will have their own different set of -
preferred tools we can really can't do
this we need to have a standard set of
tools across the organized
Asian open-source tools are readily
available although some organizations
don't like to use open source tools
because of support issues but it's also
important to have very standardized set
of tools across the organization for
various reasons so look at the reasons
first for licensing and compliance and
many of the software applications and
tools require licensing that can get
incredibly complex for a big
organization with a very wide range of
tooling we also have problems with
versioning if people are using different
versions of the tools are going to be
compatibility issues which you need to
address there's also a very important
that there are production support for
the tools you can't introduce a tool
into a production environment if the
production support team can't support it
and we also need to think about the
future once an application is in
production it needs to be maintained and
supported and it needs to be easy to do
that so many organizations have legacy
systems and any new tools that you
introduce need to be able to function
with both the new and the old systems
we're getting to the stage now where
we're getting hybrid of environments we
have the existing solutions we've got
new cloud-based solutions which are
increasingly attractive because of the
the cost values and tools must be cloud
ready or cloud compatible for future
deployment the old and new systems need
to work together and complete with
production support for both old and new
systems corporate networks are very
important and they're getting
increasingly complex we need to have
address issues such as internet
connectivity we need to think about the
addressing of various machines and
firewalls we need to have virtual local
area networks across sites we need to
connect the cloud how about the data
centers where are the data centers and
how do we connect to them and also think
about the local area networks on the
company sites keeping teams isolated
from each other so that they don't have
access to each other's data if that
might not be a good idea for various
reasons such as security so changing the
network configuration is very complex
it's also very risky because you're
likely to break connectivity cloud
computing comes with its own networking
which is actually very efficient
it makes things less complex much more
adaptable and more audible it also needs
to be more secure but cloud platforms
are very secure by default everything is
denied by default which is always a good
thing you have to open up access to give
people permission to do things there's
also a costs impact changing corporate
culture is costly we need to buy new
hardware we need to buy new software
licenses we need to pay for cloud usage
which is usually by resources like CPU
and network we need to retrain our
employees so that they understand and
use the new equipment and tools very
well people are learning new skills we
do runs of reduced efficiency but we
have to live with that so the need to be
a budget for ongoing change we need to
know it's going to cost there's going to
be an initial cost in terms of
efficiency and quality but that will
improve over the long term so DevOps is
not just about writing and deploying
code we need to improve existing code
new tools need to be new to support new
code new tools need to support new code
but they also need to be able to support
legacy code legacy code might need to be
changed or restarted over time to make
it more manageable and to make it fit in
with the new process in tooling and we
need to taking on board bug fixing
enhancements which need to work with the
new tools and new procedures now so
let's have a look at some of the
software tools we'll be looking at each
of these tools in more detail later on
during the the course but let's have a
look at what the actual basic tools are
set up a tool chain
one of the challenges is to select the
right tools there are many tools that
perform similar functions and the tools
also need to work very well together
exclusive tools each for each stage of
the software development lifecycle
phases some tools straddles various
phases some are very specific to
individual phases so let's look at the
first stage which is requirements
analysis it's all about communication
within the team and talking across
different roles so we need to be able to
that allow developers managers customers
business analysts or to talk the same
language and think about that various
tools that we want to use so fairly
obviously word processing spreadsheets
are those spreadsheets are often very
much abused and can cause a lot of
problems egg calendars so we know when
meetings are sprint management tools
although a lot of sprint management
tools are very low-tech wiki's are
incredibly useful for storing
information which is readily accessible
we need UML diagramming tools to
describe our applications and we need
issuing task management tools to manage
the workflow we have the concept of
artifact creation an artifact is simply
a by-product or result of some operation
on some kind of code so very important
to source control systems they manage
the versioning of our code and make sure
that we're building the right thing from
the right versions of the software
we've got continuous integration tools
very important for detecting problems
early so that they can be fixed and said
they don't delay other developers work
we have build tools which assemble the
components of our software from source
code through the various artifacts to
the production executables we also need
to gather documentation information and
there are tools that do that
the most complex stage of any software
development is the code development
stage and there are many tools that are
needed at this stage there's a variety
of different editors we need different
databases different types of databases
different tools for building the
software we need tools for code review
there's also them very important code
quality tools which can assess the
quality of the code and identify common
problems very quickly we have various
things like REST API design and that's
very difficult thing to do develop an
API for communicating across a network
using the REST API it is very very
difficult to coordinate user interfaces
are also incredibly difficult to
describe and get to work well we also
need to be out a map code to databases
we need unit testing and mocking
frameworks to make sure that our code is
fully custody
very important integrated development
environments they save a lot of time
developers defectively have an operating
system for which they can develop code
without having to go outside of it and
then of course we've got the in
compilers and interpreters which tend to
just work behind the scenes turning our
code from source code into executable
code
testing is vitally important we start
off with unit testing and mocking
frameworks for doing test-driven
development
scripting for writing more advanced
tests such as integration tests we've
got test harnesses which test full
systems and partial systems and we've
got user interface playback tools for
testing web interfaces we've also got
packaging tools we have repositories
where software is stored which we can
fetch and integrate with our system at
any time build tools appear here again
we've got container management tools
which are growing increasingly important
people like the use of containers where
you have one application per unit of
deployment which can communicate with
each other and then we've got deployment
descriptor generation tools as you saw
also very important because disloyalty
Scriptures which describe how software
interacts the containers are very
difficult to write then we've got
release management tools which are also
very important change management systems
we don't make change into production and
let it's been fully documented and
approved we approval systems to approve
releases we need to have important role
map mechanisms if we deploy an air Onias
system into production we need to get
back to the previous version as quickly
as possible
we need to automate the process of
release we also need to be able to
schedule tasks so that we can run
various components of the system at the
right time in the right sequence and the
important enterprise integration tools
which is allow us to deploy and change
applications dynamically automatically
very important configuration and
monitoring tools
structure configuration and management
we don't want to do it manually wanted
to automate it we have the concept of
infrastructure as code basically
scripting which controls the
infrastructure request tracing tools
find out exactly what happens when a
request is made is it been executed and
put into production performance
monitoring is vitally important make
sure our systems are doing what they're
supposed to be do in a timely fashion
also log file analysis tools many many
systems produce a lot of log files the
output is very very verbose we need to
look for the interesting things which
are usually things going wrong
which are very small parts of logging
they will need to go out of report
issues as soon as we can detect them and
AB the processing mechanism in place to
deal with them so now we're going to
look at cloud computing it's getting
increasingly important to deploy things
into the cloud as the cloud gives us
many benefits including cost and
performance
traditionally companies had data centers
but data centers are very expensive to
run and maintain for start off you could
have a building and the building needs
to be maintained and has to be purchased
we've also got to buy vast quantities of
computer hardware that's expensive we
also need considerable power supplies
large data centers consume vast amounts
of power and as anything that uses
basterds of power gets very hot so we
need a good cooling supply to do that we
also need a physical security we don't
want people getting into our data center
and causing problems
need to make sure we can connect the
data center from anywhere in the world
that we need to we also need to have
maintenance teams to support everything
because hardware fails fairly frequently
and we need to get it fixed as soon as
possible we also need to have security
teams in place to check that everybody's
got the right access is nobody has an
author ID axis that means we could have
policies and mechanism is in place to
secure our data centers so it's a very
expensive thing to do to give an example
of failures the standard SATA hard drive
has got a mean time between failure of
1.2 million hours that's a long time
it's several years but if you think
about it a data center with a hundred
thousand hard drives the laws of
statistic if we multiply those numbers
together says you can expect two drives
to fail every day on average which is
quite staggering really isn't it
most people don't expect hard drives to
fail but if you've got hundreds of
thousands of them they're going to fail
so what you're going to do well for
resort off you've got to have supply of
replacements to replace them quickly
every disc need to be mirrored so that
if it fails to taken over by another one
we need to detect a fault and be able to
find it if you cut the data center with
a hundred thousand hard drives how do
you find the one that's failed we read
maintenance teams who can deal with
these problems locate the faulty drives
and replace them we also need to be able
to destroy the disks correctly so that
data is not gained by other parties for
example destroying the disks completely
so that all data is definitely lost so
rather than having a corporate data
center we move to the cloud what happens
is cloud platform providers have
invested very very heavily in
infrastructure so what they've got a
very very large data centers very highly
saleable environments very secure and
very reliable and they provide a number
of services so on the cost basis you can
choose how much disk storage you want
you can decide how many CPUs how much
computer power you want what services
you require what platforms you want
particular operating systems and also
what applications you require so one
thing that these cloud providers do is
focus on doing one thing very well they
provide a computing platform they're not
interesting anything else
it's the users that provide the rest of
it so a bit more about data centers
cloud providers have varied high
performance data centers they are
geographically distributed around the
world it is actually quite important
this some organizations are required by
law to have their data in certain places
geographically so data centers will be
distributed typically several per
continent
access points in many locations we need
to have high-speed networks connecting
from wherever your lap happened to be to
the data centers
centers that needs to be extremely high
speed fiber cable connection of tivity
between the machines
and many cloud vendors owned their
entire infrastructure across a global
network they also have edge caching
where information is stored at the
boundary where the users interface to
the cloud rather than deep inside the
cloud where the actual data is stored so
there's a concept of infrastructure as a
service or IaaS this is the basic power
that is provided by the cloud providers
so you've got raw computing power choose
how many CPUs you've got and what power
CPUs you've got Ross storage how much
disk space you require what kind of
networking do you require do you require
an external IP address
and then the ability to build a computer
or network computer virtually you
provide the parameters in a webpage and
the system will just build you a
computer within a matter of minutes
so obviously the cloud providers want
payment and how it does this work we're
typically payment is by resource so when
you use a component nobody else can use
it so you're tying up that resource so
basically it's fair to pay for
components when you're using them or
when your resource is held because if
you're not using them nobody else can
use them but the one thing is it's very
easy for the virtual components to be
returned to the cloud vendor basically
you choose to have a component and then
you release it so a good example for
cloud is an external IP address these
are very short in demand you say you
want an external IP address for your
computer it's allocated when you start
the computer when you stop the computer
the IP address is returned to the pool
for use by somebody else it's so easy to
read configure for smaller or larger
computers so now we've got the concept
of platform as a surface or paas
and watch this is is preconfigured
runtime environments typically operating
systems or operating systems plus
well-defined applications such as web
servers and these components are
cloud-based and you choose which ones
you want the cloud provider is
responsible for updating the hardware
and the software to certain versions so
obviously they will only support certain
versions of certain operating systems
and certain applications for the
maintenance purposes the customers
provide the business logic you provide
the code that uses the actual
application the cloud provider provides
the rest and you just pay for the
resources that you're using software as
a service
this is where you get a full-blown
application such as a web based
application maintained by the service
provider and you pay for the usage you
pay for the networking traffic used
storage information and other things so
now we're going to talk about
architecture which is how things join
together how do systems communicate with
each other there are different
definitions of architecture defined by
different organizations in UML the
unified modeling language it's the
collection of connected units which are
organized to a computer and specific
purpose and what you need is some kind
of model which defines how these things
interconnect the I Triple E says a
system is a collection of components
which need to be organized to perform a
particular function or set of functions
and software architecture in practice
says the software architecture is that
program is the structure or the
structures of program which enable the
elements to be connected together and
the relationships between them so what's
the goals of architecture when it
involves various people various parties
the stakeholders the business goals as
well and also the IT infrastructure
which needs to support it as DevOps
the IT infrastructure is the most
important aspect of it but there are the
other two to take into account as DevOps
will be concerned with building the
infrastructure to support the
architecture that's required so an IT
architecture what is it where its rules
and guidelines and patterns of system
development so going to manage the
problem as a series of discrete pieces
we need to define the communication
interfaces between the pieces we need to
think about the overall structure and
how data flows we need to integrate the
various systems and subsystems in the
environment together we need to develop
software modules on the best possible
design practices and design patterns
need to control delivery of software
into the system environment effectively
and efficiently and reliably
so this compares architecture and design
architecture is more strategic Ryles
design is tactical the important word in
architecture is how how do things fit
rather than what do we use to connect
things together we look at programming
paradigms and architectural patterns
high-level patterns rather than
algorithms and low-level patterns we're
looking at the non-functional
requirements architecture is a
non-functional requirement is a
statement of these systems are going to
communicate in this way
whereas design is concerned with the
function requirements what does the
system actually do and in UML the
diagramming language we have certain
diagrams which are more associated with
architecture than those that are you use
for design so let's look at some
architectural patterns the client-server
architecture plasma has been around for
some time the idea is we have a thick
client which communicates across a
network with some external data storage
the thick client has the user interface
the business logic and the data access
layer all in the same unit of
functionality so the advantage of this
is we basically separate all of the code
from the the data if enables the server
components to be reused the server
components in managing is some central
location and we can optimize the use of
infrastructure it's also quite scalable
so the advantage of this is we basically
separate all of the code from the the
data it enables the server components to
be reused the server components and
managing is some central location and we
can optimize the use of infrastructure
it's also quite scalable the problem is
it doesn't work well with requirements
changes there are security issues as
well associated with it
the surfacing
point of failure which means the whole
system becomes I'm available if the one
component fails we've also got the
presentation and business logic in the
same place which is not a good idea it's
also quite difficult to test and scale
in terms of the thick client another
pattern which is very popular is the
interior architecture where n is a
number which is usually three the great
advantage of this is it's completely
multi-threaded so the the middle layers
can be executed in parallel so multiple
clients can each have their own threads
executing it if the business logic
changes we don't need to change the the
user interface client code typically the
client is a very thin client such as a
web browser we reduce the network
traffic dramatically because most of the
network traffic is happening between the
layers and we can add additional layers
or tiers for various purposes to add
layers of abstraction and failover
disadvantage if requirements change we
need to change quite a bit it may be in
the middle tiers the security
implications are quite interesting as
well because there can be problems
associated with the access from the
external sources
we still got server availability and
reliability issues and we've still got
testability and scalability issues
service-oriented architectures are
becoming increasingly popular they have
a great number of advantages probably
the most important one is loose coupling
we have components which can be written
in different languages operating in
different environments which can
communicate with each other seamlessly
without having to worry about the
details we've got business services can
be spread across lots of different
platforms and you just use the service
you need as and when you need it we
don't need to know where anything is it
can be anywhere within the corporate
network or within the cloud and we don't
need to know what the exact location
because the infrastructure takes care of
it we can reuse services if you've got a
legacy application what you can do is
put a service-oriented front-end on it
and then it becomes part of a
service-oriented architecture it reduce
the development costs and increases
development speed and it's easier to
integrate the business and the IT
environments there are some
disadvantages it
quite difficult to migrate because
there's so many moving parts you need
very good control you need very good
auditing and monitoring systems and
probably the hardest one is getting the
development and design correct how the
pieces fit together how they communicate
with each other
what series of operations is required to
achieve a particular business goal many
people and organizations these days are
going towards rest micro services it's a
good foundation for many api designs
rest is actually not a new idea it's
been around since 1996 when the HTTP
protocol was first devised basically the
world wide web is a good example of a
restful service so the architecture has
evolved over time the web itself has
evolved massively over the 20 years
experience existence it focuses on
resources and information and NOC code
what you do when you talk to a rest
service is you ask for a representation
of information not for the actual data
itself so components can evolve
separately it's very highly scalable you
just add other services development
costs is greatly reduced because each
piece is a fairly small unit of
functionality and it makes data
important it exposes data as a resource
and requires a separate way of
representing data the data and the code
are not considered connected the data is
stored somewhere in some form the code
delivers the data in some
representational form the disadvantages
a lot of people are not familiar with
the approach and infrastructures are not
really geared up to deal with it other
than getting better it also requires a
very significant change in the way that
developers think about how things
interoperate another architectural model
is the four plus one view which is quite
an interesting concept the idea is that
different people and teams have
different views of systems so for
example you've got the logical view is
how the end-user sees a system which is
in terms of its actual functionality you
got the development view which is how
developers seed what are the actual
software components and how they
interact
you've got the
view which is watch the actual processes
and how do they communicate with each
other and you've got the physical view
or deployment view which is where the
software actually resides on what
hardware and what location and so each
of those four views gives you a slightly
