1 a part 2 how to value a company
introduction hello and welcome to the
lesson on company valuation of the
financial modelling course by simply
learn this lesson is about the way we
can value a company valuation of
companies is a very intense and
fascinating topic as is logical
continuation of the basic elements we
introduced in part 1 on valuation
modeling here we look at the various
methods used to value a company and go
into some level of detail the
presentation we will go over today
should give you a broad overview of the
important aspects of how to value a
company with some concrete practical
examples let's now move on to our agenda
agenda we will start our presentation by
looking at backward-looking accounting
based valuation techniques those
valuations techniques rely heavily on
ratio analysis and the calculation of
key financial metrics we will introduce
the main group of financial ratios and
explain their meanings we will then
describe how accounting metrics can be
used in a forward-looking environment
through the use of financial projections
you will get to understand more about
balance sheet and profits and loss
accounts and how some of the items on
the balance sheet and in the P&amp;amp;L can be
produced forward to extend past
financial patterns we will then describe
how accounting metrics can be used in a
forward-looking environment through the
use of financial projections will get to
understand more about balance sheet and
profit and loss accounts and how some of
the items on the balance sheet and in
the pml can be projected forward to
extend past financial patterns finally
we will look at company valuation
technique that focuses entirely on a
different approach to valuation and is
based on cash flows the idea of cash
flows based evaluation techniques is
that the value of the company is just
the net present value of all its future
cash flows this gives raise to the need
to understand very well the riskiness
relay
to cash flows we will give some ideas
about how risky cash flows can be
modeled in a probabilistic environment
and how this can be integrated into
projection environment by the use of
Monte Carlo simulations now let's start
this exciting presentation
backward-looking accounting based
valuation techniques backward-looking
accounting valuation techniques rely on
aggregated financial data available
usually in a company's annual report
data available in this kind of report
can be looked at across time and the
analysis of how various key financial
metrics evolved through time provides us
with some clues about the theoretical
value of a company financial ratios are
useful because they are easy and quick
to calculate while at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
