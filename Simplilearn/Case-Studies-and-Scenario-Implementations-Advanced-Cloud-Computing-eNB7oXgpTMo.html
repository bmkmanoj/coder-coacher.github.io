you are an administrator in a company
who is handling the company's private
cloud and shared storage your manager
wants a central area in SA n to store
the setup files ISO and other
installation files in the common drive
this should be accessible to the
technical team of the company in the
form of a shared folder the manager
suggested a space of 1gb for shared
folders you have been assigned a job to
create a setup with common storage which
can be accessed in the form of folders
well this is a common scenario one can
experience in their work environment
every company follows a systematic
approach towards maintaining their
essential software's in a common
location which could be used later for
troubleshooting or any other purpose
let's understand how to achieve this
task
let's understand this case study there
are some points to be observed which are
as follows the manager demanded for a
shared folder from the SA n so two
services are to be present namely SMB
and NFS the space required is 1gb let us
assume the name of the folder to be
office setups the expected address
location to access the shared folder in
the network setup is backward slash
backward slash 192.168.255.255
first login to be open filer there click
on the volume x' and then click on add
volume to create new volume scroll down
the add volume option type the name
description and space as 1024 MB of the
volume ensure selecting the XFS volume
type as it will be used as the shared
folder once that is done click on create
you will observe the space is allotted
successfully now let's create a shared
folder next you should click on the
services option enable nfsv4 and SMB
CIFS server given this will create a
shared folder one service is enabled
click on shares to create a folder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
