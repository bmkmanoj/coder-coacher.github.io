hypothesis testing volume 1 study
session 3 reading 11 quantitative
methods hello candidate welcome back
today we learn the 12th lesson of the
simply learned cfa level 1 tutorial in
the previous tutorial we discussed the
concept of sampling and estimation we
started with the introduction of
sampling where we covered the basic
concept of sampling and its significance
then we focused on the two sampling
techniques namely simple random and
stratified random sampling highlighting
pros and cons of different ways of
choosing a sample we also discuss the
central limit theorem and the standard
error these are important concepts and
will be extensively used in this lesson
hence you are expected to remember these
concepts next we cover the construction
of confidence intervals stepwise to
understand their significance in the
sampling distribution in this lesson you
will also be required to form confidence
intervals T distribution was also
discussed in the previous lesson T
distribution will be used for the t-test
in this lesson this session is on
reading 11 as prescribed by the CFA
Institute learning outcome statement or
LOL we learned about LOL in the first
session please go through learning
outcome statement for a detailed list of
learning outcomes agenda the agenda of
this session is to cover reading 11 as
prescribed by the cfa level 1 curriculum
you can go through this reading from
volume one of the cfa level 1 curriculum
made available to you by cfa institute
in this lesson we will start by
understanding the concept of hypothesis
testing we will briefly go through the
construction of confidence intervals
though this topic was covered in the
previous lesson we will again cover it
here for emphasis and also because it
will be required extensively in this
lesson after that we will learn
how to use and interpret the z-table and
tea table once we have learned how to
use the tables we will move on to the
hypothesis testing process here we will
learn to form a hypothesis and test it
we will learn about various types of
tests as detailed in this agenda slide
these tests will be used for different
types of problems and research
requirements test that we would learn in
this lesson are z-test t-test t-test for
comparison of means of two samples
chi-square test and F test lastly we
will learn about the difference between
parametric and nonparametric tests as
per the learning outcomes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
