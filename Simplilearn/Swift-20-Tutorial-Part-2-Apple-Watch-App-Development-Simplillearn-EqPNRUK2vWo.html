and functions are extremely useful in
your code because they make your code
modular reusable and a lot cleaner so
functions actually are going to be the
first thing that we're going to deal
with that we'll be able to change things
programmatically so functions can deal
with logic functions can store
properties functions can do a lot of
things and the best way to really get
started is just to jump into a
playground and show you what they're all
about so let's do that
ok so functions let's start out with
functions by showing you how to actually
create a function and I'll explain the
syntax as we go so basically you start
out with the func keyword that means
you're about to declare a function and
you give it a name and this function I'm
going to say hello and then you have
these parentheses and inside those
parentheses would be any arguments that
the function takes so in other words if
you needed a string from the user that's
where you would get it and then if
you're returning anything in a function
then you use the hyphen and the greater
than symbol to create this arrow and
then you say what type you're going to
return so in this case we're going to
return a string and then you open up
your block for your function okay and
then in here what you have to do the
reason we're getting that error right
off the bat is because we have not
returned a string there's a keyword
called return and we use that to
inevitably at the end of the function
we're going to return a string because
we've said that we're going to return a
string when we wrote this function so
literally all this function is going to
do is going to return the string hello
and that's it that is all this function
does now you'll notice that nothing has
happened and the reason is because we
haven't called the function yet and how
do you call a function in Swift well you
just type it out in a playground string
hello and then you'll see that on the
right hand side it returns exactly what
we would expect hello
so that's pretty neat that shows you the
makeup of a function but it's not really
useful all does it say hello and we
can't change what it says or anything so
let's make a better function so we're
going to create a function with the func
keyword and we're going to say hello
there and that's going to accept an
argument which we're going to call name
and that's going to be of the type
string and then we're going to close our
parentheses because that's all we're
gonna do we're going to take a name and
then this is going to return a string
and we'll just open up our function
block here and now what we'll do is
we'll just we're simply going to do the
same thing basically as we did in the
above function but it's gonna be a
little bit more dynamic so we're going
to return a string that says hello there
and then we're gonna pull out that name
variable that we just created all right
so now again you don't see anything
because we haven't called it but if we
call hello there you'll notice that it
prompts for a string and it's saying
that it wants a name so I'm gonna say
class as the name and you'll see that
when I go ahead and I call that function
that returns the string hello there
class so that's pretty cool still
doesn't do all that much so let's let's
do a function that deals with math a
little bit here so we'll call this
function ad and we'll have that except a
number one which is going to be an
integer and a number two which is going
to also be an integer and that's just
going to return an integer so when
someone puts a number in we're expecting
to return the integer so we're just
going to return
number one plus number two all right so
this is just really just getting your
feet wet with functions a little bit so
when we call this function add it asks
for a number and it tells you that
that's going to be an integer so we'll
say 345 and if you hit the tab button it
goes over to the next one and it asks
for number two so we'll just use some
off-the-wall number and on the right
hand side it evaluates that it adds
those together and it does return our
integer like we expected now we could
have had that return a string that said
you know 345 plus 856 equals 90 101 but
we just you know
for simplicity's sake we just return an
integer there so I want to get into
slightly more complex functions but I'm
going to do that in the next video I
really just wanted to introduce you to
the syntax of a function and let you
understand how it actually works now
notice when we called this add function
there is a variable up here that we were
asking for and it's called number one
and notice that it doesn't say number
one like it says number two here and the
reason for that is the first the first
argument in a function you're expected
to understand what it is because of the
name that you've given your function so
make sure you give your function good
functions good names now you'll notice
as we called it before it still does say
that we want that number but it doesn't
specify it when you actually type out
the function okay so there's there's no
need to really be worried too much about
it but in the next video I want to go
into a little more in depth on functions
and just show you slightly more complex
functions that maybe store some
properties or deal with some properties
or perhaps handle some logic before they
return a statement
all right so we'll see you there
okay so in this video we're going to
take a closer look at functions and look
at a couple more complex examples so
we're going to jump back to that same
same playground we were working with and
we'll take it from there
okay so we're back in the same
playground and I've just created a
little bit of room here so we could work
and not be staring at the bottom of the
screen the whole time so we're gonna
create a slightly more in-depth function
just so I can show you their their
potential a little bit so I'm going to
say func and we'll make this area and
it's going to take two numbers one is
going to be width which is going to be
an integer and the other is going to be
height which is also going to be an
integer and then what we're going to do
is we're going to return a string so
we'll open up our function area here and
what I'm going to do is I want to create
a variable and I want to say let result
equal width times height okay and then
we're going to create a little logic in
here so we're going to put an if
statement in here we're gonna say if
width is equal to length and I mean
height then we're going to do the
following and we're going to go ahead
and return this string that says the
square is and we'll pull out our result
square inches okay so that's what we're
going to return if they're the same so
if the width and the height are the same
obviously it's a square and otherwise so
else if they're not the same then we're
going to return something else and we're
going to return the string that the
rectangle is and we'll pull our result
out again
square inches okay so now watch what
happens when we call this function here
so I'm just going to call it here and
we'll call area and it's going to ask me
for a width which is an integer and I'll
say that the width is 36 so three feet
and the height is we'll say 80 inches
and then what it'll tell me is the
rectangle is 2880 square inches okay but
now if I call it again and I say 25 and
25 then it detects that that's a square
and shows me that the square is 625
inches okay so you can put logic into
your functions and make them actually do
the work for you so now we could make
this you know work for circles we could
make it you know work for triangles we
could do all sorts of things you know as
complex as we'd like to make it as long
as we know how to put it in terms that
the computer will understand then it can
be done with a function so let's take a
look at another another slightly more
in-depth example so we're going to make
a function that basically says to turn
off an appliance or not so we're going
to actually call it turn off appliance
so we'll say func turn off appliance and
that's going to take two arguments one
is going to be the appliance as a name
so a string and one is going to be is on
and that's going to be a boolean so a
true or false now even though this may
be slightly more in-depth of an example
it's not going to return anything so as
we are right now we have absolutely no
errors but we're going to do is we're
going to do a if statement based on is
on so
we could say if is on equals true but
whenever you evaluate a boolean you
don't really need to say is true because
if you're saying if is on then you're
expecting to determine whether that's
true or not so if is on then what we're
going to do is we're just going to print
a line and it's going to say the and
we'll pull out the appliance name so the
appliance is on please turn it off okay
and then otherwise we'll say else if the
appliance is if it is on value is false
then we're going to return a different
statement but you have to try to kind of
visualize that what we're not doing what
we're doing is just returning a
statement here but in reality what we
would be doing is we would actually be
sending a signal to the device to turn
the appliance off or we would be
ignoring it so if we go ahead and call
this down here and we say turn off
appliance and we say that it's an oven
and is on is true then what it'll do is
it'll just say the oven is on please
turn it off but it won't say it down
here because all we're doing is a print
statement if I had done a return line as
a string it would show it down here also
but it's saying the oven is on please
turn it off and instead of actually just
saying that what we would do in a real
world application is we would send the
signal to the oven to turn it off so if
we see that the oven is on and we just
press a button on our watch or on our
iPhone to turn it off and you can do
stuff like that with a home kit you know
with certain flying
the home pet so it's not you know
something out of this world that you
know can it be done it's something
that's very reasonable so that's just
another example of what you could do and
you have to kind of use your imagination
to see this working but it's a good
example because it shows that not only
can you go based off of bullying here
but this boy is on doesn't have to come
from what we put in the function it
could come from a variable that is
detected from the appliance so if the
appliance is on it sends a signal and
then when we say oven we're just going
to go check the status of the oven and
if it is on then we're going to go ahead
and send a signal to turn it off so and
otherwise we're just going to ignore it
because it's already off and you
wouldn't want to turn a oven on remotely
so we're not going to worry about
turning it on okay so I mean those are
you know maybe not extremely in-depth
examples but those are enough to get us
started and well on our way to
understanding functions and definitely
understanding them enough to create some
pretty cool stuff in the applications
that we're going to look at and the
functions that we're going to deal with
in the applications are going to be in
fact more in-depth than these these are
just you know some pretty rudimentary
examples as you might expect in learning
functions for the first time so
hopefully you understand all this I
encourage you not only on functions but
on the other sections of the classes to
go ahead and play around with the code
and you know try to make your own
functions and make your own you know
classes as we get into classes and
whatnot to make your own and really
experiment with it until you really
fully understand what's going on because
that's that's really how you learn and
that's going to be one key part of your
success as a app developer all right so
we'll see in the next in the next lesson
in this video we're going to talk about
optionals and optionals in swift tend to
confuse a lot of people but all optional
really is is a variable that may have a
value or it may have no value at all
so either has a value or it has no value
at all so I think if explained correctly
then optionals aren't that hard to grasp
and I'm going to do my very best to
explain it to you in layman's terms
because optionals are used quite
extensively in a lot of the frameworks
that we deal with so you kind of can't
avoid using optionals and i'm gonna try
to show you like a real-world scenario
where you would use an optional okay so
we'll get to that let's go to a new
playground okay so to help me explain
optionals I'm going to use the weather
so I'm going to create a variable called
temperature and it's just gonna shorten
it for temp and that's going to be of
the type double and I'm gonna put a
question mark here so that that's now an
optional and you see if I don't give
that a value to begin with on the right
hand side it gets the value of nil which
means it has no value okay so basically
what we would do because there's no way
to predict the weather is we need to go
ahead and connect to the internet to get
the temperature right but there's no
surefire thing saying that we're going
to get the temperature but let's just
say we did in fact get the temperature
and it is 78 point five degrees out okay
now what do we do with that because this
could come back as having no value if it
comes back as having no value if it
comes back as nil then you're going to
crash your program so you need to take
precautions to do that so the most
rudimentary way to do that would be an
if statement so we could say if temp
it's not equal nil
then what we would do is we would do a
print line and we would say the
temperature is whatever the temperature
is so we would say the temperature is
and we would pull out temp to go ahead
and display that and then otherwise if
the temperature is nil then we would say
else and we would do another print line
and we would say the temp temperature
could not be obtained so for whatever
reason we can't get to the temperature
so as you see it's following correctly
because we do have a value for
temperature right now it's 78 point five
degrees but if I comment this out then
it will go ahead and say that the
temperature could not be obtained now
the problem we run into here is if I
back this back up and we look at the
actual output here it says the
temperature is optional seven eight
point five and that's not going to do us
any good because we don't want that word
optional in there so the only way to
handle that in this case would be to put
an exclamation point there saying that
there's definitely a temperature
definitely a value in the temperature
field now if I go ahead and comment this
out it goes down to temperature could
not be obtained and if I uncomment it it
comes back to temperature is 78 point
five and this really is a safe way to do
it because you're checking if
temperature is nil first but this
exclamation point if it goes ahead and
unwraps that that's called forced
unwrapping by the way that's what that
exclamation point means when you're
dealing with an optional it's the force
unwrap means that there's definitely
value there you know there's a value
there so show it to me now if it does
force unwrap that and it turns out that
it is nil
as I said before it will crash your
program now in this case we are kind of
safe but there's a much better way to
handle it and I'm going to show you that
next so it will be much better and much
more elegant if we use dan if let
statement and this is called optional
binding so if I say if let and I create
a variable and I just call it the temp
for simplicity if I can let the temp
equal temp then I'm going to do the
following and that's going to be to go
ahead and print that line that the
temperature is and then pull out the
temperature but instead of pulling out
temp we pull out the temp okay so now we
don't have any optionals to deal with we
don't have any unwrapping forced
unwrapping going on so otherwise if you
can't get if you can't assign that
variable basically then we're going to
print out that we could not get the
temperature okay
all right so basically if it can sign
that then it's going to go ahead and run
this first code if it can't it's going
to go into the else statement and it's
going to run this second code now if I
were to comment out the actual
temperature here so now we're not
getting it then you'll notice that in
both cases the if-else statement and the
if let statement it's both saying that
we could not get the temperature but
even if I didn't have this here
then this would still give us the safety
it would just not do anything because if
it can't assign this to the value of
this and have that be something other
than nil this will never print okay so
let me show you how unsafe it is to
actually I'm going to uncomment this out
real quick so we can actually get
through this without an error I want to
show you how unsafe it is so I'm going
to create a variable called the weather
and it's going to be a string and it's
gonna say
the temperature is and we're going to
pull out the value for temperature
degrees okay so now it says optional
degrees so that's no good so what's the
only other way that we could handle this
is to go ahead and put an exclamation
point right okay great well that worked
but now what happens if we don't get the
temperature from the internet boom your
program crashes because it can't get the
temperature now you notice in these two
instances up top it's fine but when
we're down here and we're just simply
pulling it out and saying go ahead give
me that vine oh it's there and then it's
not then you have a big problem and your
program crashes and first of all Apple
checks programs pretty extensively and
if your program does crash it's not ever
going to get into the App Store number
one but number two even worse is your
user has the app and all they're doing
is trying to check the weather and it
crashes on them how many times you think
they're going to try to run that app so
this not a good not a good way to go the
other two options are okay definitely
veer towards this where you're doing the
if let syntax okay because that's much
more safer you don't have to deal with
any forced unwrapping and you're good to
go and your program does not crash so
make sure you understand this before you
move on
okay so we're going to talk about
enumerations and an enumeration is
basically a list of everything in a set
or collection and in programming and
Swift and other languages enumerations
do just that they narrow down the
options that can be selected within a
certain field or within a certain
element okay so that's we're going to be
talking about so let's jump over to a
playground and get started so let me
start by saying that enumerations in
Swift and in program they're all over
the place you really can't avoid them so
just to show you how this is done I'm
just going to import UIKit here which is
the framework for iOS and I'm going to
make a couple variables here so I'm
going to say let keyboard type and I'm
going to set that equal to a UI keyboard
type and then this is an enumeration so
if I hit period here then I can only
select certain keyboard types and we're
gonna say that this is going to be a
number pad okay so then I can also you
know go through this framework and say
I'm going to set the keyboard style and
if I set that to a UI keyboard style
appearance rather and then you see we
only have limited options and that's the
whole point of an enumeration is that
it's kind of a failsafe if you can't
mess up too much okay and the whole idea
when you make your own is that you can't
have errors in your program due to
improper user selections or things like
that because it's either one selection
which is correct or it's you know one of
the other selections which are all
correct and verified by you before it
ever gets into the users hands
so let's take a look at how we make an
enumeration so we start off with the
enum keyword so II and um and that
signifies that we're going to be
declaring an enumeration and then we
give it a name so I'm going to say seat
preference and then we open up a code
block and in here is where we put our
enumerations now note the capitalization
because enumerations are started with a
capital letter so it's still camel case
but it starts with a capital letter and
you'll see this quite a bit now that
we're getting a little bit further into
the course because there's other
elements that are started with the
capital letter like classes and
structures and things like that but back
to seat preference this is sort of like
a switch where we have cases so we use
the case keyword and in this case one of
them is going to be window and then
we'll make one for the aisle and then
we'll do another case for a middle seat
and then finally we'll do a case for no
preference okay so now we have an
enumeration enumeration on its own in
general doesn't do a whole lot so they
kind of have to be used in conjunction
with something and they're very powerful
if used with a switch statement so the
first thing we would do is we would
create a variable so I'm going to create
a variable and I'm going to call it
customer prefers and I'm gonna make that
of the type seat preference okay now
what I can do is I can go ahead and say
customer prefers and just set that equal
to a seat preference dot middle of let's
say but you see how I'm just giving
those options so it only gives me those
options to select from the seat
preference that we defined so I'm gonna
say I'll but the cool thing about this
is that we don't actually need to do
that much typing because we said this
already is the type of seat preference
so all I really need to do
say I'll and that will we'll go ahead
and set that preference for us okay so
now let's learn how to use a switch
statement did this so we would do a
switch and we're gonna go off the
customer prefers variable and we're
gonna put our switch code in here okay
so as you recall now when we do switch
when we do switch statements we use
cases now I know this looks a little
familiar because we're using cases up
top but recall that the syntax for a
case on a switch is slightly different
than the syntax for a enumeration so we
would say case and we would just go down
the line so it was a dot window and
don't forget to put your your colon here
because you need it in a switch
statement when you don't need it in the
enumeration itself and then in this case
we're just going to go ahead and print a
line and it's gonna say customer prefers
the window-seat all right and then
notice the error that we're getting here
and that's because switch statements
have to be completely exhaustive okay
but you'll notice that swift is smart
enough to know when it's exhausted all
possibilities so once we've put these
four cases in then it will in fact go
ahead and eliminate our error so we're
just going to do the same thing here
we're just going to print you know the
customer prefers the aisle seat
yeah customer firstly I'll see for I'll
and it'll make another case for middle
and in that case we're just again going
to print a line customer prefers the
middle seat and we're still gonna have
an error so now once we put this case
for no preference and we have to spell
it right now our error will go away once
we have this as a full statement and it
thinks it's a full statement because I
have an empty string in there but we're
just gonna say customer has no
preference okay but you'll see here that
the switch statement is automatically
evaluating customer prefers because
we've assigned it the dot aisle
enumeration okay so this customer
prefers the window seat towards the
aisle seat rather alright so I'm not
gonna get too heavy into enumerations
right now because we are going to deal
with them quite a bit as we go through
the course and in fact enumerations can
be used in the new error handling syntax
which is coming up in the next video so
we're going to talk about error handling
next and you'll probably see me give you
an example with an enumeration okay so
that's enumerations that's just the
basic tip of the iceburg type of
enumeration but we'll get into more
depth as we go throughout the course
because we're going to need to alright
we'll see you next video
okay now we're going to talk about error
handling and error handling in Swift 2.0
is highly improved upon versus error
handling in Swift 1 and swift 1.2 so
there's a lot to learn here so we're
going to be using enumerations and we're
also going to be using a function that
throws an error we're going to take a
look at the new guard syntax which is a
safety feature for your code and we're
going to also learn the do try catch
syntax to handle errors okay so there's
a lot to learn in this section and the
best way is just to get started so we're
going to jump over into a playground and
take a look at error handling so what's
the best way to handle an error well not
have an error at all but that's not
going to happen because not everything
is in our control as a programmer
anything can happen you can have
internet outage you could have a
database failure you have corrupt system
file and you know any number things
could happen so we need to be prepared
to handle an error if one occurs so in
Swift 2.0 they introduced error handling
a new guard syntax and I do try-catch
statement that will help us handle
errors in the event that we have them
and we can predict if they're going to
happen and be ready to handle that in
our code so the first thing that is I'm
going to create an enumeration so in
room which we just looked at and I'm
going to call this login failure an
important part of this is to set it as
an error type okay this will
automatically conform to the error type
built into Swift all right so I only
need two cases in here and one is going
to be for an invalid username and in the
other case is going to be for an invalid
password so common scenario on internet
and in apps is to have a user log in to
a system so they need to have a username
and a
and that would generally be stored in a
database of some sort and what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
mock database which is just going to
store one users details and specifically
just their username and their password
so we're just going to create constants
for that so we're gonna say let DB
username and we'll make that user 1 and
we're gonna say let DB user our DB
password and we're going to set that
equal to past one so now you got to use
imagination this is stored in a database
somewhere okay so the first thing to try
to handle this error is to make that
login failure error type enumeration
which we've done so now we're going to
create a variable called login error and
we're going to make that of the type
login failure and I'm just going to
initially set this as the invalid
password type this way it's
automatically invalid so unless it
checks through our function it's going
to be invalid so now we need to create a
function that could possibly generate an
error and when we say that it could
generate an error we use the term throws
so it could throw an error so we're
going to create a function like we
normally would with one simple
distinction so we're going to create
this function called login user and it's
going to take a username which is a
string and it's going to take a password
which is also a string now here's the
keyword throws right there we have to
say that it's going to throw so that
throws an error and this is also going
to return a boolean so if the user can
login it's going to return true we open
up our function and now there's a couple
things that we want to do here at first
we want to check the database for the
username
see if that exists and we also want to
check the database for the password okay
because we need to make sure that those
details match okay so how are we gonna
check the database for the username well
we're going to use a new a new syntax
that's introduced and it's the guard
syntax and basically it works similar to
the if let syntax I showed you earlier
but it goes like this you say guard and
then we're going to say the username
which is what the user is entering or
we're actually entering through the
function and we're going to say that
that has to equal our DB username and if
that's the case we'll let that go
through otherwise we'll say else then
what we need to do is we're going to two
things we're going to set our login
error to the correct error so we're
going to say login error dot I'd rather
login error and we're going to set that
equal to a login failure dot invalid
username and then what we want to do is
we want to actually throw that error so
we're going to throw login failure dot
invalid username okay so in other words
what this syntax is saying is if the
username is equal to the database
username we're good continue in the code
and if it's not then we got a problem
and we're going to throw this error okay
so let's back this up one notch here so
now we need to check for the password
we're going to do that the same way so
we're going to say guard password and if
that can equal the database password
then we're good
the wise we need to set our login error
equal to a login failure dot invalid
password and then we need to throw that
error so we're going to throw our login
failure dot invalid password all right
now outside of these guard statements if
they can get through that code then
we're going to return true which means
that everything is good go ahead and log
the user in so right at this point is
where we would have the code to go ahead
and log user on okay now that codes not
actually going to exist in this
playground but we would log the user in
now how do we do this is the same way we
would do any other function is we would
just run the function so we would call a
login user and we put the details in but
we're going to get an error here so even
if I try this the correct way and I do
user one and pass one you'll notice that
I get an error and the reason is because
this function can throw an error but
we're not marking it with the try
statement so we can't just do that we
need to use what's called the do
try-catch statement so basically all
that is is we say do and we open up a
code block and then we say try and then
we do the function so login user and
then we'll put the correct details in
here initially and then what we need to
do is put a catch statement here to
catch the errors now in this catch
statement we're actually going to switch
on our login error so we're going to say
switch login error
and we need to do a couple things based
on what the login error actually is so
in the case that it's a dot invalid user
name I think we said let me just get
invalid username then what we're going
to do is we're going to do a print
statement and we're going to say that
log-in failed invalid username all right
and then in the case that it's dot
invalid password then we're going to do
the same thing we're to do a print
statement and we're going to say that
the log-in failed invalid password
alright so those are the only two cases
we have but it's sometimes a good idea
to go ahead and also put a default case
here in case there's an error that we
didn't predict so we could actually put
a default case here and we'll do a print
statement and we'll just say because we
don't know what happened an unknown
error occurred that's not required but
actually what's my it's never going to
be executed because there's only two
statements on our thing so yeah if we
didn't use if we had not used a
enumeration then that would have been a
good idea but since we did use an
enumeration we actually doubled up on
what we on what we need it so right now
the users logging in and it's saying
true over here because the user can
indeed log in but let's say that the
username is incorrect so I change that
now we have login failed
invalid username so let's put that back
the way it's supposed to be now they can
log in everything's fine but let's say
they tried past two so now the login is
failing because of invalid password so
you can see how this can actually handle
your errors quite elegantly and your
code is safe so this true statement will
never be reached if the username or the
password is incorrect because we are
doing a Duke try-catch statement down
here and this is all all this code here
is bundled together so this enumeration
works together with the login error and
together with the login user function
and the way we actually call that
function is what handles the error here
so as you see that's a very nice way to
make sure that your user indeed does
have the correct credentials to log into
your system so error handling in Swift
it's pretty nice it's pretty pretty
extensive but once you get the hang of
it you're good to go so I would suggest
that you play around with this a little
bit you know try to make your maybe make
your own login system your own fake
login system and a playground anyhow and
and then move on once you've got a
handle on error handling all right so
we'll see you next video
okay so we're going to talk about
property observers in this videos and
specifically getters and setters and
getters and setters are important
because they allow you to basically
synchronize two variables and
synchronize their values so that you
don't have to manually update it all the
time which is great because that's less
work for you so let's work for you means
less work for you in the code less
coding and less time developing alright
so let's get on with it and get into a
playground so the cool thing about
property observers is that you can set
one variable and have another variable
set at the same time so you have two
variables and you only set one but it
updates both and let me give an example
let's say you had a variable for feet
and you wanted to also keep track of the
number of inches so you can do that with
a getter and setter so let me show you
that because that's a really good
example so if we create a variable
called feet or extra we'll create a
variable called inches and we're gonna
say that that's a double and initially
we're just going to set that to zero
okay then now here's the important part
that you got to watch out for now we're
going to set the variable for feet so
we're gonna say variable feet and we
need to specify that that's also going
to be a double and then we open a code
block so this is sort of like a closure
and closures we haven't got into but
we'll get into those when we do talk
about actually creating apps because we
will see those in frameworks quite a bit
so now inside this code block so to
speak what we do is we say get and after
that we can optionally say set okay now
inside these get and set blocks is where
it actually does the work so the get
block is going to get the value for feet
and
how do we get the value for feet well
all we're going to do is we're going to
return and then we'll just put this in
parentheses we're going to return inches
divided by 12 okay because there's one
foot in 12 inches so now if we wanted to
set something so now we're going to set
inches off of the value of feet then we
would just say inches equals and there's
a important variable here and it's
called new value so it'll be new value
times 12 okay so now let me show you
that this actually works because right
now we have inches set at 0 so if we
call up feet what do we have 0 which
makes sense so let's set inches up here
to 12 and it comes up with 1 feet 1 feet
one foot and if we set it to 18 and it
comes up as 1.5 feet so as you can see
and the same occurs in Reverse so if we
don't set this to any value initially
well initially if we don't set that it's
going to pause the problem with our
getter and setter so we can reset it
down here if we say that inches now is
instead of being 0 if we set inches
equal to 24 then you'll see that our
value for feet is 2 but if I set feet
equal to you know 3 then it's not going
to update here because this is before
the playground okay but if I look at it
further in the playground and I look at
inches and I just literally pull it up
then that will come up as 36 inches so
they're setting each other based on what
the latest value of one was so the
latest value was that fee
is three so inches must be 36 based on
the code that we've given alright so
hopefully that makes sense and I'm going
to give you another example though so in
this case and we're actually going to
build a calculator in the course so in
this case we're going to have a display
and the display has to display a string
okay so we're going to create a variable
for the display and we're going to set
that equal to what a calculator normally
would show when you turn it on which is
zero but now in order to actually do the
math behind the scenes we need to have
that display value as a double so that
we can actually work with it with
mathematics because you can't work with
a string in mathematics you have to
convert it first okay so we're going to
have that done automatically so we're
going to create a variable called
display value and we're going to open up
a code block and we're going to make a
getter and we're going to make a set
cetera okay so first to get the display
value what oh I don't we also need to
specify what type this is so make sure
that we do end up specifying the type so
for the display value it's going to be a
double okay and what we need to do here
is we need to say first in order to get
the display value what we want to do is
we want to return the double version so
I'm going to type double in there and
then inside I'm going to say display and
I know I said this was dangerous before
but we need to specify that that
definitely has a value okay so now in
order to set it what we're going to do
is we're going to say display is equal
to the string version of new value
all right so let's let's see how this is
working let's first give us some room
here so we can see but if I set now
display equal to a string which it has
to be in order for us to actually
display it so if I set that to 789 and
then I check what display value is it's
789 as a double so as you see that works
perfectly and that that eliminates so
much work in the process of creating a
calculator that literally pays for
itself okay so you can get these for
like 99 cents I'm just kidding but
literally it taken the time to do this
one time rather than doing all these
conversions like this throughout your
code is really worth your time so I
suggest that you take a look at these
examples come up with examples of your
own like converting Celsius to
Fahrenheit or beat the meters things
like that and really understanding these
because these are very important getters
and setters okay you will love them
we'll see you next video
okay say well in the next few videos
we're going to talk about classes and
classes are extremely important not only
in Swift but in any object-oriented
programming language and classes really
they make up the framework and the
substance of what your program and
actually is and what it does and where
you hold all your functionality and it's
where pretty much everything happens was
in an application so this is really
important to grasp so we're going to
take it kind of step by step this
particular video I'm going to introduce
you to the class structure and in fact
you've seen a class because we did the
quick demo where we used a class file
but I'm going to explain it to you in
more depth here and we're gonna get
rolling with classes okay so let's head
over to a playground so class is very
important to understand so let's first
define a class and you do that with the
class keyword and then you give it a
name so we're going to create a class
called car and notice that I'm
capitalizing that okay because that is
the naming convention for classes or
that you capitalize them now if a class
does not inherit from anything then you
just open your code block give yourself
plenty of room and you write your class
now class files are generally stored as
a separate Swift file so each class
would have its own file you know it
doesn't have to be that way but
generally that's the way it's done and
that's why it's recommended to be done
so classes hold certain things within
them and one of them is properties now
properties are are just variables so for
a car we would have things like make and
I'm just going to set this all these to
an empties it would have a model for
example you might have mileage
and I just set that to zero right now
and it also have what are called methods
and methods are just functions okay so
it would just be a function so we would
create a function and here we'll just
call this description and it's not going
to take anything but it is going to
return a string and we'll open up our
function and in this function we're just
going to return a string and our string
will say the make and model has and
we'll pull out the mileage miles on it
so that's it that's our function that's
our description function and inside of a
class we refer to that as a method now
also classes in addition have
initializers and initializers are
basically what allow you to set these
variables as you're creating a class or
as you're creating an instance of a
class because we call objects and Swift
we call them instances because objects
can be either structures or they could
be classes
so rather than differentiate we just say
instance of so you have initializers
which would set it and initially in this
one I'm not going to set any
initializers and you could have a custom
initializer and I'm going to go over
that you know in the following video
we're going to continue on the same
playground so at this point our class is
created and now we have this nice nifty
car class now one thing to note is that
this car class is not inheriting from
anything and in fact it's not inheriting
from any unseen file in the Swift
language at all it's literally what
you're making right now so there is no
functionality in this class unless we
inherit from another class or we put the
functionality in the class so keep that
in mind that there is no secret
functionality that comes by just
creating a class right so we're going to
create a variable we're going to call it
a Camaro and we're going to set that
equal to a car so we'll just type the
word car in and we'll initialize that
with the parentheses so now we have an
instance of a car that goes by the name
Camaro okay so now what we can do is we
can set some things on this Camaro with
dot syntax so if we say Camaro dot and
we can put the make and make for a
Camaro bit Chevy right so we'll set that
and then we'll go ahead and say come out
dot model and that's pretty obvious here
but we'll make it more specific we'll
make it at Berlinetta okay so it's a
Camaro Berlinetta I don't know if you're
familiar with those really nice cars and
then we can say Camaro dot and pull up
the description method you see how it
has a little m there next to it that
means it's a method so we can just pull
up that method and what I'll say over
there it says now when we pull that
method up says the chevy berlin that it
has zero miles on it and that's because
we didn't set the miles so let's set
some miles on it so we'll just call up
camaro dot miles or mileage we've set
that equal to you know this pretty new
car so it only has 1230 miles on it all
right
so and that is basically how you create
and in stanchion instance of a class so
in this case it's a car class and we
created a car called Camaro
it's just variable name and then we set
the variables here now if we had an
initializer or a custom initializer on
here we could have set this all in one
line but since we didn't have one
available because we didn't create one
we couldn't do that but we are going to
do that in the next video okay so in the
next video we're just going to continue
off of this same class file or the same
playground rather and we're going to
continue learning about classes
specifically we're going to get into
initializers and custom initializers and
we may get into access levels and stored
and computed properties because so far
all these properties are stored see
they're just a variable and they don't
really do anything
aside from take a value okay but there
are things called computed properties
where you can take the variable or the
property a couple different properties
and put them together and make them
another property or you could could
perform some kind of function on them
and you know we could say mileage and
plus 100 because test-driving in there
in the car lot or something okay
so we'll continue in the next video and
continue our knowledge of classes
now we're going to take a closer look at
classes and since we've already created
a class we're halfway there so we just
need to modify a few things we're going
to look at a bit more advanced syntax
we're still going to talk about the
properties and methods and initializers
and instances but we're also going to
talk about access levels and stored
versus computed properties so and we'll
also take a look at what a class
instantiate our instantiated with an
initializer looks like versus without
one and you'll see there's a big
difference and you'll like the
difference with the initializer so we're
going to take a look at that and we'll
jump back into that playground we
created in the last video
okay so delving a little deeper into
classes the first thing I want to do is
actually what we're going to do is we're
going to come out this comment out this
Camaro and you know it's a nice car but
it's gotta go we're going to work on a
different car so the first thing I want
to do here is change this makes and
model and mileage and I want to just set
those equal to a type so to make we're
going to make a string and the model
we're going to make a string and whoops
and the mileage we're going to make an
integer okay
now you notice that we're getting an
error on our class here and that's
because we haven't set these to anything
but that's okay
it's going to give us a fix it to try to
set these equal to an empty string or a
zero integer but we're not going to do
that right now instead we're going to
get rid of that error by creating an
initializer so we do that down here
where I had written initializer only
because I had written initializer there
by saying in it and we'll open a
parenthesis and we'll say that this is
going to have a make which is going to
be a string it's going to have a model
which is going to be a string and it's
going to have a mileage value which is
going to be an integer okay now once we
put that in we no longer have our error
but in order to actually do something
with this when you open this up and
we're going to set some values here so
the way this works is you need to say
self to access the actual car and you'll
see the term self used in Swift quite a
bit but so what we'll say is self dot
make is equal to make okay and then
we'll say self dot model is equal to
model and self dot mileage is equal to
mileage so what we're doing here is
we're saying that the self dot make
which is the make up here is going to be
equal to the make which is the make
that's created when the car is
initialized so when we go to create it
now in addition to initializers there's
also the initializers
however unless you're doing something
extremely complex you won't have to
worry about the initializing anything
because Swift uses what's called
automatic reference counting or AR C for
short and that means that you really
don't have to worry about keeping track
of memory management for these objects
that we're creating so if you're
familiar in other languages with garbage
collections and things like that you
don't have to worry about that in Swift
it's extremely extremely efficient at
handling memory management so this is
almost something of a non-issue for
developers and unless you're creating
something that really really doesn't
know whether or not to hold on to the
memory or not then don't even worry
about D initializers once you start
running into memory management problems
and you're getting all sorts of debug
errors then you may need to take a look
at it but for the most part the
initializers aren't really used in most
apps okay so now with this said if we go
to create a car now you'll see what
happens so if I create a variable and I
call this M 300 so this is a car and
we're going to set it equal to a car now
you'll notice when I go to put the
parentheses I now have this make model
and mileage that it's going to ask me to
enter so I can now enter the make so in
this case it'd be a Chrysler and the
model which is pretty obvious from the
name I'm 300 and then we can put it at
mileage to it so just say this has 89
thousand miles and now we have our car
which is an M 300 so if we now call up
m300 dot description
you'll see it says the Chrysler 300 has
89 thousand miles on it so by creating
that initializer we've easily filled in
all the requirements that our particular
car class needs so as you see the
initializer while it might seem a little
painstaking and by the way the reason
you need to say self dot make equals
make because I understand that sounds
redundant but when you ask to fill this
in you don't have to call it the same
thing like this could say make here but
it may say company you know down up top
you know what I mean so in that case it
would say self dot company equals make
so if that makes any sense then then
you're doing good all right so what we
want to do now is I want to talk about
just briefly about the access levels for
classes okay so there are three possible
access levels and I'm just going to put
them in a comment up here and they are
internal private and public now as we
have this class written it doesn't say
it but the default for your access is
internal so if I were to write internal
here it would have absolutely no effect
on the class okay and internal what that
means is that any file within your
program can access this class alright
now if I set this to private then what
that means is that only this particular
Swift file has access to this class ok
so that could be useful in some
circumstances and if we set it to public
then that means that anyone we share
this file with or anyone we share our
code with will be able to access this so
that would only really be useful if
you're creating a framework or
something like that okay in general when
you create a class you're gonna leave it
at internal so you're not going to
specify it at all all right now I did
mention about computed properties so I
want to make a little space in here to
put at least one computed property in
here so I show you how to do it so to
make a computed property what you do is
you create a variable so we're going to
create a variable called name and we're
going to set that equal to or of the
type string and then we're going to open
a code block so this is like a closure
and we're going to simply return a
string and in that string we're going to
combine the make and the model so we're
gonna pull out make put a space in there
and then we'll pull out model okay so
that's a computed property and basically
what that means is we're not asking
anyone for what that information is but
in essence we're getting that
information from the two inputs the make
and the model so now we'll have access
to a dot name so if I come down here
with our m300 and I pull up the m300
name now that on the right hand side
will tell me that it's a Chrysler m300
okay without us doing anything
additional it's just in this one line of
code or these three lines of code that
does that for us okay so I realize this
is a lot to take in classes and I'm not
going to go too much further into it
because we use classes so much that by
the time you're done with this course
you will be an expert on classes so
we're going to move on actually and
we're going to talk about subclasses and
as you can imagine subclasses are
directly related to their superclass
which this in in this case is a
superclass because there is no
inheritance from another class so we
would make a subclass off of this so
type of a car and we could perhaps make
a cab or a taxi or something like that
and that would be a subclass of a car
okay or we could make a sports car or we
can make you know whatever you want it's
up to you you're building it so but the
whole idea is that this one doesn't
inherit from anything and our subclasses
that we're going to create next we'll
and we're going to actually do it right
with this same file we're going to
create a subclass from our car class so
we'll see in the next video but make
sure you understand everything that's in
here even if you have to watch this
video a second time because there is a
lot of information in here and I
understand it's a lot to take in so
we'll see you in the next video
okay so in this video we're going to
talk about sub classes and subclasses
are extremely important and they're
extremely valuable and they save us tons
of time Apple and other third-party
vendors have put extraordinary amounts
of time and effort into developing
frameworks for us to use and by
importing their frameworks and
inheriting from their super classes we
can immediately reap the benefits of all
their hard work without us having to
lift a finger so instead of inventing
the wheel every time we go to do
something we can inherit from a
superclass and immediately have all
sorts of functionality within our
program so this is definitely the way to
go when your program and in fact you'll
see that just about every class that we
have in in an application inherits from
one or another superclass so or more and
we're going to need to understand
exactly what's happening behind the
scenes when we do that so let's take a
look in a playground and we'll
investigate subclasses so as you can see
here I have a version of our car class
here and it's slightly modified so that
it acts more like a superclass because
the superclass in general will not have
a custom initializer those are generally
reserved for these subclasses so I went
ahead and I took that out and I set
these two empty strings and zero values
for the integers so that we could go
ahead and actually create this as a
subclass should be created because the
car class really shouldn't have any
custom modifications to it but a sub car
should so if we go ahead and we create
what's called a police-car so we'll make
a class for a police car and to make
that inherit from the car class we just
go ahead and make that of the type car
and we open it up okay and then we can
put our code right in here but before we
do that I just want to show you that if
we go ahead and make a police car so if
I make a variable I call that Cruiser
one
and I set that equal to a police car
when I go ahead and try to instantiate
that you'll notice that nothing is there
and you may be wondering why we're not
getting that functionality from our
initializer and that's because I removed
it so at this point we would just create
a regular police car and then we could
set the properties in the normal way so
we would say cruiser 1 and then use the
dot syntax to put mileage and to make
and whatnot in there okay so if we make
the make a Dodge we'll say and then
we'll make cruiser 1 model
equal to a challenger and then at this
point we should be able to call up our
description and I think we may have
missed putting the mileage in so let's
do that so we'll set that equal to
90,000 and then we can call up our
description and it'll go ahead and say
the Dodge Challenger has 90,000 miles on
it so we're inheriting this method we're
inheriting all these property values so
at this point you may be wondering why
we would go through trouble of making a
subclass because there's nothing
different and the reason there's nothing
different is because we have yet to add
it so there's things about a police car
that are different than a regular car so
we could say put new variables in your
new properties so we could say a
variable Cruiser ID and we'll make that
an integer and then we could say we
could you know you could add as many
different ones as you wanted but the
whole idea is then you would want to
make an initializer and then you would
have our cruiser ID in there and that
would be an integer
oops and then we'd open up our code
block and put our code in so it's a self
Cruiser ID equals Cruiser ID at the
local level okay that's one thing we
didn't talk about a scope but we'll get
into that when it becomes relevant so
now that we've done that though that
invalidates our police car declaration
here because we need to put a cruiser ID
in there it says that when we initialize
it we're gonna have a cruiser ID so if
we just back this up a little bit we can
add that in here so cruise a ride day
and we'll just say this is Cruiser ID 45
okay so then we can add cruiser ID 45 in
here if we wanted to and we could pull
that up and I'm not going to spend too
much time with subclasses because we're
going to go into such detail in
subclasses I mean literally everything
we're going to do in the class or in the
course is pretty much going to be
dealing with subclasses and as we go
through it I'll be explaining it in much
more detail so just so you understand
how inherits from there from the
superclass down to the subclass I just
want to give you this quick example and
how you can add methods and you can add
we could change this description in fact
if we wanted to so and we'll get much
more in depth in this when we start
creating our apps okay so this is just
just the tip of the iceberg on
subclasses and that's it we're going to
move on to structures from here
okay so in this video we're going to
talk about structures and in a lot of
programming language structures are
limited to very primitive value types
and they can only do so many things and
in Swift that couldn't be any more
different structures are actually just
as powerful as a class with a couple key
differences one of them being that
structures cannot inherit from another
structure so there is no inheritance
when it comes to structures so
structures you can create instances of
structures but you can't create a sub
structure from a structure as you can in
classes so and there are a couple of
other differences and we're gonna go
over them in detail in the playground
okay so as you may be able to tell I
have a class in front of us a person
class and it has some properties it has
a couple computer or one computer
property it has a method and it has an
initializer and you may be wondering why
I have a class up here if we're talking
about structures and the reason is that
structures actually support everything
that classes do in regards to what I
have on this screen so they support
properties they support computed
properties they support methods they
support initializers custom initializers
and in order to make this into a
structure instead of a class Oh
literally all we need to do is put the
struct keyword here instead of class and
now we have a structure and if I were to
create a person so if I were to say a
variable Jason and I'll make that a
person and to instantiate that you'll
see I have you know our custom
initializer there and I can go ahead and
put the details in here so I could say
you know the name first name I could say
the last name I could say the age
completely incorrect by the way and with
that you'll see that oh I'll have an
error because I put that as a string and
it's just an integer so that's will make
it a little closer to the truth okay so
there you see that I can now also pull
up Jason dot description and that will
go ahead and type out the description on
the right hand side but there's
something about structures that is even
more interesting and that's this
initializer here so I'm going to just
delete what I wrote here for a second
I'm going to delete that completely and
the thing about this initializer is we
really don't need it in a structure so
if I go ahead and delete this
initializer then it's a little bit more
compact and when I go to create Jason
again you'll see that if I make him a
person I have an empty person or I have
this person here that I can create that
has what's called a convenience
initializer
so with this convenience initializer I
don't have to go through all the hassle
of putting in all the can all the
initializer code I can just put in put
it in my properties put in my computer
properties put my methods in and then
everything will work and I'll get this
convenience initializer that is really
really cool however that may be cool but
there are downsides to structures and
because at this point you're probably
wondering well why don't we just use
structures instead of classes because
then we wouldn't have to worry about
initializers and the fact is in general
you don't have to worry about
initializers when you do classes or
subclasses anyhow for the most part it's
really an optional type of thing they
don't need initializers of course if you
set something
having no value to it and just has a
type then you need to put an initializer
but why would you decide to use a
structure versus a class and a structure
I would say in my regard you could use a
structure for holding data types and you
know even complex data types even
objects you know and obviously we can
instantiate different structures and a
lot of developers use structures to go
ahead and they make one structure file
and it literally hold all the variables
for their program in there so they can
just refer to that struct and you know
be able to call up any variable that
they'd like which is really cool but as
I said you can't go ahead and say that
this person inherits from someone
because there's no inheritance involved
when we talk about structure so you
can't inherit so that's one huge
downside
now the other difference between
structures and classes are there their
value types basically so a class is
passed by reference value type whereas a
structure is passed by value reference
type so what does that mean basically
means that when you have a class it
refers to the class for any set
properties or anything like that when
you have a structure it copies that at
the time that you instantiate it and
then if you go ahead and change the
structure later that won't have those
properties in it so if that makes sense
to you then you're doing good because
that's a hard concept to grasp and
you'll understand it a little better
once we get more involved in actually
coding things but the reason why you
might choose structure over a class is
this convenience initializer is really
cool but it does come with drawbacks you
can't do any inheritance so you will see
most of the code done in Swift in
classes opposed to structures even
though structures
or theoretically just as powerful they
just can't use inheritance okay
so just so we were clear on that that's
the big difference is that they can't
use inheritance and the other difference
is that they're passed by value opposed
to pass by reference in classes okay and
I'll have more details on that later in
the course so don't get too hung up on
the past by value pass by reference
thing just now but just know that it
will you know become ultimately very
clear to you by the time you complete
the course and the structures as you see
very similar to classes they can do just
as many things as a class can do but
they can't inherit so we're going to
move on and we're going to talk about
nsuserdefaults
which is actually a part of a framework
that helps us store data persistently
that will you know persist through a
shutdown of the device and then the data
will still be there so okay so in this
video I just wanted to give you a brief
look at nsuserdefaults and and as user
defaults allow developers like you and I
to save data persistently to the device
that will in fact be there through a
device reboot or a device shutdown or a
system failure or a battery drainage and
the information would still be there
so in other words when you normally
store a variable what happens is it's
there it's in memory but once it is out
of memory in other words the program is
shut down completely not just in the
background
then those variables would be lost
unless we use some type of saving
mechanism such as nsuserdefaults
or core data or saving to a plist file
or a database or something like that so
I just wanted to touch on that and give
you a brief look at how that's done
because we're going to be using that in
quite a few of the apps that we do okay
so we're going to jump into a playground
and we're going to take just a quick
look at and it's usually defaults and
then we're gonna get into more
interesting stuff okay okay so to access
user defaults we actually have to be in
one of the frameworks like UIKit or even
just foundation so we need to import a
framework here and we could import UI
kit or you could import just Foundation
which foundation is in fact within UI
kit so either way you're gonna get it so
what I would normally do when I want to
save something persistently is I create
a variable for a constant rather and I
call it defaults and that reasoning for
that is because it's nsuserdefaults so
it's easy to remember and I set that
equal to NS user defaults dot standard
user defaults and that sets a memory
location basically in the NS user
defaults system so and as usual defaults
will store data persistently and I
explained at the beginning of the video
but it's it's useful probably to repeat
it because it's important enough for a
developer to understand that they need
to save information from a user because
if a user isn't able to go ahead and
save their name or you know if your game
can't save a high score or anything like
that then you know chances of that being
seen as a valuable app is kind of
diminished so basically what we would do
is if we create a variable and we say
name so this would be the user's name
and we ask for them to put that in and
they go ahead and put that in and that
name is Jason and we want to store that
persistently then what we would do is we
would access our defaults and we would
say set object and now what this is
doing is setting the object and the
object is actually the variable so in
this case name and then we set a key for
it and the key is a string and I try to
keep it simple so I said it as name and
that sets it in the system as
nsuserdefaults now there is something
called synchronized so you could do
default dot synchronize
however it's not really necessary unless
you're doing a lot of changes to your
nsuserdefaults
within the same function or something
like that in fact Apple recommends that
you not use this command because it's
not really necessary okay and in my my
estimation I agree with that that it's
not necessary but in order to go ahead
and pull this information back out then
we would need to go ahead and set that
to we we need to find a way to pull that
information back out so the way we do
that is we go into our defaults again
and we set string for key let's say
because this is a string and the key is
name okay now if I do that that's coming
up no right now but the reason for that
is because we're in a playground and
it's not really the optimal place to
show this but I wanted to show you at
least this one line here at the very top
because it's important that you
understand how we access nsuserdefaults
and we're going to get into a lot more
detail about this but for right now this
is good enough I just wanted to let you
let you see that syntax basically so as
long as we're in one of the frameworks
whether it be uikit or you know watchkit
it has access to nsuserdefaults and
we'll be using that extensively actually
we'll use it with sweet names and we'll
use it so we can save data between the
iPhone and in the watch and in fact you
can save data using nsuserdefaults
between different applications so that's
why it's useful so you could actually in
fact save the username and then when the
user logs in with another application of
yours you could have their name already
there and you know that would be pretty
cool
so at this point I want to stop and
we're going to stop going over basic
Swift and we're going to go into some of
the UI elements of the watch and we're
going to look at some of the user
interface and the way the user interacts
with the watch and some of the elements
and we're going to start really getting
into the meat of Xcode
so I want to congratulate you getting
this far through here and I don't want
you to spend too much time and the
reason I was briefed and a lot of these
sessions is because I don't want to
overload you with the code I want you to
get to the fun stuff quickly and we're
going to explain it as we go along even
further okay
so don't feel like you can't continue if
you haven't memorized everything because
it will be reiterated and we emphasize
to you throughout the rest of the course
okay so congratulations on getting here
and I look forward to seeing you in the
rest all right
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
