reinventing business as we know it
every enterprise including yours now
faces a choice between innovation or
extinction digital transformation is not
specifically about IT or technology it's
about redefining your entire business
strategy perhaps even changing your
corporate culture to succeed in digital
your company should think of technology
not just as a support function but as a
strategic competency digital
transformation is not just about
applying technology to your business
it's actually about creating entirely
new business models on the backbone of
technology amazon.com was not just a
shop with a website it forever disrupted
and revolutionized the entire concept of
shopping and more it's now imperative
for every business to adapt you and take
advantage of the ways the digital world
has radically changed consumer behavior
and expectations your customers your
channels and your competitors have
already gone digital

minutes spent online searching reading
email browsing and buy that's globally
from 71% of the u.s. to 91% in Indonesia
and sixty-seven percent of Millennials
56% of Gen Xers 41% of baby boomers and
28% of seniors prefer to shop online
rather than in-store and it's not just
for retail consumers 55% of b2b buyers
say they search for product or vendor
information on social media and
according to a 2017 cloud carry study
55% of b2b buyers expect mobile access
to a sellers ecommerce platform even
your own products employees and business
operations are already dependent on
digital technology the digital
transformation continues to accelerate
for two main reasons
first technology is evolving at an
exponential rate second data is far more
plentiful and usable mastering emerging
technology has always made the
difference between companies being
competitive
or barely keeping up what makes today's
digital transformation different is the
extreme importance of data not just big
batches of data but real-time data data
about your consumers data about your
competitors data about your supply chain
data about your markets having this data
and knowing how to use it pulls your
critical business decisions out of the
shadow of opinion or guesswork and
brings intelligent options into the
light instantly so your business can do
new things and do things right the
digital transformation has the potential
to level the playing field it provides
low-cost tools and enables strategies
that give small and medium-sized
businesses a fighting chance to compete
at the same level as major enterprises
successful companies that have disrupted
an entire industry often did so by
changing business models and processes
in ways that vastly improve the customer
experience data is what makes these new
models possible digital transformation
depends on data and data depends on
effective collection cyber security
analytics and application get the data
protect the data analyze the data then
utilize the data these are the
essentials of a digital transformation
