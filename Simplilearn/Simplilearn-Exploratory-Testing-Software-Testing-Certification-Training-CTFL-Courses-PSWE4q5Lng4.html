based on testers experience and
intuition these tests are very helpful
when we have inadequate specification
and time pressures exploratory testing
is a hands-on approach in which testers
are involved in minimum planning and
maximum test execution the planning
involves the creation of a test charter
a short declaration of the scope of a
short time box test effort which can be
used as short as one to two hours the
objectives and possible approaches to be
used the test design and test execution
activities are performed simultaneously
and most of the times with no formal or
limited documentation the test
conditions test cases or test scripts
this does not mean that other more
formal testing techniques will not be
used for example the tester may decide
to use boundary value analysis but will
think through and test the most
important boundary values without
necessarily writing them down some notes
will be written during the exploratory
testing session so that a report can be
produced afterwards test logging is
undertaken as test execution is
performed documenting the key aspects of
what is tested any defects found and any
thought about possible further testing a
key aspect of exploratory testing is
learning learning by the tester about
the software its use is strengths and
its weaknesses as its name implies
exploratory testing is about exploring
finding out about the software what it
does what it doesn't do what works and
what doesn't work tester constantly
makes decisions about what to test next
and where to spend time this isn't a
proach that is most useful when there
are no or poor specifications and when
time is severely limited it can also
serve to complement other more formal
testing helping to establish greater
confidence in the software in this way
exploratory testing can be used as a
check on the formal test processes by
helping to ensure that the most serious
defects have been found error guessing
is a test design technique where the
experience of the tester is used to
anticipate what defects might be present
in the component or system under test as
a result of errors made and to design
tests specifically to expose them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
