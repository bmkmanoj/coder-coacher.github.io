by that introduction so thank you so
much for taking the time to listen to me
so in this presentation I'm going to be
talking to you about the omni-channel
experience what it is and why it should
matter to you so the omni-channel
experience is the future of marketing an
integrated seamless personalized
experience where the customer is at the
center of your focus and we will be
talking about the omni-channel marketing
strategy how it can be implemented some
examples of brands that have six
they implemented an omni-channel
strategy and where social media fits
into all of this only Channel is one of
the latest buzzwords to take the
marketing world by storm
the truth is it's actually been around
for a while now
but only until recent years has it
really started to gain traction in the
marketing community the ways people
interact with business has been in
constant and quite drastic change over
the past 10 or so years mainly due to
the internet and social media this has
led to different ways in which
businesses market and promote themselves
and particularly in the way as their
customers interact with them and even
more importantly is that customers have
different much higher expectations from
businesses when it comes to the buying
process and customer service
omni-channel is the response to this
need and the next logical step in
marketing a personalized seamless
experience for the customer from start
to finish in order to understand your
only channel means we can look at the
terminology Omni comes from the word
calmness which means Universal or
everything basically omni-channel
marketing means creating a seamless
shopping experience where customers and
potential customers can easily switch
between channels whether they be mobile
a physical store or social media now
bear with me one I trying to explain
what an omni-channel marketing strategy
is one of the biggest developments in
marketing and the way companies sell
their products is that customers now
have access to a lot more information
from various different sources it's no
longer a case of wanting to get
something go into the shop you know
sales it and that's it the end now
people can firmly research products
online checkout reviews see what social
media has to say and so on while they
can also engage with companies on
various different platforms it is the
reason why multi-channel marketing has
popped up and gained so much ground
so quickly companies have had to face
the fact that their customers are
spending a lot of their time on
different platforms whether it be mobile
social media or the web therefore they
needed to make sure that we're
maximizing these channels to put things
simply the omni-channel strategy
acknowledges that customers will likely
be using different channels at the same
time and aims to make the most of that
by creating the best most seamless
experience for the customer the most
important thing to remember about an
omni-channel strategy is that the
customer should be at the center of the
company's marketing efforts and I will
be sharing some examples with you soon
so that you can see exactly how a
company can employ an omni-channel
strategy and how it has benefited them
as well as some examples of how not to
do it I'm sure by now you're thinking
missile sounds great but what exactly is
different between an omni-channel
strategy and a multi-channel strategy
because let's face it they actually
sound very similar and you're right to
ask yourselves they're our first glance
is kind of difficult to see what the
differences could be between those two
strategies after all marketing after all
so multi-channel marketing is all about
using different channels to reach your
customers and I'm sure you've heard a
million times how important it is not to
only have a presence on various channels
but also to make sure you're being
consistent across these different
channels once you take a deeper look it
starts to become quite clear that there
are some substantial differences between
the two strategies they're closely
connected sure but they are different
the multi-channel strategy has gained a
lot of ground because companies have had
to face the fact that their customers
are spending a lot of their time on
different platforms like mobile social
media the web and others and so they
needed to find a way to make sure that
they have a presence on these channels
as well
so that they don't lose any
opportunities the thing is a
multi-channel stroke to inconsistencies
and the customer will not have the same
experience on each of the channels after
interacting the company on a channel
they will come out with a different
viewpoint that they would if they were
using a different channel and that is a
problem because they are very likely to
have to use that different channel at
some points or even worse there can be
used in their two different channels or
more at the same time or rather in the
same session in fact for example 43% of
customers have used their mobile device
while shopping in a physical store that
number is only expected from now on here
as we become even more attached to our
devices here's a scenario that you
probably found yourself in a few times
as a customer imagine you're in a
physical store and looking to buy a
laptop one in the store you might be
using your phone to look up the specs
for the laptop and other laptops so that
you can compare you might even want to
ask the store a quick question and send
them a DM a direct message on Twitter if
the staff is busy as customers we're now
expecting that the company will be able
to not only answer your questions
as soon as possible but that the
transition between the channels will be
seamless another thing that could happen
and has definitely happened to be at
least a few times is that you could be
in a bricks and mortar store and search
them through their products on their
online store at the same time and then
you find what you want to get on their
website but when you go to ask the staff
and store about it you find out that
they actually don't have it in stock at
that location and that's a problem it's
simply not a good experience for the
customer in fact they most likely won't
become a customer now that you don't
have what they want when you make them
believe that you did it with your
website and show this might be
acceptable the norm even but it's
changing customers expectations are
changing there
very fast and businesses need to keep up
the omni-channel strategy acknowledges
that customers are using all of these
different channels at the same time and
switching between them so they put their
customers at the absolute center of
their strategy every channel is there to
create the best possible experience a
deeply personalized experience to sum
this all up a multi-channel strategy
means using different platforms and it
channels to communicate to and with the
customer an omni-channel strategy on the
other hand aims to create a personalized
seamless transition between different
channels be they physical or digital it
will look at the customer first and
considers how he or she will want to
engage with your company and the
customer switches between channels
constantly so the question is can
companies and businesses keep up with
this when it comes to sales and
customers one thing is for sure return
customers are much more valuable than
new customers for your overall ROI in
fact repeat customers generate 50% of
total revenue generally and just one
repeat customer that leaves means you
will need to acquire five new customers
to make up for it omni channel marketing
is all about retaining customers and
even more so building better
relationships with them and increasing
their loyalty through omni-channel
marketing you'll be able to connect with
your customers on a deeper level make
more personalized recommendations and
improve their loyalty which in turn can
massively improve your ROI with only
channel strategy in place you will also
be able to learn more about your
existing customers what channel's they
use how they use them what they like to
buy and where and so on the more you
know about your customers the better you
will be able to market to them and make
your messaging more personalized when
you reach out to them this in turn will
improve your sales and your overall
return on investment nature on our share
with you some examples of companies
using omni-channel marketing
successfully and how they're improving
their ROI I'm sure you're all thinking
this has great in theory but how exactly
can I implement an omni-channel strategy
is it just another buzzword that sounds
good and marketers like throwing around
what can I actually take advantage and
use it for me the answer is yes yes you
can and although you might not have the
budget of a company like Disney or Nike
to help you create the best possible
strategy there is still quite a lot you
can do with digital channels
particularly with social media the first
thing that you should do is put yourself
in your customers shoes so that you can
truly understand what the process is
like for them in a variety of different
scenarios for this you can either do it
yourself with the help of some of your
team members and friends or you can hire
specialists just like you would for
let's say a website optimization project
these are some of the scenarios that you
should be researching as a customer the
first stage is when they are researching
a product how easy is it to find the
information you need about your products
or services the thing is consumers have
different ways of researching some do it
in the store others do it online only
and an increasing amount of consumers
combines the two by researching online
and in the store as well and this can be
at the same time or at different times
so it's important to look into the
different behaviors and find out how
easy it is to research your products and
services in all of the different
scenarios now on to
customer service if you have any
questions or comments to make our
customer service issue what does the
process look like which channels can you
use are you getting different responses
from different channels these are all
very important questions that you need
answered I'll give you a short example
and it's a situation I'm sure you've all
been in at some point in your lives as
well and some of you I'm sure have had
much worse customer service experiences
recently I've been having some issues
with my internet and my broadband
provider I'm not going to name any names
but I'm starting to think that they're
all interchangeable
anyway anyway back to the story my
internet wasn't working properly so I
had to point out the multiple times to
get it sorted and when I'm saying
multiple I'm saying I had to contact
them dozens of times I spent literally
hours with them on the phone online on
social media and to be completely honest
with you I'm still mad just thinking
about it what really annoys me about the
whole experience is not just the fact
that my internet wasn't working properly
but the fact that every time I spoke
with them I had to explain everything
from start and I do mean everything
including past interactions with other
employees not only there but I would get
different responses and solutions
depending on the channel I was using to
contact in the end after hours and hours
of talking to them negotiating and
frankly getting increasingly fed up with
them they realized that if they wanted
to keep me on as a customer they had to
give me something anything really so
they made me a good offer more channels
on my TV better internet and so on but
then when I wanted to implement this
offer and I realize I wasn't talking to
them what I mean by this is that it
wasn't the company as a whole that made
me that offer it was just one department
and when it came time to make use of his
offer it turned out that my offer
shouldn't have been made in the first
place
and from there a new nightmare started
who maybe when did I talk to them what
time what was the name of the person who
offered me this package was I sure I
heard it correctly
this point in her turned into an
interrogation non-story sure I got fed
up massively so not only was each
channels experience completely and
utterly different but the different
departments weren't even capable of
making the same decision or taking the
same stance as that I was dealing with
several completely different companies
at the same time to be honest it was far
from an omni-channel experience as I've
ever encountered and these are the types
of situations you should be looking into
when researching your company's customer
service so ask yourself are your
customers getting the same response no
matter the channel they're using so one
of your customers let your social media
team know of an issue they're having
some trouble with one of your products
and they get a reply saying sure we're
looking to it are they actually going to
pass that information off to the right
people and get back to the customer in a
timely fashion or will the customer have
to contact a different department and
explain the same issue again so that
they can finally get some support there
are many ways in which customer service
can go wrong and it's very important
that your channels are truly
interconnected and designed in such a
way so as to help the customer that's
all you really need to know the customer
has to be at the center of your
marketing efforts anyway let's get back
to what scenarios you should be
researching and this is another very
important one when the customer is in
the process of buying something from you
do you might have a physical store or
have a digital one only it doesn't
really matter as the principles are
essentially the same if you're selling
anything you should put yourself in the
customers shoes to find out what the
buying process is truly Lamech what you
need to consider is that buying process
is starting to get increasingly complex
and consumers are using more channels
when buying purchase patterns are
increasingly becoming omni-channel it's
no longer a case of customers seeing a
product they like
going to the closest store and buying
all those sure there's customers still
exist but this is changing very rapidly
and companies need to keep up by putting
yourself in your customers shoes you
will know where to start with your
company's omni-channel strategy which
channels in more work and which channels
aren't properly integrated remember
though that there are different types of
customers and different ways of buying
researching and interacting with the
company so you'll need to go through all
of these different scenarios in order to
start implanting your own omni-channel
strategy you should create a list or
goals of course the ultimate goal is to
create a seamless integrated experience
across all of your different channels if
you want to achieve that you need to
communicate your goals to your various
departments and their people managing
them from the staff who will be directly
involved with the customer experience to
your social media manager and all the
way up to the top executives it's also
important to make them understand the
need for communication within
departments is the only way really to
make sure that they are creating a truly
integrated experience for the customer
because that's what omni-channel means
all of the different channels and
platforms working together in order to
achieve the ultimate goal an integrated
customer experience where the user can
easily switch between channels and get
the same positive experience across them
all of these massive changes in consumer
behavior that we've been talking about
unlovely due to the digital world we
live in that all of the different
channels we are using now we're using on
a daily basis mobile email and
particularly social media they've shaped
the way we interact not only with each
other on a personal level but also with
companies social media is a big part of
that as more and more people are using
it to engage with businesses in
different stages of the buying process
when researching products and services
we're making the decision to buy and
encountering any issues and our Inlander
customer service
this means that businesses have to make
an effort to make sure that their social
media strategy is truly integrated with
all of their other channels first of all
you need to know your customer where are
they spending their time online what
social channels are they losing you can
then decide what the perfect platforms
are for your business but in order to
make your social media part of your
omni-channel marketing strategy you need
to take things a little bit further it's
important here to have a good social
media marketing tool to help you deal
with your audience you need to be able
to easily listen to your audience
analyze their behavior as well as be
able to respond to any mention question
or customer service issue in real time a
good tool can help you do that
particularly if it also has some
marketing automation capabilities to
help you sort your audience and make
sure you never miss any important
updates I would recommend you try to
like Agora post which is what I'm
currently using for my social media as
it not only helps you manage your social
media more easily but they also have a
great CRM tool where you can leave notes
I tagged see all past conversations with
the user and much much more it also
provides some good monitoring
capabilities for social media that will
help you listen to your audience and
stay on top of any brand mentions and
customer service issues all make social
media is so great in dealing with
customers and potential customers is
that it allows you to truly connect with
your audience on a personal level which
at the end of the day is what
omni-channel marketing is all about a
personalized experience when
employing an omni-channel strategy
you're basically recognizing that each
one of your customers is unique and that
they have their own individual needs and
expectations which you need to
acknowledge social media allows you to
create a personalized experience for
each and every one of your customers
which is what your audience expects each
customer wants to be special and
acknowledged appropriately by the
company they're spending their
hard-earned money in order to do that
it's more than just a case of knowing
their name and using it you need to know
everything there is to know about that
customer when I'm wearing have they
interacted with your business and the
past what if you have a paste have they
contacted a different department per
took before tweeting you or live in an
update on your facebook page one way of
dealing with this is to have a strong
customer relationship management
strategy every time someone in your
company interacts with a particular
customer the details of that interaction
should be stored in one central place so
that anyone can easily access it on the
fly this will truly help you tools
achieving a personalized experience for
all of your customers social me
is a great platform for managing your
customer service and whether we like it
or not customers think so too
it's much more convenient for them to
send out a tweet informing you of a
problem or to ask you a question rather
than to wait an hour or on hold to get
to speak to an actual person rather than
a robot so your social audience will be
using Twitter or Facebook or whatever
platform they're on to call you out when
they have an issue or say to get some
customer support this means that whoever
is managing your social media needs to
respond promptly in real-time to any
comment or question while also
personalizing their response not only
that but they need to have the necessary
knowledge to handle any customer service
issues in order to be able to do this
it's useful to have that central
database of customers that we talked
about earlier this way you can
personalize your response to any issue
and you will also be aware of any past
conversations with a particular user
even if they took place on a different
channel there are brands that take
customer service to the next level and
as a result they get amazing coverage
from their very pleased customers Delta
hotels now one of these types of brands
is Delta Hotels Mike McCready was
attending a conference in Vancouver and
while there he was staying at the Delta
at Vancouver Suites as you can see his
view really wasn't the best so he sent
out an Instagram with a photo of the
view saying the inside of my room at the
Delta is really nice for the view not so
much Mike didn't tag Delta hotels in his
update and as he mentioned in a blog he
posted about the experience afterwards
he wasn't exactly expecting anything
from them it was just a comment a fun
Instagram but Delta hotels were
listening and came back to him within an
hour on Twitter switching platforms and
offering to help I don't want to switch
rooms since he was leaving the next day
anyway so there wouldn't be a point
so Delta hotels then asked him to send a
direct message so they could give him
some tips for any future bookings that
he might make which as you can imagine
mike appreciated the fact that Delta was
listening to him and wanted to create a
better experience for him even when he
is when it wasn't necessary but the both
part came after when he came back to his
room after the conference and had a
lovely surprise from Delta Vancouver
Suites some Suites and a handwritten
note from the hotel this impressed Mike
and I'm sure they've turned him into a
return customer not only that but he
also wrote a post about it on his blog
and spread the word about the nice
gesture and there really is no better
form of marketing than word of man this
is a great example of how companies can
deal with customer service and turn what
is potentially a damaging situation for
them into not just a happy customer but
an amazing PR opportunity another sign
of great customer service is when a
company is able to employ some witnesses
in their response when the situation
witness sorry
witness in their response when the
situation calls for of course
Sainsbury's have done a great job with
this as when a customer was looking to
buy some battered fish in a local store
but it didn't have a bar caught so he
next Sainsbury's know on Twitter
as you can see Sainsbury is not have not
only been quick to respond where they
reply was in the same vein as their
customers from there it owns doomed into
a funny conversation filled with fish
patterns while also making sure the
issue Marty encountered was solved these
aren't even all of the truths after this
conversation there were dozens more
messages shared and all of them have
attracted lots of engaging and positive
publicity for Sainsbury's
as you can see from these examples even
when your customers are having issues
and complaining about them in the most
public way via social media it can still
be turned into a situation that actually
works to your advantage you could be
attracting positive media coverage like
in the Delta Hotels case or you could
show that even as a brand you still have
a personality like sales missed it
whatever the case is if there's
something to learn about from these
examples it's that you should be
listening and monitoring constantly on
social media that any mentions of your
brand and when possible think outside
the box and go above and beyond for the
customer one of the ways to make social
media a part of an integrated
omni-channel strategy is to connect your
email marketing social media can help
you get more subscribers an email can
help you in turn by getting you more
engagement or social media basically
it's a win-win situation when you
integrate the two now let's talk about
how email can help you get better
results on social media as a first step
you should include links to your social
channels in all of your emails when
using trip marketing one of your first
emails to present the social channels
you are active on and explain to your
subscriber why they should be following
you complete with a link that they can
click to to directly go to your social
account you can also use email to
promote any social media campaign you
might be holding for example if you're
holding a contest on Facebook send out
an email broadcast to your subscriber
list to let them know about the contest
tell them what they need to do in order
to win and advertise the prize that
could be winning if they participate as
promote
contact it goes both ways you could also
get more email subscribers by using
social media for example you can create
Twitter cards that allow all your
followers to subscribe to list make sure
however that you give your audience of
good reason for subscribing them you can
also use your social platforms to share
the benefits to joining your list for
example say you set up a campaign where
you are offering your list an awesome
promotion like for example they're
getting twenty five percent off on all
of your products for one week if and
then advertises on social media send out
an update when you let your fans and
followers know of what they could be
getting if they join your email list
another way to integrate email and
social is to upload your hard-earned
subscriber list your social media
accounts you can do this on most social
networks including Twitter Facebook
Google+ and LinkedIn this can help you
in multiple ways one of these ways is by
using your list to get more information
and insight into your audience the more
you know about them the more likely you
are the more you know about them what
makes them tick what their interests are
the better you can personalize your
emails and your social updates and the
more you can personalize your emails the
better chances you have of making more
conversions
likewise on social media when you write
better targeted updates you increase
your chances of getting more engagement
more clicks and traffic and so on and
after all that's what the only channel
experience is all about personalization
and the customer once you start
following the members of your email list
on social media you should also use the
opportunity to interact with them more
this leads to more followers and better
results and social plus you're truly
cementing these valuable relationships
as you're taking them a bit further
you're not just sending them email
broadcast anymore you're starting to
build real relationships with them
across platforms another way to use your
subscriber list is to create a targeted
social media ad campaign when you're
creating a social media ad come
although most networks have great
targeting abilities targeting your
subscriber list directly can get you
even better results think about it
they've already hit subscribe so not
only do they know about you and your
brand but they're already interested in
hearing more about you or more from you
in fact they might be in your list
because they're considering buying from
you or because they've already bought
something from you and might be willing
to buy more so who better to target than
them in order to increase your ad
campaign success social media offers
businesses an amazing tool will not
allow them to gain more insight into
their customers and their audience and
ever before why should we be doing that
well there are a lot of benefits but
first let's go through the type of
information you could be gathering about
your audience with the help of social
media first you can learn more about
their passions and hobbies what makes
them tick basically this allows you to
personalize the experience you create
for each customer which leaves in turn
to a better relationship another thing
you will be learning is what social
media platforms they prefer using
particularly when dealing with
complaints and customer service issues
for businesses you will then know which
social networks you should focus your
attention and resources on so that you
can always respond promptly to any
issues and questions so and also be able
to glean more insight into what types of
devices they're using on a day to day
basis as well as their movements if
they're using local location features on
their social accounts the more data you
can gather on your audience the better
of course it's not just an issue of
collecting as much data but also of
knowing how to use it to your advantage
Disney is one of the best examples on
omni-channel marketing strategy done
right turn to the smallest details
they've always been great at marketing
and they're often one step ahead and now
they're setting the bar for omni-channel
experiences in
you're planning or taking your trip to
Disney now the whole experience starts
the moment you reset your trip and buy
the tickets it continues when you get to
the destination and ends well after
you've returned back home the whole
experience not only feels personal but
it also serves the purpose to make your
whole trip better more exciting more fun
for the whole family including the
parents and generally more stress-free
wishes which is exclusively for the
parents Disney have fine-tuned each step
of the way research in the parks and
Rina teeth buying your tickets preparing
for your trip get into the hotel and
they experience once you're actually in
the park let me explain how they do this
so of course you start by researching
the parks that you can decide what to
buy
there are two main channels that you can
use for that their Disney website and
their app what's really great about it
is that you explore all different
attractions like rise restaurants and
other entertainment and even start
planning for once you get there by
creating wish lists and creating your
itinerary their website works
beautifully both on desktop and on
mobile devices which is a must because
people are likely to switch between
channels when buying something so for
example you're waiting on the tube have
some time to lose and you want to
surprise the family with a nice trip and
you get on Disney's website to see if
Disney world would be a good option for
what you're looking for the tube is
firing there while you're being squeezed
between other commuters you forget about
Disney well for a second but then you're
home and you want to continue your
research and maybe get those tickets
there's no need to keep using your phone
now so you're probably going to open up
your computer to finish the research and
by once you've decided and bought your
tickets you can use the my Disney
experience to start planning your trip
this could turn into a fun experience
for the whole family or nightmarish
depending on what your kids want once
you've arrived at your destination
you'll receive Disney's Magic
customizable whispering which you can
use as a hotel key as a fast crossbow
Rhines ticket for the parks and
generally as the primary payment method
once you're out to sea route not only
that but earlier pictures taken in the
park by professionals will be registered
to your wrist friends and instantly
upload it to the Disney now the Disney
app is another really cool feature with
it you can explore the parks virtually
directly on your friends make plans but
your restaurant find out and get around
the park and find out what the wait
times are for different rides so that
you don't know anytime basically
anything you could possibly need to have
a great experience is either in your
phone or on your wrist and as you can
imagine this makes the whole trip much
more relaxed for everyone involved
am i you're having a great time at
Disney World
Disney is collecting I'm load of data on
your behavior and using it to optimize
the experience even further this is a
great example of an omni-channel
strategy down line Disney are clearly
putting the customer fast and they're
striving to create the best possible
experience for them they are not only
giving their customers what they want
and expect but they're actually going
above and beyond to impress them with a
seamless experience which means that
when someone nears Disney well they do
so with a smile on their face which
makes them much more likely to come back
and tell their friends about the amazing
time they've had and I'm sure by now
you're thinking that while all this
sounds great in theory most businesses
don't exactly have the resources that
Disney have to create this kind of
omni-channel experience which is true
there are very few companies that could
do this but there is a lot to learn from
Disney and the strategy that they've
created it's just a question of finding
the right strategy for your business and
using the resources you have to create a
better more integrated seamless and
personalized experience for your
customers India is a very
interesting mark first off it's a huge
one the population which is over 1.25
billion people which makes it one of the
largest in the world now said the indian
market has very special needs with most
people preferring to buy in store rather
than online and not to mention they're
more likely to own a smartphone than
their desktop computer hearing this you
might be wondering if there's even a
need omni-channel marketing in india and
well there is only channel marketing is
actually exploding right now in India
and I'm very curious to see what the
future will bring as I mentioned earlier
the majority of Indian shoppers prefer
to go in store rather than buying online
so company is in India have had to think
outside the box on how to improve the
customer experience install and with how
to seamlessly integrate digital with
their bricks and mortar shop owner
Austin is one of these companies and
they've done an outstanding job once you
hear how their Indian flagship store
works you'll probably want to buy a
plane ticket to go and see for yourself
what the future of retail shopping looks
like first things first once you enter
the store you'll head right into the so
called today's briefing which is a 42
inch display digital display which gives
you relevant information about the store
such as new editions styling tips as
well as the look of the day among other
info that's all great but what comes
next is much more impressive just next
to the today's briefing display there's
a fit scanner which is basically an
infrared device where you can quickly
scan yourself to find out all of your
exact measurements so that you can find
the best possible fit the clothes you
want to get now that you know your
measurements is time to find some
clothes to buy luckily there's a style
ball digital display where you answer a
few questions about your star and get
personalized recommendations for up to
20 different looks to match your
personal style what's even more amazing
is that if you want to see how it would
look like wearing them you don't even
need a second you're changing rather you
can use the virtual trial mirror which
lets you try on the clothes at virtually
the van Roosen shop in India is
a truly exemplary way of integrating
digital into physical stores and I for
one can't wait to see war shops using
this type of technology to make
sharpening an immersive and highly
entertaining experience with Disney we
saw what the complete omni-channel
experience could look like now I want to
give you an example of war a digital
strategy could look like as part of an
omni-channel experience in a physical
store one of the pioneers here is
Barney's in New York in fact they're the
brand the first brand to create this
kind of digital customer experience
their new flagship store in downtown
Manhattan uses a complex personalization
platform that allows them to send out
editorial content that is personalized
to each basically you can sign up for
personalized notifications for
location-based shopping and for
notifications with special offers and
store happenings what's really cool here
is the location-based shopping
experience basically Barney's can track
your behavior while you're online see
what's in your mobile shopping bag what
wish lists you have I know browsing
patterns within their stores online
publication with this knowledge Barney's
can then send push notifications to
their shoppers as they get close to
their store or already inside their be
notified of events local offers but the
most impressive thing about it is that
then actually be getting personalized
notifications once they get physically
close to items that are in their mobile
shopping bags Laurel now watch this this
makes for a completely new type of
experience for shoppers and it also
helps Barney's make more sales as
customers are basically being directed
towards the exact products they're
interested the Barneys New York digital
earn so it's not again the Bahamas New
York flagship store truly gives us a
glimpse into what is most likely the
future of an integrated online and
offline shopping experience
I have an overwhelmed and managed to
explain not only what an omni-channel
strategy is but also have given you an
idea of where you can get started with
implementing your own omni-channel
marketing is clearly the next logical
step in marketing its what it customers
expect really and there's no way around
it plus it can get you better results
your customers will be happier you will
make more sales more conversions and
you'll have less disgruntled customers
this is what you need to remember the
need for personalization a seamless
transition across different channels and
perhaps most importantly that the
customers should be at the center of all
of your marketing everything you do you
should keep the customer in mind
omni-channel marketing is also a great
tool for improving your overall ROI by
creating a strategy with a customer in
mind where they get the best possible
experience every time they interact on
your brand you will manage to improve
loyalty and generally build stronger
relationships with your customers and
the more you are able to do that well
the better your return on investment
social media is a huge part of a strong
only turn on strategy and I hope that
you now have the information you need to
start integrating social media with your
other marketing channels and I now
welcome questions thank you that was
wonderful
that was wonderful we have some great
questions coming in I do need to go
ahead if you can go ahead and go one
slide forward please and then before we
start the question and answer I'm
actually going to take over the screen
here and we have a poll that we always
do at the beginning of the
question-and-answer basically if you are
interested in continuing education and
getting certified and some of the
wonderful courses simply learned you can
go in and click on the poll and it will
connect you with somebody so they can
answer more questions and you can get
something more specific in the simply
learn arena we have some great questions
coming in from let's start with sat
Indra I hope I said
name right she has some questions
concerning a newly launched products so
if you have a newly launched products
how does the omni-channel is it
beneficial for newly launched products
and what are the top three things one
needs to keep in mind while creating a
user experience for the first time
customer and for newly launched products
if you're just starting a new launched
product and you have your first customer
what would be the top things you would
suggest for that I think it's about
knowing your customer I think the rules
apply and regarded regardless of whether
it's a new business or an existing
business I think more you know about
your customer the best area so that you
can provide a seamless experience for
them so I would ensure that if you're
launching something new that you
listening and being able to monitor what
they're saying so that you don't miss
any brand mentions because to damage
your reputation initially is obviously
something you want to try and avoid I
would also make sure that you have
really clear guidelines because
sometimes it's actually easier starting
at the beginning rather than having a
big company of thousands of employees
because things get across and there's a
lot more training involved so if you
have a new business and you have that
opportunity to put things in place to
make sure that everybody is aligned that
everybody knows that procedures there's
clear guidelines on what you can and
can't do and that everything is shared
across throughout all the teams involved
nice question here what if we money is
always a big thing I've worked with a
lot of startups and I tell you the
budgets everybody asks about the budget
we don't have the budget for a full
omni-channel strategy is there anything
we can do well how can you bite off
little pieces to give a startup company
don't spend a lot of money how do you do
that how do you take care of that well I
think you know you don't have to have
big budgets I mean obviously Disney is
it it's a crazy example but it just
shows how a line they've had it
I think it boils down to have it
investing in good tools to help you so
you know having a really good measuring
and listening tool so that you can hear
what people are saying when they're
saying and investing the time into
training your staff because it's the
staff who are representing your brand
and making sure that everybody is really
aligned everybody knows that you know
these are the rules you know the
customer isn't happy what you can do and
how you can help them so that they don't
get passed from pillar to pillar it's so
frustrating as a consumer having that
issued so I think making sure that you
know everything is aligned and
everything is consistent and that you
have a strategy in place which focuses
on the resources that you have so for
example there's no point waiting it's
amazing strategy if actually when you
get down to it you just don't have the
resources in place to carry it out so
it's not just about the budget it's the
resources that you have as well so it's
setting realistic expectations and
creating goals and a vision of where you
want to be and working back to how
you're going to get there excellent
excellent I could have used that advice
many years ago and startups hindsight's
20/20 right we have a question coming in
on the b2b industry I guess they're
asking is do you have any examples of
how the omni-channel works in the b2b
industry say for example IT consulting
or IT services industry so I guess they
have a back-end where they're working
with other companies to be their support
what kind of omni-channel have you seen
something like that with the
omni-channel is integrated with their
company and I guess the company they're
working with oh that's a really good
question and because I think all my
examples are not b2b which it was just
highlights that these are being a much
further behind with it than the
consumers and no I can't
an example but I think I think actually
you should take the good examples
you know the likes of Disney who are
doing it well because just because
regardless of the industry and the space
they're in I would only look at good
examples because b2b is failing here
yeah they're not managing to master this
and that's because they don't value the
customers enough you know with it comes
with an consumer market without the
consumers they have no business and also
it's a really big volume business
whereas with a b2b you know they if they
have an unhappy customer they just get
another one you know they retained rate
it's very different because we're mouth
is very different if you're not happy in
a b2b environment you don't tend to
complain as much as you do with the
consumer so they're getting away with it
but that's going to change because more
people will not put up with it so I
think just follow the steps of how the
b2c market is doing because they're much
more heavy to me that sounds like a
great startup for a company just for
your own marketing maybe you maybe
you're onto something there
yeah I find an example yeah I'm curious
to see if there is anyone good I can't
think of any but that would be a good
sales point though for a b2b industry if
they can identify not only their
customer but the end customer and sell
that any they would think I said that'd
be a great idea for a start-up coming
down we have how can we get different
departments to work together as part of
an omni-channel strategy so you have a
large company how do you get everybody
to come together for that it sounds like
a major project yeah well first you need
to come up with your own new channel
strategy and then when it's time to
implement it you have to gather up all
them you know your different department
heads to explain what their strategy
is all about and you're really going to
need to have some kind of centralized
system where all the different
departments can easily access them and
so they can leave notes for other
departments and so on so that everything
is you know easily communicated and I
think that the best way to go about it
is to invest in cloud computing we can
keep everything too clear you know szr
angel so that everyone in your team can
see past conversations you know
histories that's happened if customers
make notes and that sort of thing so
that this way whenever somebody
interacts with a customer in any way
they have to check a central database
beforehand and after completing the
interaction they know they then must
make sure that they add notes or any
important information and I think that
that also needs to be somebody managing
this process because so that things
don't get lost so you know it's captious
it's quite strictly working excellent
excellent
let's see we have a question coming in
which approach do you see working better
for regulated product industry and I'm
not quite sure what they mean by
regulated product industry I hope you
you know what that means
multi-channel or omni-channel I've maybe
discuss a little bit what regulated
product industry is if you know what
that is that's a really good question as
well great questions I mean I I always
believe in in an omni-channel anyway
because I think that's the future and I
think that's where the direction we're
heading as as customers you know is to
have a seamless personalized experience
it's all about building relationships
and making sure that the whole journey
is linked from wherever you are so I
would recommend that excellent
let's see what types of businesses
should get started with the omni-channel
marketing which ones do you see that are
really taking off with that well one of
the types of businesses that would
really benefit the most from
omni-channel marketing strategy are
those in retail so like we're seeing in
Amazon or Barneys New York in retailing
can make much more personalized
recommendations based on past behavior
and you can obviously then integrate
that digitally with your bricks and
mortar store but you know that said most
any type of business would work great
with omni-channel marketing because it
really helps enhance the customer
experience excellent
another question coming in here I think
we have time for about one maybe two
more questions if we implemented an
omni-channel strategy would we need any
dedicated employees that we need to work
full-time on this so what kind of
resources would need to be invested in
an omni-channel strategy not necessarily
but it does depend a lot on strategy is
so you might need someone working on it
full-time in the beginning just to help
you get everything set up the goal is to
get everyone in all your different
departments working as part of your own
omni-channel strategy excellent and one
last question and if you have questions
and we were missed them you can
definitely visit the simply learn forum
if you go to WWE long you can scroll
down you'll see community or you can go
to directly to which is community dot
simply learn calm and on there you can
actually go in there and post your
question directly and I just switched it
back oh there we go okay you can post
your question directly to the forum when
we do have a lot of experts to go in
there and answer many marketing
questions and we certainly have both a
master's program and other programs
available in the different marketing
arenas and it's had lots of experts you
can go in there and answer those
questions
I'm gonna bring up one last question for
the day what are the biggest challenges
with implementing an omni-channel
strategy I think you know one of the
biggest challenge is definitely the
budget I mean that say is you know this
is an issue and you're interested in
getting extensive technology examples
Barneys New York
another issue is simply put the
creativity signs you really need to
think outside of the box in order to
find the perfect ways to be able to
blend your different channels um it can
also be quite difficult to get all of
your different departments to
collaborate constantly especially if
your company is quite big or if the
departments are quite segregated
excellent we do have to go ahead and
close because we are at the end of the
hour Lila I really want to thank you for
your time today

things I'm always learning something new
