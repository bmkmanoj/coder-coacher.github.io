based on a service lifecycle each volume
of the core is represented in the
service lifecycle a service life cycle
starts with service strategy this is the
time when what services an IT
organization should provide to be
competitive in the market is decided so
in this phase questions like what
service to provide why will someone pay
for our services are decided the next
stage in service lifecycle is service
design where in specific design related
decisions are made for example we are
looking to provide services to which
user base will our service be 24/7 or
will it be provided only during a
certain time period etc are decided
during this phase once all service
design related decisions are taken up
the next stage in the service lifecycle
is service transition this is the stage
of actually rolling out the surface to
the users so that service becomes
available to its target user base the
next stage in the service lifecycle is
service operation so once users start
accessing the service and if they
encounter any problem service operation
takes care resolving their problems in
other words aim of service operation is
making sure that service runs
uninterrupted the continual service
improvement is the process of
continuously looking at the service and
making sure that service quality or
service effectiveness and efficiency is
continuously improving this is done by
collecting lots of data about how
service is functioning over a period of
time this is an ongoing process
throughout the lifecycle of a service
now tell me who would be responsible for
CSI or continuous service in
provement of a service if you did answer
service owner you're absolutely right if
your answer is wrong go back and look at
the roles and responsibilities of the
service owner now let's look at the
graphic on the side it illustrates the
service lifecycle components which are
nothing but the constituent processes
and functions vertical boxes in the dark
shades represent the different processes
in that particular lifecycle for example
in service strategy lifecycle phase we
have strategy generation demand
management the light shaded boxes in
service operations represent functions
in that lifecycle do not panic with so
many new terms here again we will learn
about them as we progress in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
