frm exam covers the fundamental tools
and techniques used in risk management
and the theories that underlie their use
standard capital asset pricing model we
have learned in the previous lectures
about the portfolio return and
volatilities and about investors choices
in holding efficient portfolios lying
along the efficient frontier in this
lecture we will learn about the market
at equilibrium that is we will derive
pricing models for asset under
equilibrium conditions in this lecture
standard capital asset pricing model is
discussed which will have a number of
assumptions under ideal conditions in
the next lecture we will see the effects
of removing these assumptions agenda in
the first model the markets will be
assumed to be frictionless with various
idealistic conditions we also plot the
capital market line based under these
assumptions in the next lecture we will
derive a model under more practical
scenarios we will begin by explaining
the assumptions underlying the standard
model we will then study about the risk
and its measures using bata finally we
will learn about the security market
line and how the price of acid changes
with respect to the market market
equilibrium let us first understand the
concept of market equilibrium and
equilibrium market conditions all
investors are assumed to hold efficient
portfolios lying along the efficient
frontier and have common return and risk
expectations in such a case when all
investors hold the same risky portfolio
it must be market portfolio in other
words and equilibrium investors hold the
market portfolio various models have
been developed to derive the price of
the asset at equilibrium the standard
form of capital asset pricing model CAPM
is based on the most idealistic
condition
let us now see those underlying
assumptions assumptions the first
assumption means that there is no
transaction cost or any cost of
purchasing or selling the security the
second assumption means that you can buy
or sell any asset infractions also the
third assumption means that there are no
income taxes and hence there is no
difference in income from dividends or
capital gains or profit from increase in
the price of security the fourth
assumption means that single investors
cannot manipulate or affect the market
by buying or selling in huge amounts the
fifth assumption means that the
investors rely only on the return and
volatility expectation in making an
investment choice the sixth assumption
means that investors can short sell the
asset in any amount the seventh
assumption implies that the investors
can borrow and lend at the risk-free
rate to any amount the eighth assumption
means that the expectations of investors
are homogeneous or common the last
assumption implies that all assets are
marketable that is they can be sold and
purchased at any time and in any
quantity capital market line in the
previous lecture we have plotted the
efficient frontier as shown above we
know that any investor will invest only
in the efficient portfolio lying on the
efficient frontier if the investor is
allowed to borrow and lend at the
risk-free rate then any portfolio will
lie on the blue straight line this is
also the case in practice as usually a
portfolio is a combination of risky and
risk free assets also as all investors
have some expectations the nopal folio
held by them at equilibrium must be the
same which will be the market portfolio
B M if the expected return of the market
is our M and the standard deviation is
Omega then the slope of this line is our
M
- RF over Omega and the equation is
given by the are equal RF plus slope
Omega where Omega is the standard
deviation of the efficient portfolio
this line is called the capital market
line the equation signifies that the
return increases by the amount of slope
on increasing the risk that is standard
deviation Omega by one unit
hence the slope of the equation is the
sensitivity of the portfolio return with
respect the risk taken by the investor
high risk implies higher return along
the capital market line now let us
discuss the various types of risks and
then we will introduce an important
concept of beta of portfolio which is
the measure of risk with respect to the
market measures of risk you must have
come across news of bankruptcy of some
companies like Lehman Brothers if the
investor only invested in one such
company then his entire portfolio is at
risk therefore an investor usually
diversifies his risk by investing in
many securities so that the failure of
one does not affect the overall
portfolio this kind of company specific
risk can thus be diversified away by
holding many stocks as shown in the
figure there is also another type of
risk associated with the overall market
such as the international recession
affecting the world market such risk
cannot be diversified away and the
investor has to bear this risk PETA
measure of systemic risk the systematic
risk or the market risk is denoted by
the parameter beta it is the relative
risk of the asset with the market that
is the sensitivity of the asset with the
market portfolio a higher beta implies
greater sensitivity and hence a higher
risk mathematically beta is equal to the
covariance
the asset with the market divided by the
variance of the market portfolio to
understand the implication of beta let's
take an example suppose an asset has a
beta of 1.5 this means that it is one
and a half times more sensitive to the
market portfolio if the market moves by
say 20 percent upwards then the asset
moves by 1.5 times this amount which is
30 percent similarly if the market falls
by 10 percent then the asset will also
fall by 15 percent
it means the asset is one and a half
times more sensitive than the market
movement a beta of one signifies market
beta and the asset will move with the
market a beta of less than one will be
less sensitive to the market movement
for example if the market moves by 30
percent and the asset has a beta of 0.5
then it will rise by fifteen percent in
some rare cases you might come across
negative beta that is the asset and
market move in opposite direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
