individually these are then integrated
together and tested this is called as
integration testing in this form of
testing software components hardware
components or both together are combined
and tested to evaluate interactions
between them this is mainly done by
testers with formal defect management
mechanisms at each stage of integration
the testers concentrate solely on the
integration itself for example if they
are integrating component a and B they
are interested in testing the
communication between a and B and not
the functionality of the individual
modules as that would already have been
done in component testing both
functional and structural approaches may
be used to conduct integration testing
integration testing can be performed in
a variety of ways but we will limit our
discussion to three common strategies
top-down bottom-up and Big Bang approach
the top-down approach to integration
testing requires the highest level
modules to be tested and integrated
first and data flow to be tested early
in the process and it tends to minimize
the needs for drivers however the need
for stubs complicates test management
and low level utilities are tested
relatively late in the development cycle
another disadvantage of top-down
integration testing is its poor support
for early release of limited
functionality the bottom-up approach
requires the lowest level units to be
tested and integrated first these units
are frequently referred to as utility
models by using this approach utility
modules are tested early in the
development process and a need for stubs
is minimized the downside however is
that the need for drivers complicates
test management and
high level logic and data flow are
tested late like the top-down approach
the bottom-up approach also provides
poor support for early release of
limited functionality the third approach
bigbang sometimes referred to as the
umbrella approach requires testing along
functional data and control flow paths
first the inputs for functions are
integrated in the bottom of pattern
discussed above the outputs for each
function are then integrated in the
top-down manner the primary advantage of
this approach is the degree of support
the early release of limited
functionality it also helps minimize the
need for stubs and drivers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
