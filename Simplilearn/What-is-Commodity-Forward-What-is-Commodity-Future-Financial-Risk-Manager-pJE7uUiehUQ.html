the price is paid the commodity is
delivered at the spot price to the buyer
in the forwards markets the traders
enter into a contract to buy or sell the
commodity on a future date at the agreed
price the delivery takes place on the
future date which is also called the
expiry of the contract the seller of the
forward contract has to deliver the
commodity to the buyer of the contract
on this date a forward market is a
one-to-one market and is not regulated
by any exchange in a futures market the
procedure for contracts is standardized
and there are specific requirements by
the exchange that must be fulfilled by
both the buyer and the seller of the
contract the exchange also acts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
