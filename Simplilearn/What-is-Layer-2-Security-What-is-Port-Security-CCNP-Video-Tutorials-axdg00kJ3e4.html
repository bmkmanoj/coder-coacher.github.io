and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on
advanced spanning tree this lesson
focuses on layer 2 security let us begin
with the objectives of the lesson in the
next slide by the end of this lesson you
will be able to configure port security
violation modes and MAC address types
describe DHCP snooping dai and IP SG
configure 802 dot 1 export based
authentication describe various security
attacks and the steps to mitigate them
list the general switch security
guidelines let us start our discussion
with port security the switch forwarding
process shows that addresses aren't
dynamically learned this means that
potentially any device can connect to
your switch this is not secure enabling
port security can protect switch
interfaces from being used maliciously
port security cannot be configured on a
port underlying an ether channel by
default port security is disable the
default maximum number of secure MAC
addresses is 1 this means that only one
device can be attached to one switch
interface although this is the case most
often however when VoIP is used often
the phone and the PC are connected on
the same switch port then two Macs are
required one for the phone and one for
the PC by default if there is an attempt
to associate more than the configured
number of MAC addresses to an interface
a violation occurs and the port is shut
down sticky address learning is also
disabled the port security aging is
disabled with the aging time as zero and
the aging type as absolute in the next
slide let us learn how to enable and
disable port security</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
