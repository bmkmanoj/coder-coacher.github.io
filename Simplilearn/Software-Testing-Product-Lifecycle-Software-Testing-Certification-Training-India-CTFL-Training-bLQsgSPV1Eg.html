models let us understand the product and
project lifecycle the product lifecycle
looks like this it typically involves
introduction of the product growth
maturity and finally decline phases
introduction phase is where the product
is developed and launched into the
market this face requires lots of
investment without any returns and hence
you can see that there are no profits
during this phase after the product has
been successfully launched and promoted
in the market it enters the growth phase
this is the phase where product is in
use and has new customers adding in
which brings in profits to the company
as a product reaches the next phase of
maturity it brings in good profits
indeed profits are the highest in this
phase each product no matter how
successful has to eventually decline and
move out of the market in this phase
profits drop gradually as customers
would move to more advanced products
which can be by a competitor or
sometimes by the same vendor itself for
example office 2003 an office 2007 are
the products of the same company
Microsoft introduction of more advanced
feature will out date the earlier one
for so many obvious reasons and hence
product decline phase is inevitable this
entire lifecycle can span anywhere
between a couple of weeks to a couple of
years depending on the nature of the
product and the need of the product in
the market the entire product lifecycle
will involve a series of projects to
plan develop launch enhance and maintain
the product the management of focus
should always be to keep the intrud
action and growth phase the shortest in
order to maximize the amount of time the
product stays in the maturity phase let
us look at what PLM PLM is an acronym
for product lifecycle management and is
the process of managing the entire
lifecycle of a product from requirements
through design and manufacture to
service and disposal PLM describes the
engineering aspects of a product from
managing descriptions and properties of
a product through its development and
useful life PLM speeds up the product
development process by systematically
arranged product requirements and
Product data management this also
reduces the engineering costs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
