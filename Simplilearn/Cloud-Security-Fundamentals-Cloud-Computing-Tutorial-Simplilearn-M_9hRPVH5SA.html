providers is very important to
understand the distinction between the
security measures that the cloud service
provider implements and operates which
is known as the security of the cloud
and the security measures that the
customer implements and operates related
to security of customer content and
applications that make use of the cloud
service provider services and this is
called security in the cloud
basically the AWS shared responsibility
model defines which security controls
are yours and which is a responsibility
of AWS in other words you decide the
security for your applications that run
in the cloud for example which ports are
open which IP addresses can access your
resources
what patches are applied to the
operating systems do you have encryption
enabled etc and AWS guarantees the
global security of the AWS cloud for
example the hardware the data centers
the networks etc and this diagram here
gives you an overview of who owns what
exceptions to the AWS shared
responsibility model for example with
AWS managed services like RDS dynamodb
and redshift AWS is responsible for more
than just the hardware and the networks
in these cases AWS is responsible for
the security configuration like caching
antivirus etc and you're just
responsible for account management and
user access
Amazon Web Services takes cloud security
and compliance extremely seriously one
of the biggest concerns of consumers is
that the cloud is not secure and it's
something I hear time and time again but
in fact that could not be further from
the truth that AWS invests huge
resources into securing the AWS cloud
and making sure that it's compliant with
the required assurance programs
AWS cloud compliance allows customers to
understand exactly what controls have
been put in place by Amazon to maintain
cloud security and data protection
however AWS doesn't take full
responsibility as for systems that are
built on top of AWS cloud infrastructure
the compliance responsibility belongs to
the end-user
AWS meets a large amount of the Assurant
programs for finance healthcare
government and many more and here's a
list of some of the Assurant programs
AWS is compliant with and you can see
there's some big names in there like
HIPAA FedRAMP and ISO but just because
AWS have all these compliance assurance
programs it doesn't mean that your
applications are compliant there's still
stuff you'll need to do with your
applications to make them fully
compliant with these programs let's
start with infrastructure as a service
ec2 s3 and B PC are completely under
customer control so you have to perform
all the security configuration and
management tasks the virtual instances
are completely controlled by you you
have routes access
AWS does not AWS has no access rights to
your instances or guest operating
systems and they cannot SSH or RDP into
your servers so they have no idea what's
going on on your instances and you'll
find this out if you ever raise a
support to keep of AWS but they are
unable to log on to your instances to
help you with your problems you have to
do screen sharing so that's a security
attribute that AWS provides AWS has a
storage decommissioning process that is
designed to prevent customer data from
being exposed to unauthorized
individuals customer instances have no
access to raw disk devices and instead
you're presented with virtualized disks
AWS proprietary disk virtualization
layer automatically reset every block of
storage used by the customer so that
customers data is never exposed to
another in a similar way memory is also
scrubbed by the hypervisor when it's
unallocated from a host and is
unavailable for use again until
completely scrubs with the network AWS
protects against denial-of-service
man-in-the-middle IP spoofing port
scanning and packets anything it
prevents IP spoofing by AWS controlled
host-based firewall infrastructure and
it will not allow an instance to send
traffic with a source IP address or MAC
address other than its own denial of
service is prevented through the use of
security groups access control lists so
that you can minimize public entry
points and reduce the surface area of
your applications you can protect
databases and non internet-facing
resources in private subnets and use
Bastion servers for SSH and RDP access
the instances hidden in private subnets
you can put your elastic load balancers
in security groups with inbound and
outbound restrictions Amazon ec2
provides a firewall solution that by
default is configured in denial mode so
you have to open up the ports you
require for your applications to work
with network security you can use HTTPS
instead of HTTP and you can use VPN to
provide encrypted tunnel access to AWS
AWS allows you to perform vulnerability
scans but you have to request permission
in advance to perform one and you have
to limit it to your own instances and
this is something you may see on the
exam it's a popular question are you
able to run Bunner ability scans and the
answer is yes but only after you've got
permission from Amazon people often ask
if the Amazon corporate network
segregated from the AWS network and the
answer is yes using network security
different instances running on the same
physical machine are isolated from each
other via the Xen hypervisor which is
what AWS uses also the AWS firewall
resides within the hypervisor layer
between the physical network interface
and the instances virtual interface so
all packets have to pass through this
layer meaning that any instances running
alongside have no more access to that
instance than any other host on the
Internet
physical RAM is also separated using
similar mechanisms AWS provides multiple
options to secure your user credentials
you have good old username and passwords
we have multi-factor authentication then
there's the access keys and the key
pairs and also x.509 certificates and
these are a way of making media online
secure by providing a certificate and a
private key to a user so that only the
user with the key and the certificate
can view the media that you've placed
online AWS provides the ability to
encrypt with aes-256 encryption so the
data on ec2 instances or EBS storage is
encrypted for it to happen with low
latency and to be efficient it's only
available on the more powerful instance
types AWS offers SSL termination on load
balancers so this means any traffic that
passes between elastic with load
balancers and web servers is unencrypted
so the load is taken off them so you can
ensure that your data is fully encrypted
all the way into Amazon and then once
it's in there it can be unencrypted to
speed up and make your applications work
faster AWS Direct Connect provides an
alternative to using the internet to
utilizing AWS cloud services so in all
the demonstrations we've been using I've
been connecting to AWS via my web
browser however if you use direct
connect you can change this so data that
would have previously been transported
over the Internet can now be delivered
for a private network connection between
AWS and your data center or your
corporate network so it allows you to
access public services such as s3 and
private resources such as ec2 running
within your V PC using your private IP
space it also means you can extend your
IP address range of your office into
your virtual private cloud AWS cloud
trail is a web service that records AWS
API calls for your account and delivers
log files to you the recorded
information includes the identity of the
API caller the time of the API call the
source IP address of
kpi caller the request parameters and
the response elements returned by the
AWS service the AWS API call history
produced by cloud trail enables security
analysis resource change tracking and
compliance all the team now as you know
auditing is a hot topic in today's IT
world so enabling cloud trail to do this
for you is a very important and you
don't need to know much more about cloud
trail other than what it's for and why
you would use it Amazon Cloud Watch is a
monitoring service for AWS cloud
resources and the applications you run
on AWS cloud watch enables monitoring
for ec2 and other Amazon cloud services
so you can get alerts when things go
wrong you can use Amazon CloudWatch to
collect and track metrics so you can get
system-wide visibility into resource
utilization application performance and
overall operational health and you can
use these insights to react and keep
your applications running smoothly card
watch offers two types of monitoring
there's basic monitoring which is
included free of charge and polls every
five minutes and gives you ten metrics
five gigabytes of data ingestion and
five gigabytes of data storage then this
detailed monitoring and this costs more
there's a price per instance per month
but it pulls every minute so if you want
more detailed monitoring than you can
pay for it
AWS cloud watch allows you to record
metrics for services such as EBS ec2
elastic load balancer and Amazon s3 and
using these metrics you can add them to
dashboards to give visual or text-based
notifications of what's going on and
this is a diagram of the dashboard in
Amazon Cloud watch metrics are at the
hypervisor level so you can get things
like CPU disk Network but you cannot see
memory usage metrics appear as you add
more resources to your AWS account you
can create events based on your
cardboard monitoring for example
triggering lambda functions so perhaps
if you need es volume fills up you could
trigger an event
so that data is removed and archived
from the volume or a new volume is
created so there's many things you can
do you can install cloud watch agents on
ec2 instances and this will send
monitoring data about the instance to
cloud watch so you can monitor things
like HTTP response codes in Apache or
you can count exceptions in application
logs you can set alarms to warn based on
resource usage for example if CPU
utilization is too high then it could
send a notification it can also Auto
scale so if your CPU is maxed out you
can get another instance launched to
take care of some of the load or you can
send cloud watch monitoring alarms to
ec2 actions to say recover an instance
or reboot an instance if something
happens you can also use alarms to shut
down instances isn't just use for
starting them up so if you have idle
instances you can get cloud watch to
shut them down for you in this
demonstration we're going to take a look
at AWS cloud watch and how we can use it
to shutdown idle instances
so before I started this demo
creation I launched an Amazon Linux
instance and let it run for 10 minutes
just so we'd have some data so now I'm
going to go to management tools and
click on cloud watch and this brings us
to the cloud watch dashboard so what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a new dashboard and we'll click
on create dashboard so that we can have
a look at the monitoring statistics for
our new instance so let's just give it a
name and we'll call it just simply learn
just for a change
okay so there's create dashboard and now
we get the option do we want to put text
base or metric graphs which is to our
dashboard and we're going to select
metric graphs so we'll click on
configure
and then we're presented with all the
cloud box metrics that I have available
in my AWS account so obviously I've just
launched an ec2 instance so I'm going to
click on ec2 metrics and my new server
is called simple Zurn cloud watch demo
so I want to add CPU utilization so
click on that so let me create this
widget and then that now appears on our
dashboard so we can add more so we click
on add widget will do another metric
graph or go another per instance metric
and let's choose network in and network
out and we'll create the widget now as
you can see there's not a lot happening
here because I just launched this
instance and I haven't really done
anything on it but this is how you would
create a dashboard and it's quite useful
and very easy to see so you can create a
dashboard for your instance types
so what we're also going to do is set up
an alarm so let's go to alarms so now we
want to create an alarm so we click on
create alarm and we get to choose the
metric glue on the base the alarm on now
obviously we have an ec2 instance so
we're going to choose that option I'm
going to do it based on CPU utilization
of our simply learn cloud watch demo
instance so we'll click on that and
we'll click Next so now we get to give
our alarm a name so just going to call
this simply learn underscore alarm just
for the purposes of this demo we can
give
description and now we get to set the
alarm threshold so we're saying whenever
CPU utilization is and we're going to
say less than or equal to 50% for one
consecutive period and remember a period
is five minutes in basic monitoring we
want this alarm to fire so why would you
do this well imagine if you had a really
high-powered server that we're using
every night to do some highly intensive
compute computations so you might know
that it runs for a couple of hours and
it's charging you quite a lot of money
per hour to run but when the CPU
utilization drops below say fifty
percent or ten percent you know the job
is complete so then you can get an alarm
to fire and an action to happen so you
could set a notification so we could
together to send an email when this
alarm fires we're not going to do that
in this demonstration but we can do an
ec2 action so whenever this state is in
alarm I want it to stop this instance so
this instance is going to be stopped
whenever the CPU utilization is less
than 50% for five minutes
and it's just telling us that there so
now if I click on create alarm and here
is our alarm so it's just telling us
we're in alarm already because this
instance has been up and running it has
monitoring data for the last five
minutes and it's saying the alarm has
fired let me click on it and we'll see
why so state change to alarm reason
threshold crossed one data point point
zero zero three four was less than equal
to the first shoulder 50% and it says
when it's in alarm it's going to stop
the instance so if we go to the ec2
dashboard and here we can see that the
simply learned cloud works demo instance
has been stopped and it's in the status
of alarm so it's telling us that our
alarm fired and it took it straight down
obviously that's a pretty dramatic
example you wouldn't expect anything
like that to happen in a real world but
it's a good way of seeing how alarms
work
AWS trusted advisor is an online
resource to help you reduce costs
increase performance and improve
security by optimizing your AWS
environment trusted advisor provides
real-time guidance to help you provision
your resources following AWS best
practices AWS trusted advisor provides
best practices or checks in four
categories cost optimization security
fault tolerance and performance
improvement the status of the check is
shown by using color coding on the
dashboard page red means action
recommended yellow investigation
recommended and green is no problem
detected let's start with cost
optimization and using this function you
can see how you can save money with AWS
for example you might see some reserved
instances recommendations so if you have
instances that have been running for a
long time and they're always up and
running
AWS might say we'll move this to
reserved instances and you'll save some
money it'll also make for you about idle
instances that aren't doing anything you
might want to shut these down or perhaps
even you might have some unassociated
elastic IP addresses which are costing
you money because they're not allocated
to an instance trusted advisor will help
you improve the security of your
applications by notifying you about gaps
that can be closed security features
you're not using and by examining your
permissions so you might see a report
saying that you have unrestricted access
to certain ports so if you have your
sequel server port wide open to the
internet that's a bad thing it will tell
you about s3 bucket permissions maybe
you have more readwrite users than you
need and maybe you don't have
multi-factor authentication set up on
your root account trusted advisor will
help you increase the availability and
redundancy of your applications by
suggesting that you take advantage of
things like auto scaling health checks
multi availability zones and backup
capabilities so for example you might
have not taken a snapshot in a while and
advisable that you know that the age of
your snapshots is too old and you should
run some new backups it might suggest
that you add more availability zones to
your load balancer to make it more
redundant and it also might suggest s3
bucket logging for your auditing trusted
advisor will help you improve the
performance of your service by checking
your service limits ensuring you take
advantage of provisions throughput and
monitoring for over-utilized instances
so if you have instances that are
constantly maxed out trust it advisable
that you know and suggest you move them
to a different instance type it will
also let you know when your service
limits over 80% of the limit so it gives
you time to raise a ticket of AWS to
increase it and if you have EBS magnetic
volumes that are over utilized it might
be beneficial to switch to SSD and
trusted advisor will let you know this
this is a very quick demonstration to
show you how AWS trusted advisor can
help you optimize performance and
security of your ec2 instances
so if we click on my
to the bottom and click on trusted
advisor it brings up the trusted advisor
dashboard now I just ran this a couple
of minutes ago so to make speed to
demonstration hub and you can see here's
the four areas that we talked about in
the lesson cost optimization performance
security and fault tolerance and then
underneath it tells you whether you have
any areas of concern so the cost
optimization we haven't because I've got
hardly anything running in this account
performance it tells me is fine
now I'm the security we have two
cautions so let's take a look at this so
it says security groups we have specific
courts are unrestricted and it's been
checking security group for rules that
allow unrestricted access to specific
ports so let's take a look at that we'll
click on the little Chevron and it's
telling us down here that we have two
security groups one of which is our
simply learn web server security group
which has unrestricted port access to
port 22 which is the SSH port so if you
remember when we set this up we said we
would allow anyone to SSH into our web
server instances on port 22 so it is
warning us and letting us know so we did
this without realizing we could go along
and say oh okay we need to change that
another thing is telling is that I don't
have MFA enabled on my routes account
now I did but I changed my phone
recently and when that happens you need
to reset up your MFA and I haven't got
around to it yet so it's just a good
reminder so I will probably do that
after this demonstration and we have no
other faults or alerts but if you had a
much bigger environment you would see
many more things popping up here another
cool feature is on the top right you can
click on the little download button and
it will download all of this to an Excel
spreadsheet okay so they watch you can
see it puts it into a spreadsheet for
each of the four tabs we have security
groups IIM MFA and service limits so
it's telling me my service limits and
whether they were all okay so you could
download this and send it to your
auditor or whoever deals with this kind
of thing in your company
this concludes the demonstration on
trusted advisor
you should and you can secure your
virtual network at several different
levels the most broadly scoped level of
security is at the router table level
having a private subnet with no direct
path to the Internet is one of the best
ways to protect your internal computing
resources against unauthorized access
the second level is the network ACLs
provide the ability to define default
security behavior for your subnets the V
PC or the subnet layer security is
controlled by the network security team
you can use security groups to control
behavior at the instance or the eni
level which is the third level at the
fourth level you can use a third party
host based detection software that
monitors individual ec2 instances for
specific threats such as malware
intrusion known operating system
vulnerabilities and security auditing
according to AWS you can use a network
address translation or in that instance
in a public subnet in your V PC to
enable instances in the private subnet
to initiate outbound traffic to the
internet or other AWS services but
prevent the instances from receiving
inbound traffic initiated by someone on
the internet the diagram on the slide
represents the basic mechanics of how an
ad operates the network diagram has been
simplified for the sake of discussion
regions availability zones routers and
gateways are not shown here in this
example a database server in a private
subnet raises a request for a public
internet resource because of the routing
table rules defined for the private
subnet
AWS routes this non-local request to the
net server via the Nets private IP the
NAT server performs the function of
rewriting the request so to the external
resource it appears that the net is
requesting this resource via its public
IP of 154 dot 10.1 dot 3 when the
external resource responds the net
reverses the process changes the packets
originally addressed to the Nats public
IP address and re addresses them to the
private IP address of the database
server
this way numerous private instances with
only a private IP address can make
public requests to the Internet via the
net instance keep in mind the source and
destination checking must be disabled on
the net while configuring route tables
for net you have to keep in mind a few
points you can create round tables and
associate them each with a subnet public
subnets route non-local traffic through
the internet gateway private subnets
route non-local traffic through the NAT
instance or NAT gateway a common
scenario that you might face with Nets
is port forwarding you have learned how
to use NAT to provide access for the
private subnet to the internet but what
if you wanted to open up a specific
resource in the private subnet and make
it available from the internet for
example assume that you have an internal
defect tracking database running as a
web server on port 80 on a machine in
your private subnet you want to expose
this resource to the internet via your
net so that select customers and
partners have visibility into your
development process to enable this
scenario using a NAT instance you have
to log in to the instance and configure
it to forward all requests to port 80 of
your net the traffic will be forwarded
on to an Amazon ec2 instance in your
private subnet
however the nat gateway does not support
port forwarding yet so if this feature
is required in your infrastructure you
need to set up a net instance you can
use in that instance in a public subnet
in your V PC to enable instances in the
private subnet to initiate outbound
traffic to the internet or other AWS
services but you can prevent the
instances from receiving and down
traffic initiated by someone on the
Internet
this slide illustrates the communication
between the instances running in the
private subnet and the Internet through
the net instance the main route table
sends the traffic from the instances in
the private subnet to the net instance
in the public subnet then that instance
sends the traffic to the internet
gateway for the B PC the traffic is
attributed
to the elastic IP address of the net
instance the net instance specifies a
high port number for the response if a
response comes back then that instance
sends it to an instance in the private
subnet based on the port number for the
response to configure in Amazon ec2
instance as a net you must enable IP
masquerading on the instance it can be
done manually or you can search for an
AWS community ami image that is
pre-configured to serve as a net ensure
that you choose an image with the
correct virtualization type for the
instance family you are using for
example you cannot use a PV image for
your net if you plan to deploy the net
as a t2 instance ensure that the source
and destination checking is disabled on
the net source and destination checking
is a feature on Amazon ec2 instances
that informs the instance to drop
network packets that are not
specifically addressed to the instance
as the job of a net instance is to serve
as a proxy for the network traffic of
other instances this feature must be
disabled on your net
keep in mind that a single met instance
can become the single point of failure
so if you are using an ad instance and
high availability is important for your
setup then consider implementing a to
availability zone net instance design as
a high availability fill over solution
it will prove more effective when used
together with auto scaling for web
access you can also use squid proxy
architecture the most modern and
recommended way to enable instances in a
private subnet to connect to the
internet or other AWS services but
prevent the internet from initiating a
connection with those instances is to
use a network address translation or NAT
gateway a NAT gateway is a highly
available and automatically scaleable
service managed by AWS however a NAT
gateway is not a free service a NAT
gateway is charged for hourly usage and
data processing in addition Amazon ec2
charges for data transfer also apply on
that gateway is redundant inside the
availability zone but not in the whole
region in the event that the
availability zone of the net Gateway is
down resources in the other availability
zone will lose internet access to create
an availability zone independent
architecture you can create a net
gateway in each availability zone and
configure the routing to ensure that
resources used in that gateway in the
same availability zone on that gateway
supports bursts of up to 10 gigabits per
second or 10 Gbps of bandwidth if you
require more than a 10 Gbps burst you
can distribute the workload by splitting
your resources into multiple subnets and
creating a net gateway in each subnet on
that gateway requires one elastic IP
address you cannot disassociate an
elastic IP address from on that gateway
after it has been created if you need to
use a different elastic IP address for
your nat gateway you must create a new
net gateway with the required address
update your route tables and then delete
the existing that gateway if it is no
longer required
an at Gateway supports transfer control
protocol user Datagram protocol and the
internet control message protocol you
cannot associate a security group within
that gateway you can only use the
security groups for your instances in
the private subnet to control the
traffic to and from those instances you
can use a network ACL to control the
traffic to and from the subnet in which
the NAT Gateway is located the network
ACL applies to the NAT gateways traffic
the net gateway uses the ports 1024
through 65 535 when that gateway is
created it receives an elastic network
interface that's automatically assigned
a private IP address from the IP address
range of your subnet you can view the
NAT gateways network interface in the
Amazon ec2 console in this demonstration
we'll learn how to create and use NAT
gateway in the previous demonstration we
created a new V PC with private and
public subnet for this demonstration I
have created an instance in a private
subnet
it does not have a public IP but only a
private one so it does not have access
to the Internet
I created one more instance in a public
subnet to be used as Bastion host and
then from that host will use SSH for
port forwarding now let's log into the
private instance and verify if it really
can't ping from outside the V PC first
let's check the bastion host
we'll try to ping something from it
the Google URL proves very useful for
testing network connections
you
okay so we can't see it is working next
let's try to ping the private instance
somewhere else so it's 165
okay the private instance is pink Abel
will now try to SSH to it
as you can see we are in the private
instance so the bastion host is also
working fine and now let's try to ping
something on the internet from the
private instance as you can see the
private network is connecting to the
internet
we'll leave this ping running for now
and now let's proceed with creating the
net gateway we'll go to services
then DPC
and then tune that gateways will create
on that gateway
and we are going to create it in public
subnet
it once an elastic IP right now we do
not have any elastic eyepiece and so we
will create a new one
we are now ready
create an at Gateway
you
as you can see the status of the nat
gateway is shown as pending it takes a
couple of minutes
now it is up and running let's now edit
the route table for the private subnet
will go to subnets
private subnet and then route table
out table link or now that we know the
ID we can pick it from the route table
list
you
select the route table and now let's
edit its routes
we'll now add one more route to it
you
so all the traffic that goes outside
VPC CIDR block will go out our nat
gateway
you
you can add more routes if you want
we'll click Save now
as you can see the private instance has
started pinging Google so then that
gateway and the route table are working
fine
you
security groups control access to the
instances by protocol port and source or
destination you can use a single IP
address CIDR block or ID of the resource
for example instance ID or security
group ID as the source or destination
some important things about security
groups are only 5x security groups can
be associated with an en I which is a
soft limit there is a limit of 100
security groups per VPC which is a soft
limit by default no inbound traffic is
allowed however all outbound traffic is
allowed all outbound traffic in response
to an inbound request is permitted
instances that are part of the same
security group cannot communicate with
each other by default let's take a look
at some examples of security groups in
action in the first example there is a
source description of 0 0 0 0 / 0 to
specify that any computer from anywhere
on the Internet can access a web server
on our instance that is listening on
port 80 note that security groups that
restrict access by IP actually specify
an IP range using CIDR notations in the
second example access is allowed only
from a specific IP address in the third
example SSH access is allowed only from
a particular security group there are
some important limitations for security
groups that you need to keep in mind the
number of rules per security group is
soft limited by 50 the number of
security group is soft limited by 5 the
maximum number of security groups is
limited to 100 per VPC by default
your AWS account is limited to 100
security groups by default while you can
increase this limit having a large
number of security groups can lead to a
negative performance impact not just on
your network but on other networks
hosted on the same hardware as well it's
best to stay within the 100 security
group limits and as the number of
security groups in your V PC increases
you should create security groups based
around cidr blocks instead of around
resource IDs such as ec2 servers network
interfaces and other security groups
within a V PC security is controlled
using security groups and NaCl the N
ACLs are associated with specific
subnets within a V PC as NaCl s are
stateless both inbound and outbound
rules ingress and egress must be defined
you can define the inbound and outbound
rules by specifying the type of rule for
example custom TCP providing a rule
number keep in mind
rules are process from the lowest to the
highest defining the port range that
will be allowed or denied in or out
specifying the source or destination IP
address or range that will be allowed or
denied in or out after the NA Theo has
been defined it can be associated to
subnets within the V PC AWS officially
recommends a set of network ACLs for
each of the four configurations offered
by the V PC wizard as these
configurations involves applying values
that are specific to your private
network they must be implemented
manually placement groups are physical
groupings of high performance instances
in a single availability zone the
instances use enhanced networking with
maximized consistent throughput
placement groups are very useful for
clustered databases and parallel
processing for big data or rendering of
graphics AWS Identity and Access
Management or iam is a web service that
helps to securely control access to a
US resources I am provides a centralized
environment in which you can administer
users groups roles and permissions I am
is integrated with AWS providing
granular level access control at the
service application program interface or
API and resource levels AWS iam is a
free service which spans across all AWS
regions with I am
you can enable identity Federation
between your corporate directory and AWS
this means you can use existing
corporate identities to grant secure
access to AWS resources such as Amazon
s3 buckets without creating new AWS
identities for the users you can create
users and define groups and roles to
securely control access to AWS resources
AWS provides various ways of securing
the AWS resources
I am users I am groups
I am roles I am access Keys you'll learn
about each of them in detail in the
lesson
I am users are not separate accounts
they are users within your account you
can create I am users and add or delete
them from groups based on the
permissions you want to provide I am
provides unique security credentials
that can be used to access AWS I am
eliminates the need to share passwords
or access keys and makes it easy to
enable or disable a user's access as is
considered appropriate AWS I am enables
you to create multiple users and to
manage the permissions for each of these
users within their AWS account you can
provide each user with its own password
for access to the AWS management console
you can manage the users passwords
including strength link and password
reset you can also create an individual
access key for each user so that the
user can make programmatic requests to
work with resources in your account you
can revoke the access key as and when
required
AWS I am allows you to administer
multi-factor authentication or MFA for
privileged users note that a user does
not necessarily have to be a human you
can create an I am user in order to
generate an access key for an
application that runs in your AWS or
corporate network and neat AWS access
a new I am user by default is not
authorized to perform any AWS action or
access any AWS resources you need to
provide access to the users you can
assign administrative permissions to a
few users who in turn can administer
your AWS resources and create and manage
other iam users an advantage of having
individual iam users is that you can
assign permissions individually to each
it's best to use a least privilege
policy when assigning permissions
limiting a user's permissions to just
the AWS actions and resources that the
user needs for his or her job reduces
chances of mistakes you can always
increase access permissions as and when
required
however assigning permissions to
individuals in a big organization can
become a maintenance nightmare as the
list keeps getting longer it becomes
difficult to assess which particular
user has been granted what permissions
using groups simplifies the task of
adding or removing permissions to a
large number of users simultaneously
and I am group is a collection of I am
users
I am groups allow you to define sets of
permissions by function Department or
level of responsibility to provide added
security to your AWS account it is
strongly encouraged that you create a
set of groups corresponding to the least
privileged principle which is grant your
users and applications the necessary
permissions to perform only the tasks
assigned to them for example there is no
reason to assign EC to read permissions
to a user whose only job with regard to
AWS is to generate billing reports there
are a few points that you need to keep
in mind with regard to I am groups a
group can contain many users and the
user can belong to multiple groups
groups can't be nested they can only
contain users and not other groups
there's no default group that
automatically includes all users in the
AWS account if you want to have a
default group you need to create it and
assign each new user to it there's a
limit to the number of groups you can
have and a limit to how many groups the
user can be a part of let's now study an
example to understand how I am groups
work
the diagram presents an example of
groups created for a small company the
company owner creates an admins group
and adds users to it to create and
manage other users as the company grows
the admins group creates a development
group and a test group each of these
groups consists of users humans and
applications that interact with AWS
each user has an individual set of
security credentials in this example
each user belongs to a single group
however users can belong to multiple
groups as well for instance if you need
to grant a permission from the
development group admin privileges you
can simply add that person to the admins
group as a result the person now belongs
to both the development group and the
admins group till now we have discussed
accessing the AWS resources with the
help of unique identities that are
particularly a user however you can also
assume a role to temporarily take on
permissions for a specific task a role
lets you define a set of permissions to
access the resources that a user or
service needs but the permissions are
not attached to any iam user or group
instead at runtime users can
programmatically assume a role when a
role is assumed AWS provides temporary
security credentials that the user or
application can use to make requests to
AWS consequently you don't need to
create long-term security credentials
for each entity that requires access to
a resource AWS rotates the security
credentials automatically on a daily
basis the new credentials become
available at least five minutes prior to
the expiration of the old ones you need
to assign permissions to a user group or
role as required so they can securely
access the AWS resources to assign
permissions you need to create and
attach a policy which is adjacent
document that explicitly lists the
permissions a policy lets you specify
the following actions what actions will
you allow
AWS service has its own set of actions
for example you might allow a user to
use the Amazon s3 list bucket action
which returns information about the
items in a bucket any action that you
don't explicitly allow are denied
resources on which of these resources
will you allow the action for example on
which specific Amazon s3 buckets will
you allow the user to perform the list
bucket action users cannot access a
resource that you have not explicitly
granted permissions to effect what will
be the effect when a user requests
access are you going to allow or deny it
AWS resources are denied to users by
default you need to specify that you
want to allow a particular user access
to a specific resource another way of
securely accessing the AWS resources is
via I am access Keys the I am access
keys are cryptographically generated
keys that represent your account the
access key consists of two components
the access key ID and the secret access
key both keys can be generated for an
iam user in the AWS web console the key
ID uniquely identifies user credentials
and can be considered a public knowledge
the secret access key is used to
cryptographically sign all requests it's
private to the user and should never be
publicly posted or shared with
unauthorized personnel if compromised
the key can and must be revoked
you should never place your access keys
anywhere where they can be potentially
discovered by third parties third
parties can scan source code
repositories such as github for AWS
credentials and use those credentials to
spin up their own AWS resources at your
expense you can create access keys for
your master account however AWS strongly
discourages this practice it is safer to
generate a user in I am assign that user
to a group with the subset of
permissions required by your tools or
application and then generate an access
key for that user
password only security is not enough to
secure your account passwords can be
easily compromised through social
engineering or by malware's such as a
keystroke logger to provide an
additional level of account security you
can enable multi-factor authentication
or MFA with MFA users need to supply a
password and a one-time response token
this token can be generated in one of
two ways one by software software
applications such as Google
Authenticator for iPhone and Android can
be used to generate a token from a
smartphone or a tablet to buy Hardware
AWS supports key fob and display card
devices sold through Gemalto physical or
Hardware token generators provide an
additional level of security over
software devices since software devices
are harder to secure against
unauthorized usage both software and
hardware devices are configured through
a one-time process through which the
token devices are synchronized with your
AWS or iam account make sure to
safeguard your MFA token generators if a
physical token is lost or stolen or a
software generator is deleted for
example as part of a device wipe you
will have to disable NSA on your account
and it before disabling you will have to
provide a proof of identity to AWS now
that you have learned how to use NSA to
secure your AWS account you will learn
about the AWS recommended best practices
regarding account security do not
circulate information about your master
or route AWS account delegate system
administration functions to lease
privilege I am admin groups make
multi-factor authentication mandatory
for root level access physically secure
Hardware MFA devices in a safe place
such as a vault do not share master
account information with anyone other
than the account holder use I am roles
to provide cross account access
after securing your account the next
step is to secure your instances you can
define the instance level security by
deciding how to grant and revoke
permissions as employees enter and leave
the company for Windows instances you
can leverage the AWS directory service
to grant and revoke access to machines
based on existing Windows users and
groups for Linux instances you can add
users generate new key pairs and append
them to a new users file with the
commands displayed on the screen
devise a strategy for fleet-wide user
management such as creating
Amazon machine images or AM ice
containing all the current users of your
company use configuration management
applications such as chef puppet or
ansible to simplify the process of
granting and revoking access across a
large number of machines often reducing
the process to a few simple commands
let's now learn the AWS recommended best
practices regarding instance security
you should use iam roles when launching
instances avoid giving permissions to
individual users use lease privileged
access policies do not give the user
more privileges than required guard and
manage access or secret key tokens store
your access key tokens in a secure place
keep security patches up to date
subscribe to security mailing lists of
the operating systems they have
applications you're using and apply
patches and updates in a timely manner
use a net and Bastion host do not expose
your ec2 resources to the Internet if it
is not required you should not use root
level or master account access or secret
keys you do not need to use the master
account regularly so it is highly
recommended to remove its access keys or
avoid generating them embed access or
secret keys and the code or commit them
to get remember that anyone who has your
access keys has the same level of access
as you to your AWS resources
in this topic you'll learn about the
responsibilities shared between AWS and
the customer
the shared responsibility model defines
the responsibilities shared between AWS
and the customers with regard to
security AWS is responsible for the
security of the cloud that is the
underlying infrastructure and the
customer is responsible for security in
the cloud that is the resources built on
the infrastructure which include AWS ec2
instances and the operating systems and
applications installed on them accounts
that access the instances security group
that allows outside access to the
instances VPC subnet within which the
instances reside external access to the
s3 buckets
a crucial part of a customer's
responsibility involves penetration
testing penetration testing is the
practice of scanning a system
application or network to search for
vulnerabilities that an attacker can
exploit to perform penetration testing
of your ec2 instances you need to
request for permission you need to keep
in mind the following points regarding
penetration testing requests permission
is required for all penetration tests to
request permission you must be logged in
to the AWS portal using the root
credentials associated with the
instances you want to test otherwise the
ADA us vulnerability penetration testing
request form will not pre-populate
correctly AWS policy only permits
testing of ec2 and RDS instances that
you own tests against any other AWS
service or AWS owned resources are
prohibited currently Amazon does not
permit testing of small or micro RDS
instances in one small or t1 micro ec2
instances
you have already learned what the
customers responsibilities regarding
security are let's now quickly learn
what the responsibilities of AWS are AWS
offers extensive networking and security
monitoring systems to provide a secure
environment for your instances AWS is
responsible for ensuring the following
physical and environmental security fire
detection and suppression
uninterruptible power supply maintaining
a constant temperature for servers

life-support systems
storage device decommissioning business
