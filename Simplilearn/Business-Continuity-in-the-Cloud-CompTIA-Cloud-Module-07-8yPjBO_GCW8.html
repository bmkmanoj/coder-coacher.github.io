maintaining of multiple sites devices or
connections to eliminate single points
of failure which could completely stop
the flow of information redundancy is
done to maintain and use the backups
when the primary source goes down due to
some problem high availability
eh-eh-eh-eh refers to a system or a
component that is continuously
operational and is available even in the
case of physical system failure
it requires a lot of technical
implementations and backup servers and
here the concept of redundancy also
comes into the picture bail over this is
the process of temporarily switching the
production servers to a backup server
facility it can also be a redundant site
fail back operation a failover operation
is always followed by a fail back
operation a fail back operation is the
process of returning the production
servers to its original location
in this slide we'll continue to
understand the terminologies in disaster
recovery hot sites these are the
duplicate servers of the active
production server basically used for
fault tolerance
these duplicate servers always sync with
the production servers so that any
update in the production server will be
done in the hot site hot side is used in
critical business like banking finance
etc where it is essential that the data
must be live and updated
second-by-second cold sides cult sites
on the other hand are the duplicate
servers similar to that of hot site
however this site is not synchronized
with the production server 24 bar 7 and
the updates are done at the end of the
day this type of typical Recovery
Options is suited the companies which do
not require live updating businesses
like Shopping Center chains hotel chain
businesses usually prefer such type of
backup mean time between failures MTBF
MTBF refers to the time duration between
the two successive failures of the
production server machines this time is
important to understand the success rate
of the previous solution that was
delivered during the failure period this
basically checks the reliability of the
solution provided
meantime to recovery MTTR this is the
average time that a device will take to
recover from any failure so far we've
understood the terminologies in disaster
recovery in the next slide we will look
into typical solutions to meet
availability requirements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
