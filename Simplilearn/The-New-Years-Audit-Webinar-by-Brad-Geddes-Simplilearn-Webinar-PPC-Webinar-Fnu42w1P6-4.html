it's great to have you here thanks for
joining us oh thanks shipping it sounds
like we have a mixture of our regulars
and some new people so that that's great
great so yeah today we're gonna kind of
go through you know fixing the holiday
madness
I'm checking ads landing pages offers so
forth getting it back into shape right
because often in
november/december you are time strapped
you're doing everything you can to get
accounts you know ready for you know
Christmastime and all of a sudden things
sort of get out of whack and then really
you know what's up for 2017 what's a
resolution which are really the big
things you should be thinking about and
doing so really step one Christmas is
over sad to say it is back to work we
don't have another holiday for well for
another month or so until we have
Valentine's Day small holiday depending
on your industry so step one every
ecommerce account I have ever seen has
been guilty of this at least once it is
January and you search for Black Friday
deal shipping by Christmas and they're
still ads on the page and with sources
these offers don't longer exist these
landing pages sometimes don't exist
people still actually search for Black
Friday deals in February you'll see it
and so you've got some smart companies
right like target often does this were
they actually run an ad that says Black
Friday deals in in certain month right
March April May and it just said it goes
to like their deals page that says hey
Black Friday is over but here's our
deals for today right and that's the way
to kind of handle this so step one is do
you have this and where does it exist
so it's actually the easy thing to check
right go to your add screen just search
for hey my i text contains Black Friday
Christmas Xmas Hanukkah
you know shipping by a certain date etc
select all the ads pause them right
simple simple stuff now while that's
easy and text the ones that get missed
are images so if you made holiday
specific images there's no text to
search in so take a look your image ads
especially anything you may have created
late in the year say okay we also need
to get rid of our
no candy cane themed images that are
running all over the web right now we
look a little outdated now well this is
step one right what's the message
step two is did you pause so many ads
you have ad groups no ads left so a good
exercise and even if you're not in
holiday time this is still a good
exercise to run every time like a Dallas
is what we examine a lot of accounts for
ads I have again never seen an account
with more than about you know 500 ad
groups it doesn't happen for little ones
that doesn't have at least one ad group
with zero ads in it easy to find right
go to your dimensions tab go to the a
group detail screen add the column
active adds sort by it if you have zero
ads and an actor you got a problem
now again you may need to do some
filters like you know campaign state is
unpause and AD group is on pause but
this is also good exercise to even look
at if you go cranial a lot of ad groups
you know over the summer time and go oh
because that the biggest problem is
someone makes a big campaign in the
adwords editor and they named the
campaign for keywords x and the name the
campaign for the ad import y and they've
got a whole lot of ad groups no ads in
them so that's the next step now how's
that do your pages work alright I mean
that's you know ecommerce ha or
Christmastime you often add a lot of new
pages and there there's two ways
companies deal with this all right
actually there's three ways one they
just take down the page and they have
four a force ant not great number two
like this promotions expired so the
first thing somebody sees is a negative
message that's like alright it's expired
big red but if you read a little text
you can see we have other deals or the
third way is automatically redirect
these pages to your daily deals or your
specials pages so at least users see
right these are our current deals and
our current rates so that's that's the
next big
now often when we talk about negative
keywords a common thing that companies
do during holidays is they remove
certain types of negatives I mean the
example that I probably use the most
because I have a company I've dealt with
this for years is they sell really
high-end jewelry you want a $10,000 ring
they'll sell to you you want a 500 Rea
they tell you to go elsewhere right and
so words like cheap and discount they
don't want to use those words throughout
the year so they make their negative
lists they Adhan throughout the year
holiday time they removed from all the
campaigns
thing is in January they need to
remember let's go add all our negatives
again right saving for post holiday it's
their list actually right they add it
during that and they remove it you know
the rest during holiday time so if you
had certain negative keywords you added
or removed for holidays put them back
this is why whenever in November we
always do our things to remember to do
during the holidays listing out what you
did is a change is always on the list so
this time of year you can go back and
say what do we change so we can put it
back do you have keywords that need to
be paused all right so so the obvious
ones right are like Christmas gifts for
teenagers right that's a simple one if
you're a large company that sells a lot
of things like this then you might still
run keywords like gifts under $20 right
still a good keyword for you know gifts
calm or something but if you're a
smaller ecommerce company those words
have such high volume and low conversion
rates they're gonna eat your budget so
check that the topical keywords which
are really good to add I'm at certain
times a year now's the time to either
pause them or or remove them if they're
not your typical keyword throughout the
year other things to think about
checking during holidays a common thing
is to remove your bid rules because you
often have to go to manual bidding at
certain times
because you really want positions so if
you changed your bid rules and your
third party system north in AdWords go
check the bid rules if you're trying to
say what are our bids really need to be
again go back to October right what
before holiday time and you have that
huge conversion rate because if you're
using I made a bid system you're
probably still bidding too high
depending on the rules because it's
looking at last 30-day conversion rates
which at this point in time included the
week before Christmas when commercials
were crazy high so they need to be
readjusted it's common to change
extensions right during holiday time did
you change your site links
did you add call-outs it says hey we can
get it there by Christmas time no longer
a good call-out so if you do adjust
extensions for holidays need to change
it back to pre holiday extensions again
did you add you know discount type words
you don't want to use any longer you
know she discount inexpensive again time
to move them follow URLs so every once
in a while we see companies who run
special promotions and they use specific
tags on URLs or they use a you know a
different landing page solution for
holidays or something so if you change
funny URLs this is the time to get back
next to easy ones a mess
because you're probably using audiences
is do you have certain audiences you now
need to remove so for instance it's a
really common thing it's a okay when in
commerce site we have certain people who
only buy from us from the holiday time
they don't buy our stuff in the middle
of the summer or whatnot so we make a
customer match list right take your
emails or sell your CRM system and
uploaded to Adwords
and say this is our you know huge
positive modifier or even our you know
Gmail only type of ad display for
previous customers that's a great list
one during holiday time wonderful list
it may not have a purpose right now so
if you looked at your audiences and you
really up to bid adjustments or you have
certain audiences running which were
really for holiday only time now's the
time to pause that audience or change
those bid adjustments back to regular
levels again so it's a really really
easy one to miss and then if you made
that holiday plan right review it take a
look and say okay we were gonna do this
but we did this instead a lot of a lot
of e-commerce companies make
contingencies upon contingencies it says
okay inventories over X and sales are
below Y on this date we're gonna just
start counts this way right and it's all
that last-minute scrambling so notes are
often you know miss of that point in
time so review it okay what else did we
change we want to come back we want to
put back to where it was really cuz its
2017 all right this is uh it's now in a
new year all their doll the dates you
have on your website are wrong all the
dates you put on your things are wrong
it's at sauna starting 2017 so if you've
been a mark that motive member for a
long time hopefully hopefully hopefully
by now you have a marketing plan alright
our practitioner series actually ends
with here's a marketing plan to creates
you can think here's how you build stuff
here's what we do each year here's what
we need to think about for the future
alright so hopefully you have one you
can pull up the marketing plan say okay
maybe we should we should do our review
whether it's a quarter of you or an A in
review and saying have our goals changed
do we have different conversions we need
to track now or have we changed email
providers and we can do better
email segmentation than we did before
that affects how we actually build our
audiences and what our audience plan
happens to be other features that are
launched that we kept saying lashes look
at this we should look at this and you
haven't and it's sitting in your plan
that's the time just like really take
that that look right and if you're 90
she probably did this in December and
say what really what's new in our
company
what is our big overarching goals for
this year but it always starts with have
the goals changed right that is that the
number one thing to ask especially if
there was a management transition change
in in q3 or q4 because as new management
comes in they say yeah we really want to
change the way we consider customers and
you know attribution or we really want
to focus more on direct response sales
and we have such robust CRM system let's
give less credit to email right so it's
important if you had a management change
- this is probably about the time
they're ready to put their big stamp on
this is our big change to our marketing
forecast I just make sure and alignment
with whatever that may look like hey do
you have new parks new services right
this is also time to say okay you know
we're non-ecommerce we're b2b Brad so
why do you keep talking to ecommerce
right well cuz e-commerce makes all the
changes but if your b2b you know you did
in December you have to the e-commerce
companies you planned out 2017 you you
he audited your email system it's all in
good shape and now it's time to execute
those plans
all right saying these are our new
products we're gonna offer this year
these are the new services we want to
offer this year and if your e-commerce
do you have those new products it's time
to really go through that information
especially your feeds
man it's time to say what are we really
gonna get done this year right what is
that the major major thing and so I have
some some things I want to walk through
real simple that are just really good
resolutions of things to do in your
accounts number one track all your
conversion activity now this this most
companies are missing some conversions
it could be there phone calls it could
be there in store purchases it could be
that they have a massive tradeshow
presence and they're not taking that the
business cards from the trade shows and
using them back in there or CRM system
and customer match you know within their
paid search accounts most people are
missing some conversions so it's time to
look and say okay let's just track at
least one more conversion type the wind
of last year now when you think of 2016
as a whole 2016 saw a rise of audience
targeting options right so we think of
audience targeting back in on 2012 you
had remarketing and then you had just
after that dynamic remarketing and then
in 2015 I believe it was maybe 2014 you
had remarketing lists for search ads the
next year we had customer match and in
December you know Google out of the
option to even do campaign level
audience targeting and two months afore
that they added demographic targeting
for search and then you have similar
audiences our look like based audiences
so when you look and we did a huge
workshop on this um two or three months
ago
big big workshop on on audience
targeting and really getting into it and
looking at strategies is that the number
a lot of people are still focused on is
hey overall website conversions two to
four percent that's an old number right
I mean it's still true from an absolute
standpoint it's not true from how people
shop these days and the average person
will make six visits and the conversion
process now that could be three visits
to two websites it could be one visit of
six sites can be six visits to your site
may that's average in travel it's
actually 20 visits to a single
conversion in others it's it's one or
two but the reality is is that audience
targeting
is essential these days when you think
of things like DSA's get people in to
our sites just based on our site content
right and then we can look at how people
interact with our website and based on
that data create audiences and on that
second and third visit that's when they
convert right so you know one of my
favorite formulas right as I say all
right how many people came to your site
today in one person Bob tomorrow ninety
nine of those same people returns and
two people by the next day
ninety eight people returned right and
three people bought now now the problem
here is if you say I look at Google
Analytics for my conversion data right
Google Analytics is gonna tell you you
have six conversions on three hundred
visits right so that's your conversion
rate it's it's uh what is that five
percent it's actually less than that I
can't do math up ahead it seems this
morning and but in reality right when
you think of unique people you have 100
unique people and six conversions it's a
really big difference in so audience
targeting and and how you do audience
strategies is going to directly dictate
how you also think about attribution
management because if you're not using
audiences and you're just using a
straight last click conversions rates
then you're probably going to use last
click attribution which is a great
starting place right I mean you don't
want to discount at least you're
tracking things but once you start
getting audiences you say oh so we have
a long buying funnel and a person really
visits our site seven times so what we
want to really look at is how do they
find us and what finally got them to
convert right and we want to give you a
lot of credits our first and last
interaction and a little bit in the
middle right that's position based
attribution or you say now we're really
response company we don't go for this
huge branding thing at all
right so it we want to do some
attribution on pillar less click so it's
gonna be a time decay model rate what
would that the most of the most recent
interactions gets most the credit right
and so there's not even a right or wrong
attribution management strategy right it
did takes a lot on how your customers by
and in the HIPAA rule highest paid
person you know what's their thoughts on
attribution but audience targeting
attribution are important I would argue
that you know attributions your money so
that's as important as your money
happens to be but if you want to stay on
top of the game and paid search you have
to be using audience targeting and we
did a fantastic workshop which I love
just a few months ago on that you can
watch now we have today is the 19th so
in 12 days 12 days from now you can no
longer make a standard text ad for
search on Google it's all etas now
beyond that was a announcement that has
been very very quiet I'm Google's
already sunsetting ETS for Display
Network supposedly we'll see what
happens here but after January 27th you
cannot make et A's or stas for the
Display Network it's all responsive ads
and so when you think of display these
days
it really is responsive ads are the
majority of your impressions because
there can be text it could be image and
they give you any image size depending
on the publisher if you want more brand
control right then you use a lot more
image ads and if you want pretty reg
responsive aren't the prettiest ads this
happen to me that the most efficient
because of the few you need to manage
compared to the the overall impressions
you get from them so responsive gdn
that's important alright it's amazing we
still have to say this but as a site
really mobile-friendly right and that's
that's important
and thing to think about these days it
does not matter if your b2b it does not
matter if 95% of your conversion rates
are coming from desktops you need a
mobile presence and I'm still seeing
massive massive companies who are not
mobile friendly and it's usually because
we're a big enterprise b2b play no one
looks at us on a phone and it might not
be a huge number but if you're such a
big enterprise b2b play then the ASP
that the fact that you don't look on a
phone tells your your potential
customers hey their technology is not
up-to-date so it's not even about
getting mobile conversions from paid
search right it's the impression that
you're giving off to people that you're
not up-to-date and if you're outside
website is not up-to-date how could your
you know internal software be up-to-date
for mobile friendliness and it's amazing
is I was just dealing with a big
enterprise company there are apps they
they specialize in apps for mobile for
for CRM based systems and their apps are
beautiful but no one trusts them because
their website is an actually
mobile-friendly another app development
company right it's it's but that's
something else is really important try
dynamic search at so we did a um again
another workshop just a few months ago
and covered a lot about dynamic search
ads and when we think of attribution in
audience targeting what we're often
thinking about is alright it's not just
about hey how much do we bid based on
the conversion rate of a keyword right
it's how do we get a lot of people to
our website some being highly qualified
some being lower qualified right and
let's set a bid based on qualification
levels and then based on how they are to
our website then let's set our audience
bid and attracting back in when they're
really ready to convert and DSA's
dynamic search ads are just a great way
of filling stuff out there and saying
we're gonna pay maybe it's only twenty
five cents a click right I mean cuz it's
gonna be less qualified traffic but it
builds up those audience
very cheaply so that you can say okay
you know these 20% totally unqualified
these did you worsen and kind of will
make an audience targeting to watch it
but it when I could do a bid modifying
them oh wow this 30% that was great
clicks there so let's make an audience
targeting of bump them up a lot and that
30% was worth the fact that you paid was
over 70 but which is why in aggregate
right you have a low CPC for it but
DSA's they have gotten really really
useful in not just back filament or but
even primary inventory these days if
you've got a lot of partisan pages them
they're just necessary for backfill but
they've really come a long ways and in
with audience targeting and attribution
management if those are to your goals
which they really should be DSA is a
nice layer to put with those it can't
ever be said enough test landing pages
no one can ever say this enough to you
next use all the ad extensions we
recently talked about some changes there
are so many ad extensions so it's really
not used all of them and she's all are
applicable to you but there's no
extensions that if you're a manufacturer
and you sell products only in CVS and
Walmart's right you don't have physical
stores you don't sell direct you just
sell in CVS or Walmart there's actually
extension that will show the location to
the user search of your product of the
nearest one where CVS where they can buy
your product where extensions have so
many different things they will do for
you now you know site links call-outs
structure snippets I mean everyone
should use those period end of story
right you care about calls colic
Simpsons great um you have physical
location location Simpsons great but
there's they're becoming more more
specialty extensions so it's useful as
to everyone smile look at and say is
there a new extension for us as an FYI
Google is going to start looking to see
if you have a phone
on your landing page a phone number and
if you do automatically create a call
extension for you on mobile devices if
you don't want this right not everyone
actually wants this if you don't want
this opt-out and this is gonna go live
in like four or six weeks from now if
you go into your extension data you go
to the automated extensions there's an
option where you can see all the
automated and opt out of certain ones so
if you're like ooh we don't want a front
of normal places then opt out of that
try some on Tiger testing again Wiener
workshop just a few months ago right
really really getting into how do you
get deep insights into your account and
ads are the only part of your account
users are see write your keywords your
DSA is your audience all they say is
show an ad don't show an ad and how much
we'll want to spend if they happen to
click on our ad but it's all about the
ad so that adds that that marketing
component so if you haven't really tried
you know multi agar testing you've been
sort of mostly focused on you know a be
testing a few ad groups try branching
out set some more multi agar testing and
and of course for those of you who have
been here many times you know that I am
a PA I am a time management freaking in
many many ways right
so you know manage PPC more like a
project and not a to-do list and of
course I'm mark emotive simply learn the
number one resolution every year must
always be get education stay on top of
the changes there's so many changes they
changed quickly right it was a great
place that to stay on top of those and
we just taught you resolutions if you
are our time restricted and you're like
well we can't do this been off time our
next workshop we're doing this on time
until management for PBC years one of my
um absolute favorite topics of all
so it'll be a really good fun workshop
that covers both time management juices
and individuals or as a team but also
tools to help and when tools are really
applicable um to use as a team as well
all right and with that I am going to
hand it's a chip for a second to see if
we have any great questions and and grab
a supporter myself and pause for a
second all right well you were spot-on
25 minutes there man you just like you
said you would be appreciate that and
yes we do have some questions queued up
and I would again let everybody know
that if anything came up or you've got
some specific questions about some
challenges that you've been running into
with the management of your campaigns
and you want to drop them in to the
questions module please do so because we
will get to them before we jump on the
questions though I have to do what I
refer to if you've been here before you
know I refer to this as my contractual
obligation screen takeover moment and
here I'm gonna take over with a little
quick poll and Thank You GoToWebinar for
cutting off my head line like that it's
always so consistent I just want to let
you know a little bit more about what it
is that market motive and simply learn
do so you know this is a public facing
webinar it's free to be here we've got
folks joining us here who are not
currently market motive members or
simply learn members and and that's fine
we appreciate having you here and we
enjoy putting together these webinars
every month across a variety of
disciplines to share the insight of our
subject matter experts folks like Brad
who are the presenters in our various
training courses but that's the
important distinction we are more than
simply a series of webinars our core
service is that we are a training
publisher we create web-based digital
marketing training curricula here at
market motive that are used by higher
education institutions like Duke
University and Rutgers they're licensed

and in-house Enterprise teams they use
these to bring their teams up to speed
and create a common vocabulary to train
across silos and and so on also a great
onboarding tool to make new hires more
productive more quickly
these are structured courses with
streaming video lessons downloadable
workbooks quizzes tests real-world
exercises you also get access to active
moderated forums you can interact
directly with the faculty and with other
students where you can ask questions
about the materials and maybe get a
little guidance on how to apply the
lessons to your real-world marketing
challenges so if you want to know more
take the appropriate box we'll have
somebody get in touch with you help you
figure out which membership plan might
be best and figure out how we can help
you achieve your personal goals or your
business goals through this training and
if it turns out that it's not right for
you that's okay too there's no
obligation if you would rather have
somebody call you as opposed to email
you we already have your email
information thanks to your registration
here at GoToWebinar but if you would
rather have somebody call you that's
okay to just drop a phone number into
the questions module nobody else will
see it but I'll I'll make sure that it's
attached to your to your profile
information and we'll call rather than
email alright appreciate you indulging
me I'm going to close this we'll go back
to seeing your screen Brad in just a
second here waiting for GoToWebinar to
catch up with me and and close out that
poll my goodness it's a little slow
today anyway while we're waiting there
we go we're going to jump on to the
questions I'm gonna tackle the most
common question myself right away we
have a few people asking this will this
webinar be available as a recording or
can I get a hold of the slide deck yes
most all of our webinars are recorded
and they are added to the market mode of
YouTube channel I'm not sure how long
it's taking right now it goes through a
slight production process just to clean
it up and get rid of all the hemming and
hawing and hopefully would take that
silly poll out of the middle of it
before it goes up onto YouTube but yes
we used to post these inside the market
mode of the learning management platform
and if you hear a longtime member you'll
notice that over the course of the past
ten months or so they no longer appear
inside the
form there now on a playlist over at
YouTube I will share that link with you
very soon along with some other links
relevant to this presentation all right
Theresa is asking Brad I've run into a
situation recently where four or five
review extensions are not showing I'm
getting zero impressions Google has
confirmed that I've got it set up
properly and they've suggested that I
need to reduce the number of extensions
total have you run into this is there a
recommended number of extensions or a
certain number that is too many to
function properly
Brad do we have you you do I had muted
myself on here I'm here I just do my
cell phone meet when you're talking in
forgot yeah Teresa Teresa of course
you've great questions as always you can
get too many extensions but usually if
you're running like five to six you're
okay so it mean ormally call-out site
links structure snippets call or
location and review will show at once if
you have branched into using you know to
structure snippets and your six
call-outs and you know six site links
which it's again those can all show
together
you might try pausing at the second call
out or yeah that's where it won't not
call out I mean I mean the second
structured snippet if you're using
location and phone and like affiliate
location then I would suggest we're
moving you know pausing one of those and
and seeing how that does I have not seen
for view extensions always get 0 that
seems highly unusual because Google
system is built to see which combination
of extensions for a given device and AD
group and and so forth so vamos
so it's
very odd to me that you have zero
impressions that seems highly unlikely
if I miss I mean I know you did it right
so I've got a little question so I it
feels like Google's got a problem with
their system and and your rep gave you
something that is not fully correct so
if I were you I would pause like you
know the second structure snippet and
pause something that isn't crucial and I
have a feeling the impressions will not
come back but then you can set your rep
hey we did this and it doesn't work can
you hand this the engineering team and
that's probably gonna be your end result
I could be wrong you may pause it and
boom you get impressions if you do
please post in forms had happened
because I would love you know this is
the solution but um even though I'm
guessing that's your actual course of
action alright hopefully that helped
Teresa and do be sure like Brad said
post something in the forums and remind
him of your situation and and that way
also the other students of course will
be able to see that as well dan is
asking would DSA work for b2b services
like CPA or law a little bit of a
specific case but do you have experience
with those particular verticals so Dan
this is more about your page coverage in
that case so it's not yes it can work
with law no problem
but you've got some warriors that have
as you know right two to four page
websites and you're knocking anything
out of DSA's in that case you have other
lawyers who you write good blog posts
and have articles about the types of law
and how you know this type of family law
applies slightly differently in this
case versus that case and I've got good
content on their pages and those pages
also include a lead form or are you know
like you've got a blog post and you've
got a blog post that
and your company at the end I'm sure you
kind of get the difference there so if
you've got a larger lawyer site great go
for it
especially you're gonna see some bad
queries but your lawyer cpc's are so
high that who cares we're paying 50
cents for a few bad queries and some
good ones with DSA's but if you're
running like the lawyer stuff and I know
you have a few both where I feel like
the really small ones yeah probably not
worth your time I mean you could try it
but you're probably not gonna see much
perfect Dan I hope that was helpful if
not drop another question in there with
a little more clarification dan says
great thank you so that that was
definitely helpful Marielle is a
relative newbie here to digital
marketing says very new to all of this
can you please take a moment to explain
what an ETA and a gdn are all right and
in paid search this you will understand
quickly that there are a ridiculous
amount of acronyms it sometimes feels
like working with a federal government
where you can say eight acronyms in a
row and that actually meant something to
somebody so eta stands for expanded text
ad Google changed their ad format last
year to go from a 22 character headline
and to 35 character descriptions to a
230 character headlines and a 80
character description I believe that's
right it could be 60 um and so each CA
just refers to the longer ad format that
is now standard so if you've been doing
this for a month you've probably never
seen the old ad format which is about to
be a sunsetted GD n stands for Google
Display Network it is the largest
Display Network on the planet actually
it's it's huge in size and encompasses
things from its non-search sites so it
could be New York Times to Amazon to you
know YouTube right which could
theoretically be considered a search
engine at times so it's non search
intent users are on the Display Network
and
gdn just refers to Google's Display
Network as opposed to other display
networks that are owned by you know
Microsoft or Yahoo or someone else yeah
more acronyms than you can throw a stick
at and it's been that way for a long
time I mean when I was working at
agencies ten years ago we we talked
about the latest TLA which is your
three-letter acronym so TLA is abound
here in digital marketing an advanced
search and you'll find at times it's
it's okay to ask people to it to clarify
because even something as simple as
return on adspend right no one wants to
say those words so some people say Ross
others say ROAS and while that seems
very minor rage suddenly someone says
one that you're not you're not used to
hearing and takes you on the road oh you
mean the same thing and the most most
most confusing one is CR CR because some
people mean conversion rates other means
click-through rates there's one other
one o CPC cost per click is how I use it
but some people mean that to be cost per
conversion and a clicking good version
are very very different
so if you see CPC and someone seems as
how yeah RC PCs are $2.00 rating see PCs
for $57 they mean both those like one is
CPC cost per click one is cost per
conversion in the same sentence and that
should be a band thing and paid service
but that is that is the the worst one of
all is CPC uses conversion and not cost
per click it seems to me like we had a
question come up I can't member if it
was in your last paid search webinar if
it was in the social webinar that with
Jen recently but again we had a
relatively new person who was asking
clarify what CPM and CPC are there again
you have a confusion because CPM cost
per thousand is referencing the Roman
numeral m4 thousand so you would think
well so CPC must be cost per hundred
right so there's not even
there's not even any consistency across
what the acronyms use as their basis you
know what I mean so that's a great
example I've never heard that one that
Wow yeah yeah so no harm no foul asking
for clarification for sure it's I
thought there was another one that came
up recently they're so funny if I think
of it later I'll share it alright well
hopefully that was helpful
Theresa has another quick question can
you restate please maybe you can go back
and show us the previous slide how to
find the empty ad groups that looked
like what you were doing is easier than
the way she's been doing it oh god yes
so here let me show you this this is so
simple so dimensions tab add group
details and if you customize columns
there's a column called active ads so
this is your unpause ads unpause done
disabled ads in an ad group this was so
Google has made and this is where they
they get annoying at times right so they
have made the ad group details and
campaign details every you know couple
of months they add another column to it
and they don't tell anybody that oh did
you realize you can now see you know how
many disabled phone calls you have in
the campaign details and and so everyone
Swan it's worth reviewing the possible
columns you can add to the ad group and
campaign details on the dimensions had
you stopped to do pivot tables and this
and that you don't have to anymore take
me out of Excel that's what matters
Teresa I hope that helped let's see
Andrew has a question is there a rule of
thumb for the number of sitelink
extensions per campaign or ad group I'm
not sure how related that is to what you
talked about a few minutes ago with
Theresa's challenge sure right so Google
will show usually two to four a mobile
device
four to six on a desktop usually desktop
six means it's a brand based query if
you're if you've got you know five or
six you really like use five or six if
you've got a few others that are ideas
and add a couple more it's okay to have
like eight or nine and what you see over
time is Google's gonna rotate through
them and then see which one actually has
an impact on CTR now in their case it's
CTR you of course care about conversions
more but that's a way of kind of seeing
which one's raised the top the other
reason to not don't you like so two is
the minimum if you have one that won't
even show the other reason that a couple
more is Google Google's policy is if the
extension this could be call our site
link contains the exact same text as the
ad they won't show it in reality they
show up most of the time that every once
while they they fix the bug on a system
and they stop showing and they start
showing again so it's always gonna need
to keep a couple more you know X 6 is
just a good number to have so that if
you um you match the text in both you
still have call-outs and the end site
links shown but usually six is a good
number it's okay to have seven or eight
though but if you only have one call-out
or site link they will not show it all
so you must must at least have two so
that's the rule of thumb greater than
one you know what you're losing space if
you don't have more right so I mean if
they'll show four and you have two you
you've just lost the ability to push
your competitor down like an entire you
know 12 pixels and and that's there
enough that's important as well
absolutely especially about real estate
control right location location location
yep especially on mobile where the real
estate is just that much more
competitive yep very good okay and I
hope that was helpful for you as well
Raymond we've still got time here
Raymond says hi Brian I have a question
when you're sitting RLSA targets oh wait
a minute before we do this Raymond I'm
sorry you threw out CTR and I'm just
going to clarify for those that are new
that that's click-through rate in that
context yes yes and I thought of the
other one which was CPA cost per
acquisition which also has a kind of a
bazillion other they're not talking
about the accountant when they're in the
marketing meeting and talking about CPA
so another another TLA there for you so
Raymond says when you're setting RLSA
targets on your search ad groups what
target method bid only or target and bid
is more suitable
oh so that's depending on what you're
trying to do right so when you use bid
only you're basically saying my RLSA is
a bid adjustment so if you're using our
let's say will you say wow these people
abandon my shopping cart
I want to dump in my bed yeah I do
always say to your ad groups you had a
harm modifier you walk away or you say
we're tracking people who are paying
members of our software system because
we don't want a bid for them again you
add all of saia's but only 100% they
don't see those ads if you you have
scenarios as well where you may want to
do things like show a different set of
ads or use different keywords to people
who are in your audience group so like
like we mentioned DSA's earlier so let's
say you've got a big product catalog and
you find that users who have been in
your site are much more likely to
convert they you know they're members
but you're kind of look is so huge you
don't have keywords for everything and
you don't want to use all these keywords
for anybody but only you know previous
visitors so in that case you'd set up a
DSA you use our let's say as target and
bid so only someone in your list can see
that ad so it's not a and either/or
right most people use it as bid only
because that way they have visibility of
the keywords on every one and then use
it as a bit adjustment but you can't
isolate a group of people by using
target and bit and again we go over this
as well in those scenarios and our
audiences workshop that we did a couple
months ago which was a really good
workshop so that also
or you know those cases that I went
through of different keywords different
ads to audience members perfect and
again I'll be sharing the link to that
YouTube playlist with the recorded
webinars on it and hopefully the
production team is is caught up enough
to where these webinars that you're
referencing are there on that list so
Raymond I hope that was valuable Colin
as I'm new to PPC how do you get to see
better data in the keyword planner right
now I'm just seeing ranges and that is
not particularly helpful
is there a setting that Colin is missing
or is there another no so Google in
their infinite wisdom and wow I can't be
sarcastic enough on the comments about
to make they last year had a series of
changes to keyword planner data where
for a while if you didn't have a paid
search account with actual spend which
could be a penny a month
you saw zeros then they said okay people
use keyword planner data to plan so
we're gonna based how how accurate the
data is based on your spend because if
you're only spending a thousand bucks a
month you probably don't need to see hey
these five thousand keywords get 30 so
an aggregate that's that's to be another
campaign for you where someone who's got
a much larger span has more accurate
data so if if you happen to have a my
client center go to the account with the
absolute highest spend do your research
there export the the plan to excel go
back to the other account and then you
can import that right into the account
where you actually want it but you're
not missing something these are a series
of in my opinion very poor changes
Google made through q4 lat q3 to keep or
last year that makes it so your your
ramekins a range of a thousand a hundred
thousand is totally useless but I will
see someone that ranges in one account I
can go to a higher spending account I'll
say oh it's seventy two thousand and and
and that's there's no good
solution at the moment unfortunately the
other good mm can point it out here at
the other fantastic research tool is
Bing ads intelligence it'll give you
again it's based on bings data which is
now 31 percent US market share but you
can do things like hey what's the
percentage of females versus males who
search for this term or what is the is
this term also searched for people who
are you know more likely over 65 or
under 18 so with bings obviously it
doesn't fully extrapolate to Google's
volume because Google you know is much
larger than being there's no question
but it does give you better insights and
they're more precise for at least a big
network so if you're having some
problems with the keyword planner look
at Bing ads and how it is it's a plugin
for excel that has a lot of fantastic
things
terrific colin says that was awesome
thank you and then following up with a
question is there a third-party tool
like some rush or something like that to
do that I should use to do research well
I mean okay so you know semrush some
horses great great but the thing is all
the third-party tools are extracting
data from either the AdWords tool other
places they're buying data from this and
that so if you're trying to get relative
data right hey does this person spend
more than this person some rush
fantastic or hey what are the ads from
you know Lithuania
for this query right Sam well actually I
don't they do if when you but but so
much does great stuff they're like we're
tracker you know so forth but if you're
looking to plan out budgeting spans and
you want the most accurate data possible
the Bing tool and the AdWords tool are
by far the most accurate even with their
sort of imperfect ranges because it
releases based on their data where the
other systems are much more directional
and how you've compared data as opposed
to absolute
fantastic Colin says cool thank you so I
think that answered the question and
that sort of I think we have time to
squeeze one more and and you mentioned
Bing
I don't currently use Bing but I am
considering expanding into it in 2017
how much of what I've done for
organization in Adwords is transferable
to Bing or my in for a challenging
transition how similar or different are
the tools oh god it's so Bing has a
import from AdWords function so if
you've done some crazy things where you
know this campaign is all let's say only
this campaigns cost much only this
campaign is you know whatever then
you're gonna only import the appropriate
campaign so Bing is campaign a group add
just like Adwords they have what they
call on AdWords parity so users
literally can go and click an import
button now after you import and you can
choose hey only import these four
campaigns because there's no bing TVN
Network right after you import bing has
things like you can add image of images
to your search side so there's some
stuff to do after that the biggest thing
with the import process is their
geographies don't always map correctly
so for instance I live and in Washington
DC Bing does not have the same geo code
that AdWords has for Washington DC so if
I import DC from AdWords to Bing I
actually target the entire United States
again bad decision there right so
double-check those geo targets very
closely and then take a look I mean
double check your your basics right like
your campaign budgets and then usually
get some right but it's money it's worth
double check in but you're not you're in
for I mean now it takes me five to seven
minutes to do a new account the first
time you do it you're in for you know if
you're doing like twenty campaigns it
may take you a day but you're not in for
a I gotta plan this off from scratch
it's it's a great place to start with
that's great news I I would have
imagined it would it would be more
complex than that so expanding yourself
into into the Bing I don't know we call
it a network really but a being platform
yeah and they're growing I mean they're
you know they're 21 percent market share
in Taiwan they're twenty first twenty
two percent in UK they're 12 percent
Canada the 31 percent u.s. so they're I
mean again there's no Display Network
per se right so like when it comes to
beyond search they're they're they're
tiny compared to Google right but
they're there's a good marketing bump to
be had by getting into Bing search and
it might be more affordable right I saw
an article over on search engine watched
it's just four or five months old that
was a case study comparison between the
Google and Bing and they found something
like a 63% cheaper conversion on so that
is so industry dependent right you're
very mature industries online travel
it's the same right because they're
they're whelming at 10% bump in OTAs is
a huge spend if you were in you know SMB
services Carpet Cleaners oh my god it's
so much cheaper because carpet cleaner
don't take on a time to manage two
networks so there's you know and some
networks financial they're actually
slightly more expensive because legacy
Bing was on MSN which skewed very
heavily b2b so when certain errors
actually cited more expensive but for
most people yeah it's cheaper and it's
good quality traffic terrific terrific
all right I have shared a whole bunch of
links into the chat module those of you
who stuck out stuck it out here with us
to the to the very end take a look in
the chat window and you will see that I
shared a link to the upcoming webinars
and to the digital marketing courses in
PPC specifically at both market motive
and simply learn there's also a link
there to the market mode of YouTube
channel and specifically to the playlist
playlist for the old webinars and lastly
there's a link there to also Brad to
analysis so with that
we are right at our 1 hour mark and
we've answered everybody's questions
we're so efficient fantastic
once again next month Brad you've got
one of my favorites we're gonna do time
management on this second so what is
that roughly three two weeks from now
yeah that is going to be a fun one it's
one of my true passions yeah fantastic
so you can see that there on the screen
so go to that link I shared with you if
you haven't already signed up you're
welcome to join us for any of our public
facing webinars would be happy to have
everybody on board again and until then
I think that's it Brad thanks that was a
great great presentation and hopefully
everybody's all juiced up now and
excited about getting themselves on
track for 2017 so thank you chip and
everyone have a great morning or
afternoon or I guess evening if you're
