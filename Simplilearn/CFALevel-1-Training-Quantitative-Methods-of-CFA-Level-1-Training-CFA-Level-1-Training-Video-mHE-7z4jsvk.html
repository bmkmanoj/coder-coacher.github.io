introduction to the time value of money
tvm May twenty-third 2012 volume 1 study
session 1 reading 5 quantitative methods
hello candidate welcome to the sixth
lesson of the simply learned cfa level 1
tutorial the last lesson covered the
final reading of ethics up to now we
have covered the introductory lesson on
the exam structure of cfa level one and
four readings on ethics we will now
start with a topic today which is time
value of money or tvm of quantitative
methods quantitative methods will be
covered on to study sessions study
sessions to and study sessions 3 the
combined syllabus of quantitative
methods will be covered in eight lessons
from lesser number 62 lesson number 13
of the simply learn tutorials to know
more about the syllabus referred to
lesson one of the simply learn tutorials
in this lesson we will discuss the
future and present value of money that
includes the concepts of interest rates
required rate of return discount rates
for the future value to present value
and other concepts that deal with
affecting the value of money with time
agenda the agenda of this session is to
cover reading 5 as prescribed by the cfa
level 1 curriculum you can go through
this reading from volume 1 of cfa level
1 curriculum made available to you by
cfa institute in this lesson we will
start with the concept of time value of
money and move onwards as illustrated in
reading 6 of the cfa level 1 curriculum
this lesson describes the phenomenon of
valuation of money on the basis of
different risks involved and on the
basis of time involved in the
investments in this lesson you will
understand the concept of interest rates
how they are calculated and said what
the factors are that constitute the
interest rate and how those factors
affect other
interest-rate describing factors we will
cover in detail with calculations and
interpretations of future and present
value of cash flows as per the learning
outcome statements or LOL as defined by
cfa institute after completion of this
lesson a student should be able to
interpret interest rates as required
rates of return discount rates or
opportunity costs explain an interest
rate at the sum of a real risk free rate
expected inflation and premiums that
compensate investors for distinct type
of risk calculate and interpret the
effective annual rate given the stated
annual interest rate and the frequency
of compounding solve time value of money
problems for different frequencies of
compounding calculate and interpret the
future value and present value of a
single sum of money an ordinary annuity
and annuity jus a perpetuity and a
series of unequal cash flows and
demonstrate the use of a timeline in
modeling and solving time value of money
problems what is time value of money tvm
let us now start with understanding of
the concept of time value of money as we
discussed in the presentation above in
this lesson tvm is about defining the
value of money with respect to the time
and factors affecting it the time value
of money or tvm refers to the fact that
one dollar today is worth more than one
dollar in the future this is because the
one dollar today can be invested to earn
interest immediately it describes the
fact that the value of money today will
be relatively less tomorrow suppose you
are supposed to get one thousand dollars
today from a bang and you are provided
the money after six months will you
accept the money no your answer will be
surely know as a fact you know that the
value of money today will not be the
same tomorrow this is the concept of
time value of money the value of money
is driven by several factors these may
be the exchange rates market operations
interest rates inflation opportunity
cost
etc tvm reflects the relationship
between present value future value time
and interest rate that is how much
invested amount yields to how much money
on the basis of compounding with our
interest rate for n years let's take up
an example assume that you deposit one
thousand dollars in an account earning
seven percent interest for two years
what is the amount at the end of two
years the amount you will be getting at
the end of two years is 1140 four
dollars point nine the figure has been
calculated using the compound interest
formula all formulas would be discussed
in detail later in this lesson the
example manifests that value of money
would change with time in this example
the value of money after two years has
increased from one thousand dollars to
one thousand one hundred and forty-four
dollars further description about the
interest and its components and
calculation of future or present value
is described next interest rate
interpretations this slide covers the
important topic in the valuation of
money that is the interest rate interest
rates can be interpreted in three ways
the first way of describing interest
rates is as required rate of return
required rate of return as discussed in
the presentation is the return required
by investors or lenders to postpone
their current consumption an interest
rate denoted as R is a rate of return
that reflects the relationship between
differently dated cash flows the second
way of describing interest rates is as a
discount rate as discussed in the
presentation the discount rate is the
rate use to discount the future cash
flows to allow for time value of money
that is to bring future value equivalent
to present value interest rates can also
be described as an opportunity cost
opportunity cost is the most valuable
alternative investors give up by
choosing what they do with the money
components of interest rates until now
we have discussed the concept of time
value of money and factors that
influence its calculation now we will
discuss the components of composition of
interest rates that together composes
the interest rate the components of
interest rates are real risk free
interest rates inflation premium default
risk premium liquidity premium and
maturity premium or duration let us now
explore each component with a brief
explanation firstly the real risk free
interest rates is the single period
interest rate for a completely risk-free
security if no inflation were expected
the real risk free rate reflects the
time preferences of individuals for
current versus feature consumptions next
is inflation premium it compensates
investors for expected inflation and
reflects the average inflation rate
expected over the maturity of the debt
the sum of the real risk free interest
rate and inflation premium is a nominal
risk-free interest rate third is default
risk premium this premium compensates
the investors for the possibility that
the boro will fail to make a promise
payment at a contracted time and in the
contracted amount fourth is liquidity
premium this premium compensates the
investors for the risk of loss relative
to an investment fair value if the
investment needs to be converted to cash
quickly the fifth and final component is
maturity premium or duration of debt the
premium is to compensate investors for
the increased sensitivity of the market
value of debt to a change in market
interest rates as maturity is extended
all the premiums are considered while
framing the interest rate what is the
future value of a single cash flow now
that we have discussed the concept of
time value of money and structure of
interest rates let's move towards the
calculation of the future value of money
for a single cash flow
the formula illustrated in the
presentation is applied for the
calculation of future value of the cash
flow let us understand the concept more
clearly with an example for example if
you deposit $1,000 today in a bank which
pays 10 percent interest compounded
annually how much will the deposit grow
to after eight years and 12 years in
this example the present value or PV is
equal to one thousand dollars and the
rate of interest or R is ten percent
number of years or n is 8 and 12 years
let's enter the values in the formula to
derive the result the future value after
eight years is 2144 dollars the future
value after 12 years is 3138 dollars you
may wait a moment at this slide to
calculate the figures yourself and
become comfortable with the formula
future value of a single cash flow we
discuss the calculation of future value
on the basis of an interest rate in the
above slide in this slide we will
understand the concept and
interpretation of compounding and how it
affects the future value the future
value calculation works on the concept
of compounding the interest earned is
compounded along with the earnings to
compose a future value with higher
return in comparison to simple interest
calculation the compound interest earned
on revised interest is a far more
powerful force because for a given
interest rate it grows in size each
period for example we have deposit one
thousand dollars for two years in a bank
interest earned is a rate of ten percent
for one year both simple and compound
interest would be ten percent of one
thousand dollars that is one hundred
dollars in the next year simple interest
would again be one thousand dollars
however compound interest would be one
hundred and ten dollars one hundred
dollars earned on one thousand dollars
and ten dollars earned on last year's
interest of 100
dollars future value keeps on
compounding until the end year a
timeline helps us to keep track of the
compatibility of time units and the
interest rate per time period what are
effects of the frequency of compounding
we now understand well what is time
value of money how interest rate works
what are the components that affect
interest rates and the calculation of
the future value of money from the
present value and interest rate now if
the frequency of compounding the
interest is changed to say monthly
quarterly or weekly then how will you
calculate the future value the formula
for calculating future value with
multiple compounding in a year is
illustrated in the slide please take a
moment to look at the formula if the
interest rate is positive the larger the
frequency of compounding the larger
would be the future value that is
effective rate of interest is larger in
case of compounding the effective rate
will be discussed in detail later in
this lesson let us discuss it with an
example suppose your bank offers you a
CD with a two-year maturity a stated
annual interest rate of eight percent
compounded quarterly and the feature
allowing reinvestment of the interest at
the same interest rate you decide to
invest $10,000 what will the CD be worth
at maturity CD is certificates of
deposits the calculation is presented in
the slide in this example present value
or PV is $10,000 the amount which we
want to deposit the interest rate or r
is eight percent compounding is done
quarterly that is M equals four the
number of years on the investment or n
is 2 we enter all the values in the
formula to reach the result
what is continuous compounding now that
you understand the future value
calculation for single cash flows and
the interpretation of frequency of
compounding let us move forward to
continuous compounding in this slide we
will discuss the technique of
calculation of future value for
continuous compounding if the number of
compounding periods per year becomes
infinite then interest is said to
compound continuously the formula for
calculating future value for continuous
compounding is illustrated in the slide
please take a moment to study the
formula e is a numerical constant that
is equivalent to two point seven one
eight two eight you should remember the
value of e let us discuss the formula
with the help of an example suppose an
investment of ten thousand dollars will
earn eight percent compounded
continuously for two years what would be
the future value of investment at
maturity in this example present value
is ten thousand dollars compounding is
being done continuously at an eight
percent annual interest rate by entering
all the values in the formula we would
reach the result please take a moment to
calculate the results yourselves this
will help you in understanding and
remembering the formula what is
effective annual rate the stated annual
interest rate does not give a future
value directly so we need a formula for
the effective annual rate when the
interest is paid more than once annually
the rate of return will be more than the
actual annual interest that is known as
effective annual rate or ei are the
concept of EA R extends to continuous
compounding the effective annual rate is
a value used to compare different
interest plans if two plans were being
compared the interest plan with the
higher effective annual rate would be
considered the better plan the interest
plan with a higher effective annual rate
would be the better earning plan the
formula for calculating EA R is
illustrated in the slide
please take a moment to look at the
formula let's take an example to
understand the concept of the effective
annual rate suppose we wish to find the
effective annual rate associated with a
ten percent nominal annual rate when
interest is compounded one annually that
is M equals 12 semi-annually that is M
equals 2 &amp;amp; 3 quarterly that is M equals
for the calculation is provided in the
slide the periodic interest rate is the
annual interest rate divided by the
number of periods in this example the
annual interest rate is ten percent
hence the period interest rate for
quarterly compounding would be ten
percent / 4 that is 2.5% enter the value
of the periodic interest rates in the
formula and you will get the effective
annual rate the future value of a series
of cash flows and annuity is a series of
periodic cash flows payments or receipt
of equal amounts the premium payment of
a life insurance policy for example is
an annuity there are two types of
annuities the first is an ordinary
annuity an ordinary annuity is when the
cash flows occur at the end of each
period and the annuity is called a
regular annuity or a deferred annuity
the second is annuity jus annuity jus is
when the cash flows occur at the
beginning of each period the annuity is
called an annuity jus the future value
of an ordinary annuity or fvo a is the
value that a stream of expected or
promised future payments will grow to
after a given number of periods at a
specific compounded interest rate the
formula for future value of an ordinary
annuity is illustrated in the slide the
symbols have the usual meaning future
value of an ordinary annuity will be
explained with the help of two examples
in the next slide
the future value of a series of cash
flows let's take an example and discuss
the future value of an ordinary annuity
suppose you deposit one thousand dollars
annually in a bank for five years and
your deposits earn a compound interest
rate of ten percent what will be the
value of this series of deposits or
annuity at the end of five years
assuming that each deposit occurs at the
end of the year the future value of this
annuity will be as shown in the slide to
explain the concept we will not use the
formula and calculate the results using
simple compound interest or the formula
for future value or single cash flows as
the annuity is for five years it means
there will be a five-year equal payment
of one thousand dollars per year as it
is an ordinary annuity payment is at the
end of the year and hence the first
payments of one thousand dollars would
be compounded for four years at the
interest rate of ten percent and the
second annuity would be compounded for
three years and so on using the simple
future value formula we can find out the
future value of all five payments adding
all future value payments would provide
us the future value of the annuity
payment we could have reached the result
using the future value of an ordinary
annuity formula discussed in the last
slide you should calculate and reach the
results using the formula please take a
moment to calculate the result using the
formula discussed in the last slide the
next example is also a similar example
explained to you with the help of the
infographic please solve this example
using the formula
the future value of a series of cash
flows when there are unequal cash flows
for the series of an investment we need
to first calculate the feature value of
the individual cash flows and then
summing up the future values provides
the figure for the exact calculation of
the invested money this is exactly the
same approach we would use to discuss
the example in the last slide that is
calculate future values of each cash
flow and then add them to find out the
future value of entire cash flow the
only difference would be unequal cash
flows an example discussed in the last
slide we have equal cash flows of one
thousand dollars every year you can take
unequal cash flows for example one
thousand dollars in year one one
thousand one hundred dollars in year two
one thousand two hundred dollars in year
three and so on until year five and then
calculate the future value using the
same approach present value of a single
cash flow we have discussed the interest
and future value and its computation now
suppose you had to make a managerial
decision on investment for a long-term
future plan then how we decide or
compare the profit at the time by
investing now or how will you judge the
value of money here the calculation of
present value provides a required
comparison in the last few slides we
discussed calculating future value of
present payments in this slide we will
calculate the present value of future
payments or profits or annuity the
formula for calculating present value is
illustrated in the slide please take a
moment to study the formula you will
also notice that the formula is only a
reversal of the formula for the future
value of a single cash flow that is if
future value is given we can find the
present value and if present value is
given we can find the future value using
the same formula let us discuss the
formula with the help of an example
sandwiches define the present value of
1700 that will be received ad
from now Sam's opportunity cost is eight
percent in this example the future value
or FV is 1700 and discount rate or
interest rate or opportunity cost or
hurdle rate R is eight percent number of
years of value of n is 8 enter the
values in the formula to reach the
result the calculation is presented in
the slide what is the effect of the
frequency of compounding compounding
more frequently than once a year results
in a higher effective interest rate
because you are earning an interest on
interest more frequently as a result the
effective interest rate is greater than
the nominal or annual interest rate
furthermore the effective rate of
interest will be larger the more
frequently interest is compounded the
effect of frequency of compounding on
future value was also discussed in slide
number eight and 10 the formula for
calculating present value for multiple
compounding periods in a year is
illustrated in the slide the symbols
have the usual meaning let's discuss the
formula with the help of an example Sam
wishes to find the present value of one
thousand seven hundred dollars
compounded quarterly that will be
received eight years from now Sam's
opportunity cost is eight percent in
this example the future value or FV is
one thousand seven hundred dollars and
discount rates or interest rates or
opportunity cost or hurdle rate R is
eight percent number of years or n is 8
a number of periods of compounding m is
equal to four enter the values in the
formula to reach the result compare this
result with result that we got in the
example in the last slide compounding
has decreased the present value please
make a note that if the interest rate is
positive the compounding increases the
future value but decreases the present
value
the present value of a series of cash
flows in the last two slides we
discussed the present value of single
cash flow let us now discuss the present
value of series of cash flows or the
present value of an ordinary annuity the
present value of an ordinary annuity can
be expressed at the sum of the present
values of each individual annuity
payment the formula for present value of
ordinary annuity is illustrated in the
slide symbols have the usual meaning let
us discuss the formula with the help of
an example alpha company a small
producer of plastic toys wants to
determine the most it should pay to
purchase a particular annuity the
annuity consists of cash flows of one
thousand dollars at the end of each year
for five years the required return is
ten percent let's calculate the present
value of the cash flows instead of using
the formula for annuity we would use the
formula for the present value of single
cash flow to explain the concept future
cash flow in our example is one thousand
dollars at the end of year 1 year 2 and
so on hurdle rate or required return or
opportunity cost is ten percent by suing
the formula we get the present value of
first annuity as 909 dollars nine cents
present value of second annuity payment
as eight hundred and twenty-six dollars
45 cents and so on the details are as
per the timeline adding all the values
would provide us the present values of
all future cash flows please calculate
the result using the present value
formula for an ordinary annuity this
will help you become comfortable with
formula and concept the present value of
a series of cash flows in the last slide
we discussed the present value of future
cash flows suppose a series of cash
flows would be for an infinite period of
time let us now learn the present value
of an infinite series of equal cash
flows a perpetuity is an annuity that
provides payments indefinitely
a perpetuity is a special kind of
annuity with a perpetuity the periodic
annuity or cash flow stream continues
forever as this type of annuity is
unending its sum or future value cannot
be calculated the conceptual formula for
present value is as illustrated in the
slide on doing a mathematical
integration the formula would reduce to
a over R that is the present value of a
perpetuity is the ratio of a periodic
payment / the ratio let's discuss the
concept with the help of an example how
much would I have to deposit today in
order to withdraw one thousand dollars
each year forever if I can earn eight
percent on my deposit as payments are
received forever it is an example of a
perpetuity the periodic payment or a is
one thousand dollars and rate or r is
eight percent enter these values in the
formula that is one thousand dollars /
0.08 the result is the present value of
the infinite series of cash flow the
present value of a series of cash flows
in the last few slides we discussed the
present value of a single cash flow or
equal cash flows let us now discuss the
present value of unequal cash flows when
we have unequal cash flows we must first
find the present value of each
individual cash flow and then some the
respective present values to calculate
the present value of the entire cash
flow let's discuss the formula with the
help of an example beta company a shoe
manufacturer has been offered an
opportunity to receive the mix stream of
cash flows over the next five years if
the firm must earn at least nine percent
on its investments what is the most it
should pay for this opportunity please
look at the timeline to understand the
example we have calculated the present
value of each single cash flow using the
formula discussed in this slide as well
as slide number 14 summing up all
present values would provide us the
present
value of the series of cash flows the
calculation is similar to the example
discussed in slide number 16 the only
difference is the amount of the cash
flows solving for rates number of
periods or size of annuity payments in
the topics discussed above certain
pieces of information have been made
available all the problems have given
the rate of interest are the number of
time periods n the annuity amount a and
either the present value PV or future
value fe but in real-world applications
the present value and the future value
may be given and you will have to solve
for either the interest rate of the
number of periods or the annuity amount
the formulas discussed in the lesson can
be used reversely to find the required
figures for example we can solve for the
growth rate using the same formula to
find out the growth rates on the basis
of the amount invested to maturity
amount that is present value to future
value we would use same future value of
single cash formula and calculate the
growth rate you will notice from the
formula that it is the same formula with
a difference that is now in terms of
rate arm
