you on a shoot gun house you two pistols
rifle under stress when it counted my
hips we had you for about three to five
days at a pre-employment pipeline where
I knew you were going downrange and so I
do that I have to communicate to you the
best way that I could possible a base
competency level off either pistol or
rifle works and I'm let it matter to
protect yourself a new protective buddy
I've been there three ways one start off
with demonstrating competency to I would
show you a variation or a handful of
different techniques and I'd ask you to
try a toy to try on Joanie agree Becky
get up there and do three techniques and
then the third means what you'd actually
try to expedite they make it your own if
you go spin straw it rolled it out and
it's not your own it's not going to
matter when you're a dumb fight where
you're underdressed when they get an
apple impossible get that's what I did
and what I'm going to tell you how am I
going to demonstrate competence law was
up you're employed in the technology
vector for a point a lot of people
behind me giggles they're employed right
if it demonstrates the competence they
made the transition in our employ so
they might know a thing or two about
their right way wrong way there's good
techniques bad technique - you've
already heard a handful of different
techniques from everybody right oh we're
out tonight you do this try it you'll
like them throw them off let's try it
and then once you've tried a lot of
those techniques whether it's LinkedIn
profiles resume doing networking making
your own alright so once you try the
handful of 510 technique the Sun Tuesday
figure out how you internalized it how
you make it your own
and then move on the commission whatever
that is

engage and you want to have a lot of
relationship with any of the network

one of those techniques that happen you
try your mission which is now
conditioning civilian life and getting
meaningful employment we've told you
that as possible we've demonstrated
competence it's your turn to learn train
and demonstrate competency result so
with that if we could be of any
assistance to use not like simpler boots

map whatever career or agency you find
during your hallway conversations here

two weeks when you're doing your
LinkedIn search the director John

training oh that's all pay $35,000 I
don't want it but that girl paid seventy
thousand dollars
