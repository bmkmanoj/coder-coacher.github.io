training by simply learn this training
is about lean management and it will
provide you with details on what it is
and how you can use it in your
organization in this section I will
provide you with an introduction to lean
management this will act as a foundation
for the remaining part of this course we
will start with the agenda and then move
forward with the training content
here is the brief agenda we will start
with understanding the main types of
waste then talk about some additional
type of waste that people have
discovered we will conclude the lesson
with examples and a discussion in the
next slide we will go through the main
types of waste
earlier in the overview section we
covered at the high level different
types of waste during the development of
the Toyota Production system
Tachi Oh No and dr. shigeo shingo
identified seven distinct forms of waste
the main seven types of waste are waste
due to transportation excess inventory
motion for parts people somebody waiting
for another process to complete
overproduction unnecessary over
processing of the product and defects in
this subsection we'll cover in detail
each type of waste who will start with
waste due to transportation in the next
section
we can define waste due to
transportation as any movement that does
not add value it can be movement of
material supplies or resources now that
you know about this waste the next
question that probably will come to your
mind is how do you find this waste there
are some characteristics to look for in
this if you have extra cards for cliffs
or dollies you'll be spending effort
moving these from one place to another
having multiple storage locations might
appear to be a good idea but material
may move from receiving location to a
storage location from one storage
location to another or from a storage
location to the point of use before it
is finally consumed in production if
there is a complex inventory management
system you may find it difficult to
locate materials</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
