leader has to be able to get people
excited about what is the goal and what
I've seen is that that is really the
source of energy that basically the
leader is able to get his whole team
excited about what work is happening
that that percolates through the entire
team and there everybody is passionate
about what is being done and I think
being fair is something that's extremely
critical even if you are the most you
know prolific speaker or you can get
people really excited but if people
don't see fairness over a long period of
time the trust doesn't build up and that
really makes it very difficult for
people to you know continue to remain
passionate about and my mother it would
be more you know the most critical thing
that you know everybody should probably
follow those more than surprising
important things before reject things
and I think that's a mistake that a lot
of us made but I think that that's our
main mantra than they trying to follow
that the start of the day is always
about prioritizing what are the most
important things to be done to me and
then after that you come to urgent
things because there's there's always
you know long list of urgent things that
you have to do but if you do that and we
got the important ones it's just an
Austin couple of things that come to
mind which are very ridiculous I mean as
long as you are very excited about
learning something new it becomes easy
and if you approach it with a very
commonsensical and you know focus on
basics kind of an approach it gets easy
I think typically what holds people back
from running is too many concerns or
doubt around whether
I think what is most ridiculous to be
excited about learning something new and
created with the you know confident open
mind that you can move it
so one behave you have that managers
should definitely in mind is positive
state of mind and always making sure
that you know they have a state of mind
that they are doing what they are doing
because they want another you know
secrets to success of building a great
team and making sure that people respect
you as a leader is basically more around
now you know you have to get things done
you have to basically ask them to do
things because you believe in it and you
have the object to convince the road why
it should be done you cannot ask people
to do things because somebody else wants
and I think that's a bigger people
should just get out of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
