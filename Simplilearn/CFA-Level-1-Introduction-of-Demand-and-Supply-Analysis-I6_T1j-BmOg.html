and supply analysis volume one study
session three reading 13 economics
review hello candidate welcome to the
14th lesson of the simply learn cfa
level 1 tutorial the previous lesson was
the last lesson of the quantitative
methods module today we will start with
a new module economics this is the third
module and the weighting of this topic
on the exam is ten percent economics is
divided into three study sessions and we
will cover this module in nine lessons
the first lesson and topics of today's
discussion is demand and supply analysis
an introduction agenda our topic for
today is an introduction to demand and
supply analysis we will start with an
introduction of the topic in which you
will learn about the basic concepts and
factors of demand and supply then you
will learn about types of markets how
markets are formed and what factors
influence them in this lesson we will
also analyze the demand and supply curve
changes in markets versus movement along
the demand curve the supply function
changes in the supply function and the
supply curve aggregating the demand and
supply function market equilibrium
market mechanism auctions as a way to
find equilibrium price consumer surplus
producer surplus total surplus and
market interference lastly we'll discuss
demand elasticity under the topic we
will discuss own price elasticity and
the impact of elasticity of demand on
total expenditure in addition we will
also discuss income elasticity of demand
and a cross price elasticity of demand
as per the learning outcome statement
after completion of this lesson the
candidate should be able to distinguish
among types of markets explain the
principles of demand and supply
describe causes of shifts in and
movements along demand and supply curves
describe the process of aggregating
demand and supply curves including the
concept of equilibrium and mechanisms by
which markets achieve equilibrium
distinguish between stable and unstable
equilibria and identify instances of
such equilibria calculate and interpret
individual and aggregate inverse demand
and supply functions and individuals and
aggregate demand and supply curves
calculate and interpret the amount of
excess demand or excess supply
associated with a non equilibrium price
describe the types of auctions and
calculate the winning prices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
