course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project time
management let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define project time management
explain project schedule Gantt charts
and network diagrams identify the key
terms used in project time management
describe the project time management
processes explain various scheduled
network analysis techniques in the next
screen let us take a quick look at the
project management process map
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
in this lesson we will look at the third
knowledge area that is project time
management and it's processes let us
begin with the first topic of this
lesson project time management
the purpose of project time management
is to ensure that the projects get
completed on time this knowledge area is
primarily concerned with developing a
project schedule and ensuring that
project goes as per the agreed schedule
if there is a need to change the project
schedule the change should happen by
following a proper change control
procedure another term used in the CAPM
examination is schedule management plan
schedule management plan is part of the
project management plan and has
information on the planned project
schedule and its management and control
let us discuss the key activities of
projects time management in the next
screen
the key activities that are part of the
project time management include
identifying activities estimating time
and resources and sequencing activities
it is important to identify a list of
activities that would be a part of the
project next an estimation of time and
resources required for completing the
identified activities are done finally
these activities need to be sequenced as
per the dependencies in the next screen
let us discuss project schedule
project schedule represents the time
dimension of the project plan and has
information like when the project would
start when each of the project
activities would happen in what order
the project activities would happen when
project would be completed etc usually
software system is used to develop the
project schedule the project team can
enter the list of activities in the
software as well as their dependencies
and the software can produce the project
schedule as the output Microsoft Project
is the most popular tool used for
project schedule development generally
project schedule is considered similar
to project management plan project
management plan is different from
project schedule project management plan
not only has information about the
project schedule but also other
important project related plans like
risk management plan cost management
plan etc let us focus on Gantt chart in
the next screen
Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that
illustrates a project schedule it shows
the dependencies between the project
activities as well as their percent
completion a sample Gantt chart is shown
on the screen to summary elements of the
work breakdown structure are depicted to
complete those elements there are a
number of activities under them some of
these activities have dependencies for
example activity B and C have a
dependency activity C can start only
when activity B is completed the chart
gives you an idea about when specific
activities are planned to finish and
when the overall WBS element will get
delivered create tasks and work with the
Gantt chart this will make answering
Gantt chart based questions easy and fun
and the next screen let us understand
the relationships that exist among
project activities
network diagram is extensively used in
the project time management knowledge
area to plot the activity dependencies
this is a graphical representation of
the project activities in the form of a
network there are two ways to draw a
network diagram in precedence
diagramming model PDM or activity on
node Aon boxes represent activities and
the arrows indicate the dependency this
type of network can have all four types
of relationships between the activities
in arrow diagramming model a DM or
activity on arrow
AOA the arrows represent activities the
relationships and sequences can be
inferred from the direction of the
arrows and linkages between the
activities in such types of network only
finished to start relationships can be
shown such diagrams may need to make use
of dummy activities to indicate some
dependency between the activities there
may be questions in the CAPM exam based
on the network diagram so create and
work with the diagram this will make
answering network diagram based
questions easy and fun in the next
screen let us look at a network diagram
a sample network diagram is shown on the
screen
activities a and C can happen in
parallel B and D require both a and C to
complete whereas e requires both B and D
to complete activity on arrow network
diagram makes use of hammock activities
they are used to show a comprehensive
summary activity combining several other
activities underneath for control and
reporting purposes in the next screen
let us look at a few important terms in
time management
when a successor activity can start
before the predecessor activity can
complete it is considered lead for
example you can start preparing the test
environment two weeks before the
development activity finishes when the
successor activity has to wait for a few
days after the predecessor activity has
been completed it is considered lag for
example one needs to wait for two days
for the foundation to settle before work
on the pillars for the next floor starts
rolling wave planning is an iterative
planning technique in which the work to
be accomplished in the near term is
planned in detail while the work in the
future is planned at a higher level it
is a form of progressive elaboration in
the context of estimating techniques
analogous estimating is based on the
previous project data therefore if the
last five similar projects took six
months to complete the next one will
also take six months this technique
employs expert judgment another
estimating technique is parametric
estimating this technique uses a
mathematical model to calculate
projected time for an activity based on
the historical records from previous
projects and other information a few
common parameters are identified based
on the previous project data and that
parameter is used to predict the time
required to complete the next activity
or project for example you can normally
complete 10 kilometres of highway
construction lanes a week effort is the
total amount of work required to
complete the activity duration is the
amount of time it takes in terms of
elapsed or calendar days if you have an
activity that requires 10 people to work
for 5 days the total effort is 50 person
days but the duration is only 5 days in
the next screen let us look at the
project time management processes
there are seven project time management
processes they are planned schedule
management define activities sequence
activities estimate activity resources
estimate activity durations develop
schedule and control schedule the first
six processes are executed during the
planning process group the ultimate goal
of these planning processes is to
develop the project schedule the seventh
and the last process is a part of the
monitoring and controlling process group
in the next few screens
let us discuss these processes in detail
we will begin with planned schedule
management as defined in PMBOK guide
planned schedule management is the
process of establishing the policies
procedures and documentation for
planning developing managing executing
and controlling the project schedule it
belongs to the planning process group
let us look at the inputs to this
process the project management plan
provides other subsidiary plans and will
guide the scheduled planning activities
on the project the project Charter
provides an overall context and the
high-level product and project
description which might help determine
the approach for schedule management few
projects might have scheduling
constraint for example projects of
Olympics 2016 should be completed at the
same time enterprise environmental
factors provide the organizational
context to the project including the
culture of the organization the
infrastructure like scheduling systems
available key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base now let us look at the
tools and techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources experts can draw
from their previous experiences the
proper approach to govern the schedule
on a project meetings may be organized
to determine the schedule management
plan
anybody responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager sponsored customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the schedule
management plan
these may include different planning
approaches and philosophies such as
rolling wave planning or different
scheduling software that allowed to
build what-if scenarios and study the
effect of advanced scheduling techniques
like leveling fast tracking and crashing
now let us look at the outputs of this
process schedule management plan is a
component of the project management plan
that describes the criteria and
activities required to arrive at the
project schedule as well as how the
project may be baselined
monitored and controlled in the next
screen let us define activities process
define activities is the process of
identifying the specific actions to be
performed to produce the project
deliverables it belongs to the planning
process group the important input for
the define activities process is the
scope baseline scope baseline is a term
used collectively to refer to project
deliverables constraints and assumptions
of the project in addition to the scope
baseline the other inputs in this
process are Enterprise environmental
factors organizational process assets
and schedule management plan a reason
why enterprise environmental factors is
an input to define activities is because
the organization might be using project
management software to define activities
and that may influence the activity
definition process the knowledge base
containing historical information
regarding activities lists used by
previous similar projects is a good
example of organization process assets
applied to scheduling the tools and
techniques used in defining activities
are decomposition and rolling wave
planning the last technique is expert
judgment where the experience of project
team members is used in developing
detailed activity lists the output of
the process is activity list activity
attributes and milestone list activity
list contains a list of identified
activities activity attributes are the
additional information about the
activity itself a milestone is a
significant point or event in the
project a milestone list identifies all
the milestones and indicates whether the
milestone is mandatory or optional let
us move on to the next process sequence
activities
sequence activities is the process of
identifying on documenting relationships
among the project activities and is also
part of the planning process group for
every activity and milestone except the
first and last one is connected to or at
least one predecessor and one successor
the inputs to this process our activity
list activity attributes and milestone
list all these are the outputs of the
define activity process the other inputs
are schedule management plan and project
scope statement schedule management plan
provides guidance in terms of
methodology to be employed for many of
the scheduling activities on the project
organization process assets are also an
input to sequencing activities because
the organization might have some kind of
knowledge base for scheduling project
activities the enterprise environmental
factors relevant to this process may be
scheduling tools in use project
management information systems work
authorization systems etc one of the
important tools and techniques used in
sequencing activities is the precedence
diagramming method in this method the
activities are drawn on a network
diagram and all the different kinds of
dependencies between the activities are
determined while determining activity
dependency it is important to identify
the type of relationship or dependency
between the activities the other
technique is leads and lag which is
widely used for sequencing activities
the output of the process is the project
schedule network diagram which is a
graphical representation of the project
activities in a form of network which
also shows the activity dependencies
while designing the network diagram new
activities might be identified and that
would result in some of the project
document updates especially the ones
that list all the project activities in
the next screen let us look at the
estimate active
resources process
after sequencing the activities the next
step in project time management is
estimating the resources required to
accomplish each of the identified
activities estimate activity resources
process also belongs to the planning
process group here resources do not mean
only the human resources but includes
all other resources like equipment raw
materials machinery etc schedule
management plan is the first input
schedule management plan provides
guidance in terms of methodology to be
employed for many of the scheduling
activities on the project the other
inputs to this process are an activity
list and activity attributes that are
the outputs of the time management
processes risk register is another input
risks to the project may influence the
decisions about the resources that need
to be deployed hence risk register
becomes an input to this project
in addition activity cost estimates are
another input cost and resource
estimates on a project are interrelated
and influence each other for example the
cost might dictate the number and type
of resources that can be employed or the
time might dictate the cost that may
need to be incurred along with this the
resource calendar is also an important
input because it has the information
about the availability of each of the
resources some of the enterprise
environmental factors that can influence
estimating activity resources are
availability of required resources
within the organization the
organizational process assets is also an
import and input as the organization
might have standard policies for
staffing or for hiring contractors on
the project with all these inputs
available for estimating activity
resources there are various techniques
used for estimating the required
resources the first technique is using
expert judgment in this technique an
expert in resource plan
can estimate each of the activities the
next technique used is alternative
analysis in this the activities are
analyzed to identify different ways of
completing them this is to ensure only
the required resources are assigned to
each of the activities this helps in
resource optimization along with the two
techniques many organizations routinely
publish their estimating data and this
could be used in activity resource
estimation another technique that is
routinely used in activity estimation is
bottom up estimating which is
decomposing the activity further down to
understand it in more detail and
estimating at that level later all such
estimates are added to arrive at the
estimate of the activity in real
projects one has to use all the estimate
each of the activities sometimes the
project management software also helps
in estimating the software estimates are
based on the inputs provided to it
software should only be considered as a
supporting tool in estimation and never
fully rely on its output clearly the
output of this process is the activity
resource requirements along with this
resource breakdown structure is also
prepared the resource breakdown
structure is the categorization of all
the required resources and various
categories that is human resources
equipment raw materials etc in the
process of estimation several other
project documents may also be updated
for example the resource estimates are
directly correlated with cost estimates
let us now move on to the next process
estimate activity durations
the next process is to estimate the
duration required to complete each of
the activities the duration estimation
should be done by someone who is
familiar with the project for example
the same activity if done by a high
skilled resource would take less time
compared to a less skilled resource this
may vary regardless of the resource used
due to the project requirements in
addition the activity duration
estimation should be updated
continuously as you move ahead with the
project because as the project
progresses there will be more clarity on
the project the inputs of this process
are similar to the ones in sequence
activities process schedule management
plan is the first input schedule
management plan provides guidance in
terms of methodology to be employed for
many of the scheduling activities on the
project for instance it may contain
information about the estimation
techniques to be employed and the people
who need to be involved in the
estimation process activity resource
requirements is also an input to this
process because resources assigned to an
activity would significantly affect the
activity duration that is the lower
skilled resources would take more time
than the high skilled resources the
other inputs include activity list
activity attributes and resource
breakdown structure resource calendars
are also an input to this process the
type and skill set of resources
available to the team may have an impact
on the time it would take to complete
the activities risks to the project may
influence the decisions about the time
required to complete the activity hence
risk register becomes an input to this
process the project scope statement
defines the constraints and assumptions
affecting the project duration an
example of enterprise environmental
factor that can affect duration is
organizations productivity metrics which
is collected based on the experiences
from multiple projects the last input in
this process is organizational process
assets
now let us look at the tools and
techniques used for estimating activity
durations first is the expert judgment
which means using previous project
experiences and estimating the current
project duration this can be used with
other estimation techniques and used to
reconcile differences if different
techniques result in different estimates
3-point estimating is a method where
three estimates are used instead of one
it is part of a project management
philosophy known as program evaluation
and review technique pert estimating
activity durations is often done as a
team exercise as each activity may
require multiple skill sets to be
applied therefore it is important to use
group decision-making techniques to
arrive at a consensus or at least an
estimate that is acceptable to all the
team members Reserve analysis adds
buffer into the project schedule to deal
with any uncertainty the contingency
reserve may be added as a percentage of
the activity duration or fixed number of
work periods the other tools and
techniques are analogous estimating and
parametric estimating the outputs of
this process are the activity duration
estimates and project documents updates
the activity duration estimates is
represented in terms of the range of
possible results for example 10 days
plus minus 2 days that is the activity
would take minimum eight days and
maximum 12 days in the next screen let
us look into a business scenario to
understand this concept better after
reading the problem statement click the
solution button to look at a possible
answer
develop schedule is the process of
analyzing activity sequences durations
resource requirements and schedule
constraints to create the project
schedule it belongs to the planning
process group generally scheduling
software is used for developing the
project schedule entering the activities
durations and resources into a
scheduling tool generates a schedule
with planned dates for completing
project activities developing a project
schedule is an iterative process
revising and maintaining a realistic
schedule is a task in itself and it
continues throughout the project as the
work progresses the most of the inputs
of this process are the outputs of
estimate activity durations process they
are risk register project scope
statement projects staff assignments
resources calendars organizational
process assets enterprise environmental
factors schedule management plan
activity list activity attributes
project schedule network diagrams
activity resource requirements resource
breakdown structure and activity
duration estimates various tools and
techniques are used to develop scheduled
process schedule network analysis is a
technique that generates project
schedule it employs various analytical
techniques such as critical path method
critical chain method modeling
techniques and resource optimization
techniques to create the project
schedule the other tools and techniques
include leads and lags schedule
compression and scheduling tool let us
now look at the outputs of this process
the project schedule consists of a
minimum plan start date and planned
finish date for each activity although
project schedule can be represented in
tabular format it is more often
represented graphically using either bar
charts or network diagrams or a
combination of the two the final
schedule which is the output of the
devel
schedule process is also called
scheduled baseline once the schedule is
baselined
it can be changed only through formal
approvals meeting the scheduled baseline
is one of the measures of project
success scheduled data produced may
include number of resources key
milestones etc project calendars specify
the available working days and the
number of shifts in each day it
indicates how many hours and days are
available for the work of the project to
be completed project management plan
updates are a result of the develop
scheduled process many of the other
subsidiary plans of the project plan may
get impacted which may include cost
management plan scope management plan
risk management plan etc this may also
result in other project documents being
updated in the next few screens
let us discuss schedule network analysis
techniques
it is essential to know if the required
resources are available at that time
along with the time estimate of each of
the activities since schedule is
calendar based it helps in estimating
the same schedule network analysis
technique generates project schedule
there are various scheduled Network
techniques critical path method relies
on determining the critical path on a
project schedule critical chain method
is a variant of the critical path method
wherein the critical chain is determined
based on the logical resource and other
kinds of dependencies between the
activities what-if scenario analysis is
about trying to vary a certain parameter
to observe the impact on the schedule
for instance you may want to check
result if you put in more resources on a
particular activity to reduce its
duration resource optimization
techniques try to arrive at the optimal
utilization of the resources used on a
project ideally you would want the
resources to be fully utilized but you
would also want to build in sufficient
buffers in case a certain resource is
not available due to various reasons in
the next screen let us look at the
program evaluation and review technique
program evaluation and review technique
is based on three point estimates for an
activity the pessimistic estimate refers
to the worst case scenario whereas most
likely estimate is what you expect to
happen in a realistic scenario the
optimistic estimate on the other hand
represents the amount of time and
activity would take in the best-case
scenario based on these three estimates
the expected duration of the estimate is
calculated as per the formula given on
the screen the formula for calculating
standard deviation of an activity and
variance of an activity is also given
there is no question asked on variance
but the formula is important because if
the standard deviation of the whole
project is to be calculated the process
is to calculate the variance of the
whole project
then take its square root to calculate
the standard deviation of the project
concept based questions on pert can be
expected in the CAPM exam so make a note
of the formula while you prepare for the
exam in the next screen let us
understand pert with an example let us
now figure out how we can apply the
3-point estimation that pert uses in
order to draw some useful conclusions
assume that the optimistic pessimistic
and most likely estimates are 20 70 and
30 respectively using these values you
can determine the expected duration and
the standard deviation as indicated
now if the causes of variation are
random you can assume that the actual
values would be evenly distributed about
the mean and will follow the normal
distribution sometimes referred to as
the bell curve further you can use the
properties of the normal distribution
there is a 68% probability of the actual
value falling within first Sigma from
the mean ninety-five point four percent
probability for the second Sigma and
ninety-nine point seven percent
probability of the actual value falling
within third Sigma extending this logic
the notion of Six Sigma is reaching a
level of confidence that only three
point four times out of a million would
the actual value fall outside the stated
range pert allows you to plan based on
the intended level of confidence in the
outcome and determine buffers
accordingly let us discuss the critical
path method in the next screen
critical path is defined as the longest
duration path through a network diagram
which determines the shortest time to
complete the project float can be
considered as a buffer time available to
complete and activity Fotis calculated
once the network diagram is ready it is
also called as slack there are three
kinds of float the first being the total
float which is the amount of time and
activity can be delayed without delaying
the project and date or an intermediary
milestone the second type of float is
free float which is the amount of time
an activity can be delayed without
delaying the early start date of its
successor or successors activities the
last type is independent float which is
the amount of time and activity can be
delayed if all the predecessors finish
at their latest finish dates and you
want to start all the immediate
successors at their earliest start dates
the slack of the activities on the
critical path is 0 because there is no
scope to delay activities on the
critical path critical path actually
represents the project duration delaying
activities on the critical path is as
good as delaying the project duration
concept based questions on critical path
can be expected in the exam so it is
essential to have a clear understanding
of the concept in the next screen let us
learn how to calculate float
float of an activity can be calculated
by two methods however the first step in
critical path method is to identify the
critical path of the network once the
critical path is identified follow the
forward pass to find early start and
early finish for each activity the float
of the activities on the critical path
is zero so they represent the overall
project duration use forward pass or
backward pass to calculate the total
activity time calculate late finish and
late start using backward pass method
note the total float formula before you
start for the exam in the next screen
let us look at forward pass and backward
pass methods in detail
in forward pass you can either go
through the network starting with time
zero and keep calculating the time
required to complete each of the
activities until you reach the last
activity of the project the starting
time for each of the activity in this
approach is called
early start and the end time for each
activity is called the early finish
alternatively in backward pass you can
travel through the network from the
project end date and calculate the time
required to complete each activity the
end date in this approach is called the
late finish and the start date of the
activity in this approach is called
the late start the float of the activity
is either the difference between the
late start and early start or the
difference between the late finish and
early finish both the differences work
out to be the same before the start of
the CAPM exam please make a note of the
total float formula let us understand
the critical path calculation with an
example in the next screen
let us look at an example for critical
path there are five activities in this
project and two paths in the network
diagram start 1 2 4 5 end is one path
and start 1 3 5 end is the second path
since the duration of the path start 1 2
4 5 end is 18 days which is more than
the duration of the path start 1 3 5 and
the critical path of the project is
start 1 2 4 5 end let us take activity 3
as an example first calculate the early
start and early finish dates activity 3
can start only after activity 1 since
the early finish of activity 1 is 3 it
becomes the early start of activity 3
activity 3 cannot start earlier than 3
because activity 1 can be completed only
by then
therefore early start of activity 3 is 3
since the duration of the activity is 4
days the early finish of activity 3 is 3
plus 4 equals 7 days now let us
calculate the late start and late finish
of activity 3 late start of activity 5
is 14 days the activity 3 happens just
before activity 5 so the late finish of
activity 3 is 14 days to calculate the
late start you can subtract the duration
from late finish
therefore the late start of activity 3
is 14 minus 4 equals 10 in the next
screen let us focus on schedule
compression
look at the four activities in the table
the normal cost of executing each of the
activities as well as how much each of
the activities can be crashed is also
provided which activity would you crash
to reduce the project time by one day
activity a will be crashed if the
duration of the project is reduced by
one day as the per unit cost of crashing
the activity a is the least all the
activities are assumed to be on the
critical path here while crashing if you
end up saving time on a path which is
not the critical path you will not end
up saving time on the project in the
next screen let us look into the impact
of schedule compression different
schedule compression techniques have
different impact on the project the
impact of fast-track leads to risk
additions and increase in management
time for the project manager crash leads
to cost addition and increase in
management time for the project manager
reduce scope on the other hand saves
cost and resources but increases
customer dissatisfaction likewise cut
quality saves cost and resources but
increases risk resource reallocation
does not add cost or increase risk in
the next screen let us look into the
other techniques used in scheduling
there are several techniques that are
used in scheduling projects what-if
scenario analysis in this technique
questions like what if a particular dish
order schedule are put forth to
understand the impact of specific
changes on the schedule the goal is to
produce a realistic schedule Monte Carlo
analysis in this method a computer
simulates the outcomes of a project
making use of randomly generated values
that map the probability distribution of
the input variables together these two
techniques are called modeling
techniques resource optimization
techniques these are also used to
produce a resource limited schedule
resource optimization results in more
stable number of resources used in the
project critical chain method this
technique develops the project schedule
that takes into account both the
activity and resource dependencies in
the next screen let us look at the last
process and project time management
control schedule
control schedule is concerned with
determining the status of the project
schedule determining that the project
schedule has changed and managing the
actual changes as they occur the project
schedule is an important input to this
process it is the actual schedule that
needs to be controlled scheduled data
contains information related to the
schedule that may need to be monitored
in order to take actions to bring the
project back on schedule project
calendar describes the working hours and
days for the project work performance
data has information like which
activities have started their progress
and which activities have finished the
other inputs of this process our project
management plan and organizational
process assets the key tools and
techniques of this process are the
performance reviews performance review
is measuring comparing and analyzing
scheduled performance such as actual
start and finish dates percent complete
and remaining duration for work in
progress the other tools and techniques
include resource optimization techniques
modeling techniques schedule compression
leads and lags scheduling tool and
project management software in
development schedule process these
techniques are used for the first time
to develop the project schedule whereas
in control schedule process these
techniques are used to update the
project schedule the key output of the
control schedule process is the work
performance information this is
