with Cellini so guys in UI automation
these are the tools which are very
popular in the market
selenium HP qtp this is on ufp happy
ampere mobile lab automation whitney's
yes plan test complete tasks are those
guys coming up really very great these
days for a node X then or Exorcist
implemented selenium itself ok still
test what is so limitations like Ruby
you have to use rational functional
tests so what is so there are many
automation tools in the market today
okay like who she depends which one is
popular it is always depends on that so
we will be seeing the two most popular
tools the difference between two most
popular tools in this world that is
selenium and thinking one is cookies
these are the two moves popular
automation in the market and we see the
difference between both engine yes in
Chinese so I have worked on retainer X
which is a paid but it is not highly
expensive I have worked on appium this
is a free tool now and qtp it's a paid
tool selenium it is a free tool again
this complete yes it costs a bit talk
skies again it is costing a bit what
there is again a open source I don't
know about safest this plant with ease
and so artists not sure about Easton
whether they are chargeable
or not racial functional this is from
IBM's that's also paid to okay here we
go
so this is the comparison between gdb
and selenium but is record and playback
selenium can do the recording and
playback it if we can also knew of
course
ease of execution with selenium you can
easily exclusivity P also you can do
language supports selenium can automate
selenium
can use multiple language you can use a
language whichever you are comfortable
with you can pick Java see chef PHP Perl
Python Ruby etc but we are working with
Java as of now with UDP you have to work
you have to use VB script browser
support it can automate almost every
browser with gdb you can automate three
browsers that is ie Chrome and Firefox
Chrome is not mentioned here
environments are poop selenium is about
in Java it's open source tool it can
it's an API so it can run on any
operating system any we are Java
supported qtp can only run on only on
Windows support for various applications
so selenium can only automate them but
qtd can automate desktop as well as them
selenium integration with ALM it's
partial with pyramids also partial and
people have moved out from ALM that's
what I have seen if you are not aware
what LM means LM is a test management
tool cost it is free with qtp it's
license and annual maintenance fees
obvious QC QC is 20 Center it is a you
know it's an older version of LM ok and
this to me says is there any add-on or
API that can be integrated with selenium
to this desktop application so me for
desktop application we will be going to
see hot YT that's what we will be going
to see and we will be seeing that how we
can automate dekstop tasks and can
integrate it with selenium but there is
API is coming actually ok I have I
cannot recall the name of those API
expert yes there are certain API is
which are not from selenium itself which
are from third-party source and those
API is can be used on two main decks of
applications as well but auto IT is the
one which is most famous as of now other
a
is not much famous that's why I'm not
harder which I could not recall them but
there are other API is as well
Anjali ALM and testlink booth are
different test management booth I hope
testing is a differentiation ability yes
but same category correct so both are
the same category and today a new plugin
or I would say integration has come up
or Zephyr with JIRA so in Zephyr you
know using Zephyr we manage our test
cases and using JIRA V in log artists
pieces and that's how we use only one
tool that is called as zero so people
are coming out from LM that's what I
have seen now okay okay so what do you
think what is the benefit of 50 P which
is not there with selenium you can go
through with this and tell me your
opinion that I of course here we talked
about selenium benefits who work ute but
wanting to know what is the benefit of
qtp over Shalini
it's for everyone so very important sir
okay everyone said can automate next up
application okay what about other any
other benefit apart from fixture bars
PST you can do that with selenium is
will Anjali object repository correct is
reporting absolutely correct so what
happens guys in object repository
correct Abby okay so case what happens
here in object repository those who are
not aware about this object repository
what object repository is let me tell
you about that when you go to Google you
have to automate this absolutely
important points are shared by Vivek
that is technical support okay so so
here if you have to work with Google and
what you need to do is really to company
and you need to write something in this
chat box and then you have to click on
this button all the button text boxes
logo everything what we seen on the web
pages all day
as web element scroll - web element so
what we do we locate these elements we
locate these elements if we want to
populate them we have to locate them
that where these particular text box
displays in this complete page where
this button is placed in the something
page and that's what we need to do and
when we locate them we get some path we
get some I would say far or I can say
some value etc and that's what we need
to manage we need to maintain have to
place it somewhere so for that we need
in object repository and place there
that for google search this is the fuck
for a Google search button this is the
path so that's what we need to maintain
okay but with qtp it maintains
automatically that's what I can take it
up push second test report so - TP can
automatically generate the extra food
okay you automate things and it will
generated but selenium can give you much
better reports compared to you much much
better because there are many you know
open source libraries reporting
libraries which you can use with
selenium and in creative provoking
report but with QT be there is no
external integration allow for the
reporting purpose and that's where it
lacks technical support of course you
are paying two HD or the qtp license and
no you have to pay every year for the
one user license which means relations
in Sitka alright
and whenever you have any queries you
can raise it and they will supply you
back within 24 hours with selenium it's
an open ocean there is no technical
support that it lacks and you have to
rely on Stack Overflow Stack Overflow or
you know for simply non forum on your
trainers or your seniors you have to
depend all you have to rely on them
always but this is my observation but
you know technical support replies you
in 24 arcs and also the time what I have
seen is the query gets resolved
on who feed it is this is what I have
observed minimum two to three days I am
talking about it can take maximum to any
any rain this is what I have seen in
case of rain rixton you don't get the
reply of what you want within in the
first coat so that's what I have faced
but as I mentioned in selenium of the
lab facilities so they are most of the
time you will get the answer of weekly
mostly I will say 99% of the cases you
will get the reply but up in case you
don't get it and you push it to tools
you know four to five forums you may get
the reply very easily and within 24
hours should we get the reply because
there are lot of professionals put a in
the market using selenium so you don't
need to worry for motor purposes this is
my observation that whenever I have any
query I will search for that and I get
it always because she will not get the
exact good
what you are looking for but yes you
will get a hint and you can create a
code yourself you will get the logic you
can create it okay so show me see is
what is Italy so this explaining it once
again yes away so we create object
repository ourself we decide that where
they want to manage all our objects all
our weather elements where do we want to
manage them so sometimes some people
manage them in the pages itself some
people manage them in properties files
some people manage them in Excel sheets
different different frameworks different
different design patterns different
architecture of frameworks decides where
you want to maintain your objects so
what is object repository object ability
is the place where you store all navarre
web elements or you can say objects all
these objects weird in stove that so you
can store it in an excel sheet you store
them in java classes you store them in
properties file as well this is my
experience I have seen maintaining
things and all these three pieces some
people also maintain them in you know
XML and JSON okay clear to me what is
object repository
