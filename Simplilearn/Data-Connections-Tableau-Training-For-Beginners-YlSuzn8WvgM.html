data now in this particular topic we are
at the end of this lesson you will be
able to understand how you can connect
to tableau data server you will be able
to differentiate between a join and
blend how can you perform a join on a
data how can you blend our data we will
discuss the various connection options
available we will understand how tableau
server works in terms of the Kerberos
authentication all right or we will
understand various performance
optimization techniques as well shadow
extra extract as well as different
methods that we can prepare in terms of
the data that we want to analyze all
right so let me begin now the very first
topic which is connecting to tableau
server so I am going to force take you
through a couple of vegetation slides
here and then quickly move on to the
environment where we will actually then
start exploding so topic so now when you
want to connect your data source in
tableau server is pretty simple you can
connect to a flat file in your local
machine so one is you will click on to
the server in the Start screen
and or you can specify this so burning
you can specify and show your login your
door credentials the username and
password and based on that you can
perform the you can have your connection
to the database all right so that's how
you can connect to the table sugar as
well right so that's the very source
basic so see tableau administrator is
the one who assigns the roles and
creates these data sources all right and
you
Tabou has the facilities in order to
import different forms of data for the
analysis for your team and once you
connected to the tableau server then you
need to select state Arkansas or data
source on the data menu you will need to
select the data source to download or
locally file a local copy you can select
and create a roofless copy and then you
can also duplicate a duplicate of that
till the source will be added up into
your data window so that's how you can
connect to tableau server as well
alright and the it basically for both
various features wherein you can then
connect to the tableau server for your
data so you are in this example you can
see that you're able to connect to the
tableau server as an admin and connect
to the sample super-soul and it's
downloads it creates a local copy and
duplicate all the data in that
particular data win that's how we can
see the example superstore and you can
connect to the server or next we are
going to also understand what is joining
and blending so before I move on to the
presentation slides here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to move on to the
environment directly let us start
exploring these blending and joining
features or right there in alright I'm
going to simply just clear all these
sheets that we you have and let's go
back to the connect to data source
window all right now in terms of for
your if this is where you are able to
connect you can see the tableau server
so it's through this logo that you can
connect whether you can specify your
server credentials and you can click on
connect and based on that that's how
then you can provide the credentials and
login all right now I do not have a
software connection there and I can show
that example but this is how you can
click on any of these solar you would
have to type in the URL click on
connection and provide the user names
and
provided and that's how you can connect
to your data source using or server
options all right I'm going to show you
the file option where you can connect to
an excel and let us discuss the join and
the blending pasture right let me click
on itself we have the example Super's
data Sawyer and in this when i couldent
order alright i pulled in before shape
so there are three sheets in that
particular excel file when we pull in
order this is how you can identify that
whatever are these are the head node
names these are the dimensions and
measures that's how is getting
identified you can notice all the
dimensions of first place you have all
your measurements you are able to
identify the data type and the role on
ABC which is a contextual value or
numeric value that means with the
dimension with a pound sign
what kind of for data role is
established automatically identifying
each of these rows as well
all right even in the metadata that's
how you can see the field names the
field or name that you want to see onto
your face onto our your view and the
tables from which it's going to be
getting pulled in from in this you can
rename in case you want to change the
particular name hided or alias it or
describe it alright so this is how you
connect now connections is where you
have the option to connect between knife
and extract now if you connect to lies
that is connected to this particular
sheet light that means any update
happening on to yours or sheets any kind
of updates on the sheet there is the
nice connection it will automatically
update your views as well onto your
sheets that you're creating and in case
if you select on an extract all right
this is what it means that it allows or
what it does is impose that data into
the tab new data engine sports in the
data engine that is so to perform this
query it is created
an extract and based on these we can get
start using reconnection all right so
what it does is it disconnects it's more
like a small extract more than cube if
you understand it in that and I know
tableau creates an extract of that file
providing you or disconnected or whether
it allows you to give you a better
performance or better query that's how
you can then go on and start creating
and working on these extract so you can
refresh these as our extracts at a fancy
manner as well so that is what a few
extracts of it extracted as a copy of
the data and saves it in the engine and
that's how there's the performance as
well gets better in terms of using where
you can connect to your particular data
all right so you can work with multiple
data sources data sources can be of any
type all right wherein you can edit from
the number of lists that you can see it
can be your flat file or server file as
we saw or the save one and we can also
then join multiple tables within the
data or we can also blend when it's
coming in from different data sources
then we can also perform a blending so
let me for show you an option for join
now you can see we have the order table
know when I'm drag and drop the people
or sheet as well job you can see that
tableau has automatically created or
joined alright it has automatically
created a joint when we have folded two
tables coming in from the sheet and by
default all right we have the inner join
that's a blue piece so it creates a
inner join your where is again you can
then click on the join option here and
you can specify and modify the join
based on whether you want it as an inner
join which is a default you want or less
joint now if you see the right join has
been disabled you're okay I will show
these options here by default we right
joint is disabled by tableau by default
by default and to enable that you will
have to you know connect
your excel sheet in our different manner
I will show that your shorty so that's
how you can change and you can perform
your join this is where you can explore
and show rejoin cloth and your again
then you can specify like you can see a
joint that's being created amongst the
data source which is region and region
peoples among these two data is also
showing you the join and whether it is
equal to or not equal to
alright you can connect to multiple
tables and your based on that you can
add in your tables you can specify the
different joint and based on that and
when you click on sheet or you will then
be able to see that there is a joint
being perform there are two tables now
the people's table also that has been
added in and it has now performed an
inner join on our data and you can start
using this particular option so let's
say I am going to pull in the region on
my columns and I am going to have my
sales on to my voice it's now providing
me details of my stage at a regional
basis now let's say I also want to
analyze the people belonging to these
regions depending on the color so it's
going to change the columns based on the
central east south and west
alright that's how these are are the
people the number of people belonging to
each region that it has identified so
that's how it is taken up the region
people as you saw there was a joint that
was created and it's giving us that
particular option and based on that you
can see or we just have or this
particular data soldier and that's how
you can see now I'm used in earlier as
well if you remember we had pulled in
one particular table hence the blue tick
mark sign your enables and shows us that
this is the primary data that the user
this comes in picture when you're using
a particular join so let me right now
just use this particular job detail your
and we're not going to require this
alright so let's just close this we just
need one right now because we're
discussing on
I'm going to show you the blending part
we do right now we're discussing on
showing so that's how you can join in
your data sources and you can combine
multiple fields using this joint so when
you have when you have multiple tables
you can simply connect to the data let
me go back to the data source pane or
this is a sort of deep-sea data source
page and you can see the joins that's
being performed now let's say you want
to create a joint that you want to force
due to certain situations and scenario
where you want to force or right outer
join or right or right join or for that
matter you want to write a custom
sequence now you're not able to write a
sequel right you're in the in the drag
area of anyway you can drag and drop
your sheets from the excel file or any
kind of a file that you connected to for
that and to enable the right join you
will need to connect to your data in a
specific manner so let me open up a new
instance of tableau here
and let me show that you as to how we
can enable the right choice and how we
can have our custom sequence as well so
in case if you want to write in our
custom sequel all of you then how can we
perform that initial custom sequel all
right okay so let us connect to our data
here and I'm going to take you on to the
excel file now when I click on these
samples superstore here okay what we are
done is we clicked on open and that's
how we opened up the file alright and
that's how we could see the sheets now
instead of using the open option
directly what I'm going to do is in the
drop-down right here instead of open we
have an option that has opened with a
legacy connection all right this is what
is going to enable us to write a custom
sequel where we can specify a query
rather than using the entire data source
or pulling in the entire table so we're
clicking on this second
chill in the drop-down in the open tab
yo you will be able to see the open with
legacy connection I am going to ensure
that you've selected that and that's how
you will then connect to in the data
source and with that you now have a new
custom sequel option that's opened up
for you
this is where you can once you've
connected you can double click on the
new custom sequels and you can write in
your query you can write in the sequel
where you want to perform the query and
pull in your data all right you can have
your select from and let's see orders
so that's how you can perform and you
can write it a custom sequel and you can
pull it the required data you can or
have your required table that you can
put in in terms of or creating the
sequence that you want to pull it or and
have your data alright so you can have
your selects from the orders and preview
the result so your you can see the
orders table has nine thousand nine four
row we have a preview of the data
available in that particular sheet that
we pulled in alright and we can now
parameters is whatever to cover when we
come out to that particular topic so I'm
going to leave this for now so that's
how you can write your custom sequel and
you can click on OK and that's going to
pull in your entire data and as you can
see now instead in the earlier view I'm
going to just switch to the earlier
instance of tableau you could see that
you could see the name of the table that
I dragged and put in you could see the
name order but in case when we write a
custom sequel then it gives us the name
which is written as custom sequence very
alright and this is where you can get
the information you can edit the query
in case you want to change to desires
and requirement so that's how instead of
clicking on open you click on open
legacy connection and you can have your
own custom shape we define now a love
with this all right when you open and
when you click on a legacy connection
when I drag in the people's table here
you can see that even the option for
right joint have now been enabled so by
default tableau disables the option for
right joint and in case in certain
situations and circumstances you want
the right joint to be enabled you will
in the same manner have to import and or
connect to your data using a legacy
connection and you will have these right
joint which is going to be enabled every
one so you can have your custom sequence
or the right joint in that case which
get a label that you can use a custom
sequence or a right join right so that
was custom sequel then joining is
as I mentioned identify and choose
between the proposals and the flaws that
you want to add in right now let me show
you an example of blending as well so
I'm again going to open a new instance
of tableau all right and with that I'm
going to show you the example of
blending so let's see you have you want
to join it and when is the best time
well is the best way that you should use
now joining is when you have all your
multiple tables that you want to join
coming in from one data source blending
would be required when you want to join
in multiple tables coming in from
different data sources all for that
matter you can also blend even though
the tables are coming in from a single
data source there might be instances
that you might want to have till
performer blend in filler for join so
let me show that option to you all right
so let me connect to the data let's
connect to excel fill in our sample
superstore file that we have we have the
order table all right and I'm going to
go on to this sheet short all right so
we have one order we have one data which
is the order tables now I am going to
again click on add or new data source
coming in from the same excel file and
this time I'm going to have these
people's tables and move to the sheet so
now if you notice we can see - or data
set show which is one for the orders and
one for people good and enjoyed now this
is where the blending will will take
place this is where you will have a
blend automatically when you pull in
your view there is a common view that
comes into picture now let's say I am
going to first pull in the order date on
to the column all right and as soon as I
pull in you can see that my order table
has now got a blue checkmark which is
become a primary data for all right and
now let me pull in space onto my rules
and from people let me have from the
people table let
have region filled in and added to the
color so region has become a secondary
dataset and now you can see of blend
signs right a linking or data blending
that is automatically being performed on
both these two data sets all right that
we have the order table and the people
table blue team primary and people are
which is being or secondary in this case
alright so that's how you can mention
now in terms of blending what happens is
you cannot specify the joint or in this
case there is a primary and secondary
data and it is automatically blending in
the data for you it is automatically
pulling in the data you will not be able
to your select on the kind of join you
will not be able to manipulate the joy
so that's not even though at times you
have the same tables that are coming in
as I mentioned there are times where you
might want to perform and change the
join so that when you can use the
joining table option that comes into
picture so that's the difference between
your blending and between joining the
tables right so you can see this
available think and you can see how it
was simple to drag a particular view and
pulling data and your as well region has
been added to the color fill because of
which the legends have been created
identifying all four regions present in
the data
and it's also letting us know here in
the March this region is coming in from
the secondary tables you can see the
orange amber tick mark Y and that's how
you can identify that region is coming
in from the secondary table that's been
created all right in terms of saw
connecting as well wherein you can
combine and how have to join or enable
now depending on the kind of data all
right going back to the data source
depending on the kind of tables and the
kind of data that we have that's when we
can enable and half
a joint that we can decide on all right
so one is you would require and need to
have a multiple or negative connection
with which you can get define these
right outer join alright and that's how
you can proceed and have additional
joints that you can go on we also
discussed how we could create and
connect to a custom see quick very
alright and that is how we could using
the legacy connection also enable the
right outer join there is we could then
perform or right join on a tables as
well alright and in case if it's a query
then it gives in the wave of the very
odd or as a custom query where which is
what we saw on do these review and the
extract payable right now in terms of
extract all right now extracts are
basically your save subsets of the data
force which will help you in improving
the performance so instead of as I
mentioned instead of being connected to
a life connection it is better that we
select an extract which creates a subset
and sources is the tableau engine
wherein it performs the queries and it
takes advantage of this functionality
where it is not connected to the
original data source and with this it
can actually reduce the total amount of
data in terms of defining and limiting
it so that's how you can create an
extract and let's say or once you've
created an extract you can then perform
like I said you happy edit option where
you can edit the additional detailing
you can allow an incremental fetch
happening where then you can refresh the
data each time or your data the data you
can provide an information set so this
can help you in improving your
performance you can take advantage of
the functionality in terms of the data
source for your using the discounts or
the listing counts as well and moreover
it's more like an offline mode you're
actually accessing your data as a
offline access where it's not directly
connected and you are able to use it
like a data or local data right so that
is the difference between a life and an
extract that's how you can make use of
the legacy connections as well so let's
go back to the presentation slides and
have a recap now these are the joining
tables that's what we discussed that in
terms of the tables that we have we can
join our table and you have various
showings available where it makes it
easy for us to analyze the data that we
want to review we can joy two or
multiple tables and based on that we can
customize the energy let's see right
over the full outer join now the full
outer join also depends on the kind of
data source that you connected to all
right so in case of an excel file we
still do not have the right outer join
option which is enabled
so this possible option again when you
open to the legacy depending on the data
type is how you would have the right
outer join that you can force and have
it enabled so this would be depending on
the kind of data source file also that
you have and you have these four join
types that you can use in terms of
joining tables in Yahoo now when would
you want to use a joint right so our
scenario is that you have a sales
manager of an online shopping website
and you want to analyze the customers
who have returned at least half the
number of orders that they have left now
to fulfill this requirement you will
require a worksheet where if you can
join the orders and the return table on
a particular format dimension alright so
that's how then we can create a join we
can change this between the inner b4 to
a left join between the order tables and
the return tables and based on that we
then get to know the customers who have
returned at least half the number of
orders that were placed right now in
terms of enabling on right outer join or
this is taken care of by the Microsoft
jet data engine driver so in case if you
are not facing of troubles where you're
not able to connect and see that
particular option is doing an error this
legacy connection options comes in only
when you're using a Microsoft pepper jet
data engine driver this is easily
available in case if you do not have it
you can install this driver and with
this it will enable the right outer join
and the custom pre-filter all right to
enable the right auto join your that's
how you open it with a particular or
legacy connection now in terms of a
right outer join this one example we can
force and you will - right outer join we
can select on a new custom sequel where
we can type in and have our custom or
sequel generated and that's how we can
work on with the sequel where we can
provide the sequel Sinta and based on
that the datasource will then be
generated now in terms of blending this
is what happens when you have multiple
data sources in your view or when you
want to establish a link between them or
you want to blend your data or it does
not create a row level joint so in case
saw like the example that we did also
axis coming it's on the same sheet from
the same excel file but we did not want
to create a row level joint then that's
when data planning would come in handy
you can use it with the related data
across multiple sources that you want to
analyze in one particular view so that's
how you can blend your data which
creates a primary and a secondary data
so we saw that in this example or you
can see that in other
segment department and some of tails
where if the bars are being created
which are coming in from designer from
the primary connection but in terms of
the sales plan all right
these sales line are coming in from a
secondary data you can see the amber
connection your the amber I know that is
allowing you to understand and segregate
and differentiate that it is a secondary
connection so in value or that's how you
can identify as you saw that your
primary source and you have a secondary
source where you can identify in
distinguish you can distinguish between
the comments fields that are present in
your data and you can establish a
connection in case if it is not
established unlink you saw that there
was an automatic link then you can
provide a link autumn are by explicitly
defining a link as well let me take you
back to the environment all right so
this was the custom sequence now in this
case in cases there is no name provided
then you can provide a particular link
on to your view you can have the option
if it has not enabled then you can
select your particular you can see that
it has not or implicitly defined but
it's giving you an option that there is
possibility of linking you can
explicitly define you can click on this
link and use person as a linking field
and this is also linked in your data
which the previous data that you have
alright so that's how you can define an
explicitly mentioned or the way that you
can play your data and you can identify
another way it can also be varied you
can edit the connection in the mapping
and that's where you can perform she can
go back your data sources and you can
explicitly define you can identify
whether these four stores are the mean
weather or the road sure are
automatically generating a field or not
alright so that's how you can have these
two tables and you can
find the blending whether you want it or
not you can disable the linking as well
in case you don't want to perform or
particularly so with coming to that now
let us understand our oddity that's our
speed difference between the joins and
blends and where you can use it so let's
all have a recap again know in terms of
joining or joining is a sequel storm
that is combining two data sources
coming in from a single data source
while in terms of blending it's more
about combining two different data
sources into one single sheet all right
our joining is done once at the data
source and this can be used for every
worksheet while blending will be done
individually for every worksheet okay
and both the tables that are joined must
must exist in the sequel database while
in blending it helps us combine the
database which is coming in from
different sources different location and
in case this is a multi-dimensional so
HIPAA secure then you cannot perform a
joint and in terms of blending you have
a primary force and but in terms of a
primary source it cannot be a few but
your secondary source can definitely be
of cubes that you can use in terms of to
forming a blend alright so that's how
you can optimize your connections you
can select whether you want to have
perform of blend on your connections you
want to perform a join depending on the
kind of connections that you have and
that's how you can work with them with
the different data social that you have
available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
