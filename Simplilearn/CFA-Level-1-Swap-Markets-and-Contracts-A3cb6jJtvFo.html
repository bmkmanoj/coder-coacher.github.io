a swap contract is initiated usually
without any payment being exchanged that
is the initial value of the swap is zero
in a swap payments are exchanged between
the parties based on a notional
principal that is not necessarily
exchanged and initiation for example one
party agrees to pay payments based on
the domestic interest rate on a notional
principal which can be fixed or floating
in domestic currency while the other
party agrees to pay at a rate that can
be fixed or floating in another currency
the series of payments are exchanged
periodically the period between the
payments is called the settlement period
and the day on which settlement is made
is called the settlement day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
