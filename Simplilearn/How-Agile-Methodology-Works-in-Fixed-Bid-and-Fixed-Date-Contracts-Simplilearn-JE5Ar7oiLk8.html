you for your cooperation
all right you can feel the blood running
- yes sir
don't lose your eyes
focus on your breathing
Oh
onion reading
maybe friends
maybe
all right
until against the gravitational force we
made that happen
Thrun exercise at the same time for the
brain to focus it has to be clear of all
the clutter that we have traffic make
our connecticut all right what is the
next thing that I have to do
how was the last session I still have
these questions unanswered
blah blah blah uncluttered let's focus
and go back onto our topic fair enough
please please show thumbs up if you are
good then show thumbs up all right
if you are not good and this is more of
a discussion session everyone here a lot
of them are seniors by the way and you
you guys already a whole lot someone
just said I know I judge I know strum we
are already doing it most of us have all
I knew is doing it yeah so let's let's
have a discussion around contracts and I
deal in contracts all right
so again
analysis poor design design test even if
your testing is not design testing
continues when does it go in markets
after every Lucien it goes in market it
is a potentially shippable product mean
that it actually gets shipped fair
enough
you will club your Minimum Viable
products minimum features develop the
time boxes all right
our traditional whatever you go on this
area and this is like that clear
thumbs up all right what is contract I
need not say you only start to think
what is convex agreement between parties
or more so what is that what is what are
the characteristics of contracts intense
connections for Hispanics
different types of contracts right so
time of anything else
everyone understands this everyone on
one baked food okay so that is what is
partnering I need not explain everyone
already knew it everyone whose identity
one most fun right now let's see a
guiding fixed bid contracts what is the
fixed bid contracts let's let's see that
fixed
be
what do you fix you said some
I think we'll break for lunch for now
Teixeira's available for the day so you
all can have your questions you know
sugar that for the day
to present to the show
thank you one really great for lunch now
be back by 2:30 for the main session
I explained what the kinds of inside
customer relationship you customer
satisfaction he said customer
satisfaction survey those kind of things
when I haven't seen really tied up you
consider if you want to deliver this
model you get so much of payment of
things but what do you really fix is the
cost fair enough
that's it so how do you
fantastic points
fantastic points let me draw one more
thing what is that typical
temple constraint we just saw
Vina
this is no longer valid dij what is that
is triangle in idea
when you first
quality second
on Spain's
or what are the constraints
Austin
trying the panoramic Elsa academically
sound very good visual resounding okay
because my drawing is not that thick but
the point that I am trying to make here
is early appeals to focus on very that
focus on constraints but constraints are
finally just found strange yeah what we
are really wanted to focus on is the
value that we are delivering the quality
that we are delivering and yes we have
to play those constraints yes but
unfortunately in fixed paid contracts we
don't we don't figure out the Bible
nobody knows what the value is first of
all that's a bigger problem and the
second thing is we don't even fix it
we always fix the constraints and we
hence focus on constants they point
all right it's kind of that
you want fantastic quality when I go to
price - it is I'm okay
15 cents so that's why we listed on
separately value is still dead but you
can play around the quality level you
know what I mean
so your question can you can be how
let's see
you can value you can rate your value in
dollar terms recheck a will give me so
many value so much of an in terms of
dollars who will give this dollar value
to a feature we do it do they know it
fully they should is the correct answer
and because the value is not so obvious
converting everything into a dollar
value is not obvious and can be
misleading
- so is it subjective yes it cannot be
objective we should not be object
because what is valuable to a user or
that client you can say that very well
can you prove it in terms of dollar
value can be even measure it specific
relatively you can still say that this
is more valuable to me teacher a or D is
nobody able to return feature value
everyone can can have client our users
say relatively I want this more than
that any say that
like this just a little bit into the
world because you are what cost/benefit
you want to know if your spending is not
answered once you have covered
everything then we think in this forum
but beyond all right the next next field
that we can do is because we cannot do
it always in dollar value hence we do 18
points what is points not doing there
please be consistently not kidding but
you understand right story points or any
point some point think that this is more
variable than the other that's it okay
so that's how you will get out your
value quality we already mentioned
defect density or any other metrics that
you want to do as I have different
metrics but again a different session
but focuses on quality cost value then
you know AJ you know contracts you don't
have to focus on I am sure you have done
your knowing all of this information
so and give an you against it simple so
can we do it should we be giving the
values of the glycoprotein that we
should be giving that was my next
question
who will give it
right you take the world don't worry
whatever domain knowledge that you have
you may have an SME work with them again
you are in a constraint but make sure
you do everything possible in your
control or in your influence do that
collaborative exercise all right
something you are SP have a we have got
the value in terms of point or dollars
whatever it is you would I break every
hour that will give you whatever it is
give or take now
so value in getting a squatter Dora is
very high but when I tell you the cost
what it takes
you okay though it is very high value
for me but then looking at it cost I
think if we can do it like that I want
it so in your RFP you not only need your
value value is something that kind will
give you all right
we will do your sites do sites estimates
anyways this is not
you don't know me lucky you have your
recipe ready now are you cook to respond
how do you look to respond no no gives
you value the client will give you a
dollar value for the society so you
would say this is only worth escape this
is then I need this this is my baby
I am NOT saying priority because
everything is not running so that's why
I am saying ordering I want it in terms
of reverb
I want it ordered nowadays and this is
like and against if I say ok if you want
this in terms of points in terms of size
I think so now we say ok this is
required but then the cost is too high
now right away I do it later on priority
change of that is Michael cheating new
or heavily key since everyone making
things so that's why just comes down now
and in my first time our communities so
when you say ten nine and five it's
actually value honesty exactly so this
is value now if you have TSP the
question was are you ready for response
are you exactly what about constraints
you need to consider that right and
these are your inputs to consider gosh
those countries what else you need yeah
together me and goes what's the fix or
to fix what you need to know what to fix
the hydrating nature you want to fix
mine ago what is your client ready for
it
does he understand 35 fixed value this
is how it will work
it is
this is the if your client says you fix
everything in the Triangle thank you
find a different vendor move it because
you know it is it is leading to failure
please I know that I know that
and what I'm saying is even speak up and
if you think that it's not ideal
let's not do
is
working like this we are expanding in
office clients get most of the times I
have seen that client is telling us go
ahead come with us
isn't it rather than our own management
saying let's go agile and you know let's
let's get client also a check
but the point is does it matter
point is if you want to do a big good
contract or or you want a successful
contracting mechanism in a giant another
thing that I want to say is the idle
fact that comes out the plan that comes
out the numbers that come out is not I
repeat the contract the artifact the
number that comes out is important the
activity that you collaboratively do to
get that artifact to get that number is
important when you say quick lines and
and their story and why it is valuable
spread it across in your teal talk about
it understand it digest it leave it that
is important you will be there
but then what really matters is don't
tell me that you haven't seen any
contract which we charge which has gone
beyond all the fixed parameters but
still his client is very happy with you
they don't take that legal document and
going to court and suing getting it so
what really matters is whether you are
delivering that value to your client or
not are you able to prove that you have
given that what your value or not how
good is your reputation and what is not
the contract actual contract document
you take for many people still for money
to it so that there is some
predictability
it's a valid point actually this was my
Germany whatever I spoke till now does
it does it have any relation to at it
can you do it even now whether you call
it a jail or not does it matter what
matters is finally activities as I just
mentioned right now where does I just
come into the picture now that he is
asked the question let me let me reveal
it number one focus on that value number
two relative size number three is what
are you going to rebuild now
usually what we do in in usual context
now I'm not asking any questions or
anything I'm just giving it away usually
what we do in the
where items into the picture and how
agile contracting can be done he is here
in a giant what you can do is just have
a contract for release one
my attractions first police do the agile
contracting only for so much for this to
happen you need to have a master
agreement
okay in the Master Agreement you will
mention that we want actually for two
years but the payment schedule the
planning value either effort fixed
whatever you are fixing all those
parameters will be only for first finish
and you will have your clause in your
master agreement saying that let's see
how your first police goes that time you
will also know what are for and in the
first release what are you going to take
I this I ready my them I this high-value
items you know how to prioritize all the
features right very quickly again so
this is uncertainty in its value
all right is high value i w will
decompose why I value high value Jewish
second
do when you stories do when you hide it
stay away from Canada q.q because you
want to buy annuity you want to fast you
want to face Ali so if there is
something like we don't have enough to
make knowledge we don't have something
nobody knew how to do it right we said
okay we'll try to do it we'll see how it
goes
we'll see what our sustainable basis and
then you tell us not forget that and
even we will be able to be very toxic
that whether we can cope up with you or
not whether we can give enough value
so I think some of it could also be a
function is a function what is your
prospectus with the customer you in in
your situation you could mix of quadrant
to one quadrant one thing I want to do
this my failure as without to give some
early means to
so that you are still showing some value
but at the same time your penis in
yourself is they're not taking the
reciprocal I suppose technically store
everything is good or during the client
of fetching the arrows
I'm just one ready all right based on
that how it goes what the sustainable PC
is more kind of hiding there me what
kind of risk we have are considering
Google Apps relatively to get the
can this kind of model working knowledge
Elizabeth unlocking the can but the
benefit of going agile in this kind of
mantra to decrement ears you have
you can fix this but it was it the same
requirement as we had in the first thing
we not be here that there is no real
working world but a certain value
deliver it that butterfly now Realtors
know they think that something needs to
change the priority of the remaining
features should change some
they come up with the value and if I get
four requirements and the guy saying the
force requirement is obtained the penis
of
I am deliberately food money cease
working provost I have tenure 30 points
when what is perceived value here Otis
granny here
so when I talk about perceived value
value delivered 3 you're saying you
delivered 30 value value points when you
deliver the customer might want change
in one of those three saying that is
what I mentioned it's a new story it's
having value 31 because I didn't decide
what I am going to do
we also do these are the scope items
which I you so again I think
holistically you will fix you would want
the I didn't fix value big size but not
features give each any plane because
that might change and that might change
because of customer not because of you
because customer I do want to explain
what customer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
