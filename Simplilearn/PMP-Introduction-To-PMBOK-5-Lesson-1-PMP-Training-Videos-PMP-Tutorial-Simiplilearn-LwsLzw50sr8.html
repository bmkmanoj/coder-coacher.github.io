execution and monitoring and controlling
processes go hand-in-hand therefore when
a new project is initiated all processes
of project initiation process group
should be applied to the project
similarly when the project is being
closed all processes of project closing
groups should be applied for instance
identify risks is a process of project
planning group so when the project is in
planning phase you must identify all the
risks of the project next let's see what
knowledge area is as per pin Bob guide

area is a set of specific processes
performed to meet a project objective

accomplished in the project planning
process group and a few others in
project monitoring and controlling
process group for example develop

of the planning process group and the
