consultant I help people with the
various aspects of Salesforce hi I'm
Sarah a sales manager our company has
decided to implement Salesforce for CRM
and branding I've been asked to be the
head of the implementation process well
that's good
congratulations am i sensing a but there
yes I'm confused about which Edition to
choose and also about the branding and
customization options available in
Salesforce you know Sarah that's a valid
question companies looking for branding
and CRM are often not sure which
additions to go for buying Salesforce is
the easy part now the company needs to
start using it branding tabs and
homepage customizations all go a long
way to ensuring a high adoption rate
users want to log in and navigate fast
this lesson will explain how to solve
the problem of tab overkill and cleaning
up the home page for a more streamlined
experience great I can't wait to get
started
in this lesson what you learn is
customizing the homepage by adding and
removing components creating custom tabs
for faster data access creating a custom
app for applications creation uploading
a company logo to brand salesforce
exploring the system overview page and
updating the fiscal year and business
hours let's go ahead and get started so
salesforce is a web-based crm that
allows users to log in from anywhere
with an internet connection and browser
the common use cases for salesforce
include tracking business development
activities of salespeople so this could
be logging cold calls you know sending
mass emails any sending out brochures
any type of business development
activity that you'd want to track
salesforce can manage that also the
reporting and customer interaction
through case management so if customers
have any issues or complaints or
problems they can log in in and create a
case and the customer service folks can
work with that case as well also
reporting on the effectiveness of
marketing initiatives so all of those
different marketing activities that are
being put on you know how effective are
they what's the ROI what are the general
and total sales for them what are the
sales specific for products and services
and all of that also to give you the
ability to collaborate between employees
partners and customers so this last
one's pretty interesting because there's
a feature called salesforce communities
and with salesforce communities you can
actually grant login access to
individuals outside of your organization
so this is an important point here
because salesforce was really ultimately
a collaboration tool between employees
also managers of course partners and
customers next we're going to walk
through the individual salesforce
editions and talk about the pros and
cons of each
so salesforce has a wide range of
products and services that they offer
there are essentially three primary
editions that you're going to encounter
on the exam professional Edition is the
first level and it's really meant to be
a standalone accountant contact
management system you can also track you
know deals through opportunities as well
as products but there are no options for
you know integration
and you know it's there is no automation
as well so it's really meant to be a you
know starter version of Salesforce of
course the benefit there is that it's
$65 a month so it's the least expensive
of the three that you know most
Salesforce customers end up moving
forward with the next addition here is
enterprise Enterprise is by far the most
popular addition of Salesforce it allows
for workflow rules to send out automated
notifications you can perform
integrations there's a sandbox security
is also much more robust so with
Enterprise Edition you can actually
build out you know an application on
your own or you can actually connect
with other applications as well so most
customers end up moving forward with
enterprise unlimited edition is the next
level up and there's a level above that
called performance which we're not going
to go into too much detail on but
unlimited edition offers higher limits
there are multiple sandboxes allowed
additional data storage not that many
Salesforce customers have this edition
however some do so with unlimited
edition as an administrator you'll have
multiple sandboxes such as a full copy
sandbox that brings over all the data
into that sandbox so it's not just a
blank testing area it actually has your
live data as well you can also make many
more customizations you can have more
tabs and also you have additional data
storage so for the purpose of this
course you know we're going to be
focusing mainly on Enterprise Edition
features and limits that's what the exam
primarily focus on as well but you know
it is important to note that there's a
couple of different you know main
editions here of Salesforce so next
we're going to talk about home page
customization so when you first log into
Salesforce you're going to hit the home
page and so on this home page you're
going to see really a starting point so
you're going to see tasks dashboard area
you know any recent records so for
example you're going to be able to see
all the open and you know tasks that
need to be completed that haven't been
completed yet you can also view upcoming
events you can also view dashboard
snapshot so as you can see here so when
a user first logs in they are able to
you know see all of these different
aspects and this is important because
it's the starting point so from this
page really it's meant to be you know a
snapshot of all their activities and
then from here they can start clicking
on the various tabs across the top to
start moving around the system so now
I'm going to go ahead and walk you
through some of the home page features
so I'm logged into Salesforce and as you
can see here I can scroll up and down
and see a list of calendar events that I
have I also have recent items over here
on the left-hand side so if I want to
navigate to one of those I can simply
click on the link and it will take me to
that individual record so if I need to
get back I can always go back and click
on that home page so here once I'm here
I can also show the chatter feed so for
example I can click on the show feed
button and it'll actually show me a list
of all the different chatter
conversations that I have and we'll get
to chatter a little bit later on but
chatter is essentially an internal
messaging tool that allows you to
communicate with other Salesforce users
and if I don't need to see this chatter
feed for now I can just click it the
hide feed button to collapse that back
up down here I can also see all the
calendar events so what I'm doing is I'm
actually synchronizing from my Google
Apps account so all of my Google events
are being synchronized back to the
calendar here in this particular case I
can also click on the new event button
and this will actually allow me to
manually create an event so I can choose
the start date and the end date and time
as well and then save and then that's
going to show up on that calendar list
if I want to see the calendar for
multiple users I can come over here and
click on this multi user view icon and
then I can see you know different
individuals as well as their their
calendar and availability so you know if
I if I click on one of these purple
boxes here it's actually going to show
me the specific event details for that
individual user and then of course if I
want to jump back I can click on the
home tab and it'll take me back to that
page also on the home page here we have
the
recycle bin so if you ever accidentally
delete something you can click on
recycle bin and then that will allow you
to come in here and actually
undelete records now those are stored
for up to 15 days and that is up to your
data storage limit so whichever one
comes first but for most Salesforce
customers it is going to stay there for
15 days so you can always go back in
there and undelete it and pull it out
so moving on we're going to talk about
user management so the key points for
this is that users must be assigned an
active license all usernames must be
unique across all of the Salesforce
network so for example if you had a
specific username at a previous company
and you were wanting to use that at a
new company you might be at you're going
to have to change you're going to have
to use a different username so one way
around that is a for you deactivated in
the other system you can always change
the username to something that is not
meaningful you know so add a couple of
numbers to the end of your the name
before your domain and that way you can
use your own username going forward all
users must be assigned a profile and you
can also reassign user licenses so the
licenses work in a pooled format so you
buy ten licenses and so 10 people at any
given time can be accessing Salesforce
if someone leaves however you can turn
off their access and then that license
is freed up to then be assigned to their
replacement for example so now I'm
actually going to walk through the
creation of a user in Salesforce
so I'm logged in to Salesforce here and
I'm going to start by clicking on the
setup link in the top right corner so
over here on the left hand side I'm
going to choose manage users click on
users and then I can choose new user
here so if I click on this new user
button I then can start filling out the
fields relevant to that particular user
so in this case I'm going to have you
know John Adams and I'm going to choose
just any random email address in this
case and see if you if you see what
happens when I fill out that email it it
populates the user name field there as
well
you can always come back in and change
that so the email in the user name
actually don't have to be the same but
you know they will be most of the time
and then over here on the right hand
side I can choose between different
licenses so for example in this case I
have maybe an external license and then
I have a chattel external user profile I
can choose I also have options over here
on the right-hand side for example I can
choose whether this user is in
accessibility mode and color blind
palette on charts I can also turn off
this force.com quick access menu so I'm
going to go ahead and do that because
what that does is it shows a little blue
box on the right-hand side and I don't
need this particular user to see it then
I can scroll down here and I can choose
if I want them to receive a new password
and notify them immediately or not you
know a lot of a lot of people don't know
you can actually uncheck this and then
click Save and what that will allow you
to do is create a new user record but it
will not send an email notifying that
user that a new Salesforce you know user
account has been set up for them so if
you want to set their account up without
you know notifying them that's the way
to go about it so to continue on I can
also come in here and make changes so
for example if John has a problem with
the company for example and ends up
getting terminated I can actually freeze
John's user account so I can click on
freeze and that will freeze John to
access to the system I can also come
back and unfreeze if there's a situation
that's been resolved as well
if I want to deactivate John I can click
on edit here and uncheck this active
checkbox now I'm going to be prompted
here to confirm this which I'm going to
go ahead and do something to click OK
and then I'm going to click Save and
then Salesforce is now going to
deactivate John's user access now if
John tries to log in again he's going to
get a notification that says there's his
system administrator has disabled his
access Salesforce has a couple of other
user features worth mentioning so for
example we can also reset a password so
if I want to reset a password for this
user I can go ahead and do so that will
send user password reset however in this
case I had deactivated this user so it
didn't send it but you can reset their
password there if I click on users I can
also create views for example I've got
some users in this system I can also
create new view here and see you know
all admin users for example so I can
come over here and actually create a
list view of the different users in the
system and this is particularly useful
for companies that have quite a few
users so that way you can actually
create lists and you can flip through
them a little bit easier so at this
point I'm going to create a list called
admin and it's where the profile
contains the word administrator and I'm
going to click Save so here you can see
that none of the users actually showed
up what that means is none of the users
actually have that particular profile so
let me change that to say chief
executive so I'm going to click Save and
Salesforce is actually saving my change
at the moment and now you can see that a
user shows up that actually fits the
criteria for that particular list now I
can also come over here and make a
couple of other mass changes so if I if
I click on the active users list here I
can also come over here and check a
couple of different checkboxes and reset
passwords for those individuals I can
also click on this add multiple users
button so if I click add multiple users
it's going to give me the ability to
choose a license and then I can actually
add
users individually if I don't have
enough licenses then I need to you know
purchase more licenses from Salesforce
or I need to deactivate one of these
users so that way they do have there is
a free license for me to use
so the next thing we're going to talk
about here is viewing available tabs in
Salesforce so the main points of this
topic here is that tabs can be added or
removed by individual users web tabs can
be added to access commonly requested
websites tabs can also be created to
display visualforce pages there's a
couple of other uses for tabs but these
are really the three primary uses to
view object data to view websites as
well as visual for spades so I'm logged
in to Salesforce here and I've got a
couple of different tabs across the top
now I want to change what tabs are
displayed so I can click on this plus
sign and choose customize my tabs and
then it gives you the ability to
actually select different tabs that I
want to have displayed so now I want to
click Save and then you'll see that
those new tabs are now displayed across
the top so I can also click on the tab
it'll take me to individual list views
as well
same goes with dashboards so if I wanted
to create a web tab I can do that and
it'll show up as a tab here across the
top so at this point I'm going to create
a new tab for a custom object so I'm
going to click on set up in the top
right corner over here on the left hand
side I'm going to click on create and
then tabs and then I'm going to click on
this new button so when I click on this
new button I'm going to be presented
with a list of custom objects that don't
have a tab so I'm going to choose
internal our in this case it's a custom
object I'm going to choose a tab style
now when this window pops up I can
choose from a variety of different icons
in this case I'm going to choose the
flag once I click Next
it's then going to ask me for the tab
visibility so I have the ability the
ability to control who has access to
this tab by default so for example if I
if I leave this as default on then
everybody's going to be able to see the
tab when they log in if I leave it as
default off it's going to hide the tab
but it will give them the ability to add
it to their tab row if they'd like now
if I choose tab hidden it's actually
going to prevent them from seeing the
tab as well as adding the tab to their
own list of tabs in this case I'm going
to leave it as default on and
if I wanted to sort of mix and match the
visibility I can also choose apply
different tab visibility for each
profile and I can choose between default
on default off on a per profile basis in
this case I'm just going to leave it as
the default and I'm going to click Next
so here I also have the ability to add a
tab to an individual app which will
actually get to here in a few minutes in
this case I'm going to click Save
because I do want the tab to show and so
now you can see I can click on this
internal hours tab and it's going to
show me you know records for this
particular tab so the next thing we're
going to talk about is creating an app
in Salesforce so an app allows you to
access common features organize tabs in
a logical manner as well as create a
customizable application so what that
means is you can actually create
internal apps for your organization so
you might have an app for the sales team
you might have an app for the customer
service team or the marketing team so
when they log in they can actually
change from the drop down menu in the
top right corner what different
applications are available so for
example here we have a list of different
apps so we have an app for all tabs one
for the Imperial cloud sync application
we have an executive app an external app
as well so inside of Salesforce you can
you know essentially bundle up the tabs
and objects on a per app basis so for
example I'm logged in to Salesforce here
so in the top right corner I can choose
between sales or executive for example
or perhaps the imperial cloud sync app
so in the top right corner you can build
these different apps and and choose
which tabs are selected so for example
here I can choose sales and it will take
me back to the sales app for which I
have tabs built out for so at this point
I'm going to go ahead and create an app
so I'm first going to click on the setup
link in the top right corner and on this
page I'm going to come over here to the
left hand side and click on create and
apps
so now I'm going to click new and I'm
going to create an app so let's call
this app customer service in this
particular case so here I have the
ability to upload you know an associate
a logo we'll get to that in the next
lesson but at this point you can click
insert an image and actually choose a
logo to associate here I'm just going to
leave it as the default and I'm going to
click Next now this is the most
important part of the app you have the
ability to choose from different tabs
from on the left-hand side so for
example we're building an app for the
customer service team so what are the
different tabs that they would need to
see so I think accounts would be
important for customers contacts as well
for those that are actually calling in
and then cases for the actual service
tickets to resolve those customer issues
I'm going to also add the dashboards tab
so that way they can actually check on
their performance and you know see what
cases are being resolved and how long
it's taking them to resolve them so now
I'm going to click Next and on this page
I can actually choose who has access and
who doesn't so I can actually make all
these individual profiles have access to
the app by checking this visible
checkbox here I can also take the
further step of making it the default
app now what this would do is whenever a
customer service person logs in this
would be the default app that they see
here in the top right hand corner in
this case I'm going to uncheck it and be
more selective I'm just going to say for
example the CEO is going to be able to
see this then I'm going to click Save so
when I click Save I can actually click
in this top right corner and you can see
I now have my customer service app built
out and it's got those individual tabs
that we added earlier so that's
essentially how you create an app in
Salesforce so the next thing we're going
to talk about here is uploading a
company logo
now inside Salesforce when you create
apps and email templates and letterhead
and all of that you're going to want to
have the company logo in there so what
you need to do is make sure that your
logo is formatted
our sales force specifications 300 555
pixels for example you also need to
upload that logo to the documents tab
and then you can assign that logo to an
actual app in sales for so I'm now going
to demonstrate how to actually upload
the logo to Salesforce so I'm logged in
here I'm going to click on this
documents tab on the documents tab I'm
going to click new and I'm going to
actually name this for example let's
call it logo now I need to make this
externally available so I'm going to
check on that externally available image
checkbox now that's very important
because once you check that checkbox it
makes the image available for outside
applications that will reference the URL
so the best thing to do is check that
checkbox if you want to make this logo
or any document for that matter
accessible via a link from sale outside
of Salesforce if not if you want to keep
that document more restricted or private
don't check that checkbox here I can
also save the file to any of these
folders so for example I'm going to
click on the shared documents click on
browse and then for example I'm going to
grab that company logo file and I'm
going to click Save so now you can see
I've upload the logo uploaded the logo
here so I can actually go back and
reference this logo with any of the
applications that I have so for example
I can click on create and apps and I can
go back to for example that customer
service app and on this customer service
app I can actually change which images
display so here I'm going to click on
insert image and it's going to pop up a
box and I can actually choose logo here
so I'm going to choose logo it's going
to change that for me and click Save and
then when I jump over to that particular
app in the top right corner
for example customer service it's
actually going to show that logo that I
uploaded so it's a pretty simple trick
you just need to make sure to upload
that logo to the documents tab which
then you can reference elsewhere so the
next thing we're going to talk about is
the company information page so the
company information page has a few key
points here so the most important in my
opinion is being
to see your data and file storage as
well as your active licenses so not many
customers go over the data limit but if
you do there's only one place to go and
find that and that's in this company
information page so here on the company
information page we can see for example
the used data space is at 7% use file
spaces barely at you know 1% or 0%
actually so you can see that as well as
the number of active licenses down here
at the bottom so it's on this company
information page that you can update any
organizational details such as address
you can also view permission sets and
what I'm going to do is click on this
setup tab and then I'm going to click on
company profile and then company
information on the left hand side so
what's going to happen is this page will
load and show me exactly what we were
looking at before so I can actually come
over here and edit this as well so for
example if I want to update the address
or I want to change you know the default
language for example I can do so I can
also do things like turn on or turn off
the different Salesforce email
newsletters that go out in this case
case I'm just going to click Save and
I'm going to keep scrolling down so here
we can see that they use data space is
at you know 80 megabytes I can click
view and it's actually going to show me
all of the different records that I have
so I've got a bunch of project history
records I've got you know roughly 8,000
contacts so inside of Salesforce you can
actually see exactly how many records
you have on a per object basis so I'm
going to click back to go back so
scrolling down I can also see the you
know the API and what limits are are
available for that API I can also see
any restricted logins I can see my
organization ID as well and other
relevant information so if I continue
scrolling down I can see how many active
user licenses I have so in this case in
this particular Oregon have 14 active
user licenses and I've got other feature
licenses as well which we'll go over in
subsequent lessons so in general the
company overview page just gives you a
snapshot of your organization your
licensing and your total data store
frig so the next thing we're going to
talk about is the system overview page
so on the system overview page you can
view the number of custom objects the
number of workflow rules and custom tabs
as well as apex classes in API requests
you can also see any custom apps that
you've built out as well so here I'm
logged in and I'm going to click on
setup and when I click on setup over
here on the left hand side I can scroll
down under monitor and click on system
overview so on the system overview page
I can see a few relevant pieces of
information so starting in the top left
corner I can see the number of custom
objects that I have at 20 but I can see
that my maximum limit here is 200 and
I'm at 10% of that I also have one
custom setting and I'm using
approximately 81 megabytes of storage or
about 7% I also have the ability to see
the different rules and apex triggers
and classes that I've created and my
code limit so I have the ability to have
up to three million characters in
Salesforce for code I've got about 49
thousand right now so it's just barely
scratching the surface just under 2%
over in the top right hand side I can
also see my number of API requests 232
as well as other user interface items
like the number of custom acts
the act of force.com sides as well so if
I continue scrolling down I can also see
the most use licenses so if I click on
the show all link it'll take me right
back to the Comfort company overview
page so it's essentially showing you the
same information but you can see I'm at
a hundred percent of my licenses here
and I also have three Salesforce
licenses so what this is is there's
force.com licenses that allow users to
just see custom objects and then
salesforce licenses which allow users to
see everything for the purpose of the
exam we're just talking about salesforce
licenses at this point so the next thing
we're going to talk about is updating
the fiscal year in salesforce so in
salesforce you can update the fiscal
year which will help keep your reports
accurate so you can assign a starting in
month to your company and update
business hours for routing logic
as well so updating the fiscal year will
allow you to run reports using the FY
designator fiscal year on report so that
way you can say you know if your fiscal
year starts on July 1st or October 1st
or you know January 1st whatever it may
be you can set that inside of Salesforce
and that way when users run their
reports they are actually looking at
data for the fiscal year rather than the
calendar year for example so now I'm
going to go ahead and jump into
Salesforce and actually demonstrate so
to start I'm going to click on setup in
the top right hand corner and over on
the left-hand side I'm going to click on
company profile and you can see I have
fiscal year in business hours here so if
I click on fiscal year I can edit it I
can choose any month that I choose I can
also have a custom fiscal year which I
won't actually activate in this case
custom custom fiscal years allow you to
have for example five week months and in
four week months etc in this case we're
just going to talk about the standard
fiscal year I can also choose based on
what the starting month is the ending
month for example and then I can make my
change and click Save the other error
wanted to go over here is the business
hours so with business hours this is
important for tracking different cases
that might come in and leads that come
in for any kind of service level
agreements you may have so for example I
can click on edit here and over on the
right hand side I can actually check and
uncheck these check boxes to actually
customize those hours so for example
perhaps for you know Mondays I want to
say that the start time is at 8:00 a.m.
and then the end time for example might
be at you know 5:00 p.m. so it's just
really a matter of editing the different
options and then clicking save so once
that's done then those changes have been
committed to the system so this is
really important because as we go over
their topics such as case routing and
you know the service cloud in Salesforce
all of those features are going to be
looking at the business hours to
determine if cases were answered on time
and you know who they should be routed
to etc so this is also an area that's
covered on
exam so salesforce likes to cover you
know obscure areas so it's so it's an
important to to know where to find this
and get to
so to start I'm going to create an email
template so I'm going to click on setup
in the top right hand corner click on
communication templates and click on
email templates here so I'm going to
click this new template button and I've
got a variety of email templates to
choose from so I'm just going to leave
this as text but you can also choose
HTML or visualforce and with or without
letterhead for now I'm just going to
choose text and click Next so anytime
you create a new email template you
always need to check this available for
use checkbox if you want to make this
template available if it's not ready for
others to select then leave that
checkbox unchecked in this case we're
going to choose we're going to type out
you know new new lead for example so
what I can do is I can actually create
this email template like so I can put
you know the the body of the email there
as well and click Save
so now my email template is saved so I
can come back over here and edit it and
I can also add those merge fields so for
example if I want to add in fields from
leads I can click on leads and select a
field let's say company and then I can
just really copy and paste that merge
field right in there and then what's
going to happen is when united
containers uses this email template it's
going to pull in that company
information from the lead right into the
email template another area that they
went ahead and set up would be the
workflow rules so I'm going to click on
create in work phone approvals and so
you can see I've got some workflow rules
here I can click on new rule and choose
which object I want the rule to touch
and so we're actually going to talk
about workflow rules a little bit later
on in this course but Tom you know just
just so you understand workflow rules
can trigger email alerts tasks field
updates or even outbound messages so you
know this is the workflow areas and that
this is the workflow rule area and this
is what you can do with those so the
last area that I wanted to talk about
here is the sandbox so if
you log into the setup area over on the
left hand side you can click on
sandboxes so here in salesforce i also
have the ability to create a sandbox
which united containers did in that
particular case so i can actually see
here the different sand boxes that i
have i have just a developer sandbox
setup in this particular instance I can
always refresh this or login or even
delete it but Tom you know just as part
of that case study you can have sand
boxes in Salesforce for testing purposes
and we will talk about that a little bit
later on in the course as well some of
the key takeaways here is that
salesforce is a web-based customer
relationship management software that
allows users to log in from anywhere
with an internet connection and browser
salesforce offers a wide range of
products suited for each organization
and the home page consists of the
sidebar and main area and users need to
be assigned and active license to get
access to the system thanks a lot justin
this certainly helped now I'll be able
to guide my team better when
implementing Salesforce you are welcome
