of nutri Worldwide Inc mighty master
worked closely with the manufacturing
team recently we've been receiving bulk
orders and that's when problems started
while performing a random audit I found
that there is a serious lack of
collaboration between the product and
the manufacturing team when I discussed
this with our tech team they suggested
that we install Salesforce to overcome
this that's a very logical suggestion
Aaron you should consider it seriously
before placing a requisition for
installing Salesforce I wanted to check
whether it will alleviate the issue and
frankly speaking I cannot waste any more
time on this the productivity of my team
has decreased sharply due to this lack
of information Salesforce chatter will
be perfect for your solution it will
help your team members collaborate
better with emails updates posts video
links and groups chatter allows for
teams to create private groups for
collaborating on certain topics such as
product development while also allowing
public groups to discuss topics such as
where to arrange an office party replies
to posts via email make this an even
easier tool to use when tied in with
approvals and feed posts Salesforce
chatter helps with interdepartmental
communication as well let me show you
some amazing features of chatter in this
lesson sure let's start our first topic
will be a chatter overview the following
are a few facts about chatter chatter is
a Salesforce application that enables
users to connect and report activities
within their company every organization
has 5000 free chatter licenses in
chatter every user has a profile page
with a photo and work-related
information people can follow each other
form groups follow records and tasks in
chatter chatter provides instant chat
messaging and record sharing so let's
talk a little bit more about each of
these
points chatter is built right inside
Salesforce and if you see the screenshot
on the right hand side you can see it
comment and you also have the ability to
upload files and links and take a poll
it really enables users and even outside
users that have access to collaborate
inside Salesforce so you get 5000 free
chatter licenses you can give those
licenses to anyone inside or outside of
your organization the only thing they
can do with it is you know access
chatter but it does give you the ability
to give others you know voice in the
conversation you might not otherwise be
able to also in chatter you have a
profile page similar to other social
media sites you have the ability to post
your picture your email address phone
number and any other work related
information like your title or the
department you work in you can also
follow other users so if you're
interested in the posts from specific
users you can follow them you can also
form groups so a common use case would
be a new product idea group or a new
feature request group or it can even be
an informal group like where should we
go to lunch or where should we have the
company party you can also follow
records and tasks and we'll get to that
a little bit later on here in this
lesson and you can also make use of the
instant messaging through the instant
chat direct messaging private messages
and record sharing inside of chatter as
well so let's jump into Salesforce and
just see a basic chatter page so I'm
logged into Salesforce and I'm on the
chatter tab here so to see this page
you'd simply click chatter and it will
take you to the chatter page for the
entire company so we're going to talk
about each of these areas more
specifically here in a few minutes but
just for as far as an overview is
concerned you can see here that you can
have running conversations with others
in the organization on different records
you could upload files post links you
can even put out a poll such as you know
where should we order company lunch and
then over on the left hand side you can
send messages directly you can see you
know any messages directed to yourself
from others you can also see people and
groups with
in the organization as well so in this
lesson we'll talk about all these more
in depth but as far as an overview is
concerned this is sufficient so you can
see here that you know Lissette posted
to this all cloud creations group a file
so a very basic overview and you can get
this as well from your home page so if
you click on the Home tab you can see if
your chatter feed is open you can see
the chatter feed there
about enabling chatter in Salesforce
so keep the following points in mind
when enabling chatter if your
organization wants to use chatter it
will be enabled for all users
it cannot be added to select groups and
enabling chatter will also enable global
search so what that means is chatter is
all or nothing for your company if one
of you or some of you want to use
chatter and not the rest if you turn it
on its turned on for everybody now you
can take steps to mitigate it you can
hide it you can remove the tab and do a
few of the things such as disable the
email but once you turn on chatter it's
on for everybody
you also can't add it to select group so
you can't create a specific group and
just enable it for that and also a lot
of Salesforce customers like the global
search function this global search bar
that's actually part of chatter so well
I should say it's tied to chatter so if
you want the ability to use the global
search you're gonna have to enable
chatter as well let's jump into
Salesforce and look at the steps for
enabling chatter so we're in the setup
area of Salesforce I clicked on setup
and then over here on the left hand side
I went under customize all the way down
to chatter settings and then up at the
top you can see the enable checkbox is
not checked now for those of you that
have just recently purchased Salesforce
this is going to come enabled by default
however if some of you have purchased
Salesforce prior to chatter being rolled
out a few years ago you're gonna need to
take these steps so first I'm going to
check this enable checkbox and it's
going to show me a bunch of other
options here so we'll talk about all of
these here in a few minutes but
essentially all of your chatter settings
are found on this page so at this point
you've checked the enable checkbox and
click Save and it's going to enable
chatter for your organization so once
that's done you'll see it's grayed out
but you can always come back and click
edit if you want the ability to disable
chatter so that's your option there
the next thing we're going to talk about
is enabling chatter feeds on records so
I'm logged in to Salesforce back in the
setup area I clicked on setup I scroll
down and on the left hand side i
expanded chatter and I clicked on feed
tracking so I'm gonna scroll back up and
now I have the ability to track all of
these different fields so let's talk for
a minute about feed tracking so with
feed tracking in Salesforce you have the
ability to turn on and turn off fields
that are show that show up in chatter
users can enable these feeds on objects
and different records users can see
updates for the objects and records they
follow in their chatter feed so many
objects and fields are also tracked by
default and it can be customized to
include or exclude fields so let's jump
back into Salesforce and see this last
point here so if you see over here on
the left hand side we have a list of all
of the objects in Salesforce we have
custom object standard objects as well
so you can see here account everybody
knows what the account is so let's use
that one as an example so here you can
see that I've been able to feed tracking
on accounts and we have two fields that
we're tracking now let's say I want to
track something else let's say I want to
track company email I can check that
check box and click Save now what that's
going to do is it's going to give me the
ability to see a change made to that
field right inside of chatter so let me
jump over here to this new account I'm
going to click on show feed we don't see
any updates in the chatter feed so let's
say I want to come over here and I want
to put in an email for this particular
account so I'm gonna click Save so as
you can see that change to the company
email field was now posted to the
chatter feed so with feet tracking you
have the ability to post changes to
fields right inside of chatter now let's
say I don't want that I'm going to come
back over here
that company email check box and click
Save now once my changes have been saved
I'm going to go back to the account and
let's say I'm going to change this to
something totally different as a test
and I'm going to click Save so you can
see that I made my change but it did not
post that change to chatter the reason
is is because I disabled that field from
the chatter feed options here in the
setup area so only check the check boxes
of the fields that you want tracked so
you can choose any of these campaigns
cases contacts you have the ability to
choose up to 20 different fields now
something to keep in mind is that you
want to keep your chatter feed as
relevant as possible
so what that means is if you start
selecting every field that's available
that might seem like a great idea you
know you being very thorough the reality
is the more you have in the chatter feed
the more difficult it is to understand
if the posts in the feed are relevant or
not so you really only want to focus on
the fields that are most relevant for
example you might not even care about
the fields on account but maybe you want
to focus on like opportunities or
contacts let's say someone's tidal
change on a contact so maybe you want to
track that or you could jump over to
opportunities and say you know I want to
track the closed date so here we're
tracking the closed date already on
opportunities and chatters so every time
the close date changes that gets posted
to chatter so that sounds like a good
idea but changing you know our tracking
the phone number field on a contact it's
probably not necessary it's just going
to sort of clutter up your chatter feed
so those are some important
considerations when enabling feed
tracking
the next thing we'll talk about is
configuring chatter groups keep the
following points in mind when
configuring chatter groups chatter
groups are the main Arian chatter where
people share information post updates
and ask questions configuration can add
features for archiving unlisted groups
and records in groups so inside of
Salesforce you have this group's option
and like I've talked about before groups
can be used to organize discussions that
can be a discussion on everything from
the latest movie that's come out to
feature requests or new product ideas it
can be anything so groups in Salesforce
allow you to you know make sure that
conversation stay on topic on a per crew
basis so let's jump into Salesforce and
see groups in action
so I'm logged into Salesforce and I've
clicked on my chatter tab here now on
this chatter feed I can look over here
on the left-hand side and I have the
ability to create a group so I clicked
on group and I see I've got this new
product ideas group set up so I'm going
to click on it so I've clicked on new
product ideas and you can see I've got
an image here and I don't have any posts
in this group yet what I can do is I can
add members so I can search for people
at my organization and add them and once
that happens they'll get an invite to
join the group and then I can post
product ideas here
so I can share that post to the group I
can also add topics so I can you know
essentially use hashtags to organize my
individual posts or I can just leave it
without a hashtag at all and you know
the group will know that this group is
just for those ideas now here I can
click on group settings and I can see
some of the different settings that I
have here so I can see whether it's a
public or a private group I can also
choose whether or not I'm gonna archive
this group or don't automatically
archive the group and the idea behind
archiving is that sometimes you create a
group for a one-time purpose but then
once it's created nobody's using it
anymore it's automatically going to get
archived so that that's what that's
about you also have the ability to
delete the group but for now I'm just
going to click cancel and take us back
to this page so this is essentially how
groups work you have to add individuals
to participate in the group and anyone
that does not have access to the group
is not going to be able to see those
conversations
so the next thing we're going to talk
about here is creating customer groups
keep the following points in mind when
creating customer groups users can
invite customers to groups that they own
and manage customers can see information
only in groups they are invited to and
can interact only with members of those
groups so what this means is if you
create a customer group and you allow
others to join the group you're only
going to be able to see the information
in that group you're not going to be
able to see any information outside of
the group however if someone from the
group posts some confidential
information to the group of course
you're going to be able to see that as
well so it's an important consideration
that as a Salesforce administrator if
you're creating a private group and you
want to allow customers into the group
they're going to be able to see
everything that you post in there so
let's jump back into Salesforce and
create a customer group so I'm back in
the Salesforce I've clicked on the
chatter tab and now I want to create a
new group so I'm going to click this new
group up button here so I'm going to
call this new customer group to make it
painfully obvious and then down here I'm
actually going to choose private and
then it's going to give me the option to
allow customers to join the group so now
I'm going to click allow customers and
save what it's going to do now is it's
going to prompt me to make sure that I
really want to allow external customers
to see and be invited to this group at
this point I'm going to click OK so I've
now have my new customer group so if I
want to invite people I can click on add
members or this invite people option so
here I can put in the email address of
the individuals customers or otherwise
that I want to invite to this group I
can also add people a little bit more
automatically I can scroll up and down
the list of users and add them as well
but it's really just a matter of
clicking this invite people putting
their email address in there and a
message in here and sending and they're
going to get an email that's going to
allow them to register for a chat
license and then when they log into
Salesforce they are going to be taken
directly to chatter where they're going
to see this group and be able to post to
this group and see any other posts in
the group as well now an important
consideration is that once you create a
customer group you can't change it to
public or unlisted it's essentially
locked as far as these group access
settings go so when you create your
customer group just know that you're not
going to be able to ever roll it back
you're gonna hat you're essentially
stuck with the options that you chose
the first time around so if you want to
create a group and you're not sure if
you want to make it a customer group
just create it as a public group first
wait and see and then you can always
change it to a customer group later
the next thing we're going to talk about
is creating a free customer chatter user
the chatter free license is for users
who don't have Salesforce licenses
chatter free can access items such as
people profiles groups and files but
they can't access any Salesforce objects
or data chatter free users cannot see
tabs they can be a chatter moderator so
let's jump into Salesforce and see this
in action
so we're log back into Salesforce and
I'm back at this new customer group that
I pre created just a few minutes ago so
there's two ways to create a free
chatter user first is the option I
demonstrated previously I can click on
this invite people link and I can put in
email addresses and it's going to send
them an invite to register for chatter
the other option is I can actually go to
the user area and over on the right hand
side I can choose chatter free and then
make the profile chatter free user and
then I can put the information here
that's relevant on the left-hand side
and click Save and this person's going
to get an email notification letting
them know they now have a free chatter
license now if you're unsure of how many
chatter free licenses you have or have
left you can always click on the company
information link and on the company
information page you can scroll down and
you can see you have 5,000 chatter free
licenses so that way you always know
exactly how many chatter free licenses
you have available
our next topic is going to be
customizing chatter email notifications
keep the following points in mind when
customizing chatter email notifications
chatter email notifications can be
customized to show the sender
information and the company logo in the
footer email settings can be configured
on a personal or group basis so this is
an important area of Salesforce because
users some users really like to get
emails of everything that's going on in
chatter and then others don't want any
emails at all so this topic is around
the idea that some people will want a
mail some people won't and as an
administrator of the system you have the
ability to control that so let's let you
actually look at some of these settings
in Salesforce so I'm in the setup area
of Salesforce and I got here by clicking
on set up in the top right hand corner
scrolling down and I opened up chatter
and then email settings and then back up
at the top I see here I have a bunch of
different email settings for starters I
can allow emails or disallow them so if
I turn them off that means that nobody's
going to get chatter emails from
Salesforce but I'm going to turn that on
the next one here is allow email replies
so this is actually a pretty neat
feature where if someone's mentioned in
the chatter post they're gonna be able
to respond right from an email in their
inbox
they won't even have to log into
Salesforce to do it so I'm going to
check that checkbox because we want
email replies to be available we also
want to allow posts via email and allow
attachments via email so you have the
ability to restrict all of this but
we're gonna turn all of this on so what
this does is it gives the users the
ability to actually control which
chatter emails they receive and which
emails they don't
now to demonstrate this I'm going to
jump over to my settings area and
actually see what options I have
available so here you can see manage my
chattering email notifications and I'm
going to click email notifications so as
you can see on this screen you have the
ability to choose when you get an email
when you don't get an email or if you
want to receive any emails at all so
let's say for example that I don't want
to get an email whenever someone shares
a post I just made I can uncheck that
checkbox there and likewise for comments
or mentions messages or endorsements I
have the ability to control whether or
not I get an email when this stuff
happens I can also control when I get a
personal digest so Salesforce will send
you an email recap of any conversations
that were had during the day if you
choose that daily option or you can just
receive it on a weekly basis and check
that one there personally I don't find a
lot of value in the digest so my option
is never down here you also have the
ability to choose the frequency on the
groups that you join so same deal do you
want an email for every post daily
digest or weekly digests and then down
here you also have the ability to
control it on a per group basis so maybe
for the company group you want to get an
email on every post but maybe for this
customer group you really don't ever
need any emails there so to save these
settings you just click Save and the
settings on this page is applied just
for your individual user so you don't
there isn't an area in Salesforce to
control this for everyone in the company
this would only be for you and you alone
