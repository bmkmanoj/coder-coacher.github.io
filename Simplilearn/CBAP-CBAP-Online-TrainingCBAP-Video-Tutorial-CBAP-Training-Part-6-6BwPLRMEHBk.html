certified business analysis professional
cpap preparatory course offered by
simply learn in the previous module we
discussed Enterprise analysis in this
module we will understand requirement
analysis this module is important as it
collects most of the information in a
form which details and validates the
requirements that support solutions the
deliverables most of this module is
dedicated to the discussion on how to
drill down into requirements and
determine if the suggested requirements
can actually support the solution and
its desired results the tasks employed
to determine the details of the
requirements are prioritizing organizing
defining assumptions and constraints
modeling verifying and validation let us
begin with the agenda of this module in
the next slide
we'll begin by understanding what
requirements analysis is we'll then move
on to discuss prioritized requirements
followed by organized requirements will
then define assumptions and constraints
finally we'll conclude with verifying
and validating requirements let us find
out what requirement analysis is in the
next slide
requirement analysis is providing the
best requirements support to a solution
to a need
analysis of sponsor stakeholder needs
start with the elicitation process the
foundation of any successful project is
correctly identifying the need sometimes
it may not be seen as a need by some
stakeholders normally the sponsor of a
project holds the key to what is seen as
need for example stakeholders may not be
aware of certain market changes which
the executives in the organization may
feel that they must take action on on
the other hand stakeholders at the point
of process concerned may not agree with
the need identified by a different
department in the company for example
operations may not see the necessity of
taking the time to track certain phases
of a process but accounting may need the
information that is why it is important
to clearly define the need and how it
might affect the company currently or in
future moreover the need usually has to
be within the stated goals of the
company consensus from all levels in the
sphere of influence of the need and its
solution should reach a clear majority
consensus on the need and the possible
requirements needed for a potential
solution moreover if there are any
changes to these fundamental factors a
new agreement must be reached before
proceeding further with the analysis
different stakeholders may have
different needs and the BA have to help
uncover any potential conflict of needs
solutions and requirements sometimes as
the process unfolds stakeholders not
seen directly in bold with the need
solution requirement chain may become
involved with the process after the
changes have been made that is why it is
important to revisit the stakeholder
list roles and responsibilities once a
solution has been modeled and tested
any potential complex need to be
discovered before the real cost of
implementation anytime there are any
significant changes in need requirement
or solution
the consensus mechanism must be
revisited and signed off by the sponsor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
