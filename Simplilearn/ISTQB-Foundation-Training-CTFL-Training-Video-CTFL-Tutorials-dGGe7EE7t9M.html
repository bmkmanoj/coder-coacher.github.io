software testing before diving into
testing objective activities and
principles debugging is part of the
development activity that identifies
analyzes and removes defects this is
done by developer on their piece of code
testing is the activity of
identification of defects and is done by
testers these two terms are often
confused with each other and many times
used interchangeably it is therefore
important to understand that these two
terms are different and are used by
different teams to identify different
kinds of defects review is another term
which we need to be aware of in context
of testing reviews can be performed on
deliverables like documents code test
plan test cases etc while testing can
only be done when the executable code is
ready reviews can be done on kinds of
documents and at all stages of
development reviews are commonly
referred to as static testing technique
as these are done without executing the
code these are very important for each
software / product as finding a defect
early will reduce the cost and time of
the software stroke product testing is
done by testers in similar environment
to production there are different kinds
of testing levels types and techniques
to do testing on any software we will
see them in detail in upcoming sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
