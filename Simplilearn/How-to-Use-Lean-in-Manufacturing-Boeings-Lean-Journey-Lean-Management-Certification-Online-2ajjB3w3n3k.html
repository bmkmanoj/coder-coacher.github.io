training by simply learn this training
is about lean management and it will
provide you with details on what it is
and how you can use it in your
organization in this section I will
provide you with an introduction to lean
management this will act as a foundation
for the remaining part of this course we
will start with the agenda and then move
forward with the training content
here is the agenda we'll start with the
background of lean manufacturing then
talk about elimination of waste from
manufacturing process provides some of
lean tool implementation and then take a
case study on Boeing's lean journey and
conclude the lesson with challenges in
the next slide we will start with lean
manufacturing background
background lean manufacturing is not a
collection of best practices from which
manufacturers can pick and choose it is
a production philosophy a way of
conceptualizing the manufacturing
process from raw material to finish
goods and from design concept to
customer satisfaction lean is truly a
different way of thinking about
manufacturing while there are several
product innovations happening in the
manufacturing industry organizations are
largely focused on efficient ways of
producing things this is largely because
of today's context of an increasingly
competitive immediate global market
requiring companies to innovate conceive
and deliver products fast at a lower
cost and of better quality than their
global competitors lean manufacturing is
a leading manufacturing paradigm of the
fast-paced market economy with a
fundamental focus on the systematic
elimination of waste that holds the
potential to produce both meaningful
environmental results and financial
well-being while Japanese manufacturers
embraced lean as the biggest hope in
recovering effectively from a war-torn
economy in the 1950s today companies
embrace lean manufacturing for the
following three fundamental reasons
first the highly competitive globalized
market of today requires that companies
lower costs to increase margins and/or
decrease prices through the elimination
of all non value-added aspects of the
enterprise this helps achieve the
efficiency goal of lean manufacturing
