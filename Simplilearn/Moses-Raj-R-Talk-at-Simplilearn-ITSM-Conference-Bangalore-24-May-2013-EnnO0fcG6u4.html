of workshops with people and all that so
some of the things which I am going to
talk is finna mentally from that angle I
was in Australia when I see service
mindset in very different ways I was in
Australia typical indian guy I was very
young then at that time not that I'm too
old now so I was standing there all I
needed was a pen and a notebook and that
was with the custody of the front of his
person who was the receptionist so I
went and asked this person all you need
to do is go right in a register ask
there give me the pen and notebook it's
exactly what I did i wrote i did not
even care to see who's sitting there I
started writing I said I need a pen and
a notebook and she was looking at me I
knew she was looking at me but I was
trying to avoid her stealth and then I
can't avoid where she was constantly
looking yet and she said can you put a
smile and say please and then ask now
that was like a slap but anyway but I'm
telling you now once again we will do
this exercise I'll say good morning with
all your passion as much as possible say
good morning back is it ok good morning
friendcaster I know you are all awake
not great so I want to just guess get a
sense of the room how many this is
somewhere you'll need to stand up please
bear with me i'm not going to make it
stand for long I just want to get a
sense how many of you are working with
something to do IT Service Management
for the last more than one year
Wow fantastic please mr. keep standing
now now I'll this quite a lot so how
many are more than five years keeps
turning rest can sit while the average
experience is very high rope how we are
more than 10 years keep standing rest of
them please sit Wow so I had a lot to
learn from all of you now thank you so
much is I know so now what I'm going to
speak is about a journey which we went
through in implementing ITIL in our
internal IT department and what we
learnt what came out what did not come
out and what can be the possible reasons
why things weren't coming out and how we
are trying to deal with it now that's
exactly the journey which I am in
surgery which is ongoing which is what
I'm going to talk to you typically i was
there in a simply learn conference on
project management last year and
typically what they used to do is put me
just before lunch and that has something
with it everyone's stomach will be
ticking so they'll be wondering why this
guy is speaking so long and so what
happens but there is an advantage for me
when i finish there won't be any
questions but because i said there's a
feedback this time there would be one
ahead of the lunch so anyway so i have
to take some questions i will to cam he
said that's a very good question next
question please
okay we'll take some questions at the
end so that's no this session is about
service management so Who am I now i can
relate myself or the guys they are
standing there now my i am a
practitioner of quality assurance the
quality assurance what do we do there is
a perceived gap always there is a gap
between what the customer really wants
or perceives to want it to what we
actually deliver so there is a gap the
gap can be because of multiple reasons
one because the customer may not be able
to articulate it in many cases second
maybe that he articulates we are not
able to understand it or we understood
but still our capabilities aren't so
good that we are not able to deal with
it right it can be multiple reasons but
moment there is a gap quality assurance
as a job there that's exactly why I'm
employed I believe so much so I having
doing this for a last decade and a half
I have come up come across so many
situations the way the gaps have been
dealt with the gaps have been filled
with in many different ways it exists
everywhere so what do we do we help
fundamentally measure the gap in some
ways or qualify the gap in some ways
right so once we qualify and make it
visible to the guys then this change
starts happening so my job is successful
the moment I am able to make the team
realized that there is a gap right so
that's what we do and then we partner
with them to work with them in multiple
ways in in helping them to move ahead
and closing the gap in a systematic way
things don't change overnight right
that's where the change management comes
into place so that's what exactly what I
do I handle the quality assurance
function for collabera solutions we are
not a large team we have between here
and we have an office in trivandrum we
are roughly a 10-member team so that's
exactly what our slices so we are
considerably small than the
generation that we had some time back so
but some of the experiences though we
are small some of the experiences what
I'm going to share comes from the recent
journey that we went through so that's
exactly what i am what what I do so what
are the ways in which the industry tries
to fix these gaps now how are we being
trying in the service management space I
will walk you through all the three
we'll do a small exercise the
fundamentally industry ties into three
ways one is they set the set of goals
right and they start measuring against
the goals and they have put initiatives
which will put which will be helping
them to move towards the goals that is
one of the major major methods which
works very well you don't need to use
any methodologies any techniques a
simple approach like that will
definitely work I have made it work use
that as a simple tool with two R's the
team get a sense oh we have we stand
here we want to move will do that
exercise right now the second method
which we typically uses use a
methodology like say if it is a software
development work we use CMMI or if it is
an organization when I was I started my
career and mrf so we use science or 9000
as a means to get the organization to be
more closer to what the delivery has to
be so it can be a methodology like that
or it can be a technique like a six
sigma lean and all that now I'll touch
upon ITIL in detail that's the focus of
my discussion let me but let me qualify
these other two what they are there are
a lot of misconceptions about what they
what they really are let me touch upon a
lean many many of them think the moment
you get a Six Sigma project and every of
your problem is going to get solved
because there are some six sigma guys
also think just because you have a six
sigma hammer everywhere you can go and
keep hitting right but they all work
only in certain situations
to really understand what lean is we
organized a trip you can also go to
trader from your organization if you ask
and request I don't know if any of you
visited the Toyota factory fantastic now
you please go and see you will see
really lean in action everything is a
streamlined flow every step is very
clearly demarcated as to what that step
is and how it has to be done and what
can go wrong what cannot go wrong how
what is the time fixed the time is fixed
or every two minutes 32 seconds there is
a step that is done so which means
within that two minute study the seconds
it moved from that step to the next step
the conveyor is kindness Lee moving it
doesn't stop so the car is fitted as the
conveyor is moving and this guy fits
moves back the next guy starts the next
two minute 32 seconds he he looks at how
the guy has fixed before if there is a
problem he pulls a string which means
the line stops and if that line stoppage
is less than 32 minutes 33 seconds then
the line continues so there is no wait
wait age time so it is just a stream
line flow now if we can think of making
this flow better and better our
productivity our overall cycle that
significantly improves right that is
exactly what they really do now how much
of that we can do an IT how much of that
really happens in such a stream line
flow is a question mark but then if
someone thinks it does not apply then it
is a problem but it is fundamentally of
flow thinking be it any of the concepts
like theory of constraint or any of the
lean methods like a con bond or anything
it is all designed to help make the flow
streamlined and streamlined and
streamlined so in your area if problem
is fundamentally about how to streamline
the work if you can use lean techniques
it'll really help
right because it will help you to
dissect into every small small step and
see how the whole thing flows and who
does what is there anything which is
unnecessarily being done why should it
be done so all that flow thinking comes
in with lean and it was really a I
opener when we visited we took the
entire management also there so they
also could see this real thing so they
start believing what we are really
saying the Six Sigma is fundamentally a
very very precision oriented technique
now when I mean a precision oriented
technique it helps you to really see the
variability in the system where the
variability is extremely high you have
to really finely dwell down dwell down
and go to the root of the problem this
is exactly what is causing the
variability and attack that now do we
have situations which needs such a level
of accuracy and precision in our
analysis now it's a question mark you
will need to answer that so having a six
sigma and lean is not the solution to
all the problems but it does solve quite
a bit of problems so with that I'll
leave that that's not my focus of the
discussion as well but then the reason
why I'm saying all this is there a lot
of reishi because every company has a
reason that as a goal number of Six
Sigma projects are number of lean
projects so whatever they do they will
convert that into a lean project and put
it there right are a Six Sigma project
in put together the whole objective is
defeated right now let me come back to
the first point a simple exercise let us
do this exercise how it's in 10 minutes
or say 15 minutes are further for our
sake we'll take one step and see how
quickly we can judge what's the gap and
how we can move it you can do this for
your team's it is a very involved
exercise for the team let's take what do
you think is one of the itsms objective
any one objective
Sifl didn't print
any any one objective
okay we will keep that on call will take
something much more simply she ain't
reliable networking system fair enough
right safe
the level
efficient
networking system
No
we all are you are a recipient of in
your organization you have been getting
this service right from your IT in a
scale of one to five now the next step
the first step is what is the objective
next step is you have to guess get a
sense of where do you stand right and
where do you want to be now in your area
now I don't have a data that many
problem many times the issue comes
because everyone wants to have data and
data and data and they it's gets into
analysis paralysis right instead of
really figuring out what the real gap
and how again qualified take a simple
five-point scale in a five-point scale
value think are as an industry the
networking service we get typically
stands let us take a typical BSNL or any
of the service providing a good
broadband service let us take that says
that's a bet you think they sent the
scale of one to five 143.5 three
what is its one
okay the ability to connect or a contact
personnel to solve is a challenge okay
when it fails what else why someone said
2.5 someone said
ownership like what do you mean the
ownership okay fine what else why
someone said for what is so great there
yeah seamless connectivity yeah okay
fantastic okay great so you feel there
is so much why did you not know why this
cell phone is not normal the reason why
I am doing this is try this exercise
very genuinely for 10 minutes you will
get a list of issues and the team will
be able to identify a value say 3.5 or
whatever letters you can do this is
their customer I did not have data now
this is the current state
now how do I move from here to say 4.5
or five what should I do I just fix
these gaps
I do this exercise again in the game
it's a very simple exercise it is not an
exercise which involves lot of
methodology it results it just is a
people-centric exercise it is about a
set of people and finally we generate a
single sheet of all the objectives a
typical sheet of all the objectives
where we stand on the left what are the
typical challenges against each of the
objective and then what are the
initiatives that the people propose and
it had just happens in half a day or
sometimes in a day and the buy-in is
much higher the ownership is much higher
with the team because they want to
change now because it is all what they
have said now this is a very very easy
effective tool in your themes that you
can adopt i right but this may not give
a solution this may not give you a sense
of direction of very very methodical
deep best practice driven or very
evaluation oriented independent view
there is a risk with this because no
matter what you do there are some things
which the people don't want to accept
right it has its own issues so this any
isolation may not be the permanent
permanent cell a perfect solution but
this is a very good solution for you to
really baseline where your team stands
or where who more you are trying to
consult and help where they standard a
good starting point right this will help
to align them to get them to really
start working on a change plan so I
leave it that so this is how typically
in service management people have been
trying to fix the gap either through a
typical goal then to a metric finally
what we do take all the objectives
translate into goals dan says the
parameters which can be measured and put
goals against it and translate into
people and finally they start tracking
and the initiatives get done so we keep
monitoring against those measurable
parameters we are moving or not so that
the gap is getting closed or not right
so either that or it can be a
fundamental very
systematic analysis like a six sigma
leaf or a very methodical use of a
standard so my session from here is
going to get off into the most up in the
thing on ITIL now is ITIL really popular
what do you think finally pop okay I I
also wanted to answer this question to
myself so I wanted to get into somewhere
this is a Ngram viewer in Google not
sure if you have seen it it's very
interesting you can go and key in any
number of I don't know that the maximum
number of books you can compare you can
go and key in a book name or a title a
word and the title and you can see
whether how many as a percentage how
much is this book between a certain
period to certain period this is i think
is still 2008 is what the data gives and
in the last 30 years is what I 30 30 40
years is what I excited to see what's
happening about people talking about so
this is I just did a comparison to a
service management an idea now you can
see that idil is kind of the books being
written about using IDL or about ITIL
it's kind of in the increased so there
is a growing popularity next is much
more interesting which is this is a
search trend in Google you can go there
is a search trend here this I compared
between CMMI and itl who is idea if you
put ITIL it will kind of give all words
ready to ITIL v3 ITIL certification and
ITIL this idea any anything about idea
similarly CMMI is about CMM CMMI all
those related words it captures so
somewhere CMMI is kind of people as have
stopped searching about CMMI people have
started searching kind of it's also a
declining trend but there is the summer
and 2008 there seems to have been much
higher interest but still the interest
level seems to be high so it is it is
there there is a lot of hype about it
and all that but that does it solve the
set give the value that it claims to be
there are a lot of time so now what is
this ITIL now I i'll skip the slide i
think most of you know at a very high
level what idil is fundamentally a set
of best practices on the IT service
management space started in the UK
government my to be the start was very
interesting for the multiple reasons
someone in a non IT person triggering a
thought that you need a method or a set
of ways to do it and that gave birth to
a model ID I'll or a framework all ideal
sorry so from then it has evolved and
the v3 is the latest version and it has
five areas from strategy design from
design how do you transition into the
operations and finally managed in the
operations and then it's an improvement
cycle so that's the iti so we started
this journey this is the one or two
slides there are the content slides
yells and other slides are too much
content please don't get too much to
read this I'll walk you through that
somewhere in last middle of last year
there are a lot of escalations about our
internal IT function that there is a
clear-cut disconnect between the team
which is the IT team as well as and the
business team and the business team
always expects everything to be perfect
IT team says this is what is the best
that we can give we do have dependencies
we have vendor dependencies we have
internal partners from another center
who are we are dependent on them to
provide the service so multiple issues
were there now so finally we proposed
okay we will go for an ITIL journey
which will solve the problem so the
first thing was I don't think this is
going to follow the problem which is
also true
right but then there was a rather sir
kizim in the whole thing now you guys
keep claiming all these models will
solve all these ISO standards will solve
so we were proposing training the people
on ITIL benchmarking louie gap analysis
visa viel finally getting it certified
for is a 20k that was the thing we
proposed now there was quite a bit of
sarcasm this is not going to change
anything on the ground right this is
just income it away another
certification it will pass and all eyes
or certifications you can almost get it
like paying some money so that's the way
because anyway auditors get paid for
auditing so it's not that they have they
also don't want to hurt a company so
it's a it's all a game it's going on so
this is not going to be any value now we
knew it's not going to be a perfect
solution right because the issues are
much more fundamental than typical model
can solve but then you did solve some
problems now my interest here is to see
what problems it solved and what it did
not solve and why it did not solve
that's the interest of me in sharing
this case study so what did we do we
like any typical evaluation so we got a
partner who can do a very objective
independent gap assessment and they did
it we trained all our guys on ITIL
foundation and then from there we made
workgroups and these groups started
defending the process we were very
particular that no fellow from outside
is no consultant from outside is going
to come and define process for us the
guys on the ground has to define the
process so there is ownership there so
they all SAT multiple row war rooms
rolled over we call it they what they
were called process action teams and
they SAT together for days debating
discussing defining the processes
deciding on the tool which they we need
to buy and all those things we had a
tool it the configuration managed part
was in there so they bought a tool for
that they integrated so all those things
were discussed debated we define some
ten process areas fundamental
process documents came right from
incident problem change configuration
and all those basic stuff were defined
and put up and then we went through a
series of assessments now what really
changed typically our SLS were very very
only for request they sell as well many
of the things there weren't much SLS for
example when we do a network service if
the network fails there wasn't a celeb
there for an insolent but for the
network itself on the availability
target they were measuring but there are
not a commitment this is the level we
will give you so a lot of lack kunas
they were there in the system so all
those holes got plugged so everywhere
what is the minimal expectation the
field has for every service they came up
with some for broad services and each of
the four broad services there were some
three sub services so in total of around
12 to 15 services were there and for
each what is the target it was all very
neatly documented in a catalog against
that what's the measurement and all
those were defined so he dearly did Bill
bring in a lot of operational clean up
into the entire setup of course it was
also because our setup was never
challenged we were at a very low
maturity right some of your situations
may be much more higher but it starts
thinking what is the service you offer
each service how you really are going to
commit what is it you are committing so
we had to figure out what is the
critical service or what is the
non-critical service so in all that so
we went through a large exercise so the
team finally agreed on the whole thing
now that that whole catalog has come a
dashboard started coming this is the
service this is where we stand this is
the matrix saying this is overall health
of the service so all the dashboard
started coming so there is much once
again the gap started reducing
what did the team did took each service
they did a component failure analysis
which are the components have manual
curtain work which of the components
have auto fail over which other
components have no failures if it fails
the service face so that entire risk was
a fast the complete it was done a very
fantastic x-ray the whole team side
together did this component failure
analysis because not a large team but
this brought in a very clear view of how
vulnerable their systems are where are
the things they're running a risk right
so it's a very simple exercise of a
matrix take the survey stake all the
components and started mapping whether
it is a I think the user not connected a
notation the notation was either auto
cut our is there aught of failover is
there a za if there is a manual federal
as I am there is no failover there is a
X so they could see where all the X's
and how much excess can really impact
the that sub service and the overall
service so it was a fantastic exercise
which gave a lot of visibility to
whether whatever you have committed are
you in a position to really deliver it
really helped them to see what is the
gap that they are still having now then
what happened there was a it was a
change management chaos last 2012 they
had just eight changes documented rest
all who had sneaked under the belt so
you don't know who made those changes
how the changes were made what change
was made nothing was there so that was
another thing which was streamlined now
every month there is a change a change a
board which meets looks at all the
proposed changes then there are
emergency changes there are standard
changes now so it kind of brought in a
lot of mature practice in the way the
change management is done end of the
month there is a change effectiveness
meeting the change effectiveness meeting
we defined a very nice simple evaluation
template which kind of gifts are they it
doesn't go out a change level how many
changes were rolled back it matches that
if there is a rollback what are the
reasons for it how many changes had
repeat incidents right after the change
done and all that what is objective of
the changes been really met or not so
like that some six or seven aspects the
team collectively sits it has business
it has pete has business representatives
it has the IT it has security it has
quality all these i sit together
evaluate how we really done a good job
so that also brings in a feedback
mechanism to that will change management
so change management is really come a
long way I am not sure if I'm not saying
it's perfect but it where we were the
lack of accounting on change things have
really was Lee improved now we had
dependency with multiple other groups so
all those things became an oil a now
this oil isn't really working though
very well and then we started an area
where the team was spending extremely
high amount of time we did not know how
much time each one is each each of them
is spending on what activity there are
so many reports being generated so we
took that area to optimize the entire
reporting and and those those kind of
tasks so these were some of the changes
we brought so he change that I talked
about you can see that the che the gap
was actually reducing right that's
exactly the value we got but then let's
evaluate now this is exactly what we
finally put up now how much did it
change in the operations it is bring
governance and operations very much you
take any of the governance process
operational processes it made an impact
in our incident management it made an
impact on our problem management it made
an impact in our all the event
management everything got clean up now
we go one level higher what is it in our
change management configuration
management release management testing
has it improved yes this journey
definitely hit the ground there
now one level higher did it really
change the service design part we
actually when he documented and did some
change some some means to assess what is
the vulnerability from an availability
angle are do we have sufficient capacity
or not we did raise some questions did
fundamentally change things it wasn't
now go to one level higher did it really
though we started lot of things in the
business relationship been here to see
SAT and all that feedback some reports
in a nice dashboard way to really
improve the connect very limited
now so there is a level where it
impacted where it did not affect right
now at this juncture do you see a
similar phenomena in your place or do
you see a very different not in your
places yo when you involved with this
kind of journey for multiple years right
you agree with it do you have a
different view to it feel pretty sure
there was none in our case we did if
there was some impact it is not that
there was no impact the SLA started
looking slightly better he doesn't it
was bad certain critical accounts where
we had some issues the performance
became better they had oil less now they
started putting a while a with this team
so this team is accountable for that so
all that got cleaned up responsiveness
slightly improved so there was some
business impact there was some customer
better customer connect now the thing is
every quarter the IT team goes in
presence what are the improvements we do
from a large projects as well as
projects and operational changes every
quarter they go and present to the
business they send the dashboard of all
the parameters and this improvement is a
presentation they make to bring a better
connect of what changes they are
bringing it did bring some change but
did really improve the alignment it
really improve the business connect we
will really make the team Proctor he
doesn't still the same fires continue
right still there is a huge gap so we
this where we finally came to now we
will do a quick so what so I was looking
at various case studies in industry are
we missing something r is the industry
also talking the same thing the same
question I asked we wanted to see from
various places whether is it similar non
similar so this was an exercise I
enhance the exercise we did some of the
search sometime back we looked at a
couple of case studies published in the
listing way from 2001 there are multiple
case studies till now huge number of
case studies is there in the open open
area right so we took up all the case
studies now some of the case this is we
used this for case studies in presenting
the value of y we should go for an ITIL
initially right so these are the four
case studies we used initially visa kind
of worked on improving their monitoring
and systems outages and reducing the
incidence by ask which is seventy-five
percent so impact they could see was in
service operations they did something on
service design nationwide implementing
ki IDL process that led to forty percent
reduction in system outages so somewhere
availability management plus operations
that seems to have been the case Capital
One and some of them are actually our
calc lines so that was one of the
reasons why you picked up these case
studies initially somewhere since 2001
they reduced their system crashes
fundamentally incidents and all that
bank of america a lot of these cases
which are fundamentally once again on
either change management release
management or this we couldn't see any
case study which is significantly
improved costs right now i'm not saying
it is not there this is the original
case so then we were recently analyzing
this this is and there is a very nice
thing i came across whole giving a sense
of what are the various case studies
right and most some of them are so
brilliant that they could really bring
in a significant cost reduction but the
leverage for cost reduction is by
increase reducing the incidence and
improving the help desk that is the help
desk team size and one thread seems to
be running that most of the improvements
on this area whether it is being using
six sigma or lean or whatever that is is
aimed at reducing the cost factor that
is spent into the IT management and we
went through a case study i was just
looking at so quite a lot of case
studies from all the industries biet
government bait telecom sector bait
healthcare made a travel beat everywhere
there are multiple case studies put up
there across all the things one
predominant feature are most often the
case study cited are mostly in the
service operation service transition
which are ample number of case studies
to become but the moment it comes to the
higher level how much satisfaction in to
really draw how much business connect an
alignment it really draw whatever that
means right now those come kind of case
studies were far few those kind of
practices being published or for you now
that doesn't mean idil is weak right ID
I'll may have practices but the way we
have deciphered and way we have really
brought it to the ground or the way it
is being interpreted and put in there is
a perceived gap which is really a gap
which we need to really build it as
practitioners so this is another area we
owe this is the area that we identified
so if you stop here it's not going to
really take us to a major impact that we
are really looking at so we are going
through a cycle now and that cycle is
what I'm going to explain now I want to
dissect this problem through another
means and I seriously wanted to know why
is this phenomenon saw right so I want
your help yeah please
the mic the continual improvements is
one which will differentiate one
last sides are not seeing any any case
studies are even off SAS okay yes
improvement actually why I removed it
the reason is CSI is one which cuts
across all these areas there are no
practices in CSI right kind of you can
use any methodology that they give a
nine-point methodology or seven point
methodology right fundamentally wanted
chases baseline where you are defined
where you want to go and then put a plan
to go there that's exactly in a nutshell
what they are saying so it can be to
improve your business alignment it can
be to improve service design factors it
can be to improve operations and reduce
costs there so it can be anywhere so
most of the case studies have come from
actually implementing a CSI program
correct with along with some of the
practices so what what it means is that
no continuous improvements is the block
is there it is
the efficiency in the operations not
under like many bringing the
productivity or the innovation or the
transformation in the that block exactly
that's exactly where is my point is as
well so traditionally the way it is
deciphered and put in it impacts
somewhere it's good but as practitioners
if we have a closed eye to this is the
only way then we may miss the bus right
how do we challenge ourselves to see the
other dimensions which the model by
design the way it is understood and
implemented doesn't really impact right
because yes we may do everything by the
book still may not make a huge dent at
the end of it right are you with me till
now yes let's do a small exercise I need
your help all in video is to say whether
it is great well measured is the
measurement system a factor not a factor
or none not very clearly measured right
I'll tell you what the exercises so this
is the list of process areas right we'll
go from operations I want to see why the
whole system works the way it works
right it is not that people are not
intelligent right people are not caring
about things there are we practice pneus
and experts always are trying to push
and strive to improve and improve so I
want to see and my area of interest is
measurements and I thought you by
dealing with measurements right now
that's a quality guys easiest tool you
put a measure measure it beat the people
automatically they will start changing
right now that sells I wanted to see
whether what is the maturity of
measurements in easy area to show to the
user to show to the practitioner to show
to the management that it is really
mature right so the parameter we are
trying to assess now is effectiveness of
the measurement system is there a
measurement system really capable of
measuring that area and
acting that it is this is the exact
expected level it has to operator let's
go one by one now let us take incident
management what do you think how is our
measurement system very good average not
good
very good
fairly straightforward we know how the
incidents most of them comes through a
tool today we have we yeah so the scope
of this question is is the measurement
system proposed mature now is the
measurement system which is there in the
industry matured enough what is the
question is the measurement system is
you're asking do we have the measurement
system in the industry let's take in
industry in the general so these are
generally it is a generalized view some
of them are my perspectives I may be
wrong I am NOT a great authority in
order ITIL expert certified I come from
a very independent view of a quality
assurance view right of any system that
needs to be measured can be
systematically improved that's the
viewpoint I come back right so let's
look at incident management we agree
that the measurement system is quite
capable today it's quite effective we
can look at data like response
resolution critical response critical
ticket response major ticket response
all that we can dissect the data and
it's very clear to any person no one can
fool around especially at some
organization may not do that's a
different thing we weren't doing very
effectively but today our capability in
measuring improving looking at the data
reporting everything is very good what
do you think of a problem management
effectiveness of the measurement system
has good
can we say that looking at the problem
data yeah these guys are very good in
problem and his mentor I don't think so
we haven't we just got we were zero list
of problems last year now we have
started seeing some problems in the
problem list that's all and even if that
list would have been much longer I don't
think anyone can qualify and say yeah
this system is really effectively
working so i would give up hello service
request very good like very close with
incident even management fairly good lot
of tools are there it clearly three
triggers and all that right access
management I won't know much about this
area but I chose to give is that we did
not at least have an issue with a kind
of volumes that we were dealing now
let's come to change management
configuration management release and
deployment testing we may have measures
my question is is the measurement system
really effective by looking at it can we
judge this system is really operating at
a fairly good level of maturity right
what do you think of change management
at medium great not great
what is not allow that
difficult it's a judgment so I'm just
using this as a sense to communicate and
engage with you that's it so it's a
generic view it given a situation things
may change vastly change management be
once we institution lucker there is a
person element in it but the moment we
started putting the change management
process in place the changes started
getting the log we could measure the
effectiveness of change fairly it may be
a judgmental exercise but we could see
the change management really working
none of the change was getting getting
escaped because there is a business
there is everyone connected so it has
processes in it place to bring the whole
thing but when it comes to sorry the
yellow I don't think looks clear here it
all looks like green but the way
configuration management we do have a
system today but how much of it is
really effectively working there is
still a lot of gray area release and
deployment how much is it really
effectively done the release and
deployment just that we are releasing
and all that one there is good good
thing about it is there is a feedback
loop which comes if it may create
subsequent incidents but that also
sometimes escapes us it's not that it is
very only that cas are connected so
there is a fair connect but still how
efficient is the release in deployment
working is it foolproof we have no clue
testing is finally okay knowledge
management is another area we have
started putting some knowledge we really
don't know how effective it is there is
no way to measure right we only can know
yes there are some knowledge elements
people are logging in all that how much
is used how effective it is we have no
clue now let us go to this area it will
be much more interesting
I'll go a bit faster now except service
level management and supplier management
where the metrics are pretty fairly
decently established governed you can
use that to judge all other areas the
measurement system wasn't really telling
where we really stand up there is a gap
now what do you think is service
portfolio which talks about the business
relationship feature in all that what do
you think yeah
this is the most i have not we have we
have not been able to get a single
metric of course with our in our
scenario at least amber just
generalizing there may be brilliant
papers written that there are
methodologies that are there in the
industry but this is what we could
muster so the reason why I'm putting
this slide is that you can see the areas
that are not really making an impact
doesn't have a clear-cut measurement
system the woman there is a measurement
system fairly well-established family
well governed things start changing or a
period of time now that doesn't mean the
most obvious solution obviously will be
to go but a measurement system but maybe
not it's not possible because the d
areas we are dealing with alignment to
business what is alignment of business
what does it mean right it's a very very
fluid a very superfluous definition this
what we can give so somewhere we need to
change this paradigm now is
fundamentally what is coming out my
service excellence if I talk about my
customer centricity is a problem the way
I need to overcome some of these areas I
need to have a different approach to the
whole thing the way we need to move
forward may have a different means to
attack the whole thing so now what can
those be I just want to leave you with
four thoughts and that would help my
presentation the first thought I want to
leave you is customer centricity now we
did what is actually happening now
the good or bad ITIL has made a set of
SLS now the set of SLS what is actually
making his essence fundamentally to me
is a minimal expectation or the most
likely expectation of a system it
doesn't push a system to be excellent
right if you ask when whatever whatever
you put for a ticket we put eight hours
as a cycle time if it is a some slightly
a lower priority if it's a higher
priority wave of ten minutes half an
hour like that now imagine you putting
in your shoe if we have a smaller
problem but still it doesn't really help
you right you will be stuck somewhere
but the point is it's a smaller problem
because there are thousands of machines
in the company and one of machine going
off it's obviously not a high priority
ticket now that doesn't mean that's not
a problem for the person right now it
doesn't really push the system it helps
to see that at least a minimal level is
met I'm not saying every where it can be
met within 15 minutes or half not but
then it doesn't push a system to X
become excellent so that's where the
first point comes the whole system
design makes people think yeah we are
really great because we are met all the
SLS there is a very interesting case
study by singapore airlines now
singapore ramen is known for their
customer service now it is not an
accident that they have been very good
in customer service I'll cite an
incident which happened and I was told
to me by my friend he was stranded in an
airport where the flight got delayed
what they did they came they came an
announcement that's why it is delayed we
will keep you posted every now and then
we will be notifying you they said that
so there was an air of discontent and so
that's what happened initially then
suddenly one person arrived saying that
you may be feeling chill have this
blanket
so so this is the first thing so these
are all sitting together yngwie worst
then came an announcement saying that
we'll be serving you some light food
light snack and all that so there came
snacks and they were fed then it was
still announcement came it's still
further delayed so they got food and
finally they kept on getting the thing
when it what's happening what's
happening and when they were about to
board the plane everyone said you have
been a great you have been very patient
please accept the gift as a token of our
opposition for your patience they were
trained the system was designed to face
in adverse situation which the Paris
passengers are going through there was
another interesting practice that they
have any person across the globe you go
and ask a certain question the answer
will be same the consistency of answer
now we talk about process process
process for doing our activities they
have a process for answering the
questions what is the right answer for a
question now the responsiveness of a
query or a or a issue that a person may
take it to their core counter is
addressed in a much much in a very short
time and they pride about it now it is
know whether it's not an accident
actually what is the aftermath of this
kotak mahindra bank was a recent entrant
into the space of banking right there
were every established players like
ICICI H HDFC's and big big guys like SBI
is and all that and they are not
thriving now kotak mahindra bank finally
decided that we have to do something
they called the singapore airlines to
come and do a consulting for them and
singapore aliens came and found out you
guys your guys on the front doesn't know
really what to say
they keep saying something so since then
their major focus was on training the
frontline executors as to what kind of
questions will come how they should
answer how consistently they have to
answer and since then kotak mahindra
bank has grown significantly in this
high competitive banking environment now
that is an example of a great customer
service now if we pride ourselves saying
that that our sls indicate that we are a
great team please sit back and think
that may not really the right answer
right how to leave the third lingering
here it is for you to see what in your
view in your environment will really
mean a great customer service right the
second thought I want to leave with you
is on innovation now
we have this constant challenge in our
organization so whenever we put a
standard process be it a software
process software engineering process
like a review process or a testing
process or even for itsm a standard
process any standard process is only
going to solve fifty to sixty percent of
the real issues it's not going to solve
give solution to 100 percentage of the
operational issues that the team is
going at going through at that point in
time right now how do we overcome this
barrier so we started with with a
program and the program goes something
like this let me give a small exercise
think yeah
okay i have a basket can you transfer
water in this
how
exactly that's not a solution then sorry
fantastic that's an option make it an
ice cube and put it what is it a
solution put the water bottle that it
will transfer water left what else see
that's exactly the point now the moment
I say state a problem which is the first
obvious solution seemed to be what you
possible at the moment I start pushing
my team to go to the next step the
brilliant idea starts coming we did this
exercise another example behave like how
can I continue first the more time okay
another exercise we gave we told a story
this is a guy throwing a party for a set
of people and these set of people in
there in there and he's for elite kind
of people are the audience so he made a
very nice Jews too so so they were about
to serve the Jews is made and kept in a
big play big one and then there is a
eyes which has been brought and it's
about to be mixed and serve chili now
there is a guy who is from the from the
audience or the participant in that was
a one of the most important guy he walks
in here is how I like this juice
fantastic but I like to be chilled now
how are you it doesn't seem to be chill
so he says no no we are going to put the
ice he says he asked the question where
is lies bought from they say that's from
a shop but do you know what water it is
made of I am very particular about
taking any of this I said if that is the
case I don't want to drink now this guy
has a problem
right he has to serve a chilled Jews but
he can't put the ice inside what'd he do
yes
she live in
nice
keep the juice on top of rice yeah what
else say regrets so the moment a problem
looks a big problem the moment you start
generating possibilities and you can we
encourage your team to generate
possibilities your odds of making a
change is going to be much higher that's
exactly how the innovative thinking
starts emanating right and as managers
we both desire to a team to make them
start thinking thinking if there is a
problem yeah it is a problem right but
then start thinking bigger can we still
do something about it instead of saying
that it's a problem problem problem why
can't we do something different about it
we have tried all this fair enough can
we try some one step different and this
when you keep trying new idea starts
coming so this is a I'll leave this here
but I think we haven't as an industry
done very a big deal on this the reason
is this who are engineers engineering is
an applied science profession you apply
signs to solve real-world problems
that's exactly what we learn but when I
learned I never understood this right we
just mugged up something and came so
today also we try to tend to take the
first most easiest option to all
solutions all problems right so if we
can help the team to start looking at
the unobvious help them to seek one step
ahead I think that's when we will make
this change start looking different and
better and better so that's there and i
believe the next round of change is not
going to be based on all these
methodologies like idea and all that
it's going to be highly driven our own
creativity that's exactly what i believe
now measuring value and I know it's a
very touchy area I will give you an
example as to what I have the same
challenge as many of you guys have now
what do i do I have a team of people now
who has to go and consult projects audit
their projects consult them to improve
and all that that's exactly what my team
does as much as as an IT Service
Management you have a problem of value
and alignment I have the same problem
now what do I do now one of the things
we have is a monthly set of milestones
every person commits these are the
milestones I will achieve by the end of
the month at the start of the month they
commit because my team is internal and
no one gives us a schedule no client is
there to give us this is what you should
do it's we generate and we collaborate
with the project's to achieve them now
my measure is how many of that outcomes
are going to make a difference at the
project if I have we typically run
around for a eight member team in
bangalore including me we typically run
around with 120 to 140 outcomes in the
month some are small some are big every
outcome is measured we at the end of the
month we quantify how many we finished
exactly as per the plan we roughly run
around 75 80 / center right and how many
of that some of them are operational you
have to do it anyways but how many of
that really made it change for example
this guy goes and does an audit he finds
a great finding and then the finding is
that there is a perceived miss connect
to the project he goes and puts a Kanban
board and the team starts dying putting
things there they all come together
discuss it and that has made an
improvement in this month great that is
counted as one difference we have made
on the ground and that's counted as one
value I know exactly the start of the
month how many value items that we have
which will make a change on the ground
and that is the reason why we exist you
can figure out your own means it need
not be foolproof it cannot need not be
perfect but you need to have an answer
right it's better to not having anything
right so in your own areas whatever be
the value and it may be cost it may be
some or whatever the means alignment it
may be ideas that you take to the table
right which makes it different it can be
anything but you need to have a
measurement on this value addition else
someone is going to come and tell
something and take the things away from
you
right so that's the third thought I live
with you the fourth thought I leave with
you who is teaming now this thought
emanates from the this is my last
thought I am going to close with this
this is the cmmi was flying big time
right major branding for CMMI in fact
they started bullying the industry as
much to this extent that if you are not
seeing my level Phi you can't even go to
a big bank and or big bank or a big
company and bit for that it still exists
right but then today you saw that the
same eyes popularity is coming down and
agile is eating into it right now why
the simple reason is this see how my no
matter what of all the models that I
have seen for the software industry Co
my from project management angle is
extremely good from a software
engineering angle is extremely good
there are a lot of positives about it
but what it is not is it doesn't tell on
a day-to-day basis how you really work a
jail exactly brings in as to how you
should work and what delivery and value
you will deliver with for every two
weeks every four weeks sometimes even
every week and it is measurable the
measurement can be asked much as I said
how many times we impacted something in
the project how many lean projects we
closed which impacted something in the
which made a difference to the ground
right but it helps to measure some
outcome on a very short duration so that
you don't guy you can't sit and relax
and wait for next 3 months for some
things to happen every two weeks every
week there has to be a change and
everyone has a daily task and the team
in my team we have a come what may there
is a 930 stand up collar and a 930 stand
up call everyone logs in whether they
are at home most of them are an office
by then and they say what I did
yesterday as against a task I planned
what I am going to do today
and am I stuck anywhere that means help
from the manager or the or be from me so
that makes a team self-managed at the
start of the month we have milestones
designed at the middle of the month we
review how we are doing against the
milestones are the end of the month we
quantify the milestones again it is it
makes you measure it makes you move it
makes you give a sense of movement it
gives a purpose for every person in the
team and this teeming and collaboration
is something which is critical now when
I see a typical IT team I see that they
are into multiple silos and the moment
and all these silos are not connected
well and each one is in their own way
unless they're wise we figure a way to
bring some practices to in to make them
collaborate make them work together on a
day-to-day basis make some sense for
them as a meaning to achieve that is
when the check will start moving which
do you think let us take four areas area
number one service operations happens on
time typically yes problems
identification and doing root cause does
it happen on time but slower changes do
they go always on time no come to the IT
projects how much improvement like we
want to virtualize a set of service we
want to move this project is it always
going on time you can see that right
from operations as we grow higher and
higher you see that our commitment to
really do and deliver value keeps lawyer
right we need to figure out a way to
integrate the team to ensure that right
from the fundamental operations like as
typical tickets to problems to the next
changes to the value adding projects all
have to have a focus and on a day to day
basis things have to tick it's like the
middle overs of a cricket match right if
they all start only heating force that
team is not going to end up getting too
many runs right they have to keep
playing
ones and twos and one sent to keep the
scoreboard ticking so that you can
really accelerate and that is exactly
one of the other things which I see that
I dsm really the set the current model
of iti really doesn't go focused on it
you have to augment some means to deal
with it well it will be summarized so
these are my four thoughts IDL has made
a dent into the industry it has brought
in Lord of engineering finest the
management finest into the way we manage
service services in the service
management but then if the customer
centricity is lost if the innovative
pulling is lost then keep the way we do
the various teams are integrate and make
them gallop is lost and if we can put
all these things together the four
things that I talked about it and if you
can measure the value on a regular basis
I think we as itsm will make a much
larger dent than what we are doing today
thank you so much a patient hearing
yeah once it
during the entire case ready and
implementation did you at any point in
time look at the cost of failure and
evaluated did you quantify it at any
point in time we couldn't quantify it we
had couple of s ones we tried
quantifying we what at the moment the
current quantification is for the
critical projects critical accounts what
is the availability loss that is where
we have not put that into a number at
this juncture one of the things we are
right now moving is to measure the IT
cost per person so that we will see what
is happening that's the main thinking at
this juncture we haven't started
quantifying the issue wise what is the
opportunity laws or potential loss to
the business at this juncture we haven't
done a good thought
my name is Alice I work for a 90s M
consulting company called three cover
had a question I think in your second
slide I guess in your journey you
mentioned training as one of the steps
that was after forming your poor team so
how much of impact that had in your
subsequent stages so what we did is we
had a core team a core team of around 12
people plus there were other people who
are interviewing and all that right so
it made our team of around 20 odd people
so he got them voltage and certified it
really helped because we were and the
way to three things it was done the
first of all as a motivational factor
you get certified all right so that was
a carrot in a way there and also when we
did the training was very particular to
get a good trainer who who could really
stand and connect with the ground so we
gave them lot of this thing about how we
really operate what is that services we
offer because we had a infrastructure
management business which deals with a
couple of customers outside we had the
internal IT team which was a major
consumer who was going through the major
change so it was fundamentally because
these two teams there we get all the
flavors to them so they came prepared
with lot of this exercises to deal with
make the people understand and all that
so it was done with that value in mind
so what it did is it brought the
engagement on them to believe that they
can define a process that's exactly what
I would say as an outcome of the
training process how much they really
used it on the ground I was some of the
at least the IT operations guys who are
internal they could really contribute on
the change with every change process was
defined by them implemented by them it
was not a that someone else wrote the
process quality guys did not write any
process I was particular about it the
guys on the ground has to write the
process because you are consumed what we
will do we will create a sheet of all
the line by line of the standards what
we need to comply
you right we will reveal together and
see how much we have met so quality was
fundamentally doing an encouraging role
of helping them structure helping them
think through all these dimensions
helping the mask right questions so they
wrote it and finally it was reviewed so
that way they were the authors of the
process for a large to large extent so
that way it did contribute been making
them aware and won't the change it was
time that way then what we did is for
the ground guys we did an internal
training that training was very
different it wasn't about complete about
ITIL foundation it was a four hour
program where we took very simple
examples like a flip Carter now it took
flipkart and then kind of explained okay
now what is service strategy there that
people could really connect what is
financial management there what is this
there then you go to a pisa store what
is an Operations and what is this then
so it's all used very very simple
examples like what we see the taxi
surveys are some service on a day to day
basis based on which the whole thing was
explained that really connected with
them I hope answer any more questions
my questions about the measurement
framework I think you mentioned it
rather it was a core part of your
presentation when it comes to
measurement framework when it comes to
measurement framework and quantifying
the outcome the specific challenges
which we have faced in our engagement
sees the inclination of the measurement
frameworks if we try to incline it
towards the customer view of the
services it becomes more understandable
but it is difficult from the IT point of
view rather it becomes not doable and if
we incline it towards the IT perspective
it becomes easily doable and I think can
connect with it but from then from the
customers perspective it becomes non
understandable so how do you exactly
balanced you had any specific can you
give an example of that okay still
trying to sue for example when I
structure my management frame my
measurement framework or quantification
of the outcomes if I try to focus on all
the customer centric and customer
understandable outputs to be measured
and present it I have experienced that
my IT just cannot connect with what is
the impact they are making exactly in
the terms of expression of outputs and
if i tell my IT to come up with the
measurement framework which suits them
and which they can easily understand
customer says no i can't connect with it
so is happening place this how do we
balance it yeah so i still haven't got a
sense of which matric you are talking
about but but in a conceptual level let
me try to get there now what when we saw
that in our teams right they are fixing
issues the guy on the ground had no clue
which issue is his priority so what
happened was everyone was reading
something as priority and what is
initially the priority is given by the
person but we had like.we he did not
even have a criteria to relook at it so
one of the change we brought in was a
criteria definition as to how which is
really that critical supercritical which
is the critical which is that not so
critical that kind of made a difference
so when we finally go and say it is a
request comes from a certain group or a
certain person on some area for an
access or whatever that is it has to be
dealt on a higher priority versus
something that kind of helped connect
better with those critical accounts
because initially everything was one
bucket everything was to be for our
radars so there was a high disconnect
this content on it that is possibly one
closer thought I could give but i don't
know that i really have got a sense of
it actually that's precisely what i was
talking about so you are saying it was
IT driven or IT understood measurement
framework and quantification outcomes
and you try to do it the customer focus
on customer understandable but in this
specific case customer dictated
quantification of outcomes I mean there
was the discussion I'm sure but then
ultimately the diktat comes from the
customer and has to be taken okay fine
an extension to this so in this specific
case what I have experienced is IT feels
that they have to take it as a tease and
there is no discussion and kanuk
possible I have you spell have you faced
this specifically or experienced it
still the disconnect exists it is not
that we have solved the disconnect he we
are not talking about a customer end
customer I am talking about our IT team
vs
the business team though all these
changes happens internally and the
reports are going and all that still
there is a heavy amount of disconnect
our discontent whether it is really a
disconnect are only at this content it
still exists still the field thinks
these guys don't understand what my
problem is right it's an ongoing journey
I think only recommendation what I was
giving the IT head is now we have
started this improvement branding in
essence not branding per se sharing the
improvements now many times they the
popular perception when I talk to the
field they say ID doesn't do anything
many things were the ID does is not even
visible to the field so now what the ID
is doing is going and presenting wall
until a hey these are the changes I am
breaking now they are also sharing my
guys are going through a they are
working with the training team to put a
customer facing training for their IT
friend who take the call and the field
engineers so we are training them so
they are going to sharing all this
voluntarily because some of the things
are disconnect which is emanated from
the past it is not really always because
of a ticket issue or something it is
more perceived so only somewhere the
connect and all that will help to remove
some noise and maybe we'll get to avoid
when we can fix that but it is a
constant challenging process that I can
see thank you I think I'm out of time

talking to all of you thank you very
much sir moses is very insightful
