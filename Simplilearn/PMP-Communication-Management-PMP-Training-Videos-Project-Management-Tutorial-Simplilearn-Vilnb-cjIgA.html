course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project
communications management there are 47
processes and project management grouped
into 10 knowledge areas and mapped into
five process groups in this lesson we
will look at the 7th knowledge area that
is project communications management and
its processes in the next screen let us
understand communication communication
can be best defined as a two-way process
of exchanging information between two
entities as you can see on the screen if
project is an entity the project needs
to communicate with other entities in
the organization like project managers
senior management of the organization
and any other stakeholder of the project
similarly these entities may also have
to communicate with the projects the
communication between project and the
stakeholders is always two-sided project
manager is responsible for ensuring
proper communication to and from the
project in fact a project manager spends
almost 90% of his or her time on
communication you can now understand how
important it is for a project manager to
plan this activity well in the next
screen let us discuss communication
methods communication can be done in two
ways
it can be done written or verbal both
written as well as verbal communication
can either be formal or informal formal
means communicating by following some
basic rules whereas informal means
taking a casual approach these two
combinations result in four different
communication methods they are formal
written formal verbal informal written
and informal verbal formal written
method is used for project management
plans
project charter and over long-distance
communication formal verbal method is
used during presentations
whereas in formal written method is
applicable while writing notes or emails
informal verbal on the other hand is
applied during conversations you can
expect questions in the PMP exam which
require choosing a communication method
for a given situation so a fair
understanding of the communication
methods can help you score higher in the
next screen let us look at the various
communication technologies communication
technology refers to the different media
used for communicating a few such
technologies are listed on screen among
which email fax and telephone are a few
popular communication technologies in
the next screen let us understand the
communication channel with the help of
an example communication takes place
between four people in a team the lines
across the members represent there can
be six unique channels of communication
existing within the team now if the team
comprises 10 members how many unique
channels of communication will be
calculated you can use the formula n
multiplied with n minus 1 and the
resulting sum divided by 2
n is the total number of people involved
in communication in this case N equals
to 10 if this is put into the formula
you will get 45 as the result there for
45 unique communication channels exist
in a team of 10 people it is difficult
to manage such a large number of
communication channels therefore it is
important to structure communication
otherwise everyone starts communicating
everything to everyone and it can become
a real chaos in the project in the PMP
exam you may be asked to calculate the
number of communication channels in a
scenario based question so please make a
note of the formula to answer the
question correctly in the next screen
let us discuss the basic communication
model
project communications management
includes the processes required to
ensure that information about timely and
appropriate generation collection
distribution storage and ultimate
disposition of project is prepared and
circulated to all project stakeholders
it is the responsibility of a project
manager to ensure that the information
requested by the stakeholder is
communicated to them the frequency at
which the information needs to be shared
may also vary from stakeholder to
stakeholder for example think about a
simple process of sharing a project
status report with the customer and
senior management this knowledge area
explains how it should be done as per
