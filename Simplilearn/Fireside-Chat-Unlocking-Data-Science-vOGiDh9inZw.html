have got a nice participant set already
welcome to this discussion around data
sign just introduce myself really quick
because I'm not the important guy here
Eric is I am the product dude and simply
learned and I learned you're certified
to pick so with that little spiel let me
actually quickly set you up for success
here I will be monitoring the Q&amp;amp;A
section which I'm sure you can see on
your screen
send your questions to us we have about
30-40 minutes worth of content if you're
going to ask question when asking Eric
questions if you have further things
that you want to deep dive on or drill
down on please let me know I'll be
looking at the Q&amp;amp;A section just let me
know right we'll make this as
interactive as you can I'll try to
represent as many questions as I can but
keep in mind it won't be possible to do
everybody's questions today we will have
10 to 50 minutes at the end to cover as
many as you can all right but that's
that let me just jump right in
let me introduce Eric now Eric and I go
back a few years we were actually at a
different company before at a cloud
company and if anybody knows cloud then
you know that you're talking about huge
amounts of data and lots of customers
and lots of customer behaviors across
multiple industries right and so Eric
was basically the chief data scientist
at that at the time we worked very
closely because I was a product dude he
was a data science dude and we work
together but with that said Eric why
don't you introduce yourself I know you
work at circle up now you do some really
cool stuff why don't you introduce us
until the audience what you do right now
yes first of all I'm really happy to be
here this is going to be fun and before
that sir my opinion I have a background
funny enough in psychology psychology
and math I have a PhD in cognitive
psychology as well as a bachelor's in
psychology and math and you know through
various coincidences and you know me
following interests of mine I became
really good statistics and some computer
programming and you know I got a couple
of jobs out of academia that enabled me
to apply those skills to solve real
world problems as opposed to
in basic research and I've been like fun
on set at a cloud computing company I
work with the Federal Aviation
Administration on drones which was
really fun fun and then now I work for
circle up which is a financial tech
company and we our mission is to help
entrepreneurs thrive by getting them the
capital and resources they need and
essentially we help entrepreneurs meet
investors and so we follow bunch of
problems around matchmaking and then
filtering and deciding which companies
are relevant for investors and like and
vice versa and yeah that's just what I
do but Eric let me ask you we're going
to get deeper on this in a few minutes
but I'm very curious why would a
financial company that's investing and
stuff what a data scientist what do you
do there I mean what what why a data
side is it a financial company yeah it's
a good question well I think I think
cirglod would say that it is a it is a
strange thing at least in private equity
for companies to be utilizing data
science the way that we do and that's
what makes us stand out as you know a
lot of a lot of stock market traders use
a machine learning and algorithms you're
aware of the whole algorithmic trading
appraised and high-speed trading and
that and that so in the public markets
it's been very common for at least 20
years to be utilizing data in the ways
that I do for private markets but the
key with where we play is data is much
harder to get in the private space it's
harder to know how much a private
company makes how much growth they
experienced over the last 12 months who
their competitors are where their
distributed right there's a bunch of
distributors that don't just post their
data to the major data providers right
so we aggregate all that data and
perform analysis on and build products
that sort of service those insights to
the companies themselves entrepreneurs
and then also investors so that they
know which companies to pick are which
companies for suit conversations with
wonderful so so that's actually
formalized with a little bit I think you
know frankly I'm not a data guy I have
worked with data guys like you right and
I keep hearing all these different
titles I hear data analyst I hear data
scientists I hear machine learning
expert and I hear all these different
title
so let's get a little deeper in terms of
you know let's say there are people I'm
sure there are people in the audience
that are trying to figure out what the
heck does all this mean and how do I
even get to know it and if I've already
started how do I get to the next level
right so so let's start with the
definitions of these rules right let's
start simple big data you know just data
analysts versus data scientists right
and I know for a fact you were
legitimate data scientist so asking you
would be the right question right can
you do this exam subjectively
objectively how are you different rate
between these two roles and what are the
kind of sets you would expect from
either of them the follow-on question of
that but you can I can repeat again of
course if you're a data analyst how do
you get into data science is there even
a path getting so give give us a sense
of what what is the difference in how do
we you know how do we bridge that yeah
yeah no those are those are three
critical questions first of all like
what is the data scientists and how does
it differ from the term that we used to
use which is data analysts or add more
statistician and then of course how do
you get to being a data slices for
curious and being one especially if
you're an analyst or something related
so let's just start with let's start
with data scientist because that's what
this presentation or discussions about
there you know people have tried to
define data science work you know over
the last 10 20 years the protest two
answers to that question are a Venn
diagram and a tweet right okay so lots
of information condensed into one visual
or verbal statement right the Venn
diagram it was made in about 2010 20
2009 2010 by a guy named drew Conway and
I don't know this person I'm going to
refer to him though just to give him
credit for the diagram and there are
three circles in the diagram one is math
and statistics one is substance
expertise that is knowing about a domain
as opposed to just abstractly how to
calculate so and the other is hacking
skills in other words how to program a
computer right and essentially if you
can do all three of those he's saying
you're you're a data scientist or you
can't be at it like this right there you
can you say what do you mean expertise
of the domain what is that because I
understand that I'm sure audience are
probably asking what the heck is a
domain yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry I try
to you
but ready to jargon so that you know it
after this talk so let me explain it is
last so domain expertise is like when we
were working in cloud right knowing
something about what cloud is right of
course
where we worked this cloud 101 for
everyone who started working of it
didn't know what it was right and that
sort of level of understanding but then
hopefully like a 102 or 301 or some
advanced understanding of what the
specific domain I work in financial tech
now and I have to add to brush up on you
know my background in finance so but
it's the combination of the abilities to
the math ability to do computer program
firming and the ability to think about
the specific topic or study gotcha and
then there's a second thing I want to
get to this one too this is some fun and
it's short which is the tweet and this
was a person named Josh will again don't
know the guy I just searched him in
LinkedIn he's an expert in the area and
he said basically data science is a
person who is better at statistics than
any software engineer and better at
software engineering in any statistician
right so it's like a person that has an
unusual depth in both of these topics as
opposed to just one ok so again it's
similar to the Venn diagram kind of
unifying several different things here
mostly programming in math class
statistics and then some subject matter
expertise or domain knowledge as usual
as well so that's data vector or you can
think that's great no no I was gonna say
this mixed loss you just explained
exactly what is going to ask no
programming right what do you mean with
programming and how much our programming
is fair yeah maybe a little bit of
detail there and then from there let's
dig into ok why the data analyst not
called save a scientist by the way yeah
sitting very candid and being honest
with his audience here there are a lot
of data analyst had called in from data
scientist right yeah sure and I'm trying
to I'm trying to make sure that that
boundary is kind of understood where
data science starts of our data
analytics also help with them yeah yeah
so I mean really like the definition of
that term of the term data science has
been democratized right so it's it's
whatever most of the people on the
internet think that's perfect so and and
I wouldn't I wouldn't call out any one
person that claims to be one is that
you're not
I don't think you know it's but it
should useful to sort of to present to
the audience what most people tend to
agree on right and so I data analysts I
think usually is associated with a
person who can do basic descriptive
statistics visualized data and
communicate those data points for
conclusions to a stakeholder a person at
the company they work for who's
requesting that analysis or needs it on
a regular basis maybe on a dashboard
right and they can build that for them
so that that person has their needs met
in terms of just keeping a pulse on
whatever they're trying to follow right
so at loud computing company maybe the
number of people who would still have
account or that are running servers
right and so an analyst is good at that
at least good at that right and there's
some overlap in that with data science
right which is what the data scientist
needs to be able to go out and get data
right and they need to be able to
summarize that data and visualize it and
communicate all those things there are
some points where an analyst is
differentiated from a data scientist I
think intuitively to me and based on
experiences I've had in the industry
which are the ability to apply more
advanced statistics so rather than just
describing what happened or calculating
a mean or a standard deviation or even
some basic statistics like a linear
regression or correlation something more
advanced like you know like a neural
network right or a decision tree or some
sort of predictive model maybe a
forecasting analysis using I don't want
to throw out a bunch of buzz words but
you know advanced models right and then
the other is trying to solve a problem
at scale right what I mean by a scale is
the following so a data analyst will be
able to take a specific question or a
specific topic and go deep and discuss
what that data look like with regard to
that question or topic and present that
data on you know because what happened
explain it now where data scientist will
we'll try to solve that problems more
broadly right so at circle up for exam
we analyze companies so an analyst might
be really good at taking one company and
digging in on their their revenue growth
their distribution and looking at all
the nooks and crannies of how they run
over time and going deep on one specific
thing and communicating to either the
business owner or someone who is
interested in investing what happened
with that company or as a data scientist
might do two different things first of
all they will do that not only for one
company but for an entire industry right
so they're gonna have to solve a scale
problem they'd have to go out and
collect similar data points for
comparable companies define what is it
does mean to be comparable and then also
do some kind of intelligent analysis
like prediction or filling in some data
point you maybe don't have person for
companies right so those are two ways
that a data scientist energy from an
analyst so there was actually a question
that's very relevant that I was gonna
ask you that next to anyway right all
right let me actually summarize what I
understood from you in this last quicker
right
my understanding is data analysts have a
basic understanding of statistics have a
very good sense of data so they're
probably able to ingest combined tables
create new views and visualize that data
and they're probably able to pull out
some insights of that data right and if
we understand what you said is data
science takes that to the next level you
are now in advanced statistics you're
actually a very good programmer right
and your ears actually do this at scale
you're able to automate the whole thing
and do it a much faster level in terms
of the data that you're working right
yeah and there's there's one other thing
which is there's the data Sciences also
works on a product team yep in a sense
that they're helping to build a product
that does that on a regular basis it
distributes some insights on a regular
basis right or through an application
right the user would interact with where
Salus is associated with again some
analyst do that right they build
dashboards very sophisticated dashboards
but it's associated with someone that
does like a one time go on shot analysis
but got it so we're going to get the
skills and tools and it's beautiful the
audience is actually asking questions
that I had kind of prepared for you I
love it
right so you know skills I heard you say
statistics some assistance in math you
may able to
it's data and replies that and basically
coding right those are the major three
skills that I see coming out of here
right so let's talk about tools and
languages and things like that right
yeah if you look at what's common in
industry today
right I hear are Python I hear all these
coding languages been used but what do
you see that is usually what's common
you've been in many industries many
different teams as a data scientist so
I'm sure everybody wants to hear
look what's what's in vogue what's
actually exciting what's actually what
you're looking for the fourth time
yeah totally well I mean this is the
immediate two answers are Python and
r-right some close seconds that you know
are very popular as well but it's all
slightly different problem and for
slightly different user bases Scala
SPARC Hadoop right some of those go to
the data some of them are related to a
different language right and some of
that's just user preference but the two
big ones are Python and R and I see them
in that order between so matter of fact
and it pains me as an r enthusiast and
lover that the Python is definitely the
most popular and and is that that's for
a reason right it's a much broader
programming language it solves other
problems in addition to calculating
statistical models and specifying models
and you know it was sampling from
randomly distributions or randomly from
distributions it's you know web
developers use Python who don't do any
statistics right and so it's just a
bigger animal and so when when companies
are looking to incorporate machine
learning into their current data
pipelines they think well if I can do in
Python why would I go away from that
right so so that's kind of where we are
and in terms of tools within those the
basic abilities that you need abates of
things that you need to accomplish the
tasks that you're doing with these
languages is taking in data right
usually from a table or some sort of
nested data format we've used Excel for
a long time everybody knows Excel you
know rectangles of data right give me
the rectangle put it into the Caprona
mean language and I was first using our
I just thought okay I know how to open
an excel file how do I open this file in
R and then how do I say show me that row
or show me that column or that cell
add some things together right filter
sort all of those things that's that's
you know that's what we do
and and of course I should have
mentioned this earlier but sequel and
database basic database tools are also
an SS and necessary skill to be able to
use sequel or Postgres or now these days
graph databases but those are some of
the most common tools I can go down into
any of them if you like I think I think
let's answer the question that one of
the audience members asked actually by
the way she's learning is coming down
the road I'm just speaking to the
audience really quick give me time to
catch up
Eric's got a lot to share so we will get
to the questions and machine learning
something very gonna get into very soon
right okay but one slightly of you know
relevant questions that came to sell our
Python of course number one in Python an
r1 into SAS gala you know some of these
right where does that get you scaling
excuse and how do my understanding for
of a developer tool right can you maybe
differentiate a little bit in terms of
usage where it's applicable those kind
of things yeah scour is comparable to
the Python and R and then SAS I would
say is a sort of different thing in that
it is further removed from the ability
to do general-purpose programming same
with SPSS okay that's actually a
point-and-click tool that you can use
macros and sort of I think you can at
least back in grad school when I use it
once or twice you could specify by
something with a programming language
behind the scenes so that that's not the
primary use case and so I associate sass
also with I interview for healthcare job
a while back and SAS has a bunch of
certified models and so sometimes you're
in history where the statistics need to
be certified right feet are for example
in Python they're both open source
libraries right so they've been tested
by many many many people and so you tend
to assume and it's probably a safe
assumption not 100% that the model is
useful and it's working and I do think
it's doing but with SAS there's actually
certifications work where you can say I
know that this is the case at least no
to the extent that the
the certification is effective right so
and they're also more associated with
academic use cases right because the
primary problem they're trying to solve
there is fit a statistical model or give
me a p-value or help me evaluate some
hypothesis right and they're often used
more on a one time basis whereas with
Python or are you can program something
to do an at an ad hoc analysis whenever
a certain events are triggered in a web
app right and so you can do some you can
do things more programmatically
gotcha so so maybe maybe taking the
summary of what you're taking away in
terms of something I can boil down to
right if you want to get into data
analytics learn statistics learn the
courses that go with data analytics and
potentially some of the big data
component to that get really good at
that and when you want to get to the big
data science start getting to our
programming Python programming
potentially fast but it much more niche
if you may face what I'm hearing you say
right and start learning a lot more of
the advanced statistical model
potentially to get the data
is that a fair you know sort of
differentiation between data analytics
and data science yeah if you're a data
analyst and you want to become a data
scientist right um there are two obvious
things that you should do first of all
Rita on these advanced statistical
models machine learning models and just
a hint as an answer that even though
we're going to probably talk about that
more def in a minute
Michigan learning is really just it's a
different perspective on statistics
right so some models can be called a
statistical model or machine learning
well in any case they are definitely
more advanced and so as an analyst if
you want to learn those models and then
you want to you want to thumb you want
to get real-world experience right
whether that's a project I really do at
night or whatever or whether it's we're
at work and you notice that there's a
particular problem someone's trying to
solve and you say hey I can build a
model and just stick your neck out and
try right right we did that sometimes
where we were raised to work right I
would say hey you know what this really
sounds like a machine learning problem I
could do that right and they said okay
Eric go for it and I did it and you know
I've proved it to myself into the
company that it was useful right so
those are the two things learn about the
methods and just go do it
gotcha or you can dig it certification
with a replicating
that's part of the learning is learning
by the way I'm not a marketing guy so
I'm a prodigal I'm gonna stay away from
marketing since we don't at all
anyway so um you know I think there's a
lot of interest building for the next
step of the questionnaire that I was I
was intending for you right machine
learning AI all the stuff that's really
hot it's the big buzzword right now
right so I'll tell you being a guy that
understands data to some extent but
being a guy let me tell you what my
confusion is you're telling me that okay
you have to learn the machine learning
algorithms to become a data scientist
right right so where is that line
between data sign and machine learning
right let's started that we will then
move into machine learning versus AI
which is the different conversation
entirely right so let's say somebody
wanted to get into deep and a machine
learning this part-time your data
scientists are ready to some extent what
Delta skill sets are you now looking for
and what is that evolution that you have
to go over to get there you know
actually you're you know you're putting
a line in one place and I think it's
fair for that line there there's a
bigger line which is between basic
statistics and data analysis and machine
learning right and so there's sort of
data science and machine learning and
advancing statistics they're all kind of
hovering around the same space right so
let me put it this way a regression
linear regression so one of the first
things you wind up in your intro to
statistics course you have a variable
call it X and you have another variable
Y and you want to know well how they
relate to one another right you perform
a regression which is there's a bunch of
point X is on the x-axis y is on the y
axis and you try to find a line that
represents that relationship whether
it's positive or negative right linear
regression guess what it's a machine
learning technique okay it's also a data
science technique it's also a technique
that many analysts will use to solve an
analysis problem what I would say is the
difference between machine learning
specifically is you're you have an eye
toward automation right you have an eye
toward solving an automation problem
right if you're trying to you're trying
to get an answer to something
systematically you're not necessarily
trying to test the hypothesis right
that's more associated with statistics
hypothesis testing machine learning is I
want to get this enough
so I can plug it into a tool or I want
to do some complex analysis of an image
or some audio file or some kind of
measurement that's really esoteric and
that a lot of people can't just readily
go analyze right you can analyze revenue
numbers because your company probably
has a database somewhere where they put
the numbers and you can go to that table
and calculate the mean that's no problem
machine learning is also associated with
taking messy stuff like images or sound
files or natural language and making
sense out of it right and so again those
are all connotations I think machine
learning and advanced statistics are
kind of synonymous but machine learning
is associated with automation problem
and I think with more complex by the
representation image representation
problems so maybe maybe look for my
perspective let me try to simplify what
you just said - my very rudimentary
understanding of these various different
domains right data science you're
basically programming it you're trying
to figure out the Graduate advice to
solve the equation if you may machine
learning my understanding is always it's
a fuzzy problem you don't really have an
equation so you got to figure out what
the equation or the logic is in the
first place and my understanding
learning part is your learning based on
the data is that a fair way today or how
would you how would you say this how
would you explain yeah okay well well
here's I mean one you know one basic
division within machine learning is
supervised and unsupervised learning
right we're getting a little bit of
technical jargon but this is sort of
necessary to go any further supervised
learning is when you want to find
pattern and you have some one variable
that you're trying to associate patterns
with right so suppose I want to predict
the revenue of a company something we do
a circle up and I want to you know use a
bunch of other data points that I can
come up at about these companies to
predict that right right that's a
supervised learning problem because I'm
my goal is to know what the revenue is
and there is a true amount of revenue
that each company has that I that I can
reference and that I will train my model
on right same with a classification
problem right suppose I want to know is
this company in the you know chips
or the ice-cream business right so I
have a bunch of companies and maybe
they're you know I go to their website
and look at some keywords and I just
want to learn which ones are chips and
which ones are ice cream because I want
to look at only ice cream company later
in they don't deliver the data to me
saying hey I'm an ice cream company
right it's there but I have to find the
patent right again what I get a bunch of
companies that I already know our chips
or ice cream that's the thing I'm trying
to predict and I use those to train a
model to find the patterns that enabled
me to use that model in the future on
companies that I don't know whether it's
your ice cream that's supervised
learning
then there's unsupervised learning where
there is no ice cream chips right
there's just a bunch of data and and
maybe I just want to find groups of
things that are similar right so you
know maybe rather than saying I want to
know the chips versus ice cream I say
here's a bunch of companies based on the
words that they use on their website
which ones are the most similar and then
let's look at those and just sort of see
what what comes out right oh wow look
interesting all the salty snacks
companies tend to use the same words the
same jargon the same keywords right and
all of the apparel companies tend to use
a different type right so if I want to
look at this industry with an unbiased
perspective I don't know what types of
things there are I just want to pump
behind those types in the data I can use
an unsupervised learning model so those
are two types of two learning problems
and those give you a little bit of sense
for specific problems you might solve
now again though at the end of the end
of the day those are both two typical
models being used advanced statistical
models to solve those problems right so
we keep coming back to that overlap
between the two
so everybody didn't make things more
confusing notice a lot but look again
from an audience perspective I would try
to ask another question right I'm a data
scientist today I'm a very good data
scientist and I want to get and I know
machine learning as part of what a data
scientist to do right yes what is it
I would do to get truly how do I become
a machine learning right I've already
done science I get statistics I'm good
at programming but what next are there
tools skills you know capabilities I
need to go filled on top of what I
already have to get to that next level
of data fine yeah I see what you're
saying
and I think there
designs that are probably less skilled
in machine learning than others
okay and so if you want to go if you
want to double down on your machine I
feel that I would say go study wanted
like one of these esoteric data types
right like like natural language
processing right or go so in other words
there's a bunch of like so Twitter is a
great event well they often call it the
firehose the data firehouse because
there's just so much data coming in
every moment keep or tweet tweet tweet
week right and so go to Twitter find a
bunch of people that you're interested
in and try to understand what patterns
start in their tweets right and you will
soon come up against the problem huh
how do I even calculate language use
what is it what is the first step right
that's machine learning right and then
once you have basic you know like okay I
can use this method tf-idf
to come up with words that appear in
this person's a profile and and you know
they're tweaks more often than other
people who are similar or you go to like
image processing and you say hey I just
took a bunch of images on vacation I did
this actually a couple years ago I said
I've noticed the colors in this city are
just really interesting to me what's the
pattern in those colors right so go to
some complex doing domain and try to
unlock the hidden patterns in that data
that's but manual baby let me ask you
this is help study right so if I wanted
to actually learn something Ollie's yeah
I know that Google is doing some really
exciting things there potentially other
countries or as we speak some exciting
thing starts all right what what tools
would I have to get there comment with
what do you think okay tools a couple
definitely I would learn most of the
methods in the scikit-learn package so
Python scikit-learn is a machine
learning library and they have
everything from like I said linear
regression to came in clustering to
boosted decision trees to ensemble
models familiarize yourself with the set
of tools that are connoted with machine
learning experts right and so
scikit-learn is a great place to start
another really hot one right now is
tensorflow so Google people's language
for building neural networks right those
will be good this will be good places to
start
wonderful all right let's take the next
step you're a machine learning person
you've done it all you know how to use
these algorithms right is there a
connection and I don't know this I'm
just asking unbiased question from
machine learning to AI what is the
connection if there is connection what
is it if there's none what is that Venn
diagrams look like so is there sort of a
natural yeah from machine learning
AI or are they completely different
thing well look I think I'm gonna be a
little bit like I was born say it's all
kind of fuzzy you know overlap but I
think there is a clear distinction here
so AI at least in my mind intelligent is
something different than in something
different than just pattern recognition
right pattern recognition is involved in
intelligence but intelligence in is
something more connoted with making
novel drawing novel insights right
assembling together pieces of knowledge
to come to some new conclusion
generalization right and so and then
also it's associated with people right
and robots and automation you know like
all the stuff that you see like
self-driving cars your thermostat that
knows what temperature you want it to be
right
if those those devices are making
decisions for you
they're reasoning through a situation
and drawing a conclusion right which is
a little bit more sophisticated than
just saying hey look you gave me a bunch
of words and I tended to see that these
words are associated with ice cream
these words are associated with potato
chips right it's a little bit more
sophisticated it's like a step on top of
that it's like when you're learning you
know a child first learns how to
classify different objects in the world
but then he learns how interesting that
type of object I think it moves right
and I think I can expect it at any
moment to move forward or backward right
now it's becoming intelligent it's
making novel drawing no conclusions
about things from its knowledge base so
artificial intelligence is more about
building a knowledge base and a set of
rules that help you apply the knowledge
creatively and flexibly for future
applications right
understood all right so slightly
if you may a slightly tactical question
that came through which you know look
every data scientist doesn't definitely
work with every single tool so you're
more than welcome to say look I haven't
worked as a dildo
but the question that came in if I read
it right just give me one second is you
know if you're already good at spark
right okay should I then use skala Java
Python what what is sort of the sister
combination that might go with it any
experiences that domain is not the good
one yeah I mean um if you're already
good at spark I would think that you've
probably already learned Python or at
least some other basic programming
language because spark is you can use
spark typically people use spark through
an API right so or at least I'm most
familiar with that right so like I would
use PI spark which is an API a spark API
through Python right so I'm developing
some analysis pipeline and I say at some
point I say ohd I got too much data to
put all this in memory I need spark
right okay so if I fire up a cluster and
I start using spark to query the data
and manipulate the data instead so if
you're already using Clark uh
Wow all right that's great I think it's
more common well I don't know my and my
experience is probably more common for
you took a course you work with some pet
smaller data set or you know you were
academic in my case and I've worked with
small data sets from this experiment
that I ran and I'm now I'm thinking oh
wow how do I manage a billion rows ah
mark I think you spark to do that
so you're more likely to go to spark
from the other languages vice versa but
that's it I think it's awesome with the
person already no spark
I would just want to know kind of what
the background is like how do they end
up using spark without knowing Python or
C or R or anything else and then we
could continue from there all right so
I'm going to change topics a little bit
and maybe was the last question would
ask you write and then be opened up
quite open question answer for a few
minutes right if you were looking what's
store forward like machine learning
Ã¡i going forward right there's a lot of
bars just complete you know noncoms
right people just talk about it a lot
and nothing really happens right so
machine learning an AI which is kind of
the future of data science if you may
and all the latest a starts happening
now what where do you think it's all
headed what is happening next what are
the cool applications happening with
this what are you seeing in terms of
that being applied in the real world
yeah so so I wouldn't be a very
reputable data scientist if I said that
I could predict the future because as
hard well I guess I wouldn't be very
good what if I said I could do it at all
but but knowing exactly what's going to
happen you know it's hard to know but
but there are some things happening
right now that I know as a matter of
fact or will get better next year
and so I'll talk about those and then
we'll speculate rampantly for a second
about other stuff so there's kind of two
ways the question as well one is the
technology the data scientists use like
spike spark and Python and R and all
that and then the other one is like end
users like what what has a consumer of
data science tools or products that use
data signs can I expect right let's
solve the technology went first that's a
little easier for me I always just want
to do things faster do things in a way
that's more interpretive and do things
that at a higher level of abstraction in
other words tell the computer solves a
big problem as opposed to hey computer
can you solve these ten problems and
then I'll put it together and solve big
problems and so in terms of faster
you know parallel computing and tools
like spark and Hadoop right I think what
you'll see is those getting easier to
use less friction from the analyst of
the data scientists noticing they need
you know a big data solution and then
I'm going to go out and use it and being
able to just start typing right I want
to use the same language for the small
data has the big data and tools like
spark or bridging that gap but there's
still a language divide
do things clearer or more interpretable
there there's a lot of models on their
machine money models that we call black
boxes right or you find a pattern and
essentially they enable you to say put a
bunch of data and get something out
right like earlier potato chips or
ice creams right right I have it you
want answer
so those models are often very
complicated under the hood and it's hard
to convince someone that's using those
model like a product management right
for an investor in our kid these are
this is a reputable thing to be using
right you can trust this models
decisions right but there are nice
things coming out that enable us to look
inside the black box and make them a
little less black right to make them a
little more white and there's there's a
tool called lie you can google that and
look at it so I'm expecting more stuff
like that because that's a big pain
point right now more day scientists and
then more abstract like I said earlier
just be able to tell computer kind of
more further toward the AI you know
spectrum I just want to do this do all
of it in a way that I can trust and then
for end-users here's just a couple of
things that I'm sort of bullish on right
um things like is anything under the
internet-of-things umbrella right you
might have heard that term all it means
is you have devices at home in your car
wherever and eventually they're going to
be just connected to the Internet the
cloud right and there's going to be
models up here helping those devices to
make your life easier voice command
everything voice command right I have an
MS on Echo diets and I use Alexa all the
time it's embarrassing though I only use
it for like two things but I love it
hey like a step set an alarm oh you know
it's going off right now and then you
know hey Alexa play some music for me
it's beautiful all I have to tell to do
to say it I don't have to write a
language I don't have to chicken here
talking now so those are those are a few
things that I'm I'm expecting to come
out of the future for data scientists
and for users wonderful all right I'm
gonna stop the formal questions at this
point of time I think we covered a lot
of ground I know a few folks are asking
about a difference between data
scientists and data analyst I'll try to
summarize a little bit from a layman's
perspective what era carding opportunity
right and actually this recording will
be provided to all the participants
no problem we'll send those videos out
what's done right but if I can summarize
for you Eric just through people we've
talked at the beginning of the session
right my
your discussion was data analysts are
very good at very specific problems
first of all there are not necessarily
great programmers they're good at
actually ingesting data combining tables
reading the data views and visualization
and then using some level of insight to
say okay for this specific problem
here's my answer to you right and data
scientists take that to the next level
they actually do it at scale which means
you have to automate program you have to
take to the next level and you do much
more complicated statistical models of
both what I remember right yeah and then
you're just taking that to the next
level machine learning that takes that
it says now let's take that to a more
generalized problem and make it even if
it's fuzzy logic I don't exactly know
how things are going to fit together the
machine learning that figures out what
those clusters are what those patterns
are right and then taking it even one
step further
artificial intelligence then takes that
and build a knowledge base that it can
actually draw on and really create
independent decisions that are separate
from disseminating learning algorithm
which is still at some point pretty
linear in that sense right so that's
what go ahead
is that a good summary of it sort of
there's a transition there yeah as murky
as all these things are I think that's a
pretty fair everything you said is
pretty fair yeah I would I would say you
have analysis you know here's one thing
people might find this useful
we at circle up refer to this graph and
there's four stages of an advanced
analytics program it says and you can
look this up on Google and find it as
well first you describe the data then
you explain the data then you perceive
you predict new things right and
eventually you're at a point where you
can prescribe in other words you know
what's going to happen if you do one
thing or another and you can because you
have a goal represented you can say do
this one instead of this one right
because you haven't understanding if
that will cause you to get some outcome
you want so you know that's another
progression that we often refer to when
we're trying to develop a really
powerful data science and machine
learning program at circle up is moving
through those stages from description
all the way up to prescription that is
super helpful into the framework to take
back yeah here I'm going to stop right
now and I'm gonna open it up a little
bit I think there's one question more
that I want to ask I think it's coming
from pre untrue so the question that's
being asked is look statistical models
have been there since
forever right I mean you know you start
with days of Einstein or even before
that you've got statistics running
around so what they capitalized that's
five years why is this whole thing just
exploding at this point of time was
there something specific that trigger at
all
yeah that's a great point I mean this is
funny like statistics has actually
matured a lot and there are a lot of
different philosophies to orient
yourself around there's the Bayesian
versus frequentist you can google that
let's not do that
that's another hour and a half now
that's that's the PhD talking is that is
that right yeah I heard I put on my nerd
glasses right so like so there's that
right but then and I guess one thing I
would say is that
vivianne ism has sort of made a revival
because now we can use very fast
computers to do some sorts of Bayesian
analysis we couldn't do before right
whereas frequentist it lends itself to
like look up tables and and
characterizing specific distributions
and testing the hypotheses anyway a
bunch of jargon I threw out either but
maybe you've heard some of it and are
googling it that's good
another thing to say to say is that
there have actually been a lot of
advances in statistics in just the last
20 30 50 years right a few of those are
one is called regularization forget that
word overfitting right so you have a
model and it's really really good on the
data did you train the model on but then
you go and apply it in the real world
and be slightly different and now the
models not very good because they
couldn't anticipate that that subset
that it was learning on was actually
kind of overly specific in certain ways
and the machine learning model gobbled
up all of that explanation and said I'm
really smart now I'm gonna you know I
can explain the heck out of this data
I'm going to be good at the other data
sets but in fact it's not as good
because there were unforeseen
differences in the data you went off and
tried to use the model and there are
better tools these days to understand
how to prevent overfitting into what's
called regular eyes and and then there
are also advances in specific machine
learning technologies right but you
could call them statistical model
you know the certain certain models like
this are decision freeze so a decision
tree is a model that says okay I'm gonna
try to predict whether it's ice cream or
potato chips and I'm going to go one
step at a time and I'm going to take one
one data point and say okay if they use
the word delicious that's not a good one
if they use the word crunchy it's
probably a potato chip but if they use
the word crunchy and they use the word
Oreo well it could be an ice cream
because it could be right and so
essentially you build out this tree and
the tree represents your model and those
were not well understood before you know
20 30 years ago
and they've gotten really really really
good just recently also know that works
I won't continue to go on because I want
to be able to answer other questions but
neural networks especially deep neural
networks have gotten much much much more
powerful just because we have more
computing technology these days and in a
sense you're able to to build a neural
network that has their deep because they
have many many layers whereas the neural
networks were using 20 30 years ago and
two maybe three layers right and those
are pretty good at specific problems but
we found out that mysteriously almost
that these deep neural networks are much
much better even than those others so
alphago some of the self-driving car
technologies based on neural networks
and by the way I do want to ask one
question from my side because I think
that'll be valuable if you said multiple
layers right yeah you know my
understanding of that is you basically
have let's take a regression algorithm
one there could be a regression you then
add the next thing you add the next
thing and it goes through this pipeline
algorithm is that a fair way of looking
at the speed learning out of there's a
different way okay
yes some of them work that way the
layers are actually the raw data so a
the bottom layer would be all the
independent variables or the X values
right so if you're predicting ice cream
versus whatever right you might have a
layer that literally has one node for
each word and it's on active or off
based on what whether that word was
present in the key words right and based
on those on/off patterns just basically
a bunch of life one cookbook you define
what's called an activation function
that moves up to the output layer which
says it's ice cream versus crustaceans
right and you're just learning that
pattern right and the deeper you go what
happens is you're actually taking those
inputs and you're just making space
between the inputs and the outputs and
you're calculating intermediate layers
and the model is learning how to
allocate the activation to those
intermediate layers in a way that just
mysteriously works for classifying right
so you're adding maybe ten layers in
between and maybe those layers represent
things like conjunctions they used
crunchy and you know delicious or and
tasty or whatever right the way it's
really worrisome enough data scientist
says seriously which tactically wipe up
a lot of magic that that's what you're
telling me all right I will take that
for what it is I'll take one last
question it comes from Spencer again you
know any area of data science that has
suddenly evolved in somebody's exploding
is there anything that you see that is
just caught your eye and that's just
exploding really fast yeah I mean you
know I'm just going to give the trendy
answer which i think is probably
probably the right answer the one that
most people would give which is neuronal
networks are very powerful and people
are using them more and more and more
often and I would say that we have a lot
of work to do in understanding how to
pull those into everyday product I think
there's a lot more hype right now around
neural networks than there is
understanding of neural networks and and
and then certainly either just
understanding how they work and how to
put them together but then also
understanding once you know generally
how they work the parts that nobody
really understands how they work right
and so we have a lot of work to do in
that area applying them and practicing
using them and making them you know
consumable by everyone in the data
community not just the ones that can
operate the heavy machinery right but
the ones that they're you know sharing
the results from the analysis with and
the business case users right I think
I'm just going to say neuro networks
because that's an easy answer
by the way the questions are still
coming and thick and fast we'll do a
couple more all right one I think you
answered partially already and I think
would be easy one for you to answer the
question is the role of data science and
business intelligence right yeah if I
think about what you do for a living
right now that's exactly what you write
you're basically using data sent for
business intelligence but any other
thoughts that you want to add an edge of
the role of data science intelligence
yeah definitely I actually prepared some
some thoughts on this because I thought
it might come up so two things first you
should go right now and Google the
stitch fix algorithms tore stitch fix is
a company that's ended clothing based on
you know their hunches about what you
might like and then your feedback based
on previous shipments and you know it's
a very very popular product and it's
also they're full of really smart data
scientists and they use data science
everywhere and so it's a really great
case study of how to use data science
and machine learning in every aspect of
your business right and you have a
beautiful web application where you can
sort of scroll down and see all the ways
they use data science right so that's
one really fun things you can do offline
or online but after this within that
some of the things they do that I think
are general purpose problems I'll just
list them first and if we can go into a
couple of them if there's time logistics
so in other words inventory management
for companies that have products and
they want to know how much to buy and
how much to you know their respective
cell delivery so one of the classic
examples of a fun machine learning
problem is the traveling salesperson
problem right you have all these boxes
to delivery houses how do you save gas
and get there the quickest and save time
okay and then there's generally just
forecasting of everything you know of a
helps the company to know how much
they're expected to make in earnings or
what this quarter is going to look like
compared to next right
so just using models to forecast into
the future any arbitrary stuff
recommendation systems is another really
big one so you know Netflix is is a very
popular product that users
recommendation system is kind of at its
core you know you watch this other
people like you watch these other things
you know maybe just try it right ways to
solve that problem also useful for
advertising right you click on this ad
other people clicked on this actually
from these other ads maybe that's a good
for you to write and then user
segmentation trying to figure out who
the people are using your tools or your
applications and knowing more about
their personalities and the things that
they do while they're using the product
without not using the product and then
sentiment analysis knowing right people
are talking about you online is it good
if it's not good what are they saying
right being able to manage all that
sloppy mess and you know language data
and understanding feelings in the
sentiment so those are all doing any of
those particularly users interested but
those are ways it's very commonly that
people apply machine learning statistics
to solve practical business problems
wonderful now guys I know audience
probably has a lot more questions to
come but Eric is gonna run out of voice
he'll be testing hot water right that's
what it does drew I'm gonna stop it
skier
look I enjoyed the conversation
immensely an area called agree attaching
up with you right um I hope the audience
has got as much value is I got it I'm
not a data science guy but if I've
learned it on here right so Eric thank
you very very much really appreciate
