s can be structured the important
factors to consider when choosing the
SLA structure are will the SLA structure
allow flexibility in the levels of
service to be delivered for various
customers will the SLA structure require
much duplication of effort who will sign
the SLA s three types of SLA structures
that are discussed with in ITIL are
service based customer based and
multi-level or hierarchal SLA s many
different factors will need to be
considered when deciding which SLA
structure is most appropriate for an
organization to use typical multi-level
SLA structure components are corporate
level all generic issues pertaining to
the organization are covered which are
the same for the entire organization for
example security SLA s at the
organizational level every employee
needs to have a password of 8 characters
and need to change it every 30 days or
every employee needs to have an access
card with photograph imprinted customer
level those issues specific to a
customer can be dealt with for example
security requirements of one or more
departments within the organization are
higher for example the financial
department needs higher security
measures service level all issues
relevant to a specific service in
relation to customer can be covered for
example the email services for a
particular department say management
needs encryption and secure backups
using a multi-level structure for a
large organization reduces the
duplication of effect while still
providing customization for customers
and services by inheritance which is to
say that corporate level
SLA s apply to everybody and every
department in that organization
customer level SL A's apply to
department and so on let's illustrate
the concept as depicted in the slide say
we are a beverages provider with tea
coffee and juices in our service
portfolio so for customer a wants to be
provided every morning and evening and
coffee should be available before and
after lunch and juices to be provided
during lunch hours so that's the
customer specific SLA we have signed
with customer a and we price the
offering based on that now we also have
a to stand where we offer deuce all the
time but at fixed prices and where the
customers B and C can source their needs
this constitutes a service based SLA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
