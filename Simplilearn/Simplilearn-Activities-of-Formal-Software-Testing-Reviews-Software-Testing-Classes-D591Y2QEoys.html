to informal reviews formal reviews
follow a formal process
a typical formal review process consists
of six main steps one planning to kick
off three preparation for review meeting
five rework six follow up let us
understand each of these steps in more
detail planning the review process for a
particular review begins with a request
for review by the author to the
moderator or inspection leader with a
clear objective a moderator is often
assigned to take care of the scheduling
dates time place and invitation of the
review for more formal reviews for
example inspections the moderator always
performs an entry check and defines at
this stage formal exit criteria the
entry check is carried out to ensure
that the reviewers time is not wasted on
a document that is not ready for review
moderator and author decide which part
of the document to review because the
human mind can comprehend a limited set
of pages at one time the number should
not be too high the maximum size is
usually between 10 and 20 pages informal
inspection only a page or two may be
looked at in depth in order to find the
most serious defects that are not
obvious the team normally consists of
four to six participants including
moderator and author to improve the
effectiveness of the review different
roles are assigned to each of the
participants these roles help the
reviewers focus on particular types of
defects during checking this reduces the
chance of different reviewers finding
the same D
the moderator assigns the roles to the
reviewers kickoff an optional step in a
review procedure is a kickoff meeting
the goal of this meeting is to get
everybody on the same wavelength
regarding the document under review and
to commit to the time there will be
spent on checking in general the kickoff
is highly recommended since there is a
strong positive effect of a kickoff
meeting on the motivation of reviewers
and thus the effectiveness of the review
process during the kickoff meeting the
reviewers receive a short introduction
on the objectives of the review and the
document the relationships between the
document and the review and the other
documents sources are explained
especially if the number of related
documents is high role assignments
checking rate the pages to be checked
process changes and possible other
questions
are also discussed during this meeting
of course the distribution of the
document under review source documents
and other related documentation will
also be done during the kickoff
preparation the participants prepare
individually for the review using the
related documents procedures rules and
checklists provided this ensures that
reviewers have studied the document
before participating in the review
sometime this step can be handled before
the review meeting this can be done by
sharing the artifact under review with
the reviewers before the meeting the
individual participants while studying
the artifacts can identify defects
questions and comment according to their
understanding of the document and their
role in the review process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
