course offered by simply learn in this
lesson we will focus on project cost
management there are 47 processes in
project management grouped into 10
knowledge areas and mapped to five
process groups in this lesson we will
look at the fourth knowledge area that
is project cost management and its
processes in the next screen let us
understand the concept of project cost
management project cost management
involves activities like estimating the
cost of each of the project activities
adding the cost estimates of the related
activities to arrive at the cost budget
and controlling the cost to ensure that
project activities are completed within
the defined budget in the next screen
let us discuss cost management plan the
cost management plan is a vital step and
project cost management it contains
information like planning the project
cost managing and controlling the
project in relation to the cost baseline
and managing cost variances project cost
management plan is a part of the project
management plan the methods used in
estimating the cost of each of the
project activities are similar to the
ones used in estimating project time for
example time estimation methods like
expert judgment analogous estimating
bottom up estimating and reserve
analysis are few of the techniques that
are also used in estimating activity
cost
let us discuss control account in the
next screen control account is an
important concept in the project cost
management project cost is generally
estimated at individual activity level
it becomes difficult to manage cost at
the activity level in large projects
therefore the cost is managed at a
higher level
this requires related activities to be
clubbed
and their cost being managed together as
one unit this unit is called control
account while estimating the project
time WBS is created to break down the
project into smaller deliverables these
deliverables are broken down into work
packages and these work packages are in
turn broken into activities control
account is defined at a level higher
than the work packages for example if
five work packages are part of the one
control account the cost of all
activities belonging to these five work
packages are managed as one unit in the
next screen let us discuss the project
cost management process project cost
management has four processes they are
planned cost management estimate costs
determine budget and control costs the
three processes planned cost management
estimate costs and determined budgets
are a part of planning process group and
control cost process is a part of
monitoring and controlling process group
let us look at each of these processes
in detail let us begin with the first
process that is plan cost management in
the next screen managing costs on a
project is a critical exercise if the
activities are planned well it becomes
easier to achieve harmony with the
overall cost and budget of the project
plan cost management is the process of
establishing the policies procedures and
documentation for planning managing
expending and controlling the project
costs let us look at the inputs required
for this process the project management
plan provides other subsidiary plans and
guides the cost planning activities on
the project the project charter provides
an overall context and high-level
product and project description which
help determine the approach for cost
management for example for some projects
budget could be a constraint whereas for
others budget would not be a constraint
but subject to the
other objectives enterprise
environmental factors provide the
organizational context to the project
including the culture of the
organization and the infrastructure for
instance the scheduling systems
available the key personnel and so on
organizational process assets provide
inputs such as policies and procedures
templates past performance data and
estimates historical information and
knowledge base now let us look at the
tools and techniques employed in this
process expert judgment refers to input
received from knowledgeable and
experienced resources experts can devise
an approach to govern the costs on a
project by using their previous
experiences meetings may be organized to
determine the cost management plan
everyone responsible for the project
schedule management such as the project
manager representatives from the
appropriate accounting or financial
organization sponsor customer and other
stakeholders must attend these meetings
several analytical techniques may be
used to determine the cost management
plan these techniques help to map the
impact of various decisions on cost for
example how do risk management processes
impact cost etc cost management plan is
the primary output of this process it
establishes the units of measure levels
of precision organizational process
links control accounts to be used rules
for performance measurement and
reporting frequency and methodology of
monitoring the costs and various other
details that lay the overall framework
for cost management on a project in the
next screen let us discuss the second
process under project cost management
estimate cost estimate cost is the
approximation of the monetary resources
required to complete a project activity
cost of a specific activity is estimated
based on the information available at
that point of time as the project team
gets more information about the project
the activity cost estimation may change
let us look at the inputs of this
process scope baseline is the most
important input as it details out the
project scope of work along with that
project schedule is also important
this contains information like when and
which resource is required for the
project it is good to remember that the
same kind of resources may have
different costs at different points of
time human resource management plan is
another important input various elements
like personnel rates rewards or
recognition programs etc are covered in
the human resource management plan which
is important in approximating the cost
estimate human resource management plan
will be discussed in detail in the human
resource management knowledge area risk
register is also an input because risk
mitigation costs should be considered in
cost planning more information on risk
and its effect in the project will be
looked at in detail in risk management
knowledge area another input Enterprise
environmental factors provides
organizational context to the project
organization process assets is listed as
an input as organizations might have
standard set of cost estimation policies
or templates cost management plan is
another important input the cost
management plan lays the framework for
the cost management processes in the
project it provides guidelines such as
the units of measure accuracy desired
methodologies and tools to be used etc
let us now look at the tools and
techniques used in this process expert
judgment reserve analysis analogous
estimating cost of quality parametric
estimating project management software
bottom up estimating 3-point estimating
vendor bid analysis and group
decision-making are the various tools
and techniques used in this process most
of the tools and techniques used here
are
similar to the ones used in the time
management knowledge area vendor bid
analysis is a technique used to estimate
project cost for example a project
requires material procured externally
through suppliers in order to get that
you invite bids from three or four
suppliers and assess their quotations
based on their quotations you can get an
idea of the costs that will be involved
in getting the material for the project
group decision-making technique is
another important technique for project
cost estimation cost estimation is an
exercise which may be carried out by a
group or committee in order to gather
well-rounded input therefore group
decision-making techniques may be used
to arrive at a decision that team can
work with the outputs of this process
are quite straightforward estimates of
each of the activities are arrived at
basis of the estimate includes things
like how the estimate was developed what
were the assumptions made in estimating
etc project document updates is also one
of the outputs because the cost
estimates may result in updates to other
aspects of the project for example
quality risk time etc in the next screen
let us discuss the third process under
project cost management determine budget
once the estimate of each of the
activities has arrived at the next
project cost management process is to
determine budget it is the process of
aggregating the estimated costs of
individual activities or work packages
to establish an authorized cost baseline
this is where the control account
concept comes into picture the estimated
costs of the activities are aggregated
to arrive at the cost budget at the
control accounts level once approved
this cost budget becomes the cost
baseline of the project project cost
performance is measured against the cost
baseline that is how much more would the
project cost be compared to the original
cost baseline the cost baseline includes
all authorized budgets but
excludes management reserves the inputs
used in determining the project budget
are the activity cost estimates and the
basis of estimates which are the output
of the previous cost management process
the cost management plan lays the
framework for the cost management
processes in the project it provides
guidelines such as the budgeting cycle
tools and techniques used to prepare and
approve the budget etc in addition to
these two important inputs scope
baseline is also looked at project
schedule provides aggregate cost in a
particular calendar period to ensure how
much money can be made available during
that time similarly resource calendar
provides information on the resource
which is assigned to the project at a
particular point of time this
information is then used to indicate
resource costs over the duration of the
project risk register gives an
understanding of the overall level of
risk on the project and therefore the
level of contingency reserves that need
to be built into the budget agreements
entered into with the suppliers are also
required to finalize the budget again
organizational process asset is an input
because organization may have few
policies for reporting the cost budget
or there might be some cost budgeting
tools being used there are various tools
and techniques used in determining
budgets cost aggregation technique
involves adding up the cost and
aggregating them at the control account
level so that the cost can be managed in
a better way in reserve analysis once
the costs are estimated some extra
amount is added to the estimate as a
management reserve to take care of any
unplanned activities expert judgment is
a technique in which an experts help is
sought to estimate the activity cost
expert is someone who might have worked
on a similar project in the past and has
a good idea to estimate the activity
cost involved historical relationships
are used to predict the total project
costs using
mathematical model this is similar to an
alligator parametric estimate method
funding limit reconciliation technique
is used to ensure that cost on the
project is budgeted or spent as per the
availability of the fund for example if
the project can get the funding of only
$50,000 a month the project budget
should be planned accordingly the output
of this process is the cost baseline
this is an authorized project budget
over a period this is used to measure
monitor and control overall cost
performance of the project in addition
to this the project funding requirements
are also arrived on funding requirements
means how much fund the project requires
monthly quarterly or yearly for the
execution the last output of this
process is project document updates an
understanding of determining budget may
be useful when answering questions in
the PMP exam so make a note of the
inputs tools and techniques and outputs
of determining budget in the next screen
let us discuss the last process of
project cost management that is control
cost control costs is the process of
monitoring the status of the project to
update the project budgets and managing
changes to the cost baseline updating
the budget involves recording actual
costs spent until date any increase to
the authorized budget can only be
approved through the perform integrated
change control process some of the
typical activities that happen as part
of the control cost process are ensuring
that cost expenditure does not exceed
the authorized funding monitor the cost
performance to understand variance and
monitoring the work performance against
the funds expended the inputs to the
process our project management plan
organizational process assets project
funding requirements and work
performance data work performance data
contains the information about the
project progress the important tools and
eeks used in controlling costs are
earned value analysis management
forecasting to complete performance
index other important aspects of
controlling costs are the review the
performance analyze the reserves to make
sure the project has enough budgetary
reserves to meet the expenses and
project management software which helps
in tracking and managing costs now let
us look at the output of this process
the key outputs of this process are work
performance information in terms of cost
variance CV schedule variance SV and
earned value evie and forecasts about
the cost performance this process may
also result in change requests arising
out of cost control measures as well as
updates to project documents the project
management plan and organizational
process assets business scenario based
questions on project cost control can be
expected in the exam so if you have
questions on these concepts get them
cleared as that will help you score
higher
