dedicated hard disk storage device that
is set up with its own network address
it provides file based data storage
services to other devices on the network
a network attached storage device is
attached to a local area network with an
assigned IP address it allows both
application programs and files to be
served faster as they do not compete for
processor resources na s devices are
usually configured with a web browser
and do not have a keyboard or display
network attached storage consists of
hard disk storage including multi-disc
raid systems we will learn more about
raid systems in later slides na s
software can usually handle a number of
network protocols such as Microsoft's
internetwork packet exchange nivelle's
net where internetwork packet exchange
and sun microsystems network file system
although some na s boxes will run a
standard operating system like Windows
many na s devices run their own
proprietary operating system for example
the mas platforms from net app used the
company's proprietary data ONTAP
operating system management utilities
are able to manage heterogeneous
multiple na s boxes as more storage is
added to the infrastructure which eases
the management burden on storage
administrators management utilities are
the software administrator control
panels that are used for configuring and
managing the mas na s can be set up on
dedicated OS or on Windows OS network
attached storage can be a step
award and included as part of more
sophisticated storage system known as a
storage area network Asin in the next
slide we'll continue to understand and
compare various storage technologies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
