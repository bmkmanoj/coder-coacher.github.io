non-for-profit organization that offers
a certification program for project
practitioners for all educational and
skill levels PMI is based in the USA and

credential is valid for five years after
the completion of this three-year period
it can be renewed PMI measures project
management experience in the units of PD
you PDU means professional development
unit you can acquire PD use in many ways
for example if you attend a project
management class of one hour by an
expert it is considered equivalent to
one PD you if you write a white paper on
the topic related to
jekt management it may be equivalent to
five PDUs PMI has detailed guidelines on
what kind of project management
activities amounts to how many PDUs you
can look for the CCR handbook on the PMI
website for more details
PMI releases a guide every four years
it's called as PMBOK guide that is a
guide to the project management body of
knowledge PMBOK guide acts as a textbook
for the CAPM exam PMBOK guide can be
considered as a standard for project
management profession in the next screen
we will look into the application
requirements for the CAPM exam PMI CAPM
certificate is an experience as well as
knowledge based certification this means
certain prerequisites are to be met in
order to be able to apply for this
certification the prerequisites depend
upon a person's formal education as
shown in the table a professional needs
to have at least 1500 hours of project
management experience along with a
secondary diploma high school diploma or
global equivalent a professional whose
highest formal education is a high
school degree will require 23 hours of
formal project management education
lastly one also has to submit details of
having attended 35 hours of project
management training just before writing

PMI you can visit their website
WW be mio RG let us focus on CAPM exam
process in the next screen
CAPM exam covers 150 questions out of
which 15 questions are considered as
pretest questions used for future tests
and are not scored you will not be
communicated about these questions they
might be any random pick therefore you
should answer all 150 questions with the
same seriousness PMI includes these
questions to see how many test takers
are getting them right based on this
they might decide to include these
questions in the future exam it is
similar to a survey conducted by PMI of
the 150 questions
therefore 135 will be scored all
questions are multiple-choice questions
with only one correct answer you get one
point for every question answered
correctly there is no negative marking
for the incorrect ones you may also mark
a question for review and revisit it at
the end if unsure then however you
should attempt all the 150 questions in
the given time PMI grades students on
each of the five process groups and
based on the grading they declare CAPM
pass or fail the grades are not
disclosed to everyone rather a rating is
given they are below proficient
proficient and moderately proficient in
each of the five process groups the
percentage of questions from each of
these aspects is listed on the table
CAPM exam is conducted for three hours
there is one point for every right
question there are no penalties for
wrong answers the result pass or fail is
determined by a combination of these
grades how many grades or number of
points one has to score to pass the CAPM
exam is not made public by PMI the
questions in the CAPM exam are related
to various aspects of project management
these aspects are project initiation
planning executing monitoring and
controlling and closing we call these
aspects as process groups for more
details please refer to the CAPM
examination content outline on the PMI
website let us next discuss the CAPM
exam syllabus
there are five process groups ten
knowledge areas and 47 project
management processes to understand the
syllabus you need to understand the
following terms process groups knowledge
areas and processes let us first discuss
process group the project management
discipline is divided into five broad
process groups when a new project starts
it is first in the project initiation
phase moving to planning phase then to
execution followed by monitoring and
controlling and finally it is closed
project execution and monitoring and
controlling processes go hand in hand
therefore when a new project is
initiated all processes of project
initiation process group should be
applied to the project similarly when
the project is being closed all
processes of project closing group
should be applied for instance identify
risks is a process of project planning
group so when the project is in planning
phase you must identify all the risks of
the project next let us see what
knowledge area is as per PMBOK guide
there are 10 knowledge areas a knowledge
area is a set of specific processes
performed to meet a project objective
let us now consider processes there are
47 processes these processes might be
accomplished in the project planning
process group and a few others in
project monitoring and controlling
process group for example develop
schedule one of the processes is a part
of the planning process group and the
project time management knowledge area
likewise in human resource management
knowledge area developed human resource
plan process is in the project planning
group and manage projects team process
is in the project execution group
