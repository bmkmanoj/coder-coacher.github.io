center operations in detail we will also
look into the permissions
recommendations and requirement for
end-users which are required to operate
the end-users cloud data centers
efficiently in the next slide we'll get
introduced to the data center operations
our Security Alliance has a cloud
control matrix which is designed based
on the industry specific standards and
compliances the cloud security alliances
cloud controls matrix has a number of
physical requirements based upon
different standard and regulatory
requirements an important advantage of
hosting specific applications is that it
makes the auditing process much easier
additionally service automation is
enabled in reporting logging and
publication of audit results
let us look at a few examples as
illustrated in the table a data center
that houses healthcare specific
applications must adhere to HIPAA Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act compliance
this means all the policies and
procedures should be established
according to the HIPAA compliance in
order to maintain a safe and secure
working environment
since HIPAA is a policy the control here
is the security policy therefore
policies and procedures shall be
established for maintaining a safe and
secure working environment in offices
rooms facilities and secure areas
if it is an application that focuses on
card processing or payment like PCI DSS
payment card industry data security
standard the control here is with regard
to user access users will not have
direct access to information assets
hence their physical access to
information assets and functions by
users and support personnel shall be
restricted
lastly in the data center hosting a
power generation application like NERC
CIP North American Electric Reliability
corporation critical infrastructure
protection there are several controlled
access points
tremendous care is taken to maintain
safety by means of fences surveillance
security patrols etc
hence physical security perimeters
fences walls barriers guards gates
electronic surveillance physical
authentication mechanisms reception
desks and security patrols shall be
implemented to safeguard sensitive data
and information systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
