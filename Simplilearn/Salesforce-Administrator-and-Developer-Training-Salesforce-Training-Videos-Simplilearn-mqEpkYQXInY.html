a build a suggestion box app with no
code to have hit begin a developer admin
that probably a good one okay
you
new reports and everything cool
all right so you're learning how to
build an application or not cloud from
start to finish
without writing in code if you're new to
upload the goal is to introduce you to
the basics of a building at this point
the point-and-click
skills apply whether you're not meant to
read close on the platform if you're
familiar with the upload admin features
managing users insecurity customizing
standards objects and so on the goal is
to apply the excuse to developing new
applications I think that is one I think
that's a I think we chose the wrong one
yesterday you went from the beginning
though yeah I mean being able to build
the Junction object you know figuring
out how to build a jumpsuit objects know
what it wouldn't actually look like yeah
I think that was all good exercise yeah
and it's interesting when you're
actually practicing because it's fine
where the junction objects for the right
Junction object and the way I should go
it's very important it's not just like
just writing things about know you gotta
know what you're doing
yeah and that's where there's one to
many relationships come in you know
there's one what was it one session can
have many and then one was the other one
I forget but you know it's that
one-to-many relationship that if you
know that'll help
yeah it was working well
you dare give adenosine only like
anything if I manage to complete Dolan
okay let's let's go here you build a
situational management after all or
influences of messages interactive 30
building except rate the app's
definition and data model applications
simplification requirement on only one
custom objects notify user interface on
the browser and no pills for salon model
using bleach layout compact layout new
global actions ultimate calculations
data quality and database updates to
improve the user experience using
formalized validation rules and present
builders define before charts and
dashboards to track the status of
situations and analyze how well the
company manages suggestion instead of
creating a suggestion crystal objects
you could you educated a third force
service below standard objects when
you'd example your one trips for
building and pick them up without using
the search box
okay what are we going to do wait for
Stockholm acting with standard
collaboration and analytics features
similar is yourself with the app users
interface in the browser and in the
first question on mobile app all right
so developer edition from force.com
homepage click on green as up button
quick start wizard hmm the quick start
wizard oh yeah the little one here do
not so let's go up for step oh thank you
Mario
what are they betting what are the
benefit to the QuickStart app other than
the present user to get to step by step
one
well it doesn't a lot of close-ups you
can create the app
and then there's also an object that's
getting created and then after it adds a
bunch of other stuff reporting and
attachments that you don't have to mess
with yeah so it creates a tab that
creates an app that it creates an object
yeah I think this course when you go to
admin the first thing you do in admin
beginner angel trail and it's great
enough yep
if you're at the car garage sale garage
vehicle yeah yeah
know it scary at the time ahead of us
takes one cyclical seems like a thousand
years ago it does actually it is so
let's go there and up in suggestions are
the label suggestion and plural is the
judge
you
it's really cool to see you guys doing
this without really any of my help
yeah not that I mind helping but it just
shows that you're pretty proficient it's
good to have also the two has giving you
the staff and even if you need something
like along the way for your company oh
and you can always refer back to the
step by step up right and create an
April let me give you a lot of ideas too
alright let's move along
go try up and start the tour
you
you
okay yeah I and Keenan okay what they
say
like to say far
we kind of know that sufferin
try out the mobile app the let's Vinci
machines three and four and twelve float
I knew it create a map responsible
we automatically create a mobile
personal app you can access until on
okay let's go there
so I tried to send an email that from
the mobile app and you don't get a lot
log to the Salesforce
I don't know what's wrong
you
and it's okay
okay condors
you
it's an obsession
you should be here
you
you
oh you know
you
click allow you to create on your
suggestion good I just going to bring
the this steps here to make a difference
I can really okay
create the new suggestion and there's
been suggestion
suggestion 1 and click Save
okay now with it how it's working we got
it
yellow belt usually that mobile
integrates with classic yeah
I like the Moghuls
I just couldn't find out why my America
don't all didn't get lost your email
yeah the first email next week using the
mobile I stated my fictitious contact
with my email address and I sent from
the app because I thought invited
telling from the app they mail would get
logged right away and you don't have to
go to login mail and all that or use the
skills for Outlook but that is what
happened
you got a contact you created mm-hmm
with your email yeah and you said in
your contacts in Salesforce one you shut
that email yes
this is form
we go to contact
can identify a number related related
there you go yeah contact
unless then checked Rogers
you have to show more at the bottom for
your quick actions ribbit
you
random mouth so I got the box here which
is not going to work because business
with you guys but when I said so my
orange so then I created a context with
a friend's email address and she
received a mail but it doesn't get along
to the contacts
the email was the same in the contact
yes obviously yeah
because actually I didn't talk about
that send email and when it came to log
into the white pepper if you go to your
cache on the home page there might be an
unresolved item because maybe the email
wasn't just perfect or something yeah
I'll try that tomorrow then
yeah gives a bit if it's not an exact
match to a contact in the two line of
the email it'll end up in unresolved
items in your cache okay yeah that's a
good idea I'll double check on those
but your thanks to the two mom and
they're cold and and I'm going to give
her this I just like here to this cold
that I've had for like a month
I know
mm oh you are okay so notice where I
live Ohio is just like you know
incubator for all this stuff
yes
all right so let's
adding custom tools
were you going to add fields from great
crystal to ensure the crystal field
Wizards and gamma builder both together
Daniel how did you get the suggestion
app to show up on Salesforce 100
you
I think I just scroll down here and
likes columns
so speed more under more and then except
going and suggestion like here okay I
don't have this discussion yesterday Mia
and it is cheap job yes
so let's see what they wanted to do I
have a builder console that's a big one
how many of the share
personal tax has some and if you donít
you need to add more future to store
relevant information about each
suggestion you stand for many types of
data to protect for these later as you
extend your apps for now let's add a
field there we know we need okay so you
can add the new field from the for
Stockholm we practiced in menu by
hovering on few fields and clicking new
bring this over here so you can see them
there you go I never worked from here -
it has its moments
look you food meal I mean for me
especially if I'm developing from
scratch I'm probably going to do it all
from the schema builder personally
speaking yeah I didn't know much about
the schema builder until two weeks ago
so I did everything from the shorts up
from this piece here sure you know more
than one way to skin a cat is this day
yeah so what field that we looking for
that feels create objects continue they
want us to create a suggestion
description field so it's a text area
rich so that one is the really big one
now the things I just don't know yeah
that rich one just allows you to add
images and links okay check
so suggestion script is going to base
and the lamp 32 them visible line and
and help that wave enters much detail
feel double security yeah they did they
took crews through it
you
next as a Janu
you
forget my upgrades on to enterprise much
search all right yes I'll have like some
real-life Tong Tong at the arc get your
money of that and they film a nice piece
of integration with material that is
going to work - because my Kato would
want admin privileges and it's so weird
so now it's the suggestion category
field and it's particular
what do you sticklers for continued
local control to control the um
the selections are the information
that's in that field sure it's also a
reporting issue right we're going to
filter things by their picklist values
as the founders for the resolution and
for business processes
business processes are big-12 but
they're essentially just filtering
information as well good good like the
sales process is just your sales funnel
yeah see this one is customer service
employee services so we could say show
me all the
uh records that had customer service is
value right but funding reporting you
sends of that
yeah the filter uh-huh they show me all
the records with a suggestion category
field as customer service selected
so let's say you have you have an
account you have several accounts and
the difficulty has different rather a
niche browser has different features but
though we can filter all the way down to
say show me what counts has this product
and this feature I think you can make
sure you I say report type it might take
a joined report but you can definitely
support on that
that makes my my seat
okay Google oh they say met let's again
to accept the default field disability
and security status and safe
you
go back to the up another record
you
you
khalaqa have you work in parallel here
yeah the steps is going to skim a
builder
so yeah didn't you
so they say go back to the up
try adding a record in salesforce
1mobile up notification page layout is
the same home browser and in the mobile
path
you
I think the real beauty of mobile is
that it's just so much easier as far as
interface for the NDA
for the end user cause it's into it if
they understand Facebook and this kind
of emulates Facebook and functionality
sort of
whereas that they were in classic they
might be completely lost a little
trading on mobile
then I have to worry about going home
and entering anything when they're done
they do it in real time
we want ice cream it that way that we
can refresh if you just pull down on the
screen I swipe downward like if you
actually use a mobile device it'll it'll
reload like from like if you swipe down
there you go alright they work
you
sweet get it no now we go choose camera
builder I mean guys my phone honest
right you guys gonna go back to work and
just be like killing it
exchangers it makes a lot of friends and
lots of enemies kiss like what you're
gonna fix my system oh yeah there's more
stuff in this I don't think so yeah it's
like when you consult the first person
or the first thing I do when I consult
as I go and I find you whoever the
person is that was running the
organization whether was done right
wrong and different and I get with them
first and I'm like look I'm not trying
to take your job I'm not trying to ruin
your day I'm trying to help ya it drives
you crazy right
and then we'll see if we can't fix it if
you can fix some of their small problems
that have been driving them crazy then
they start to trust you
and once they see working for days I
might like this thing that you can get
each workday you would so many lost
chosen and if I feel fortunate letter
minutes now we already did all the work
and just went but then they say they're
working they're like oh yeah make sense
sure that you are doing this some words
where they've been mismanaged for years
and then I call them checkbox shitty and
that you know that's the one thing they
knew how to do so there's like a hundred
check boxes and nobody does any of Marr
but that's what I almost said what's the
brother features I almost put like the
world them all hyper check boxes yep but
then I essentially Nicolas percent so
table it now we are going to create
products so austere my builder we are
going to go to the object palette and
select suggestion object rear-ended and
they use their object so they see you
xxx just a mono
you
okay so let's end our field today and
turn further of a suggestion so we are
adding I started field what we call
though
what we call status field an object
that's that that business process so I
can get through these stages where a
suggestion gets submitted maybe we do
something along those lines yes that's
right it's the new under consideration
in progress and implemented this is the
pig list value yes oh because any both
compasses the gesture this is late
started Ryan when would you you the
checkbox over 80 different type of rest
I use checkboxes for things like hand
support flag active checkboxes okay
I'm trying to think of another good one
I try to refrain from using them
okay you know just because they can
really start to overtake that object
yeah and I asked because before I came
on to be the administrator some of the
our custom objects had check boxes built
in and I wasn't sure why they went with
a checkbox over a different type of a
field well you can use check boxes as
controlling in a dependency
so that can be kind of helpful mm-hmm or
you know in any number of reasons but I
try to refrain from using checkboxes you
know keep it to a minimum
yeah it's usually a better way I have
one on the leaf I don't I picture eyes
around its invalid contacts data or
invalid data if it's the email within
the Lord or person there's no longer
this company and it can track that
person they lead so we just click on the
checkbox and instead of clothing
clothing because might come across the
individual pointer that's like in that's
like an active checkbox yeah that's
right sounds like yeah so I don't know
if it's the best practice on what I just
I try to avoid them because once you
start using them people tend to keep
creating new ones and the next thing you
know you've got this checkbox problem
before run what therefore people don't
fill them out and that's getting a dead
field
yes all right so now we are adding a
date field which is implemented date
and they dictated for the dimension the
face okay now you take the implemented
into security while still in schema
builder
Oh
click right here click manage field
permission
oh that's nice I didn't like the look of
you and like radar yes Jesse
unchecked above read-only for system
administrator
is it because remember system admin you
can control what they see to feel double
security now the administrator can
always go back in and change it
now
go back to them and check it so we're
back to the protection tab in the
browser or to suggest in the object in
Salesforce one and create a new
suggestion record and deal what you'll
notice
you
you
you
let's get on this let's get more snacks
so how do I go down here can you scroll
maybe drag dragon cam down
that's weird
you
you should like this but something's
wrong wait can you grab
screen and moves upwards above the quick
actions
I'm going down you're down there you can
scroll
come on Ed okay but then when I get here
I can't go yeah I can't seem this for a
living
no the let's look here say what well we
are supposed to notice that could be a
bit of a glitch
yeah can you add a date field
yes is it so what do you have to do uh
edit especially Oh yep we did it in the
schema builder so you're going to have
to add it to the page layout oh that's
what they say now we are supposed to
notice that so they say
notice anything where are two of new
fields we just created status and
implemented a don't worry there they're
just not on the page layout we knew that
right yeah no no
so it's it when you become a builder you
need to add to the page layout into that
exercise we have to do that
well we very excited that that's
probably why you couldn't scroll I'd
wager there was no field down there I
really like how they're running nish in
parallel with mobile I think that's cool
yeah nice job I still can't believe
these things really 50 points I know I
don't like I hung it boy I think you've
got more badges than I did at this point
really yep I did the whole admin
beginner and I'm halfway through the
development beginner nice and there's a
couple but maybe a six hour is missing
yeah I don't know if I'd buy that I
think you'd be cruised through it'll be
less than six hours yes then I have some
time at the office when I'm waiting for
something
I was just feeling like playing with it
yeah that's great I was addicted to it
for about six weeks
and then I just I just got to the point
where I was so busy that I couldn't
really get on there anymore
all right so now we are going to find a
page layout so let's see what they want
us to do then I feel change of the
suggestion and fit the page layout in
the page layout you can have water
chocolate discussion but definitely
think field and group feel good together
your computer but they started field and
read to the right column in the
information section on the owner and
then implemented a field stress to the
red column in the information section
section knowledge party Creek State okay
so this status goes on the owner
you
and the other one goes implemented a in
the red color on the information session
you
right here
I'm expense them
it's a
it's going on right now in the news
section you rearranged the remaining
field
in the description too one column for
the rails and on ok and we create
sections and page layout ah isn't it
here and it was I need yep good guys can
ever go on the system information there
are two columns
ok yep oh that's cute
what they want
and to the toilet and with one one down
she then worked his way out there you go
unashamed inside description here right
yeah
you
yeah suggestions friction
okay now as compact layout so what is
the compact layout is it that one day
you can make smaller that you can hide
the Friends of your face sticking well
up your phone for me
go to any account
you
you
you
where's a inversion Omak
it should be here at one end of this
period you make your screen bigger
better still Nelson
there was one you get you were at a camp
here for a second there we go oh you
don't know if you have to do you have to
click your
phone again
chitta call him yeah try that and I can
never remember how to get that thing to
go away
oh right nice list
there yeah yeah it gets like caught in
that sometimes that's simulator yeah so
if you look at Burlington for instance
the Cirrus has customer direct phone
number
Griffen website that's the compact
layout so just at the top of the page
it's going to put pertinent information
you can control what you want to see in
there and that's how we're going to
learn though yes yes
so the compact layouts works for the
for the phone uh yes that it's just put
those little few field there so the user
can see at a glance what they're looking
at okay it's good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
