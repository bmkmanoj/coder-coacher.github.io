certification course offered by simply
learn in this lesson we will be
introduced to the CAPM certification
course
after completing this lesson you will be
able to define CAPM and PMI identify the
application requirements for the CAPM
examination identify the guidelines to
fill up the CAPM application describe
the CAPM exam outline and syllabus let
us now begin with the terms PMI and CAPM
project management institute or PM i is
a non-for-profit organization that
offers a certification program for
project practitioners for all
educational and skill levels PMI is
based in the USA and has local chapters
across the globe therefore if you are
based in Singapore you can look for a
PMI chapter in Singapore such local
chapters conduct regular knowledge
sharing and networking sessions for
people interested in project management
certified associate in project
management or CAPM on the other hand is
one of the certifications awarded by PMI
it is a credential industry recognised
and demanded worldwide for many of the
project management jobs it is a
mandatory qualification CAPM is not
restricted to a specific domain a
project manager working in any industry
be it manufacturing retail defense or
information technology can write the
CAPM exam and upon successful completion
can be a CAPM certified professional to
sum up PMI is an organization and CAPM
is a credential PMI therefore writes and
supervises the CAPM examinations a CAPM
credential is valid for 5 years after
the completion of this three-year period
it can be renewed PMI measures project
management experience in the units of PD
you PDU means professional development
unit you can acquire PD use and many
ways for example if you attend a project
management class of one hour by an
expert it is considered equivalent to
one PD you if you write a white paper on
the topic related to project management
it may be equivalent to five PD use PMI
has detailed guidelines on what kind of
project management activities amounts to
how many PD use you can look for the CCR
handbook on the PMI website for more
details
PMI releases a guide every four years
it's called as PMBOK guide that is a
guide to the project management body of
knowledge
PMBOK guide acts as a textbook for the
CAPM exam PMBOK guide can be considered
as a standard for project management
profession in the next screen we will
look into the application requirements
for the CAPM exam
p.mi CAPM certificate is an experience
as well as knowledge based certification
this means certain prerequisites are to
be met in order to be able to apply for
this certification the prerequisites
depend upon a person's formal education
as shown in the table a professional
needs to have at least 1500 hours of
project management experience along with
a secondary diploma high school diploma
or global equivalent a professional
whose highest formal education is a high
school degree will require 23 hours of
formal project management education
lastly one also has to submit details of
having attended 35 hours of project
management training just before writing
the CAPM exam our EP stands for
registered education provider PMI our EP
training institute means these training
companies are registered with PMI as a
registered education provider these
provide 35 p.m. contact our certificate
if you attend their 35 hour training
program their certificate can be used as
a proof to be submitted to PMI
applications can be submitted online
once the exam fee is paid PMI sends an
authorization letter many companies are
PMI our EP and provide project
management training simply learn is one
of them PMI randomly
audits some applications from time to
time in the event of the application
being selected for audit clear
instructions will be given on the
evidence that has to be physically
submitted to PMI follow the instructions
and send the evidence before
authorization is given to proceed
examination must be written within a
year of receiving the authorization
letter if you need more information on
PMI you can visit their website w WB m
io RG let us focus on CAPM exam process
in the next screen
CAPM exam covers 150 questions out of
which 15 questions are considered as
pretest questions used for future tests
and are not scored you will not be
communicated about these questions they
might be any random pick therefore you
should answer all 150 questions with the
same seriousness PMI includes these
questions to see how many test takers
are getting them right based on this
they might decide to include these
questions in the future exam it is
similar to a survey conducted by PMI of
the 150 questions
therefore 135 will be scored all
questions are multiple-choice questions
with only one correct answer you get one
point for every question answered
correctly there is no negative marking
for the incorrect ones you may also mark
a question for review and revisit it at
the end if unsure then however you
should attempt all the 150 questions in
the given time PMI grades students on
each of the five process groups and
based on the grading they declare CAPM
pass or fail the grades are not
disclosed to everyone rather a rating is
given they are below proficient
proficient and moderately proficient in
each of the five process groups the
percentage of questions from each of
these aspects is listed on the table
CAPM exam is conducted for three hours
there is one point for every right
question there are no penalties for
wrong answers the result pass or fail is
determined by a combination of these
grades how many grades or number of
points one has to score to pass the CAPM
exam is not made public by PMI the
questions in the CAPM exam are related
to various aspects of project management
these aspects are project initiation
planning executing monitoring and
controlling and closing we call these
aspects as process groups for more
details please refer to the CAPM
examination content outline on the PMI
website let us next discuss the CAPM
exam syllabus
there are five process groups ten
knowledge areas and 47 project
management processes to understand the
syllabus you need to understand the
following terms process groups knowledge
areas and processes let us first discuss
process group the project management
discipline is divided into five broad
process groups when a new project starts
it is first in the project initiation
phase moving to planning phase then to
execution followed by monitoring and
controlling and finally it is closed
project execution and monitoring and
controlling processes go hand in hand
therefore when a new project is
initiated all processes of project
initiation process group should be
applied to the project similarly when
the project is being closed all
processes a project closing group should
be applied for instance identify risks
is a process of project planning group
so when the project is in planning phase
you must identify all the risks of the
project next let us see what knowledge
area is as per pin box guide there are
10 knowledge areas a knowledge area is a
set of specific processes performed to
meet a project objective let us now
consider processes there are 47
processes these processes might be
accomplished in the project planning
process group and a few others in
project monitoring and controlling
process group for example develop
schedule one of the processes is a part
of the planning process group and the
project time management knowledge area
likewise in human resource management
knowledge area develop human resource
plan process is in the project planning
group and manage projects team process
is in the project execution group
let us take an overview of the lessons
of this tutorial we have 14 lessons in
total this is the first lesson which is
an introduction to the CAPM
certification lesson - project
management framework aims to explain
what project and project management is
all about it can be considered as an
introduction to the project management
lesson 3 that is project management
processes groups aims to explain the
five project management process groups
the 10 knowledge areas are covered in
lesson 4 - lesson 13 each lesson is
dedicated to each of these 10 areas
lesson 14 revises the same processes
from a process group perspective this
will help clarify the sequence in which
some of the activities are carried out
and understand these processes more
holistically once you are through with
these 14 lessons you can go ahead and
take our online practice tests
hello and welcome to CAPM certification
course offered by simply learned in this
lesson we will focus on project
management framework let us begin with
the objectives of this lesson after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define project project management
program management and portfolio
management recognize the roles of
project management office identify the
project constraints and their impact on
the project explain the role of a
project manager in stakeholder
management describe different
organization structure differentiate
between a project lifecycle and a
product lifecycle
let us begin this lesson with
understanding what a project is in the
next screen a project is a temporary
endeavor undertaken to create a unique
product service or result for example
developing a new product service or
result constructing a building
industrial plant or infrastructure and
implementing improving or enhancing
existing business processes and
procedures in the next screen we will
focus on the characteristics of a
project a project can be distinguished
based on its characteristics the
definition describes two characteristics
of a project first it is temporary in
nature temporary here does not mean
short in duration a project can extend
for long duration based on the
requirements for example creating a new
indigenous missile defense system for a
country however there is always a
definite plan start and end date for a
project it cannot go on indefinitely
secondly the project is supposed to
produce a unique output the output could
be a product service or result there can
be many common activities between two
projects but the outcome of each project
should be unique in some way or the
other now let us look at what marks the
end of a project a project ends when
either the objectives are met
or the project is terminated because the
objectives will not or cannot be met the
other reason to terminate the project
can be that the need for the output of
the project does not exist anymore
usually the sponsor of the project takes
a call about the closure of the project
it is important to differentiate project
work from regular operational work for
example your office receptionist does
the same work every day of picking any
incoming call and directing the call to
the right person in the office this is
an ongoing repetitive work and can be
classified as operation operations
unlike projects are neither temporary
nor unique creating a new software
system to effectively track your
customer complaint can be an example of
a project when the software is
successfully developed the project
objective is met which marks the end of
the project when you start using this
software to track customer complaints
you are entering into the operations
phase in the next screen let us now look
into project management
as defined in the PMBOK guide project
management is the application of
knowledge skills and tools and
techniques applied to project activities
to meet the project requirements project
management is achieved by proper
application and integration of the 47
processes project application and
integration means these processes should
be executed in the right manner as well
as in the right order in the next screen
let us discuss how to manage a project
program management is defined as the
application of knowledge skills tools
and techniques to a program to meet the
program requirements and to obtain
benefits and control not available by
managing projects individually as
defined in PMBOK guide a program is a
group of related projects which when
managed as a group in a coordinated
fashion provides benefits and control
that are not available while managing
them individually these benefits could
be from decreased risk economies of
scale improved management of
dependencies delivery of additional
capabilities optimal utilization of
shared resources and so on let us now
learn the various features of program
management
random projects cannot be grouped
together as a program the projects in a
program should be related in some way or
the other and there should be some value
added in managing them together a
project may not be a part of any program
but a program will always have projects
a project can also be executed as a
standalone project a program is designed
to deliver some strategic benefits value
to the organization these benefits can
be tangible or intangible examples of
tangible benefit could be increased
profit margins or operational cost
savings examples of intangible benefits
could be improved team morale or
building up certain competencies while a
project manager focuses relentlessly on
the fulfilment of the projects
requirements that is scope cost time
quality a program manager needs to focus
on ensuring that the organizational
benefits are realized in the next screen
let us understand what a portfolio is
portfolio is yet another term used along
with project and program a portfolio may
have multiple projects and programs that
are managed as a group to achieve
strategic objectives note that all
projects and programs in a portfolio may
not be necessarily interdependent or
directly related a portfolio can be
created based on the business objectives
for example an IT service company can
have a portfolio named Japanese projects
which is formed with an aim to take over
the Japanese market by giving more
attention to these projects within this
portfolio similar projects can be
managed as a program and all banking
projects from Japan can be managed as a
banking program in the next screen
let us discuss portfolio management
portfolio management is the centralized
management of one or more portfolios
this includes identifying prioritizing
authorizing managing and controlling
projects programs and other related work
to achieve strategic business objectives
therefore whether the company should
have Japanese projects as portfolio or
not is decided by portfolio management
in the next screen let us understand the
relationship between portfolios programs
and projects
the image on the screen will help you to
understand the terms portfolios programs
and projects a portfolio is part of an
organization's overall strategy it
represents a conscious decision by an
organization to invest in the portfolio
the overall objectives of a portfolio
are then cascaded down to the lower
level components the components could be
sub portfolios programs or projects
these components can further be broken
down into smaller components for ease of
management although a project may not
contain operations a program or a
portfolio it can include other work this
other work may comprise training and
development customer support and
services etc if the other work has
synergy with the overall objectives and
adds to the capability to deliver the
higher-level benefits then it can be
included in the program or portfolio as
well in the next screen we will discuss
project management office project
management office or PMO is a specific
type of body or department within an
organization PMO performs several roles
in the organization and these can
broadly be classified as primary roles
and other roles typically the PMO may
take up any one or a combination of the
three primary roles it provides the
policies methodologies and tools and
templates for managing projects within
the organization it provides support and
training in organization on how to
manage projects and finally it provides
project managers for different ongoing
projects in the organization PMO may
also help in managing inter dependencies
between the projects selecting managing
and deploying shared or dedicated
project resources if need be terminating
a project and organising lessons learnt
sessions and maintaining the project
management knowledge base for an
organization in the next screen
we will discuss how to manage the triple
constraints
any project can be done successfully if
there is no constraint on time or there
is unlimited budget available
unfortunately that is not true in real
life a project is performed within some
constraint and these constraints are
usually competing therefore if you
change one it would affect the other for
example if the project duration
increases it would lead to increase in
the project cost as well triple
constraint is a term that originally
referred to the three competing project
constraints within which the projects
are performed these constraints are
costs time and scope quality is a
primary concern for a project manager
therefore the project manager has to
make trade-offs to keep the scope cost
time quality plain and balanced to
achieve the balance the project manager
also needs to manage other aspects of
the project for instance the people
stakeholders risks communication and
procurements the project manager plays
the essential role of integrating all
these different aspects of project
management in the CAPM examination you
can expect business scenario based
questions focusing on the triple
constraints in the next screen let us
understand who a stakeholder is
a stakeholder can be defined as the one
whose interests may positively or
negatively be affected or perceived to
be affected by the decision activity or
outcome of the project as per the
definition the project team project
manager project sponsor PMO office
customer etc are the stakeholders of the
project a project sponsor is the one who
gives a go-ahead for a project and
provides the necessary resources to
execute the project therefore the head
of projects in the organization who
provides a green signal to start a
project and allocates required resources
to the project is the project sponsor a
project sponsor is usually somebody
placed high up in the organizational
hierarchy of the performing organization
that is the organization in which the
work of the project is being carried out
in the next screen let us look at
stakeholder management
one of the key responsibilities of a
project manager is to manage
stakeholders a project manager has to
involve the stakeholders from the
beginning of the project until the end
so they are aware of every step a
project manager has to take up specific
activities for stakeholder management
identifying both internal and external
stakeholders missing out any stakeholder
can be disastrous for a project a
stakeholder who is identified towards
the end of the project may come up with
his own requirement at that stage and
incorporating them can be risky
determining stakeholder requirements
after identifying all the stakeholders
the project manager also needs to ensure
that their requirements are clearly
identified sometimes stakeholders might
themselves not know of their requirement
and it is the job of the project manager
to get them right by doing a proper
stakeholder requirement analysis
determining stakeholder expectations
stakeholders might also have some
unstated expectations which need to be
clarified to see if it can become a
project requirement it is again the role
of the project manager to determine the
stakeholders expectation communicating
with stakeholders
once all the stated and unstated
stakeholder requirements are known the
project manager as part of stakeholder
analysis should focus on communicating
them regularly to keep stakeholders
involved in the project once you
understand the practices of stakeholder
management it will be easier for you to
answer scenario-based questions and the
examination in the next screen let us
look at the various organization
structure projects are performed in an
organization and the functioning of the
organization might affect the project
the different organization structured
types explained here are based on the
level of authority that a project
manager gets into and those
organizations in a functional type of
organization the organization is grouped
by the area of specialization with a
different functional areas for instance
marketing accounting engineering etc our
departments within the organization each
employee typically reports to a
functional manager in such types of
organization normally projects are
undertaken within the department itself
if a project requires any assistance
from another department the request
moves from the head of the requesting
department to the head of the concerned
department the team members do their
normal departmental work in addition to
the project work the next type of
organization is projectized organization
in such organisations there are no
departments the organization's resources
mostly work on projects team members
report to a project manager the project
manager has complete control over the
resources when the project is completed
either they move on to another project
or they look for some job outside the
company they do not have a department
for themselves the third type of
organization is a matrix organization
which is a blend of functional and
projectized organizational structure a
team member belongs to a department as
well as they are part of a project team
in such organization team members have
two bosses one their department head and
the second their project manager since
there are two bosses here this type of
organization is further classified into
three different types they are weak
strong and balanced matrix organization
so out of the two bosses that team
members have in matrix organization if
the project manager has more authority
over the team member such organizations
are called strong matrix where the
functional manager has more authority
it's a weak matrix organization if they
both share equal Authority then it is a
balanced organization there is another
term that you might find in the exam
called tight matrix this generally
refers to a co-located team that is a
team that has been
placed in the same location to enhance
their performance in the CAPM exam if
there is no mention of the organization
type you can assume it to be a matrix
organization let us look at each of
these organization structures in detail
in the next screen let us look at
functional organization
in a functional organization the
resources of the organization are
grouped by functions sometimes called
departments examples of functions could
be sales finance administration
manufacturing etc each function plays a
definite role in the organization and is
headed by a functional head or
supervisor all the resources in such an
organization report directly into their
functions therefore a salesperson would
report in to the seals organizational
hierarchy a purchase executive would
report in to procurement and so on you
would notice that in a functional
organization the project managers role
is not explicitly called out when a
functional organization embarks on a
project each of the functions that are
involved may volunteer some resources to
work on the project one of these
resources may end up playing the project
managers role the resource assignments
may not even be full-time and sometimes
even the project manager is part-time
since the project manager has no
authority over any of the resources they
are dependent on the functional heads
this makes it more challenging for the
project manager to coordinate in the
team however functional organizations
provide an opportunity for
specialization for example if a purchase
executive was reporting into the
purchase department that executive would
have exposure to all the purchasing that
happens within the organization and has
a well-defined career path in functional
organizations project management happens
at the functional head level next let us
look at the projectized organization and
the next screen
the projectized organization has all the
resources aligned around projects the
project managers have complete control
over the resources working on their
projects the biggest advantage of the
projectized organization is that the
resources have loyalty to their projects
and project execution becomes easier
this kind of structure is suitable for
organizations whose work is in the
nature of projects there are few
disadvantages in this structure as well
firstly the role of the resource is over
once the project is completed secondly
highly specialized roles within a
project may not be fully occupied all
the time for example a purchase
executive may have worked for selected
periods on a project while purchase
activities are going on however for the
rest of the period their capability may
not be optimally utilized there is less
scope for functional specialization as
the project boundaries limit the kind of
work for the resources each project
manager is in charge of a project and
its resources next let us look at the
matrix organization in a matrix
organization the resources report to the
functional managers and are managed by
the project managers as well there might
even be a function that represents all
the project managers in the organization
which provides project management
expertise the matrix structure has three
variants commonly referred to as weak
balanced and strong in a weak matrix the
authority of the project manager is the
weakest and strongest in a strong matrix
structure the titles given to project
managers and functional or weak matrix
organizations are project expediter or
project coordinator they would be called
project managers and a balanced or
strong matrix structure and have
slightly more authority over the time of
the team members the advantage of the
matrix structure is that resources can
be optimally utilized while preserving
the capacity of the project managers to
get projects executed efficiently
resources can specialise in their
functions and have stability in their
careers also contribute to the projects
at the same time potentially
the disadvantage of matrix organization
is that the communication overhead
increases significantly this is because
every resource in the organization
belongs into a project and into a
function leading to a dual reporting
structure in a matrix organization
project management happens at project
resource level in the next screen let us
summarize the advantages and
disadvantages of different
organizational structures
each organization structure has its own
set of advantages and disadvantages the
advantage of functional organizations is
that resources may find clearly defined
career paths and achieve specialization
and skill development in their
respective fields it will be a flexible
workforce since only one manager will be
responsible avoiding confusion the
disadvantage of such organization type
is that project work is hampered
department work is always given higher
priority than the project work in
addition there is no career path in
project management which leads to lower
interest in projects in the case of the
projectized organization one of the
clear advantages is better communication
within the projects since Project Work
is the only work team members are doing
it also leads to loyalty towards the
project goals the disadvantage of such
organization type is the inefficient use
of resources because every project team
has their own support function therefore
this might lead to the duplication of
effort it also leads to the resources
being left with no work since their
roles are over once the project is
completed
it also hampers skill development
because the project requirements dictate
what kind of work team members perform
at different stages on a project now let
us look at the matrix organization it
also has the advantage of better
coordination and maximum utilization of
resources however the disadvantage is
the higher potential for conflict among
the managers which might lead to
communication complexity and overhead
management business scenario based
questions to identify the type of
organization structure can be expected
in the CAPM exam when the organization
type is not mentioned it can be assumed
to be a matrix type of organization in
the next screen let us focus on the
comparison on project lifecycle and
product lifecycle
project life-cycle spans the initiation
of a project until the closure of the
project the product life cycle on the
other hand also encompasses the
operational and maintenance phases a
typical product life cycle starts with
conception of the product and goes until
its withdrawal from the market the
withdrawal might be because it becomes
obsolete or there is no further need for
the product in the market a product has
a long life cycle a product can require
or spawn many projects over its life for
example a project and product conception
phase could be to determine customer
needs whereas a project during product
maturity phase could be used to perform
competitive analysis typically a product
life cycle is longer than the project
life cycle a project also has its own
life cycle and this life cycle depends
upon the industry and the organization
within which the project is being
executed sometimes different
organizations within the same industry
use different life cycles in the next
screen let us discuss more on project
lifecycle
a lifecycle is composed of phases each
phase represents a discrete unit of work
required to be done on the project there
are different ways of classifying
project life cycles let us first discuss
the sequential versus overlapping life
cycle in sequential phases the
subsequent phase starts only after the
previous phase has been completed
whereas in overlapping phases two or
more phases may run in parallel for some
time this could help fast tracking and
compressing the amount of time required
the other way of classifying life cycles
is how they go about the process of
planning and predictive life cycles
there is a large upfront planning phase
where all the details of scope costs
time are planned before beginning the
subsequent phases these phases then are
executed in either sequential or
overlapping modes they are suitable for
large projects where all the
requirements are likely to be known in
advance and where upfront planning
effort is required to get the necessary
approvals another feature of predictive
life cycles is that each phase may
potentially be different in the nature
of activities and may require people
with different skill sets for example
traditional software development life
cycle has phases like requirements
feasibility planning design construction
testing and transition we will continue
project life cycles in the next screen
incremental and iterative life cycles
have a short upfront high-level
definition and planning phase the
product is then developed through a
series of iterations where iteration
increments or adds to the functionality
by a little all the activities are
intentionally repeated in iterations
adaptive or agile life cycles are
variants of incremental and iterative
life cycles where iteration is very
short typically two to four weeks agile
methodologies are becoming very popular
in the software development into
three and in other industries where the
requirements are highly changeable and
frequent feedback is beneficial let us
now check your understanding of the
topics covered in this lesson here is a
quick recap of what was covered in this
lesson project management is the
application of knowledge skills and
tools and techniques applied to project
activities to meet the project
requirements PMO provides the policies
methodologies and tools and templates
for managing projects within the
organization project manager has to
integrate various project aspects like
the people stakeholders risks
communication and procurements with the
project constraints time scope cost and
quality identifying internal and
external stakeholders determining their
requirements and communicating with them
regularly is an important role of a
project manager functional projectized
and matrix are the three types of
organization structures based on the
level of authority given to the project
manager project lifecycle spans the
initiation of a project until the
closure while product lifecycle also
encompasses the operational and
maintenance phases hello and welcome to
CAPM certification course offered by
simply learn in this lesson we will
focus on project management processes
let us begin with the objectives of this
lesson
after completing this lesson you will be
able to differentiate between project
lifecycle and project management process
name the five project management process
groups describe the process group
interactions recognized processes
aligned to different process groups and
knowledge areas identify the inputs and
actions of project management process
groups let us now begin with
understanding the differences between
project lifecycle and project management
process project lifecycle addresses the
question what to do to get the work done
it varies industry wise for example let
us look at a typical project lifecycle
in a software industry first you
understand what is required and analyze
it as part of the requirement analysis
phase then as part of the design phase
you figure out the implementation of it
and arrive with the approach next you
implement the functionality by writing
the code as part of the coding phase the
code is then verified to ensure it works
right as part of the testing phase the
tested and verified software is then
installed at the customer locations as
part of the installation phase after the
installation the system then moves into
operations and support phase the project
management process dresses the question
what to do to manage the project the
processes for managing the projects are
likely to be the same across industries
for instance in the developed scheduled
process one needs to develop the project
schedule irrespective of the industry or
domain you're working in the next screen
let us understand the project management
process groups
the project management processes are
divided into five process groups they
are initiating process group planning
process group executing process group
monitoring and controlling process group
and closing process group the initiating
process happens at the beginning of the
project or phase the planning executing
adds monitoring and controlling
processes go together
therefore you plan execute and replan
based on the execution result the
project closing processes are performed
when the project work or a phase within
the project is completed the typical
project management process and the
closing phase releases resources back to
the resource pool so the team members
can be assigned to another project note
the iteration of processes within the
phases is dependent on the scale of the
projects small projects may have only
one iteration whereas bigger projects
may have multiple iterations before they
enter a new phase project management
processes are overlapping activities let
us look at the interaction between these
activities in the next screen
process groups have overlapping
activities that occur throughout the
project lifecycle the output of one
process group is generally the input to
another or a deliverable of the project
for example project management plan is
an output of planning process group and
an input to execution process group note
that production of the plan is not a
one-time activity as the project
progresses the project management plan
may get updated as a result of the
monitoring and controlling processes the
updated project management plan once
again forms an input to the execution
process group in the next screen we will
discuss the project management process
group knowledge area and project
management process mapping given on the
screen is the list of the 47 project
management processes 10 knowledge areas
and 5 process groups the table shows how
each of them is interrelated you can see
that the project integration management
processes can be mapped back to all 5
process groups while project scope
management processes are mapped back to
only planning and monitoring process
group study the table to identify
processes under project management and
the knowledge area they belong to all
the 47 processes are described in detail
in this tutorial each knowledge area is
covered in detail as a lesson it also
covers how the process is mapped to
process groups to help you understand
the big picture further the inputs and
outputs of each of these processes tools
and techniques that are used in these
processes and what exactly happens
during these processes are also
discussed in the next screen we will
cover each of the process groups here is
a quick recap of what was covered in
this lesson project lifecycle addresses
the question what to do to get the work
done while project management process
addresses the question what to do to
manage the project
there are 47 processes in project
management grouped into 10 knowledge
areas and mapped to five process groups
initiating process group defines a new
project or phase when the project
charter is approved the project is
officially authorized planning process
group establishes the total scope of
effort objectives and course of action
required to attain those objectives
executing process group completes the
work defined and the project management
plan to satisfy the project
specifications monitoring and
controlling process group tracks reviews
and regulates the progress and
performance of the project identifies
and initiates the changes to the plan
when required closing process group
finalizes the activities across all
project management process groups to
formally complete the project phase or
contractual obligations
