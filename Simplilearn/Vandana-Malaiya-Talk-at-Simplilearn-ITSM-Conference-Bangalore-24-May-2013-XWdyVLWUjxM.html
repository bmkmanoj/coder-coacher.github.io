two
fairly in detail on what is
my understanding is and also perhaps
right
from IBM quite a bit how many of you are
from IBM
so maybe you already are aware of these
examples but for the benefit of others
before we start
these news items the first one first on
the top
what happened here
so we had a state which is
rule by
my example has nothing to do
my night night
incumbent by before God that they have
and completely lost my secrecy
we're and if you visit
you see a complete contrast
that used to be called immodesty
for less
when I guess how I central city was
boring and I wanna know what happened to
that case it's not that they were
thanking anybody or anything a strap the
windows to get anything you that on the
other part of living here as operations
that we are the facts
s people ground businesses quantifies of
the distances anyways I if you move your
job
it's not that a client is associated
with you for perpetuity but the minute
you use your lose your
a contractual commitment or stop
the client is going to go and find
another vendor who is going to support
this is precisely that was what happened
the second example on the right hand
side most of you here perhaps know and
this is an IBM example but I I thought
it was very relevant
this was something that we got into an
engagement
10 year or so bad so the party and I
will give a lot of credit to party
somebody
Oh
leverage and a marriage is that ok so
the full exercise he was things that you
but to me that engagement with a baby
stroller example of my centricity and
those who are not an idea housewives but
I we must do it some way
now but any dishonest just a mechanical
strength we on our customer you know
what they like and people we make the
best of it
they come to you and goodbye so we're
customer focus you say okay the my
niece's hours I can't go wire service
and I'm a stupid fire business even a
resource media I the most brilliant
thing is I have the social all three
bowling averages and if there is a match
and if you are not a particular on
meeting against four five of them and
each one of them knows when at nine
months the possibility of being the best
days to anyone and never there the cost
of the subway right so the uniqueness of
the service goes away and
self-publishing based on us and this is
a museum or accumulate right because a
lot has got us and remain and and you
mean I'm focused on a Samba so you're
frying a soul a spirit
I'm sure 930 service in your little to
win you must be trying to get what is
the seat axle missing a vital issues and
that Lydia so that that language that
line has the grass Mac service goes away
so the second place largely for most of
our nation is ordered and when we look
at our spectrum of lines why do you find
that most all most of the companies and
serving the minds of you
the time but the next two phases is
where you start seeing how the thrill
happens the next one is how do you get
engaged with a customer right so you are
completely engaged with what the client
wants to achieve in the long term how is
the client engaging with its customers
and how do they want to retain how can
you help them leverage their customer
base so if you look at a telco
engagement then you are working with the
telco company to not just try to sustain
or retain their business help them run
their business but also how do you grow
the business right and when you get into
this phase you will find that you are
engaging very very heavily in what is
called innovation alright so we try to
innovate for the client you will try to
leverage other services beyond what you
are engaged with so as an organization
you might be engaged with a client to do
provide X service but you will not limit
your engagement just to that you will
try to figure out how you can get the
total intellect of your organization
total bandwidth of your organization to
be able to service a declined and I
would rate our engagement or IBM's
engagement with Martha going into that
mode perpetually engaged with declined
on where they are going how can they
better that service how will they
provide that service the last one is
customer inspired now you guys must have
all of you have or have at least one
product from Apple I'm sure
alright what was the what was the space
in which they walked they try to study
they try to study the customer and they
acknowledged or realized what the need
is right there was this entertainment
and business coming together was not
something that we thought greatly off
few years back but when it was put
across to us from an apple point of view
we realize yes we could do that right so
looking at the products these are
products which are so user friendly very
very intuitive products they address the
needs of every age group I mean you
don't have to tell a child how to start
using an iPad same as you don't have to
tell an 80 year old actually how to use
an iPad so that understanding that need
did the PCs do the same thing no
actually pcs could not or the
smartphones could not get across to the
elderly specially and and you know
become help them become the users of
that technology that was coming up so we
saw a lot of companies focused on
improving what they were working on but
then there was this company which came
and try to understand the customer very
very deeply what works what do they
spend their time on it is music that
every person likes to listen to write
here your choice of music could be
different but you will very rarely find
people who don't listen to music right
will they carry multiple devices is I
want to listen to music on the way and
their type of music on the way and
something on the office in the breaks
they they want it all on the same
you know gadget that they are using so
if you look at the intuitiveness of
usage if you look at the kind of stuff
that is available made available by
Apple you realize this is one
organization which understood how to be
customer inspired and there might be
many more examples what I think because
all of us have a technology users and
Apple to me rings the biggest bill when
I look at a customer inspired
organization so when you look at client
centricity there are multiple phases of
client centricity and I think one should
constantly evaluate as an organization
as an individual how well are we engaged
so in the teams that we work in largely
we try to make sure that at least
everyone is getting engaged with the
client not just in the first two phases
but moving to the third phase and of
course you know there are some examples
of customer inspired which I will again
take forward for IT companies also this
slide I am going to share some of the
best practices that we have in our
organization and our organizations to
device similar methods if you are
looking at becoming very client-centric
so as an organization we have this
concept of innovation discovery programs
and what we do in these programs is
engage both the organization which is
our own organization as well as the
client organization completely in coming
out with ideas which can be improvised
or worked on by the client organization
or actually funded by the client
organization most likely we will execute
them which will improve their business
all right so the idea jams are extremely
popular and
one of the examples I'd like to give
again a very very telco centric so this
was for idea which is an organization
that we service and we conducted a jam
last year by the way we do this for most
of our large customers but conducted a
jam which was asking our employees
itself how do you think this
organization which you might be a
customer of can improve their business
for you so all of us are using services
some of us might be using services of a
particular company and and which could
be idea so the asked was to the
employees an open jam as to how do you
think we can improve the business of the
client we gathered all these ideas
collated them obviously had to you know
bucket eyes them in a particular manner
and then had a three day workshop with
the CIO and the senior management of the
telco company that we were working with
came out with a set that they felt they
wanted to implement and then help them
implement it so this is this is going to
the next level of client centricity
where you start looking at what is it
that they would would benefit them and
can as IBM or care as an organization I
do anything about helping them improve
their business right so this this is one
example I thought would be
when you want to bring in client
centricity it is a huge culture a change
in the organization we normally work
with a contract I have service the
contract client should be happy and we
are done with it right but that is not
sufficient certainly not sufficient in
the current environment so when we are
looking at working with the client
centricity scenario you have to pick up
some mechanism by which you can reach
out to the employees help them
understand what is meant by what you
call as client centricity ONN each
organization's definition here could be
different and then create mechanisms by
which you start understanding what they
understand now with client centricity so
last year actually earlier this year we
had a jam across all the employees of
IBM which was an almost 3 lakh employees
participated in it asking them what what
they felt or what to them was enhancing
client experience so this we labeled it
as a client experience jam you can see
that on the slide and invited ideas from
employees on how or what they felt we
could do better to enhance the client
experience and it could be client
experience based on which client they
were serving or as a generic practice
what could I BM do and there are two add
one you know two things which will
happen with this whole exercise one
everyone started thinking about the fact
that you have to do something about
enhancing client experience right am i
doing anything or not do I have anything
to contribute here or not if not then
can I start thinking around it and
second is as an organization we got
ideas which I am sure a senior
management we wouldn't get on it because
every employee contributed to it
I think getting those thought processes
in was extremely critical just because
the response was so huge we are still in
the process of collating the inputs and
we'll be rolling it out back into our
systems and how we will work going
forward but this is another mechanism
finally I want to touch upon an area
which will be relevant to all this
audience when we engage with the client
it is so easy to go back and say okay
you need to add this server or you need
to add this many more applications if
you want to improve our business or you
need to go to the you know future
versions of software and so on so forth
most of us know that our clients have
tons of hardware which is lying wasted
not used right all of you perhaps go
through that experience lot of
unutilized applications barely used
applications investments which are not
really being put to use as they should
be it is very important for us when we
are engaging with clients to forget for
an instance that I need to add more
business here and you know the only way
i can add business is if i sell them or
hardware if i sell them or software if i
sell them or service the way to do it
also could be to help them lean out
their system right have that
conversation have a constant dialogue
with the clients on what is it that they
really need for their running their
enterprise or servicing their customers
as they might be and arrive at how best
that can be done first if possible with
their existing infrastructure otherwise
get on to the next level where we will
say that yes we need to enhance the
infrastructure for us to be able to go
ahead and do that so getting into this
dialog is something which is absolutely
essential
and I will talk again a little more
about it as we proceed so this was
someone the client experience I just
also wanted to share something
responsiveness is something that we
always associate with the SLA that we
have so if i have an SLA which says you
can turn around this problem in two
weeks time most of us will figure out
how to turn it around in two weeks time
but turn it around and say that
irrespective of what the problem is i'll
try to turn it around and 24 hours all
right very very different impact and you
could actually if something that you're
turning around in 24 hours if you were
to say that I am NOT going to take more
than a couple of hours to actually turn
it around and let me see how to do it so
triggering your organization into
something which is as radical as this
that I don't have to wait to service my
SLA but can I do something much faster
much ever you know better with a much
shorter time would help us address this
kind of scenario as I move into the next
segment which is largely looking at how
do we get focus how how do we get
service focused I just wanted us to you
know realize one fact itsm is not
something which is as matured as many
other fields that we have had so if I
look at the project management you know
field it has evolved and it has
continuously matured over yours we are
still in a curve which is maturing when
it comes to I PSN I was reading a very
decent Forrester report on itsm and one
of the very strong inputs coming out
from that report was drop the IT part
look at the sm part right and don't just
look at the sm part but look at the
service management and automation
and the reason why if you dig deeper
into that report they are kind of
talking about it a lot is somewhere in
terms you know in our eagerness to use
the IT bit quite a bit we forgot that
there was a customer that we were
addressing and this report largely tries
to bring us back into the customer ask
what is the customer looking for and how
do we go much deeper into the customer
ask or the client asked then be focused
on how do I just provide in the best
practices that are possible which which
is something that we look at through it
a lot itsm p.m. let me touch upon on the
various segments of itsm where do we go
with it right so for first one with
regards the service strategy which
services are most important to the
customer to enable them to achieve their
objectives how much of our time and
energy when we are devising the strategy
are we spending on this very very simple
aspect as against these are the services
I have to offer let me figure out how
these services fit for you right or I
can design a service which will have all
this and you use right it's a completely
different paradigm which services are
most important to the customer to enable
them to achieve their objective and get
them the most value from the assets so
sorry about the spell there
from the assets that they have and again
this is something that i would say post
bubble burst ride the dot-com bubble
burst and those of you who joined the
industry a little later than that should
be aware that when the dot-com bubble
burst happened one of the realizations
was that the infrastructure was being
used only ten percent to service
whatever we needed to service so there
was a need to look at mechanisms like
cloud computing etcetera where people
could get going without Mayday making
that huge investment in infrastructure
that till then was the norm so you had
to buy this huge hardware if you have to
service and if you did not have that
there's no way you could go ahead and
service your customers so there are huge
investment asks that were there and
somewhere there was a need to move away
from these ass and start looking at my
mechanisms by which you could start
servicing almost using it like a tap or
like we use electricity you know
pay-as-you-go of scenario and cloud
computing came as a big boon there so so
the need to look at whether we are using
the assets effectively and how can we
add value further to them when we look
at the service design I think they're
there is the need to look at providing
functionality and quality of service
that is needed
the quality of service where you will
see keeps coming back or and and the
focus is not just the turnaround time or
you know the effectiveness but overall
how are we improving the productivity
how are we improving the quality and how
are we reducing the cost so all three
factors are becoming very critical and
one of the realizations I had over the
last couple of years when we are seeing
you know things not going so well as far
as the business goes all of you perhaps
realize we are not in a mode where where
a lot of companies are coming out and
making investments in IT as they would
otherwise one of the things that I
realized is without any contractual
commitment somewhere the client asked
has moved to cheaper right I should
spend less get better quality and get
better productivity out of what I am
making as an investment today and all
the organizations perhaps needs to get
into providing that to the client
when I look at service transition and
this yet in in right so we have had the
multiple practices that have contributed
to how we deal with service transition
and I'm not going to go a lot deeper
into many of these areas because I know
the most of the speaker's after me are
dwelling lot deeper into the whole of
itsm domain but one has to look at our
service transitions part of the problem
any any of the things that we are
looking at when we are engaging with the
client is there something in service
transition that we need to improvise and
and pick that up and look at it mostly
you will find things like change
management configuration management are
areas which are not very well and
addressed release management right have
you automated release management as we
as much as we should have so look at
those areas of service transition which
by themselves could be the contributors
for the transition issues and address
them first before you look at a more you
know revamping the whole thing another
area which which given the population
that we have which is the transient
population is the knowledge management
so do we have a very rugged knowledge
management system in place that is going
to ensure that the knowledge that is
build up over a period of time through
somebody addressing a particular kind of
a problem is captured and made available
to the next guy who comes in without
that individual building the skill and
we'll be building the experience so what
what organizations I really want to do
is look at building this skill but not
be so dependent on the individuals
experience to be build up for them to be
able to deliver that quality of service
and when when if we are able to reach
that or arrive at that with the
knowledge management systems that we
have I think we have actually
and that code so having very good
knowledge men systems there makes a lot
of difference okay continuous
improvement again I think this is
something which requires to be part of
the agenda all the time as an
organization and in my specific
organization which I currently run we
have a special group which looks into
the continuous improvement we look at
the analytics coming out of all the
services that we are providing and look
at the areas where we have some
transition gaps for instance arrive at
initiatives or programs that will help
us address just fix those and thereby
better so there is a need to look at
continuous improvement as a program in
your organization exclusively rather
than it happening you know as the ask
let me move on to getting automated and
I think I have covered a lot of this
while run very very quickly through it
but one of the things that is becoming
very critical less for organizations to
look at having defined automation goals
right and goes largely on how much
productivity they are looking at
increasing what is the quality they are
looking at improving and how they can
make the service much more flexible than
it is today right and flexible to the
need of the organization that they are
servicing
where the automation pics we expect
would be much higher is at least the
task execution as I right so where we
have well-defined repetitive tasks like
backups patch distribution etcetera very
very easy if you don't already have the
automation I think the first thing is to
move to those tasks next look at process
flows and I think VVC or transition from
many of the organization's to start
looking at some of the process flows to
be automated which which is a good move
but the real benefit of it would come if
you start looking at decision making or
the rescission triggers coming out of
these process flows and those get
automated in which case one of the
concerns that comes out is what will
happen to our large workforce that is
already there a writer so a large force
that we employ or deploy in our
organizations perhaps it is good because
automation would mean that we need to
rescale ourselves in areas which are not
currently on the ongoing areas so you
will have to rescale yourself and look
at how we provide services based on the
automation that we are going into I
wanted to touch upon I know I'm running
out of time but I just wanted to run on
one of the things that we all should be
very very cognizant of most of the
workforce today is moving to an
well you know becoming mobile workforce
agree or not I don't think the new
generation and I'm sure many of you also
belong to that new generation here is
looking very much to be tied to the risk
and working if that is the reality that
we are going to work with our systems
and processes have to be able to cater
to that workforce yes agree you know
somewhat I think largely we are seeing
that people are looking at using any
time anywhere devices for the
communication they are looking at being
able to you know what from wherever they
can and they would still provide the
same kind of service so for
organizations which are providing the
service providers like us the need
becomes to automate to a level where we
will be able to support this mobile
workforce at you know the way that they
would operate best so this is where I
would like to stop and maybe we can go
into brief thank you any
check any question answers well London
comments thoughts are also welcome
because I think you are a generation
which I can learn a lot from and I
believe that is what happens i learned
much from a recession that Ivan so and
any any comment also will help
but my name is wretched I am part of
software group India's of the last part
of IBM india now my question is around
the services transition which you spoke
about so what i understood is the
services transition mean that a client
is transferring the services from say X
vendor to Y or is it more than that it
is more than that right so one of the
first the initial phase as you are
looking at a transition from expander to
Y or the client might have been managing
it themselves and then they are moving
into a vendor but it also means that as
new applications and new services get
developed how we are effectively
developing and applying their more
enhancements how are we effectively to
blind them so in my view that
I have a question my name is Madhu part
of the group get over that next I'm
going to ask a non I be able to ask
questions this oh the services paradigm
in India to meet you and I think we were
putting in customer survive fortunately
working weekend Indian customer right
now so the services paradigm is a little
different from what we see if the US
customers and Yuki customers right so
and it will take time to mature but as
an Indian mindset the customer has lot
more expectations than and us customer
on you the customer has basically the
requirements keeps evolving let's say if
we do a an implementation for an us
customer in a period of five years the
Union customer would expect that to be
done in 11 and half years hmm so I mean
do you have some experience of yours if
you were in me with any Union customer
and how this is maturing yeah so you you
touched upon a point which is kind of
keeps us awake all the time right
I don't think it is first of all just in
Indian minds that we see this largely
across all the growth markets I think as
as Indians we all know that we want much
more than what are penny can get us
maybe we are always looking at how can
if I am spending ten bucks how can I get
worth of 15 or 20 rather than you know
had agreed for 10 but with a PCR or
something like that agree to make it
happen with 15 that's okay so that
that's the reality I mean I don't think
we can change that mindset or it is
going to go away now from GBS item and
you know I worked with the services
group where we constantly face this
challenge and in fact some of the things
that we have started now looking at
doing guys is training our people I mean
one of the problems i found is that most
of our most of our employees are very
tuned to servicing much more mature
client which is already used to
outsourcing which means all the inputs
come in very structured and we are used
to servicing them right over you know a
u.s. client or some of the European
clients not all are very very structural
clients and you see the flow much better
but when it comes to the Indian clients
one of these one of the key things we
have seen is they don't like the change
management processes to be put in place
because the minute you put change
management class processes you are going
to monitor and track every change that
you are doing and the effort against
that and cost it right and charge them
for that so it becomes essential to
educate the client as to why we have to
do it because it is the short run versus
the long run and also bring in the
maturity of the client so with one of
the large telcos that we are working now
we are trying to see how we can get them
to CMMI level three at least try
get their processes at level 3 so that
we will be able to service them much
better then if they continue to do this
cowboy style transferring of
requirements to us so it is an RDS
exercise I'll say I don't have an easy
answer for it I know we all go through
it the client is what it is but a very
very strong negotiation and education
process with decline to get them are to
be able to service them for us to be
able to service them better is something
that i would recommend you yeah but
anyone else has any ideas on this front
i'll be very happy to hear because this
is one area and any of the other
speakers actually if you have any
thoughts i will be very very happy to
hear them any more questions for this is
wonderful you know I BMO hey thank you
guys and hope you have a wonderful day
thank you thank you very much mrs. Van
