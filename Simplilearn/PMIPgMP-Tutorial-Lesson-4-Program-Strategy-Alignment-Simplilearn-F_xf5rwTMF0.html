of the PG MP certification course
offered by simply learn this lesson will
help you to understand the first of the
by program management performance
domains which is program strategy
alignment let us explore the objectives
of this lesson in the next screen after
completing this lesson you will be able
to define strategy understand how
strategy of an organization is expressed
list the tasks involved in strategic
program management differentiate
tactical approach and strategic approach
discuss the processes artifacts and
activities required to align a program
with a strategy of an organization let
us begin with understanding the meaning
of strategy and the next slide strategy
is a long-term plan of action to achieve
a goal the word strategy has its origins
in military missions the definition on
the slide refers to one of the original
ideas about strategy strategy was used
as a way of deploying various means to
support the policies of a nation one of
the central ideas of strategy is that it
refers to a plan to reach a definite
goal strategy can also be defined as the
science and art of employing the
political economic psychological and
military forces of a nation or group of
nations to afford the maximum support to
adopted policies in peace or war it is
the skill of making or carrying out
plans to achieve a goal a program
manager must demonstrate focus on the
long-term and strategic goals now we may
wonder who defines the strategy of an
organization it is the executive
leadership of the organization which
comes up with the overall strategy the
organization defines the strategy that
governs its decisions around the
investments it makes in various
portfolios the program delivers some of
the benefits in line with these
strategies let us understand the
migration from tactical to strategic in
the next slide one of the fundamental
aspects of transitioning from project
management to program management level
is the transition from the tactical to
strict
we have understood what strategic means
now let us see what tactical is while
strategy defines the what tactics define
the how in military it is said that
troops on the ground determine the
tactics while the generals away from the
battlefield define the strategy it is an
interesting way to think about strategy
because as a program manager one has to
provide the team with a sense of
direction as to where the program is
headed and then trust the troops to come
up with the right tactics so to become
focused on the strategy perform the
following actions focus on the long term
goals not just on day to day problems
and think of ways to solve them delegate
the day to day issues however delegation
does not mean handing it over to the
team it must be done after standardizing
and fine-tuning the day to day work this
is where the program manager will work
closely with the project managers to
become strategic the program manager
will have to develop more business
intelligence because the strategy will
be decided based on what is relevant to
the business and the program manager
accepts responsibility and
accountability to broader business goals
rather than specific deliverables within
the program it is not that deliverables
are unimportant it is just that the
program manager needs to think of the
goal and not short term milestones it is
rightly said that the first step in
becoming a leader is to start thinking
like one so it is important to make this
mental transition first in the following
slide let us look into the mechanics of
translating organizational strategy into
the work of the program typically an
organization determines its strategy
through a planning cycle the strategic
review is either pre-planned or calendar
based or it can be triggered by a change
in business conditions in the strategic
review the organization looks at the
vision and mission statements and
translates them into a strategic plan
within the boundaries of the
organization's capabilities and core
values the strategic plan is made
keeping in mind the business context
this includes market dynamics specific
requests from
stammers and partners stakeholders
government regulations and mandates and
the plans of the competitors the outcome
of strategic planning is the portfolio
decisions that is decisions about where
the organization would like to invest
its resources it also provides the
program a definition of the expected
outcomes and results that the
organization is looking for let us
continue with the same in the next slide
this diagram given on the slide
illustrates how an organization strategy
is expressed and gets translated into
action at the top level is the vision
vision expresses the goal of an
organization the mission expresses the
sense of purpose for the organization
the mission has to be such that it
enables the organization to realize the
vision the vision and mission translate
into a strategy the portfolio and
strategic planning occur wherein the
strategy manifests itself into portfolio
decisions in line with the portfolio the
organization undertakes some operations
and some projects projects are aimed at
creating additional value or increasing
the overall value of the organization
while operations are meant to actually
realize or produce the value let us look
into the elements of strategic alignment
in the next slide having understood what
strategy is and how it gets manifested
we will now understand how a program
aligns itself to the strategy we will
start with looking into specific
processes and artifacts that result in
this alignment first let us understand
the program business case the business
case provides an indication about the
intent the authority and philosophy
behind the program the basic purpose of
the business case is to establish why
the program is needed or being proposed
it gives the direction in which a
program is headed in order to address
that need the program manager may
participate in the creation of the
business case in collaboration with the
program sponsor and various other
stakeholders the program manager
basically lays down how the program is
beneficial and in line with the overall
strategy the business case along with
the executive mandate to start
forms the key inputs for the
establishment of the program charter and
to authorize programs throughout the
life of the program the validity of the
business case must be reviewed is the
business case still valid and is it
still in line with the strategy of the
organization next we will understand the
program management plan the program
management plan provides the program
level vision mission goals and
objectives these are derived from the
Charter and are the mandate given to the
program the plan answers the question
how are we going to achieve these goals
the program management plan should set
up measures that enable us to track
whether and to what extent the program
has succeeded in meeting the
organization's strategic objectives let
us now look into various key terms
related to strategic alignment in detail
we have referred to terms like vision
mission goals and objectives in the
previous slides let us now understand
what exactly they mean and the role they
play in articulating the strategy the
vision is a description of a goal
it describes the long term direction and
future state for example the vision of a
program may be that it aims to deliver a
certain financial outcome like revenues
or margins the program vision needs to
clearly establish what the goal is in a
way that it should be possible to answer
the question have you reached there at
the end of the program a vision will
typically be a one-liner the mission on
the other hand answers the question why
do we exist it establishes the
philosophy the values and the overall
environment in which the program
operates it is typically a narrative in
the form of we shall try to improve the
profitability of the organization we
shall provide rewarding careers to
employees
we shall maximize the returns to the
shareholders the goals are clearly
defined outcomes that the program is
expected to realize the outcome could be
tangible for example specific
deliverables or intangible for example
improved team morale objectives specify
the success measures for the program for
example the
objective could be an efficiency or
productivity figure that the program
strives to achieve the goals and
objectives are cascaded to the
components of the program and form the
basis of component level planning in the
next slide let us understand these
definitions better by considering an
example let us now take a quick look at
the high-level strategic program
management tasks to understand the
workflow involved at this domain level
the first activity involved in the
strategic program management tasks list
is to define the program objectives
requirements and risks the next task is
to derive the program charter with key
milestones and cost and time estimation
for approval from stakeholder after the
approval from stakeholders extensive
effort is made to analyze the
stakeholders concerns and expectations
and also identify organizational
benefits for the program following this
a thorough market analysis and
cost-benefit analysis are done to ensure
development of program scope and
evaluation of program objectives
soon after this approval from
organizational authorities has to be
obtained just before the program is
initiated integration opportunities and
needs are identified these could include
finance human resource skill sets and so
on the last task that winds up strategic
program management is using the
strategic opportunities for alteration
the strategic opportunities are used to
make the most of the knowledge gained
through organizational benefits having
identified that tasks involved in
strategic program management let us now
move on to understand what the program
roadmap is program roadmap is one of the
critical artifacts produced by the
program that depicts its strategic
alignment and sets up a timetable for
the delivery of strategic benefits a
program is a chronological
representation of the programs
activities and intended direction the
roadmap establishes the linkage between
the business case which represents the
strategy and the work that is planned in
the program let us take a look at the
diagram for an example of a program
roadmap for the establishment
Factory it is broadly classified into
three components visa vie civil works
engineering fixtures and testing and
commissioning within each component
there are sub components that get
completed at various points in time we
can see that some of the work of the
components and subcomponents happens in
parallel while others are in sequence
also notice the timelines at the bottom
of the chart which provide an indication
about when the specific component or sub
component would be ready let us
understand the environmental assessments
in the next slide as we discussed
earlier the organizational and the
program strategies are not prepared in
isolation they have to take cognizance
of the environment in which the
organization and the program do their
work some of those factors are internal
within the enterprise and some are
external outside the organization where
the work is getting done here are some
examples of these factors first is the
overall business environment this
includes things like business climate
market dynamics whether the business is
booming or shrinking etc the market
represents the health of the overall
market including factors affecting the
broader market where the organization is
placed in relation to other players in
the market etc the funding available for
the organization and the program is
another factor sometimes funds are
easily available through the
organization or financial institutions
while they may be difficult to get on
other occasions similar to funding the
requirement for resources and the
availability of the resources is also a
factor how the organization is placed
within the overall industry is an
external factor help safety and
environmental issues may be important in
some industries the broader economy may
impact the organization and of the
program the culture of the organization
is an important internal enterprise
factor the regulatory environment
government or non-government is another
factor the growth of the overall
industry market or the organization's go
around growth is an important
consideration the technology involved
and the organization's access to the
technology are to be looked into the
riskiness of the business and the
specific effort are also important to
summarize there are a large number of
variables that impact the strategy and
we need to analyze these factors to
devise the strategy in the next slide we
will discuss some techniques for
environmental analysis let us now
discuss some techniques for analyzing
the environmental factors to guide the
formulation of the strategy one of the
techniques is comparative advantage
analysis this involves comparing the
different alternatives to pursue an
opportunity within or outside the
organization it also involves analyzing
different scenarios called
what-if analysis feasibility studies are
vital to establish the viability of a
strategy feasibility has to be
established from a financial standpoint
whether we can find the funds and
whether there will be sufficient return
on investment sourcing who will provide
the resources the complexity technical
or otherwise and whether the
organization can complete the work with
the prevailing constraints according to
the outcome of the feasibility analysis
the organization may accept or reject
proposals s wot analysis refers to
analyzing the strengths weaknesses
opportunities and threats in s wot
analysis it is important to have a point
of reference that is the goal that we
have in mind and only in that context
can the SW ot be analyzed assumptions
analysis refers to the analysis of the
various assumptions that have been made
in preparing the proposals validating
the correctness and making sure they are
documented historical information is an
important mechanism for knowledge
management and benefiting from the
knowledge meant of the organization has
gained from past experiences this
includes lessons learned past successes
and failures best practices established
etc
it also provides information about
specific artifacts metrics risks and
estimation data these techniques are
important to validate if the strategy
evolved is viable and whether it will
work in the prevailing conditions it
forms a key mechanism to ensure that the
program is indeed geared to deliver the
organization's strategic goals let us
now check your understanding of the
topics covered in this lesson read the
following business scenario and answer
the question that follows over the past
six months the number of trouble reports
received by the customer service
department in your company has been
increasing significantly new equipment
from two new vendors were purchased
overseas to reduce equipment cost
however most of cost reduction has been
absorbed by increased customer support
costs a program was started by an
inexperienced manager to reduce the
amount of customer support reports by
25% in the next quarter to date a lot of
work has been done but very little
impact has occurred with your extensive
program experience the program board has
assigned you to act as an internal
consultant to help get this program in
alignment with the program goals the
next slide has a question based on this
case we now continue with the scenario
in your initial conversations with the
program manager you noticed a hesitancy
to provide details of the past efforts
they know you have been sent to fix
their program and are being careful not
to expose any weak areas you know it is
important to get these details to better
understand what improvement efforts are
to be planned the next slide contains
the second scenario based question read
the following scenario and answer the
question that follows following a recent
CMM I bought it it is clear that your
organization lags and measures of
project management maturity a key
finding is that most of the key
artifacts and documents that are
required to support your CMMI capability
are not in place CMMI requires programs
to be strategically focused and
traceable you have been selected to
establish a program that works across
borders
to fix the CMMI problem and get the
organization to a higher level of
maturity the next slide has a question
based on this case let us quickly
summarize what we learned in this lesson
strategy is a long-term plan of action
to achieve a certain goal strategy is
expressed through the program business
case program management plan program
vision program mission and the program
goals and objectives the program's
roadmap ties up the specific activities
and components within the program with
the overall strategic objectives the
program has to constantly assess the
internal and external environment to
ensure continued alignment with the
strategy and establish the capability of
the program to deliver the strategic
benefits the techniques used to analyze
the environment include the comparative
advantage analysis feasibility analysis
SW ot analysis assumptions analysis and
historical information with this we
conclude the discussion on the first of
the five domains program strategic
alignment in the next lesson we will
discuss benefits management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
