with a request for change or RFC in
short the RFC is a record in the change
management system that allows
information to be captured and tracked
through to completion the graphic
illustrates the different activities in
a change management process the request
for change or RFC in short is logged an
initial review is performed to filter
RFC's for example if it is incomplete or
incorrectly routed the RFC s are
assessed it may require involvement of
change advisory board or emergency
change advisory board for business
justification impact costs benefits and
risks of changes
this is authorized by the change manager
while the responsibility for
authorization for changes lies with the
change manager the change requester
intern will ensure that they have the
approval of three main areas these areas
are financial approval that is to say
what's it going to cost and once the
cost of not doing it business approval
that is to say what are the consequences
to the business and of not doing it
technical approval that is to say what
are the consequences to the
infrastructure and of not doing it work
orders are issued for the build of the
change and carried out by implementation
groups change management coordinates the
work performed with multiple checkpoints
which means the change management
forwards approved changes to the
relevant product experts so that they
can build and test the changes and
create and deploy releases implemented
changes are evaluated after some time or
post implementation review PIR in short
is done if the change is successful it
can be closed the change is closed of
RFC is standard form to capture and
process all changes to any CI
a key activity of change management is
the assessment of the change request
either by change manager or change
advisory board now let's look at a key
concept in assessing changes in change
management call the seven R's of change
management in the next slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
