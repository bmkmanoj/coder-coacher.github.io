externa menteng with wherever I can
ok but can ever trust me it's the same
guy ok so tickly moving on to the agenda
here what we are going to cover today is
we'll have a very quick introduction to
PMI and PMP - these are two names which
do not require any introduction everyone
knows about it and then we'll talk about
the eligibility criteria what it needs
to be eligible to take the PMP
examination how the application and
audit process work what exactly happen
and how you should start and you'll get

overview austin-bot guide so this is
only one side for that but it is going
to give you the complete overview of
thing bucket and we will help question
and answer at the end but it's not that
I'm going to hold on to all the
questions to the end
I'll take logical breaks and whatever
appropriate questions are there I am
going to answer them and Richard is
going to ensure that I don't miss any
question in case of a mist or anything
he is going to bring it up and I'll
answer all the questions so I will make
sure that before the session and all
your questions are answered okay so
that's about the agenda and I will
quickly start with the topic here so
first is introduction to PMI and as I
told your PMI does not require any
introduction as such because you know
people know about PMP people know about
TMI TMI project management institute is
a not-for-profit Association which was
established back in 1969 and since then
PMI has been working to uplift the
project management community they became
up with this bimbo guide which is
project management body of knowledge
where they consolidated all the best
practice practices of project management
which they picked up which they
collected from all the industries across
the globe so it is not confined to one
particular industry or one particular
region or country or domain it can be
used by anyone and everyone who is
working on the domain of project
management and there are hundreds and
thousands of members that calls that low
and PMI is very very actively engaged in
in the profession for the upper
uplifting the profession okay and they
have lot of certification and one of the
certification the most prominent
certification is PMP which is project
management professional and project
management official certification is a
most important industries because my
certification for project managers in
sector you know offer it you must have
been hearing the news about the leo
and the Joker and roll curtain and all
these things are happening here but PMP
is one certification which actually
ensures and demonstrate that you have
the right capabilities education and
experience to lead and direct project
now why this has become so important
because as as the time progressing the
margins are shrinking and companies do
not have bandwidth companies do not have
the kind of patience or time to you know
experiment with the thing they want
someone who can write from the table
start performing and start delivering
and it actually makes you more
marketable you know it increases any
professional smart ability for him to
employers and it definitely attracts a
higher salary so I am NOT going to speak
much about it because you know the
entire net is full of is full of the
information and the benefits of the PNP
and I mean the proof is that you have so
many people from different geographies
and different regions you know joining
this session to know more about the PNP
that itself is a proof that how
significant this certification is now
moving on to the next important point I
mean next point which is which is quite
important and I am sure most of you
would be looking for this question am I
eligible for PMP so let's have a quick
look at what is the requirement what is
the eligibility criteria so if you have
a bachelor's degree if you hold ending
engineering degree or any other
bachelor's degree then you need to have
four thousand five hundred hours of
project management experience okay and
along and that four thousand five
hundred hours of experience must have
come from last curve some minimum thirty
six months when I say thirty six months
it means that if any one of you have two
years of experience of Twain half years
of experience but you are saying that I
have more than 4500 hours of experience
that means you are not eligible
you need to have minimum 36 months of
experience there is no maximum limit
there is no upper limit and I am going
to talk about how you're going to
calculate your four thousand five
hundred hours of project management
experience and that experience must come
from the projects done in now
eight years only so if it is if we are
in 2017 right now so that means you
cannot consider the experience from a
project in which you work and before
June 2008 2009 okay so the project must
be after June 2009 if you do not have a
bachelor's degree if you have a diploma
prostitute diploma or I mean you are a
high school graduate then you need to
have seven thousand five hundred hours
of PM experience then minimum five years
time and apart from bills you also need
to have certified contacts our
certificate that means you need to
complete this project management
education for certifying us that is
where simply learn is going to help you
you will provide this project management
education and and after the training you
are going to get this sub circuit which
is going to make you eligible to take
the PMP examination okay so any
questions on this part you can just
write and type in in your in the
question window and when I take the
logical break I am going to answer all
your questions here going on to the next
one that how we are going to calculate
that project management experience this
is a disappoint important part because
you know people I've seen in my
experience a lot of people ask this
question that I am both on multiple
project I worked on with the project
which are probably seven or eight so is
there any capping from p.m. p.m. I know
there is absolutely no capping from TMI
the numbers of projects can exceed to
five ten twenty thirty PMI is never
going to ask question because as per
Kimber quite the definition of project
is an animal undertaken to create a
unique product service or desert is a
project okay so the the most important
point here is it has to start and some
point of time at and at some point of
time it cannot here never ending or
ongoing activity so if you are some
operations background then we need to
talk separately you can probably reach
out to me or to my team and they will
help you how you're going to calculate
with your experience and also this
definition also highlights that the
duration of the project is not important
the duration of the project would be one
day one year ten years also I have seen
people who have been working on one
single project for seven or eight years
so that is also absolutely fine another
important point is this project must not
this Exodus must not overlap okay so you
can see here on the screen there are two
projects so they starting from January
your project a has a duration of six
months and somewhere at the end of
probably a March or Apple you started
working on another project project D and
you work till September so if you look
at the cumulative duration it is going
to be 12 months but you cannot mention
this in your application form the empty
application form that since I work on
two projects of having six month
duration each that means cumulative is
12 months know at the end of September
the total duration that where you can
actually calculate your project
management experiences fall will give is
10 sorry 9 months so January to
September 9 months ok so there must not
be any overlap between your projects
that is one point second is your
designation is not important
lot of people have this doubt that I was
not a project manager I was a lead or I
was a developer I was a system analyst
or I was engineer so your title or your
designation is not important what is
important that the role that you played
in the project ok so suppose you are
given an analyst but you played an
active role active part in connecting
the requirement from the customer
articulating this requirement into a
witness into the pan and then managing
some Bob of execution or maybe driving
some part of execution and then you are
also involved in the training and
handover to the customer so that means
you devoted some time and initiating
planning
and then execution probably monitoring
and controlling and closing so you need
to specify how many hours to spend in
depth so we are going to talk about that
in the fuels right from now so right now
what you need to understand so is your
duration it must not come from the
project which have overlapping and your
title is not important here okay and you
need to document the experience or each
and every project that will work on if
you work on ten projects and you need to
document experience all ten different
projects how I am going to tell you that
in some time okay so with this we are
done with this slide and before I move
on to the next one let me just take a
couple of questions here Sonia is asking
I need to know I am working as a lead
for electrical power of project will
this work here's Nia this will
definitely work provided you have the
adequate experience and Goro is asking
I'm working as ITT you ate for five
years at data center ok ladies at eight
years experience here's perfect your
figure is eligible borrow of course you
need to look into your experience
calculations asking I am some IT
background - two years of experience for
point being p.m. do I need to have
development experience well this is a
this is a question which is not related
to exactly to the PMP but yes this is it
all depends on the kind of opportunity
and how you're going to get that
opportunity okay you can reach out to me
if you have any further questions I will
share my contact it is at end of the
session and she newest Alou has a
question nowadays market is demanding
pmi-acp and NOC PMP everyone means
desire so how is helping me PMP as it's
code now well PMP is not old
pmi-acp yes it has a market and that
market is going but you need to
understand that pmi-acp is in demand
specifically into software development
industry and software development
industry is not the only industry there
are multiple industries and they require
a PMP certification and another
important point is the sixth edition of
PM work is going to come up in some kind
I'm going to talk about that towards the
end so they have inputted lot of you
know
content about the edge i lessor so yes
pmi-acp demand is increasing but that is
absolutely no impact on the demand for
PMP it is ever growing now okay
and so harsh as a question that I've
experienced in manufacturing am I
eligible yes yes you are eligible and
godoh thing someone asked you to go for
CFM yes definitely pimple for CAPM okay
fine so that I can see that the
questions are being bombarded here so
I'm just going to stop here and I'll
take remaining questions at the end here
because we need to move on with a slight
a lot of things coming up and please
don't worry all of your patients are
going to get answered okay I am NOT in
the session before I answer all the
questions now let's move on to the next
slide quickly have a look at the PMP
application process so the application
process if you want to I mean whenever
you are ready to kick start your PMP
journey you need to go to this URL which
is giving you given here on PMI
authority and you need to click on the
supply for the integrating share and
once you have detail you need to follow
the process I am going to give you the
screenshots you know that in the
following slides you complete and submit
an application online once you submit
your own as your application online then
PMI is going to take around five this is
maximum five business is this day's time
to review your application and review
your credentials so when I say
credentials means they will check
whether you are eligible for PMP or not
if you have adequate experience or not
and once all these details are checked
then you receive a mail from PMI that
you can go ahead your your application
as in accept it you can go ahead and
make the payment now then if you need to
go and make the payment and after you
make the payment then PMI is going to
pick up 20% of the applications purely
on the random basis for audit okay then
your pikmin eric delays in case your
application is picked up for audit then
all the projects that you're going to
document you need to provide a reference
for that and PMI will verify whether you
have the flight experience or not and it
will look for some kind of confirmation
from those lessons
we are going to cover that in sometimes
from now and once you supply the
required information to PMI you will get
the Lotus care response from PMI if it
is accepted then you will receive a link
from PMI which will the you know where
you can go and schedule your examination
in case your application is not picked
up for audit then right after you submit
your make your payment you are going to
receive a link from PMI that follow the
same go to chromatic website and skip
your daily examination and we start
preparing for that so the process is
very simple and it is the
straightforward and PMI is going to
inform you about each and every step
their communication is very neat and
clear and very precise they're going to
make you aware of entire process in case
your application is picked up erotic and
of course simply learn is always there
to support you and assist you in case
you have any dogs or you hit any
roadblock we are all there to assist you
you can reach out to me as well J so
this is the PMP overall PMP application
process and another important point to
note here is when you submit your
application you do not require any
documents at that time okay in case your
application is picked up erotic then you
require three set of documents one is
your education certificate you know this
will be sure to that you have the
bachelor's degree or not second is you
require your training completion
certificate which simply learn is going
to provide you okay after completion of
your training will provide the
certificate to my contacts at escape
this will fulfill the requirement of PM
education project management education
and third is the reference of all those
people so suppose you work on two
projects and you need to submit the
experience or each and every project and
also you need to provide a reference a
person who can vouch that yells mr. X
this will also work on this project from
this in this duration in this capacity
there is a very simple process all you
need to do is all the
the lessons need to do is you know they
need to download that form take a
printout of that fill up that form and
send it to you by post soft copy will
not work important point to note here is
soft but they will not work they will
have to mean it to you they will have to
pour it or post it to you and then
without opening you need to forward the
same envelope as it is to your local PMI
office okay if you are in India it will
go to Google or if you're in some other
country it will go to the regional
offices here and then PMI is going to
revert to you once it is accepted and
you have cleared the audit okay so this
is about the PMP application process and
now we are going to have a quick look at
how does the form look like because
unless used to create your IIT and start
your submitting your application you
will not get to see this and that's why
I taken a screenshot of the form so you
you can just you know get a feel of how
this application is going to look like
and most importantly this is actually to
remove the fear from the people's mind
you know a lot of people have been
pushing gates people have been
procrastinating that is the decision to
take on the PNP because they feel it's a
very complex and very lengthy process no
it is not at all complex and lengthy
process it won't take more than property
an hour or two are to submit an entire
application fill up an entire form and
most of the time will be in when you
start writing your project somebody or
start recommending your experience so
after I mean there are some few details
here on the left side you'll see the
step and application and there are
contact essays contact information
attended education so I am NOT unjust of
not going there I am starting a straight
from where you need some information so
suppose you started working or you have
enough experience and you work on
vertical project since 2010 and let's
say you have worked on five projects so
far so you need to document each and
every project here so this is the first
step where you enter the project
specific information like the project
title of the project and start and
finish state and the important point is
the role let you played here in the
project whether it was
project contributors supervisor manager
leader project manager educator
consultant administrator or other if you
do not if your title or if your role in
the project does not matches yours then
you can just select others okay and then
your primary industry once you have
filled up this data and then you go save
and move to the next one where you need
to provider organization so this project
was done when you are working for which
particular organization so you need to
provide organization detail now suppose
you work with ABC limited and you need
multiple projects here so after you
return enter the details for the first
time and you seem and continue next time
when you come here who enter the details
of the second project you can click on
the drop down which is here on the top
boxes select the same documentation and
you need go to fill this information
again and again so provide the required
details here and then you move on to the
next one now this is the important point
where you need to provide a primary
contact for this experience for each and
every project you need to provide the
reference of a primary contact and that
context can be either project spawn
sponsor or client or manager or director
or any primary stakeholder so primary
stakeholder could be anyone it could be
your senior team member it could be
senior analyst it could be your finance
manager it can be a controller or anyone
okay so so I did all this information
now my advice to you is before you fill
in this detail before you give the
reference of any person I would suggest
you reach out to that person and check
with them whether they are okay or they
will be available to provide his
reference to PMI articles in case you
have given someone's name and after your
application is picked up for audit and
then you are not able to reach out to
that person then your application will
be cancelled and then you will lose one
hundred and fifty dollars
PMI will refund yo all the money and pay
an amount detecting one hundred and
fifty dollars okay so make sure you are
talking to that person before you
provide your TA
and then we move on to the next where
for that particular project so we are
going to talk about it later the entire
project is divided into five domains
that is initiating planning executing
controlling and closing the project so
you will need to specify you need to
populate this detail here that how many
are to spend working on each and every
domain of this project now there may be
a situation there may be a project where
you did not work on the planning you
work on initiating and then you work on
executing and you open the closing that
is absolutely fine in one project not
necessary that you have to work on all
the five domains but then you fill up
all the experience entire experience you
have to ensure that you have some amount
of exposure or experience in each and
every domain of this project management
otherwise your replication means not be
accepted okay so after you have entered
the number of are spending each and
every domain for each project then you
move to the last section here where you
need to provide a summary of this
project and the summary must improve the
project objective and the role that you
played and in each domain I would
suggest that you know you summarized in
such a way that you are giving a please
detail about deliverables of each and
every domain and the entire description
must not exceed three hundred and fifty
characters you can connect with me or
with my team and we'll provide you a
sample of summary of this project which
will be helpful which in comes very
handy when you are filling up this
application here okay so after you have
filled up your exterior when you start
adding your project here so this is how
your experience worksheet is going to
look like you keep on adding project and
p.m. I am in this tool will keep on
capturing your experience here so you
will have to keep adding unless you
cause four thousand five hundred hours
of p.m. experience now you may have a
rich experience of twenty twenty-five
years of experience and you want to wear
probably nine thousand or ten thousand
hours of experience that will not help
it does not
any difference all that matters is 4,500
Oz so I would suggest you need not to
you know spend effort in giving the
spheres of faith thousand or nine
thousand or ten thousand dollars it is
not at all needed and PMI will not get
impressed by it the only way to interest
PMI is your experience and it is well
articulated where you have very clearly
mentioned you work on which domain and
what activities you head and what
deliverables you have and that's it
anyone after that the process to pick up
for audit is purely on the random basis
no one knows whether the application is
going to be picked up or not okay and
after you have documented all the
experience and you have required 4500
hours then you move to the next section
where you need to provide a detail about
your p.m. your p.m. education so this is
here in the add education section you
need to write your title as PMP
certification training and in the
institution mean you need to start
typing simply learn so simply learn is
this is circuit PMI and so you know we
have this IP intellectual property
rights also we have for sale set one
listen to assets from a PMI so we are
authorized to use PMI content for
training and since we are registered
with PMI when you start writing
you'll see the name getting populated
there and provide to start your training
start it and end date and just save and
continue and once you move on to this
one then you need to you're ready to
submit your application so you can
download the PDF version of your
application after you have completed all
your project and you have four thousand
five hundred also HP is you can look at
that you can share that with us as well
you can probably provide you give you
and review because what happens is
suppose you have in this past eight
years you work on only two project which
has given you the required experience
and you make some mistake while typing
the well letter you know writing the
summary of that and in case PMI refuses
to accept that or rejects it someday you
cannot reword it
I mean PMI mail is this question that
okay
welcome standing so we cannot accept it
and then when you are resubmitting the
application for the same project you
cannot show experience and planning so
he will have a very careful while
submitting the application ok you can
reach outwards and we will support you
we will provide you guidance on how to
fill up the application form that
support is there 24 by 7 down the block
ok so with this I am going to take a
logical click and I am going to look at
the question that I am getting here and
I can see lot of questions coming up
here let me quickly take some time to
answer these questions here so the first
question is I am going to take is how is
PHP okay this is from Pawan Kumar Pawan
is asking how is PMP certification
beneficial for civil engineering
profession well civil engineering health
has a lot of significance that because
you know most of the world that you go
there is a cure your project and in
India and outside India the demand for
PMP certification especially in the
Middle East is increasing like anything
for civil engineering professionals ok
construction is a very very prominent
industry in fact before IT came before
the IT emerges a strong industry which
which demands PMP certification this was
already there in the construction and
super 1 I mean this this question cannot
be summarized and I mean if I don't
summarize the answer in one statement
yes it is extremely beneficial ok next
question is from ABS double seven eight
I am sorry I can't see your name if
after payment application rejected then
what about the payment where a PMI will
not reject your application after you
made the payment if PMI has to reject
application that will happen before the
you make the payment and in case for any
reason your application is rejected you
to non-compliance or due to some audit
issues then PMI will deduct one hundred
and fifty dollars as their
administrative charges and return the
remaining money okay and next question
is from Universal Oh
given a change of P for P MP and
which one should I choose what should
the mental condition before taking the
PMP examination okay she never said oh I
can see a lot of questions here
there are many standards and tools and
ethics defined in PMI she must salute
what I will do is I will park your
questions for the end I would suggest
that let us complete this first and
let's have a review or I am an overview
of bimbo Quay and then I answer this
question to you so you are in a better
position to understand that okay I hope
you won't mind it but don't worry I'll
answer the question before I end the
session and for one is nothing that the
started should be project start or all
peasants start a to the project no the
start date should be the project started
once there are suspicions I turned
regular show up in purchase Department
yes you are eligible as long as you work
on the project if you have any doubt
about your candidature or your
experience you can share your profile
without one of our team members and and
review that and I will get back to you
on that
again the question from ABS mm innate
building processes for getting business
means it's somebody involved in
preparing page did it be counted as an
experience yes definitely see I want to
add one thing here for the interest of
the larger audience here the notion is
that PMP is only for IT or PMP is only
for people who are working in software
development or IT projects no wherever
there is an element of project project
management is required and wherever
project management is required PMP is in
very high demand okay so if you are in
purchase you're involved in the bidding
process
bidding itself is a project when you go
for the large project when you pick such
a large project you need to initiate you
need to plan that you need to execute
you know to monitor different political
it's sort of one single activity for
your field of the form you give it to
them you probably need to do some
solution solutioning also at your end
okay
and in fact EMI also you know gives a
lot of significance to the bidding
entire bidding process there is a one
knowledge area project procurement
management in timber Curnutt
okay so yes you are eligible you can
straightaway go for it
the next is again she was aloof from I
am planning to become the MP trainer
once I complete the anti-segregation
what is the purpose well becoming a
trainer is completely your choice but of
course you need to have that adequate
knowledge and and most importantly you
should be able to handle question we can
talk offline about this okay okay now I
know from which location you are giving
guidance for us I am in Bangor she knows
hello and if you are here around I would
love to meet you and be very glad to
meet you know all the people I am there
and all social media I am there and
Linkedin I have my own page in Facebook
you can find me and connect it through
there and yes I will be glad to connect
with everyone there so what is TMI
registration PMI registration okay so I
am going to talk about so there is a
question from division J given J I am
going to take your questions at the
appropriate time there is a slide which
I mentioned for EMV examination fee and
is it use of a PMP examination we are
going to talk about that so your
question will be answered when we reach
to that appropriate section here okay
and then there is a question Rowling's
Childre how PMP benefits were rolling
stock manager okay we can talk about
that later
I mean it may not fit completely into a
project category but yes there may be
sitting areas so this is a very specific
question which I'll locate offs I know
maybe at the end hitter completely in
the last okay so I think the questions
are not getting stock and if I start
answering all the questions right now we
will not have time for the important
topic so I am so sorry but I will pause
the questions here and I will move on to
the slides and when I take the next
logical place I'll try to answer some of
the questions otherwise we take it to
them and okay wait so moving on to the
next section here about the PMP
examinations fee so PMP examination fee
is in case you decide to take the PMI
membership first then it is going to be
four hundred and five dollars the PMI
membership fee is one hundred and thirty
nine dollars okay so one hundred and
thirty nine dollars plus four hundred
five dollars or P mph
that makes it around five hundred and
forty four dollars in case you do not
want to go for PMI membership than the
fee for a PMP examination is five
hundred and fifty five dollars a lot of
people ask this question whether I
should go for PMI membership or not my
personal recommendation is yes you must
go for PMI membership because it comes
with a lot of other benefits of course
you get access to the soft of your
Kimber guide which is your personal copy
and when you get this exes let me just
share my personal copy with you you are
going to get this first ID copy there in
the bottom I mean the top it is written
like PMMA PMI member benefit license or
so and so and your PMI number as well it
is not for distribution scene or
reproduction so no one can sell you the
soft copy and then provide you the soft
copy of PMBOK guide when you apply for
the PMP examination you get your own
copy you get your own version okay and
and also it is you may see membership to
the local PMI chapter which is
completely optional on your decision on
your choice so like I will give you my
example when I was going for PMP
examination I have taken the membership
for a local chapter as well because the
local chapters health are very very
helpful in certain days you know after
you become PMP then you can start
attending the conferences you can go and
participate in the activities there and
for each activity that you are doing or
whatever work you're getting involved
into you will be able to uncertain PDUs
so P Rios are you very oh so then you
have to renew your PMP certification
okay so PMI membership is something that
I would suggest you to go for it along
with this you also get access to project
management comm so project management
comm is a is a sigh poem by PMI where
you'll get lot of resources and most
importantly you will get an opportunity
to connect with tho professionals across
the globe and a lot of companies have
started posting their requirements as
well just a great networking site it's a
great net right provide great resources
there and when you become member you get
access to a lot of forums as well and
which which can be very useful while
preparing for the PMP examination so to
conclude this
better to go for PMI membership or not
yes you should go for it okay and then
you'll complete the process and you get
up your application is selected and you
have got the examination then right from
the day okay so let me go back to the
process let's say you after making the
process whatever it is if your
application is picked up for audit or
not the day you receive an email from
PMI that your application is accepted
your payment is accepted now you can go
and lock your computer examination and
chromatic Center from that day you will
have one year's time to clear the PMP
examination and within that one year's
time you are allowed to have only three
attempts for example a person went there
and let's say the person got this email
from PMI on 1st of January 2017 that a
person can take the mph nomination till
24 December 2017 ok now that person
schedules of exam poster tampering
separate let's say 28:15 to February the
person went there and unfortunately the
person failed so one attempt is gone and
then the person can reappear for the
examination after a gap of 30 days so he
cannot apply reapply for the person
gonna be apply for it before 16th of Jan
so it is a 16th of March so after paying
that he examination fee and while paying
a well while reapplying for the
examination if the person is change
member then you will have to pay $225
otherwise you have to pay three hundred
seventy-five dollars let's say the
person that person blocked the
examination apply for the reexamination
so second time on 16th of March and
unfortunately second time also that
person failed then he will get third
opportunity as well after a gap of 30
days he can reschedule the examination
after paying the fee depending on this
membership says testicle and if the
person let us fail to clear that exam in
third attempt as well then his
application is
insert okay let's say he is the third
rectangle 30th of April so after that he
will encase if you want to go for the
fourth attempt or the next time then
that person will have to resubmit that
restart the entire process from the
beginning but I have not come across
anyone who is fail to clear that so you
don't need to worry about it most likely
if you go with simply learn most likely
that you will be able to create this in
first attempt why I am going to talk
about that later on and important point
is this scheduling fee if you suppose
you schedule the examination for 15th of
February and you want to risk it to the
examination on 18th of January and then
there is some travel or something urgent
came up then you are not allowed to do
that in case if you want to do that you
have to pay a re-examination or
rescheduling fee of 70 others okay this
yodeling within 48 hours is not allowed
and you have the flexibility to change
the exam location and also put no-show
is considered else one attempt cons so
make sure that you are working on your
schedule video for the PMP examination
clear and this is to move on to the next
part which is PMP exclamation looping
and I can see the questions are putting
in and I will hold on to the question
let's see some pages topics first they
some movement and then I am going to
take a break and come back to your
questions so very quickly the PMP
examination go pin as I told you the
entire timbre guide is divided into five
domains entire project is divided into
five domains initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing and these are the percentage of
questions that you're going to get so
all those all those 200 questions you'll
be 13 percent of questions which is 26
from initiating 24 from pending and so
on okay but these questions will be
mixed randomly and then there are ten
knowledge areas which are mapped or
these four five domains of it okay so
there is a question coming up here
percentage of pass of PMP I am going to
take the question later though it is
very important data
but I have a slide for that phone volume
back part so these are the 10 knowledge
areas which are covered in spit bucket
and hat simply learn this is our exam
syllabus we are going to cover all the
five domains and all the ten knowledge
areas so there are five process groups
ten knowledge areas and 47 processes in
pimple site and you will need to go
through each and everything but it is
not as difficult as it seems to be don't
worry I can make it very easy for you
you know and also when when we when we
come to the last of it I am going to
talk about that when you try to memorize
everything then you are definitely
heading for a failure memorization will
not help you need to understand the
logical flow and then things will be
very very easy for you I'll share my
personal experience when I was preparing
for the PMP examination you may believe
it or you may not believe it but I've
studied only for five is I was working
with Hewlett Packard at that time HP in
Chennai and you know I had been pushing
my PMP examination date but then I came
to a point that I could not have pushes
beyond that and then I took the
examination leave for five days and I
just locked myself in the room and
studied for five days and I was able to
create this in saw shutter so the time
and I have seen people spending two ones
with Siemens preparing for the
examinations they also have failed and
then I have seen people who just did
this food is training I did a session
probably one year back where I was
gentleman from Canada was working in a
telecom industry he competed the
training and then held them for the PMP
examination without any preparation and
he was able to clear it so the logic and
understanding is very very important
very crucial here and the content of a
we are designed the content which is
going to help you understand the logic
the kind of instructors we have so we
cover each and every area that is
required for you required to clear this
PMP examination and not only just
clearing the PMP examination because
after you become PMP we will get back to
the respective organization the
expectations from you will be very high
the organization will be expecting you
to perform in certain manner so we are
going to load you with that also okay so
coming to the Nexus myths about the PMP
examination so here a lot of your
questions are going to be answered so
one of the most popular myths is that
you need to have 61% mass to clear the
PMP examination which is absolutely is
wrong okay
from number 2005 onwards TMI stopped
publishing the passing percentage and
they adopted the psychometric analysis
so I will tell you about how it happened
so there are 200 questions in the PMP
examination let's say you start at the
PMP exam and you get one question at
number 10
so there is a question and then there
are four options given and you select it
after going through all the everything
you selected one most of the option
which you feel is the most appropriate
where you move to let the question
number 35 you may get the same question
with different set of options okay when
you go to question number X is 50 you
may get a similar kind of question with
some fills and there's a different set
of options so this is how you attempt
that these three questions PMI is going
to figure out whether you apply certain
logic or was this just by a fluke
okay that is that is the the approach
that PMI uses but again no one knows
what approach PMI is going to take so it
is completely completely unknown to the
outside world so if anyone comes and
tells you I know how PMI is going to
look at your score and everything that
is absolutely wrong okay so 61% is just
a myth it is no longer than a PMI is
going to give you great it can be
moderate proficient proficient or below
proficient for each domain initiating
planning executing monitoring
controlling and closing PMI is going to
give you the great and depending on the
grade and based on their own logic there
were to take care whether you have
powers of sale inside I know cases where
people got you know below proficient in
two or three domains and they got
proficient in one domain and they still
cleared it clear
second part is we talked about this
domains and five domains 10 knowledge
areas and 47 processes and then if you
put together everything with the way
process is structured is there is a for
each process there is input then there
are tools and techniques and then there
are outputs put together all the inputs
tools techniques and outputs or you can
call that as ITP all the more than 520 I
take use in the symbol base and it is
not possible or not very helpful to
memorize each and everything your
memorization is not going to work your
teaching some people rely heavily on
teach it as seen lot of people will
repel all sort of cheat sheet will read
your sort of teach it but still they
have failed
okay so cheat sheet is now going to help
you memorization is not going to help
you so you really need to understand the
logical flow and the moment you
understand that you are there you need
to understand that you need to
understand the logical flow in fact p.m.
I also emphasize on the same thing that
your memorization is not going to be
very very helpful okay so let us see
come to the last section where I am
going to cover up give you a very quick
overview of Timbuk where you are
slightly behind the schedule because I
you know started canceling the session
and before we move on let me just you
know have a look at the questions that
we're getting here or there are a lot of
questions I mean it's better that I push
all the questions for the for the end
and let me quickly move to the next one
and I'm probably going to take the
questions so Richard I hope you are
keeping a track of all the questions and
I am going to take up everything at end
of the session so with this we move on
to the next important part here is the
overview of the PIM book guide so I am
going to spend five minutes on this
where I will give you a glimpse or a
very quick overview of how this entire
logical flow is structured and those who
have attended some training at some
point of time I am sure this will is
very helpful those who are planning to
go for it you will get insight on what
exactly you need to prepare for and how
you should go for it
and before that give me a few seconds
and
is going to sit some water I've been
speaking non-stop for plus 50 minutes
okay and here we go so we are going to
look at the logical sequence at a very
high level so the very the first thing
here is the very first thing that you
are doing any project is your developer
project charter so project charter comes
under initiating domain so when you
there is a process or everything that
you are going to do there are processes
here I'm not going to talk about those
processes in details right now but there
is a process called develop project
Charter and once you follow the
processes you collect the info and then
you have the tools and techniques and
you will get the project charter as an
output so project Charter is the
document which is going to authorize the
commencement of a project in any
organization and it will also empower
the project manager to add resources or
utilize the resources of the
organization for the project's work once
the Charter is prepared then project
manager along with the project team will
start working on the subsidiary project
management plan so before they come up
with a monster' project management plan
the team and the project manager will
have to work on all these subsidiary
plans all the components of the project
that is the change management and
deployment management and configuration
management plan who
tying calls quality HR communication
procurement drills and you will come up
with your finish line that it will cost
baseline schedule design and scope a
sign once all the subsidiary plans are
completed or ready then we are going to
consolidate everything in develop
project management plan process there is
a process called as develop project
management plan and outcome of that is
going to be your project management plan
once your project management plan is
ready then the project will move into
executing stage so that act and manage
projects works so that it can manage
project work is there
another is going to release the team and
manage the team in twins of work which
was planet and as team start doing the
world there would be work results or it
is called it as output and that output
is going to be in the form of your
deliverables and along with the
deliverables you're going to get your
work performance data so the work
performance data could be like there was
a task or there was a deliverable which
was supposed to take X amount of time
and Y amount of money when you did the
work at end of the degree River when the
work was completed and you has a pillar
is ready you look at the actual time
consumed actual time taken to tell you
over there and the amount of money you
have to spend to do this so that comes
to let's say seven days and two hundred
dollars so in that particular
deliverable you spend seven days and you
spend two hundred dollars so that eight
hour work performance data will go to
your different respective processes in
monitoring and controlling domain so for
each of the knowledge area for example
scope there is a control scope for
schedule this is control schedule for
project cost management there is control
cost so this data raw data which is not
just seventies and won't get order but
you will get multiple set of data they
are actually each will go to their
respective controlling processes where
the team will do the variance analysis
because they will compare their actual
is what world bank and then this
comparison is done when the variance
analysis is done we are going to come up
with both performance information so
let's say this deliverable which was
supposed to take five days time when you
get the variance analysis you realize
that it was supposed to take five days
time and you're supposed to spend one
seventy-five dollars in that that was
the plan
okay and actually seven days and two
hundred dollars so there is a variance
of two days negative - negative food
is that means you have or spell your
deliverable was delayed and you all
spent also instead of five days it took
seven days instead of 175 dollars you
spent $200 so this is your work
performance information so the work
performance information then will be
taken to the monitor and control project
work process there is a process for the
HondaJet control project work so the
difference in your control scope control
schedule control costs and so processes
here and monitor control project work is
the for example control scope or control
schedule is the variance analysis of
only the scheduled part schedule element
of the deliverable but in monitor and
control project work you're going to do
the variance analysis for all the
associated information for example here
it looks like the simple delay of pootie
but when you look at the impact of this
on the cause that can be significant
when you look at the impact of this on
the quality that can be significant when
you look at the impact of this on the
wrist that can be significant there may
be some risk associated to the schedule
like if you miss your milestone by
alexei food is you may have to pay some
penalty to the augment your client
organization okay so in monitoring and
control project work you will look at
the impact of one element of variance in
one element at the other elements and
once you have done this variance
analysis for the project you are going
to document the project progress update
against your plan and you will also yeah
thanks a lot Universal ooh yes I was
looking for that thank you and we got
work performance data which was analyzed
through that we got work performance
information for the deliverable and now
we are going to publish our work
performance reports or the project
dashboard so work performance data says
you talk
days to deliver this work performance
information sir there is a negative
variance of good days and work of all
performance reports are going to
showcase the impact of these areas in
the overall project okay so this is the
difference in these three key elements
here which are going to be very very
prominent when you take the PMP
examination so understanding that it
says is very crucial and along with this
work performance information you may
also have some change requests so you
need to understand that why is this
variance is happening you may have to
take some corrective action or you may
have to take some preventive action or
you may have to take both but in project
once things are planned once everything
is planned you do not have authority to
alter anything without obtaining a pool
from the change Control Board so the
project team is going to request certain
changes in the plan and those changes
could be for corrective or preventing
work both directions that will go to
change control board in integrated
change control process and after change
Control Board has refused the request
will look at the impact of this change
and will obtain the necessary after
world and if the request is approved
then that success will be implemented in
your direct and manage project work
process so you will have to execute the
world as further change plan changes in
the plan and they may be they may not be
a request directly from control scope or
control schedule or control course but
if they come from monitor control
project work also so depending on where
you are so sometimes what happens is
let's say there is no variance when you
did your control scope control scheduled
control person all the individuals
controlling processes there is
absolutely no variance but when you
consolidate everything and when you look
at the work performance report you
realize that right now the process is
fine but there are certain factors or
elements if you do not take care of that
in future there may be a delays so you
will take some preventive actions
but you do not have authority to alter
any elements so for that also you need
to raise a request to change control
board and once it is approved it will be
implemented in the pan and this will be
repeated over and over again unless all
the deliverables are completed and
handed over to customer and then we will
move to the close project AUSA's okay
and he'll follow you to the ethnicity
folder you do the post-mortem you do the
review of all the deliverable you will
make sure that all the terms and
conditions are met and then you will
finally declare the project else
completed and you will move on to the
next project and in your career and in
your job in your company ISM okay so
this was a very very high-level logical
sequence of the entire project and
believe me this is all you are going to
study in your entire preparation in the
pimp okay this is what you need to
understand in detail when you go for the
PNP examination if you understand this
if you understand the logical flow and
logical sequence you are there I can
guarantee you that you are going to
clear this in first attempt
okay you need not to worry about there
so it cooks complex I'm sure there would
be seven people who probably did not
understand some parts of it because you
are talking listening these things for
the first time so another important
point is you will have to start becoming
familiar with the terminology like you
may come with loads of experience
fifteen twenty years of experience and
you reckon all this work but you were
using certain distant terms to call
these elements as but no you will have
to unlearn and you will to learn the way
PMI expects you to remember things okay
that is extremely important so simple
quiet is something that is going to be
the Bible of it and do not even go for
PMP examination without doing one cover
to cover study of timber by Equis one
cycle is extremely extremely important
okay so this is about the logical
sequence of the project
and with this they come to the last
section here that why you should go
though simply learn for chaining I am
going to very take you through the
verification bottle we have so first of
all we have the sexy pass you can attend
multiple patches now this is a very
fantastic thing because what happens is
I will tell you a situation suppose you
are preparing for the PMP examination
and put a June going on 7 June you apply
for the PMP examination let's say by end
of June your entire but your your
application and everything is done and
1st of July you apply for the PMP
examination and you schedule the second
Amish enforce articles of July now by 15
times you lay your training is I mean
you're tailing is over relaxing this in
the month of June itself but when you
are near your examination you hit a
roadblock you have some doubt or
confusion and you want to clarify that
so many people say that I want to go for
physical classroom session but in
physical classroom session you may have
to run after the training organization
to speak to the instructor or you know
rearrange the page you may have of
shallow money to do that but here all
you need to do is you just need to log
into your account and register yourself
for any of the upcoming batch in case in
case there is an urgency you can reach
out for supporting which is there 24 by
7 and you can join any of the ongoing
page and you can speak to instructor
this is the fantastic opportunity that
we have and we have current different
batches I'm going to share I'm going to
show you how many patches we are running
FTP can every weekend and apart from
that we have seven days money-back
guarantee in case you follow all the
criteria and you prepare the baby are
suggesting you prove that and you
fulfill the criteria but still
unfortunately if anyone is not able to
clear it in the first attempt we will
refund their their training fee okay and
when you register for it in case for any
reason in case if you are not able if
you don't find the content useful or you
don't like it any for any reason you
will have seven days money-back
guarantee
okay it's not that we need to run after
people that okay my money is gone they
are not refunding that no we will
different that money in case if you are
not satisfied with the content
and we'll provide you assistance is
getting an application form and on top
of that I am always available my details
are there I'm going to share that with
you you can reach out to me anytime you
want you can write a mail to me and I
will be glad to assist you in anything
I can now the another important which is
very unique you will not find it
anywhere outside so as I told you that
PMP examination PMP exam is a
psychometric tests psychometric
assessment and more than 80 percent of
the questions the PMP examination are
situational examination you will be
given a situation or the scenario and
you will have to assume the
responsibility of project manager and
select the most appropriate answer from
the given four options that you have
okay
that is that is any area where where you
really really need to understand the
concept and along with the more
questions and along with other content
we also have case studies those case
studies will help you understand them
the scenarios that you may come across
and the similar kind of scenarios will
be there in the PMP examination so once
you go through those case studies once
you do the project there is a project
also there is a project submission as
well wiener dog is it actually increases
the likelihood of you clearing this
difficult PMP examination in this first
attempt and when I say the word
difficult it is only when you perceive
it to be difficult once you go through
the case studies if you track the logic
then it is going to be a piece of cake
for you along with that you also have
the scenario based games which will
serve the same purpose and most
importantly as I told you after you
clear the PMP examination and you go
back to your respective work field then
you will be expected to deliver in the
same session and these case studies will
actually help you understand how the
project management will be implemented
or these processes and methods will be
applied in the real life world and that
is where your professional growth starts
see I am Telling You very clearly after
you become PMP the world is not going to
change it's not that you know you get
bombarded with the offer you
still have to prove you still have a
believer and these case studies and
gains will help you deliver okay
and of course the stakes are very high
we are talking about 275 or 375 dollars
of course depending on your membership
status so I'm sure you would not want to
risk your 275 oximeter with others which
are focus focus reexamination so coming
to the last right here are the best it
is as I told you that we guarantee to
run the patches none of the patch will
get cancer here I mean of course there
may be certain emergencies but we will
take care of that and we have this
patches upcoming back is starting to
suit your schedule and professionals you
know find it very very difficult to
below full four days of the training so
that's why you don't need to travel
anywhere it's the online live virtual
classes you just need to be the comfort
of your home the day you are right now
and the base the reason I call it is the
demo classes because this is exactly how
the PMP classes are going to happen you
will be able to see the instructor you
will be able to see everything on the
screen they are going to be highly
engaging and the most important thing is
all these classes will be recorded and
you will have lifelong access to the
cost recording you can download that and
you store in your PC or mobile file and
then go through it whenever you want but
I am sure after you become PMP no one
would even want to listen to the
recording and another thing is your
flexi pass so all these vectors that
you'll see here and these are just only
for the month of June they have patches
coming up in July and August also and
probably more then this is number of
batches because you know tendons are
already gone now and you can register
for any best that you want without any
questions are okay we already talked
about the more questions we have around
total 1000 questions here plus we have
separate pieces and we have case studies
and we have scenario based games okay so
this is this is all I wanted to cover in
the session today and I am sorry we are
late by 5 minutes but I am going to take
up some time now
propagate the questions please start
writing your questions and I long look
at all the questions that I brought here
we have a few questions that came in
concerning the differences in the
different programs I know simply learn
offers PNP we offer the prince
- there's agile there's waterfall
there's a question of what's used in
Europe that came from neha versus what's
used in the america versus what's common
in India can you just briefly address a
the difference between prince2 PMP and
then of course edge waterfall you
already addressed a little bit during
the talk okay
yes it's you so this is a very good
question and very important question PMP
things - and pmi-acp I'll give you an
example because you know the laws of
information available this is theory
based is knowledge bases process pays
and blah blah blah let me give you a
very simple example to understand this
suppose you are driving a car you're on
a highway and at some point you see a
pothole then you are driving at a
certain speed and then you need to take
certain action to probably avoid a
pothole okay now suppose similar kind of
roadblock you hit in your project then
if you are following the pin book or
your methodology is based on the timber
guide then it is going to give you the
knowledge timber guide or PMP is based
on the knowledge given to imparted to
the project manager so in this situation
you will get lot of choices a lot of
options that you can reduce the speed of
your car from for the 80 miles an hour
to 50 miles an hour or forty miles an
hour
second option is you can take a people
third option is you can take a u-turn
fourth option is you stop there and for
the way for some assistance of comma
they are cooking multiple options here
so it will give you all the knowledge
and
depending on the situation circumstances
you take a call that what we should do
this is based on PMD or timba correct
now coming to pins to soap install is
process based so the process will
already be defined okay
oscar's there is some customization
there would be customization which is
allowed in both the approaches but
prince will say whenever you see a
pothole make sure you are reducing your
speed from 80 miles to 35 miles an hour
and then then you are probably 200
meters from the pothole take the
slightly - and then follow this so the
processes are laid out that is why it is
called as that pimple or TMP is
knowledge base and prince2 is process
based now both of them follow the is a
hybrid approach which is a mix of the
traditional waterfall and some kind of
agile so why is a traditional waterfall
because there are some activities some
processes which are sequential and
within those processes you may have some
isolated work going on that is why it is
called as hybrid approach now coming to
pmi-acp because there is a question also
coming up that whether I should go for
PMT or pins to war or pmi-acp now
pmi-acp follows the agile approach okay
so agile approach means there are three
elements in any project scope time cost
and quality within the center of it when
you follow the traditional or hybrid
approach your scope time and cost are
constant they will not change in case if
you need to alter that then you have to
go to the change control process but in
case of a giant your time and cost may
remain constant but your scope will be
defined iteratively which is mostly
based on the feature space and pmi-acp
your agile is predominantly used in the
software industry of course it can be
used in other industrial cell but it is
mostly used in software development
industry so it is mostly more moreover
the feature base so you first complete
one feature and you involve a review
with the customers you in
complet their input sales you take the
feedback of the team and based on the
feedback and input and the work that you
learn and how it is going on you move to
the next citation but the important
point to understand here is for a
project which approach should be used
whether it is hybrid or traditional
waterfall or assign now if you work in
an industry where the requirements keep
changing constantly then you must follow
agile but if you work in an industry or
in your organization where even before
you start the project the end product is
absolutely clear to you then you can
follow PMP or prince2 approach okay and
another important point is these
certifications do not compete with each
other but they complement each other and
in fact if you are looking really
looking for that next level jump in your
career I would suggest anyone to go for
all the certification because if you're
looking for a change you have no idea in
which job you are going to land into so
you must go for that you must I work
personally I would recommend that go for
at least two of the certification so you
are ready to you know gel into any kind
of industry or any kind of organization
so Richard slightly elevated answer but
I hope it clarifies hmm oh I thought it
was wonderful yeah it's hard to cover
all that and I certainly worked with the
number of people who have the different
certifications over the years depending
on what business are working in I'm
going to what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put the questions into two
groups and there's some that kind of
outside of those two groups let's the
fur the second one I'm going to do is we
have a lot of individual questions as
far as their specific career they're in
before we do that can you talk a little
bit about the actual classes like how
long the classes are is the PMP or the
PMI book supplied as part of the class
you know what would if you're going
through the master course on PMP how
many classes is that
that kind of thing if you talk just a
little bit about the course is going
away about five or six people who asked
about that
sure sure so as I told you as I
discussed sermon mentioned this we have
this lvc live virtual classes and these
classes are scheduled to keeping in mind
that in the business schedule other
people so you don't need to go anywhere
as we have pecan and PJ classes both we
have morning classes then we have
evening classes and the curation is for
house for three are three are in case if
you are going for the weekend patch then
each class is a for all and there will
be a class as a four hour speech if you
are going for a weekday class then there
would be three hours to your class
starting from Monday to Friday okay so
you can you know choose a batch of your
choice or it may also happen that you
register for a beat the best but you
know at some point of time it starts
conflicting with your schedule or some
changing priorities then you can
immediately log into your account and
register for any other weekend patch
also so it is a three year curve or four
or curves depending on whether you join
a big debate or we can bet and as I told
you timber guide is not supplied because
no company is authorized to distribute
the timber kite soft copy of timber play
and then you register for the PMP
examination or when you apply for the
PMP PMI membership you are going to get
your own personalized soft copy of
timber kite okay and the third part of
your question is is the content that we
supply is sufficient to clear the PMP
examination yes absolutely yes the only
thing that you need to read addition is
Tim Bob guide I would not recommend
anyone going for the PNP examination
without reading that Tim Bob guide cover
to cover simple guide cover to the world
and all the contents of file simply
learn is equal to you getting PMP
certified
okay I hope it covers all the pattern
question Richard I think so I think you
got all the different ones that I found
in there and of course if someone we
missed something you know please throw
the question back out there concerning
the classes and let's hear I could just
a lot
of people asking specific to their
background I'm not sure how to cover all
of them like we have reg Eve who's from
a testing background I have rolling
stock manager Chandra previously
manufacturing but now MEP supply change
management Ritu maintenance sector so
PMP helpful in the maintenance sector
team lead in the data center operation
okay I gotta zoom more down here yeah
there's a lot on here so that was like
so let me give you a give them a please
explanation of everything and I'm sure
it is going to answer each and every
question so first let me reiterate the
definition of project it is important to
understand this the definition of the
project is any and the work undertaken
to create a unique product service or
result falls into the category of a
project and if you have work on that if
you have worked on any area any domain
or any element of this that means you
are a part of the project manager you
are doing the project management your
title is not important now when I talk
about this world this activity this
endeavor cookies on and in those days
would be IT could be software it would
be manufacturing it could be supply
chain it could be construction it could
be engineering back down it could be
anything okay as long as the work that
you're doing falls into the category of
project and project management yes you
are eligible coming to the second part
part of it your whole the role that you
played your title is not important you
may be a analyst you may a designer you
may be an engineer you may be a
developer you may be a career is vicious
but if the work that you're doing
falling into the category of project
management gives that to make you
eligible now third part is how would you
know whether you are actually working on
the project or not for example someone
said I am I'm a team lead in data center
operations now yes operations require a
different approach and that may not fit
into the pills
for project management but suppose you
have a team of 30 people who are running
operations due to the activities the
tickets are being dazed and you are
doing that but there is definitely some
element of project management as well
for example every quarter you need to do
some business planning you need to do
the headcount planning so you will
initiate you will probably identify some
people you will stick with them and then
you will do the analysis of what kind of
volume we are going to expect in the
next fiscal quarter or maybe the next
distance difficult year okay so there is
a planning activity and then you will
send it to your customer for every wall
or provision senior management for
approval and once it is approved then
you are going to execute this plan there
could be a cost optimization project
let's say you are of hardcore operation
professional operations professional you
have been a delivery manager or
operations manager your organization
gave you a mandate to reduce the
operational cause by 10% in next fiscal
year so this is something which is going
to run parallel to the operations work
that you're doing and which will fall
into the category of being a project and
gives this is going to make you eligible
to take the PMP examination okay so I
hope this gives a good insight everyone
there are a lot of activities and I am
also going to you know plan another
webinar which will talk more about the
people who do not come from the project
x norm but in case if you enroll to
simply learn or you're planning to
enroll and you still have some doubt you
can reach out to me I am going to share
my email address at end of the session I
am done with it you can just stop a mail
or you can reach out to any of our sales
number you need to go you need to go to
the similans PMP page you need to
register yourself and drop in your query
and we'll support you will answer this
will we'll look into your profile and
give you the details about it yeah so
Richard one more thing and we can all
just need to tell all the signals so I
just mentioned this in case in if your
questions are unanswered some other
specific question that you have that I
am not covered or missed out all you
need to do is go to simply known calm
and look for PMT page register yourself
or if you are already just dropping a
meal okay and then
there's two more questions I want to try
to grab in here one of them I'm going to
answer just because I feel like I'm on
the sidelines no the questions on
recordings we do record this session if
you do want a copy of that recording you
can send a note to our emails and we'll
send you out the link if you go to
simply learn comm you can also go under
any of the tech support or the contact
emails and let them know you were here
and you want a copy of the session that
we can go back and review it the
question that a lot of people are
curious about is that the PMP they have
the new edition coming out so there's
questions on the PMP as far as if it's
going to be released should they wait
till the new edition comes out so they
start studying now that kind of thing
and I got a complete okay yes this is a
very very important topic and very
important question so PMI is going to
come up with a sixth edition of PMBOK
guide which is going to release sometime
in q3 so this is right now we're at q2
second water and this quarter water is
going to be July August September so
sometime in q3 they are going to release
this but it's not that you know that
they in box 6 edition is IO you will
start taking examination based on 6th
edition no you might we'll give you a
minimum six or seven months trying
rollover time okay okay she was the
saying it is q1 in 2018 oh this mice
this time it might have changed but
until the last information that I heard
maybe I am not updated of this and one
it is q3 but I'll just check that and
get back leo now point here is lot of
people asking whether we should wait for
the new edition or just go with it see
if you are seriously thinking of going
for PMP examination then I would
personally suggest go for it now because
the changes are going to be significant
changes are not minor they're going to
be significant and what happens is
whenever the new version comes in it
takes some time for you know everyone
for all the required resources to come
up and head over to your
of course Dylan is going to update the
content as soon as possible but there is
a lot of additional information a lot of
experience which has been captured and
gathered and collected here which you
can which can really really be helpful
for example even though I have been
doing this training for years and happen
housing thousands of people but it'll
take some time for me also to understand
and class and then there is the relevant
examples so if you go for the existing
Edition which is the fifth edition there
is no dearth of any content or knowledge
or information available on fifth
edition but also the value remains the
same no one is going to ask you that
whether you did this in 5th edition or
your digital insisted 6th edition I get
my PMP examination 4th edition and am
still here standing in front of you
taking the session and doing the
trainings across and you know doing my
work so no one will question that they
will know no one will say that we will
not hire because you did in 5th edition
I would personally suggest go for it now
before the exam changes to 6th edition
this is a right time for it right now ok
so that's about it Richard and if there
are any special so hold on wait Richard
for few moments let me just announce it
here if you feel that your question is
not answered you can quickly type in
here and I am here for some more time
and I'll answer your question in the
meantime while you're pulling so let me
quickly run through the questions just
to make sure that I've got this or
anything Richard I'm sorry I know it is
late we're late we're all shooting by 25
in 6 minutes but it's very important
that we answer all the questions oh
there is not a problem
I remember they allocated some extra
time for this so we should know that so
now I'll ask you.guess pmpf imagine euro
Nihar p.m. RP n music remember that
cause of role PMI has presence in 173
countries and it is number from 204
countries so you can go for it ok and ok
ok let me just come from presenting this
all I think I answered all the questions
and then the she was hello were
sufficiently will it change for p.m. PM
PM s if a defendant should I choose so I
think I am
that question as well it completely
depends on what industry which region
which geography you are and - and what
is your career plan but I would suggest
go for prints - and PMP and pmi-acp if
you can go for three all of them
fantastic but at is go for ever go for
at is - okay and then answering the
question how PMP benefits to a rolling
stock manager I think I answered this
question it will help you every one help
everyone and then okay okay so there is
a question from kalpesh with a tool of
PN be taught in PMI COEs so there are
specific tools that you know what I can
do is with if you if you are planning to
and goal if you can give me a
confirmation I can probably work out on
something for you we can give you the
complementary force of Microsoft Project
along with it but you have to reach out
to the sales team you know for this and
you can just drop me a nail I shared my
email address and you will definitely
help you with that but no cool is
covered during this PNP changing the
focus is on p.m. pH domination and we
can provide the tool separately okay
I'm completed there's a question machine
your solo again and completed CMP and
not for in the PMS generate defined by
PMA due to some situation okay which
actions PMI will be taking action
Universal ooh I am NOT very clear with
this but again let me just tell you one
thing that PMI has given this in book
guide which will give you the guidance
now whether the organizations are
following it or not foreign debt that is
completely of them as long as it falls
into the within the professional
responsibilities and ethics you know it
is fine because PMI says you have the
authority and right to Taylor the tailor
make the this processes or customizer
processes okay and if I stayed in for
some time okay I covered this question
and okay okay okay okay
Xin was really anything most difficult
for me is right it is how to I follow
and remember she was alone heed to
connect offline and I'll answer the
questions here okay how do I remember is
a very difficult question to answer in
one thing so Mihai is asking
mobsters taken by simply learned before
appearing for PMP examination yes there
are five masters and each mock test is
around 200 question and I would very
strongly recommend you to go through all
those 1000 questions more more questions
you do higher the probability of you
clear it in first attempt and there was
a question you know earlier also I hope
the fashions are not repeated know all
this 1000 questions as unique question
it is not that you know you saw some
questions in mock this one and the same
are being repeated in two or three or
four no all are the unique question okay
so she also is again asking for the last
400 question we are not sure who pass
well no one in the world can give you
guarantee that you're 100% going to pass
it all it's all about how you take it to
be very honest when I took the PMP
examination I did only 300 more
questions and I was still able to clear
this in first attempt okay when to renew
the PMP certification when we have only
ha you your subjugation is valid for 3
years and she is trying unit 160 PDUs
okay and then that is sufficient for
renewals you need not to reappear for
the examination okay uh Rajeev is asking
what are the charges for 35 PDUs that
simply none so Reggie my team will reach
out to you with with the details of the
no charges okay and I answer this this
session about the new edition and and
key in PNP help in switching my industry
momentum in power industry yes they have
PNP definitely can be used so that you
know you need to speak to me or sign and
then I will be able to guide you so
whether I need to purchase any
particular book to prepare by Sudha
Sudha well as I told you similar content
is sufficient to help you prepare for
the PNP examination if you wish to go
for any issue contained yes there are
lot of information available but I will
suggest you know you don't need to do
that actually
whatever we have is more than sufficient
more than enough and so let me just go
to the last part of the questions is to
ensure that nothing
miss Tokyo okay so what today we're
asking is a construction based project
example in the learning for a PMP yes
instructor is going to share the example
from that you know instructor definitely
share that and when you reach out to the
when you look at this content you'll
find example in case studies for the
construction as well and she never saw
Lou is saying simply learn is else
awesome thanks a lot universal thanks a
lot for your compliment and I'm sure
we'll be able to help you and you'll be
able to clear this in first attempt okay
let me quickly go to the next okay
okay and then Divya is asking for the
copy of this video yes this recording
will be shared with all of you and God
is asking question I have started my
CAPM but can I switch to PMP or me to
complete my CIPM first no it's not like
that then you need to first clear CAPM
and then move PMP if you are eligible
for the PMP you straight away go to PMV
why you're going for CAPM CAPM photo
signal who do not have that four
thousand five hundred hours of project
management experience but still they
need to acquire the right knowledge
because you know their role or their job
demand sir if you have that exhales go
for PMP straightaway this all require I
mean it's not a step-by-step learning
and then first we need the pin book and
then take the training okay as you know
I would suggest no no no okay now this
very important question that regime is
asked whether you should read the simple
guide first and then go for the PMP
training no I would very strongly
suggest that don't even touch the
pimple-faced first you go for the
training because let me tell you my
guidance is one of the most boring book
in the world if you are not able to
sleep in the night open the pimple guide
and you will be able to swallow ski but
if you understand the logic and if you
follow the process which is being talked
to you I can assure you textin book will
become the series will become a very
interesting book for you okay so is it a
special approach that you need to follow
and reading the pimp up I just
reading is not going to help you so
don't wait for reading the PMBOK I'd go
for the training first
whilst they was asking whether the force
is in English yes it is in English not
in any Indian language okay and the PR
is I read the training function in BPO
said can i implement the PMP training
out there oh yes definitely fear you can
get in touch with me and I will help you
with it this way is saying also they've
been our tanker crystal and Pia is
asking also the we cover any aspects of
problem solving in PMP like Six Sigma
there are so Six Sigma also follow this
approach you know the project management
approach you have define and measure and
analyze so we have this DNA see there
and similarly here this PMP and problem
solving
it talks PMP talks more about the
knowledge of the project manager and
project manager will have to use some
aspect of the knowledge for the proper
solving okay
and the range thanks for the compliment
and okay the soap I think it is asking I
am learning Six Sigma the civilian is it
the right one for PMP now visitors after
they be here is fantastic you know
learning path is that you can upgrade
your Six Sigma for the project
management masters there you just need
to pay some additional and you can you
can get not only PMP person addition
forces as well okay great I think I have
covered all the questions and if still I
am Bisto any question piece you know
reach out coming I shared my email
address can just drop in a query and I
will make sure that I am teaching are
for you and stick to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
