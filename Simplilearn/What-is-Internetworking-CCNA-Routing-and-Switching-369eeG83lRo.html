and switching course offered by simply
learn this course is divided into 21
lessons this is the first lesson of the
course that talks about internet working
this lesson focuses on the definition of
the word network and two models that
help the learner to understand data
communications let us begin with the
objectives of this lesson in the next
slide by the end of this lesson you will
be able to explain internetworking
models list the types of Internet
working models discuss the OSI reference
model and its layers describe the role
of different devices that comprise a
network let us start by discussing what
comprises a network a network is a
collection of devices that are connected
through media it has the following
characteristics devices contain services
and resources devices could be PCs
routers switches and servers the
services that the routers switches and
servers provide include switching
routing addressing and data access among
others connecting users to the available
services means that the services can be
provided once for all the users instead
of piece mail over multiple devices
connecting devices allow users to share
resources more efficiently a network is
scalable and easier to maintain this
course will present the concepts
involved in creating and maintaining a
small to medium size network for an
organization let us discuss the internet
working models in the next slide with
the inception of networks hardware and
software from different manufacturers
could not interoperate to create a
network it was necessary to buy all the
components from the same vendor to build
hardware and software that can
interoperate a model with communication
functions is required internet working
models are important for three reasons
firstly they encourage interoperability
a model gives a standard way to discuss
the functions that are required a vendor
manufactures a device to fulfill
specific
functions that are detailed in the model
secondly models provide a reference to
describe the process of data
communication and networking these
models are used all the time using model
terminology becomes a shorthand way of
expressing data communication concepts
thirdly models facilitate modular
engineering one vendor can write
software that implements higher layers
for example a web browser and another
vendor can write software that
implements the lower layers the copper
cables used to transmit data are
standardized so that they can be used by
any switch router or PC in the next
slide we will discuss the types of
internet working models</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
