and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on layer
three path control the following lesson
focuses on redistribution let us begin
with the objectives of the lesson in the
next slide by the end of this lesson you
will be able to explain the need for
redistribution and its techniques
explain how ad is used to influence
redistribution configure and verify
redistribution for grip eeew GRP OSPF
and BGP let us start our discussion on
redistribution
is there a need to redistribute routes
from one routing source into another yes
and the reasons are as follows portions
of networks especially in large
enterprises may have static routes or
older routing protocols companies
acquire other firms and absorb their
networks and protocols completely in the
next slide let us look at the
complications in redistributions why is
redistribution complicated the major
reason is that each routing protocol
keeps different information about the
network for example
eeew GRP maintains information about
reported distance but OSPF is not such
constructs are not easily translated
from one protocol to another this brings
up the question is information in the IP
routing table alone used for
redistribution no it is not for
efficient traffic flow in the network
there is a mechanism to configure
information for the redistributed routes
this sounds simple in theory but there
are some caveats in practice let us now
look at the issues caused by
redistribution issues caused by
redistribution are as follows
routing feedback also called domain
loops can occur this will be discussed
in detail under multi-point
redistribution routing protocols have
incompatible routing information each
routing protocol uses different metrics
to determine the best path and hence it
cannot be translated exactly into a
different protocol this may lead to sub
optimal paths different routing
protocols converge at different rates
for example rip converges more slowly
than E I G R P so if a link goes down
the eigrp Network learns about it before
the rip network note that redistribution
adds to a networks complexity and should
be used only when necessary let us now
look at the various redistribution
techniques</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
