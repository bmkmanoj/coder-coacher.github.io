and switching course offered by simply
learn the last lesson focused on switch
architecture and operation this lesson
focuses on switch port configuration let
us begin with the objectives of the
lesson in the next slide by the end of
this lesson you will be able to explain
the methods to perform multi-layer
switch forwarding identify the fields
involved in layer 3 routing packet
rewriting describe the types of switch
interfaces in layer 2 and 3 configure
speed and duplex explain err disabled
interfaces and re-enable them configure
miscellaneous switch commands let us
begin the discussion with multi-layer
switch forwarding methods there are two
options route caching and topology based
switching route caching combines a route
processor and a switch engine the route
processor processes a traffic flows
first packet once the destination is
known the switch engine takes over it
places the destination in its route cash
and handles all subsequent packets in
that traffic flow route caching is no
longer the default forwarding method for
iOS catalyst switches however this is
still used to gather traffic flow
information so it is important to
understand how the processing occurs let
us look at Cisco Express boarding
Cisco's topology based switching and how
it works Cisco express forwarding CEF is
the second method of multi-layer switch
forwarding CEF forwards packets at line
speed with some exceptions CEF is on by
default and cisco recommends that you do
not disable it CEF is similar to fast
switching in router iOS it is less CPU
intensive than route caching CEF uses
two areas in memory content addressable
memory cam
and ternary content addressable memory
tcam let us look at them in the next
slide content addressable memory for cam
holds the mac address table it is the
primary table used for layer 2
forwarding cam processing returns one of
the two values found or not found these
results are sufficient for Mac
processing either the mac is found or
not found ternary content addressable
memory or t cam is different t cam
processing returns three values 0 1 or
don't care this range of results is
required for the more complex matching
involved in acls QoS and routing tables
for example a lookup can be initiated
for longest matches first matches or
exact matches each tcam entry consists
of value masks and result combinations
there is a special area in the tcam
called the ello you if an ACL entry
concerns port number calculations as
shown in the slide and ello you register
entry is created that includes both the
operator and operand involved the tcam
has a limited number of ello use let us
look at the two tables used by the tcam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
