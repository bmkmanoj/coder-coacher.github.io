access control of the CISSP
certification course offered by simply
learn in IT security the term access
control means ensuring people and other
entities like services and processes are
identified and authenticated before
being allowed to access the system or
perform any action on the network access
control is the second of the ten domains
of the common body of knowledge for the
CISSP certification exam this domain
outlines the various information system
security options that control access to
an organization's information and data
processing resources next let us look at
the domain objectives
you
after completing this domain you will be
able to describe the concepts and
techniques of access control explained
methodologies of access control and
their implementation and decentralized
and centralized environments distinguish
between detective and corrective access
control explain the mechanisms for
controlling system use identify
potential vulnerabilities risks and
exposures it is essential to understand
the role access controls play in IT
security we will begin with the scenario
demonstrating the importance of access
controls
Kevin Butler is a security administrator
in the network firewall division at
nutri Worldwide Inc he is preparing for
his CISSP exam he received an email from
Sir J Stankovic
the project manager responsible for the
firewall division it stated that as a
part of the strong focus on security
this financial year nutri Worldwide Inc
would perform two cycles of security
audits instead of one the following
processes will be audited with rigor
this year access controls access control
implementation access control monitoring
Kevin wrote sir J suggesting that the
audit can also check how mitigation is
plan to avoid the threats to access
controls that nutri worldwide Inc has
faced in the last year Sarah J was
impressed by Kevin suggestion
Kevin understands the importance of
access controls the additional security
audits that are planned by his company
reflect the same the mission statement
of this audit was later announced to all
the IT security team it read protecting
networks applications and data from
attack is of utmost importance this will
be achieved through extensive security
audits that audit current security
practices policies and processes and
suggest improvement actionable to be
implemented examine and authenticate
security through penetration testing and
vulnerability assessments access
controls protect systems and resources
from unauthorized access after
successful authentication they can also
participate in determining the
authorization level in this topic we
will describe key terms related to
access control describe the identity and
access provisioning lifecycle
to be able to access a set of data or a
resource a subject has to be identified
up dedicated and authorized the process
is shown here
identification describes a method of
ensuring that a subject such as user
program or process is a real entity as
it claims to be identification can be
provided by user name or account number
authentication is the testing or
reconciliation of evidence of a user's
identity it establishes the user's
identity and ensures that the users are
genuine to be properly authenticated the
subject is usually required to provide a
second piece to the credential set this
piece could be password passphrase
cryptographic key personal
identification number or pin anatomical
attribute or token authorization is
granting access to an object after the
subject has been properly identified and
authenticated it is the rights and
permissions granted to an individual or
a process which enable their access to a
computer resource once it uses identity
and authentication are established
authorization levels determine the
extent of system rights that an operator
can hold for example a user authorized
for net banking transaction the
following screen will focus on privacy
accountability and Identity Management
in this screen we will focus on identity
and access provisioning lifecycle after
an appropriate access control model has
been selected and deployed the identity
and access provisioning lifecycle must
be maintained and secured we will learn
each access control model later in this
domain several organizations follow best
practices for issuing access however
many of them lack formal processes
identity and access provisioning life
cycle refers to the provisioning review
revocation of all accounts provisioning
includes creating new accounts and
provisioning them with appropriate
rights and privileges review can be
called auditing it includes checking all
the accounts periodically it also
includes disabling the inactive accounts
and checking for excessive privileges
revoked
includes disabling employee's account as
soon as they leave the organization it
also includes setting account expiry
date for temporary accounts an
appropriate organization policy should
be followed for deleting an expired
account as a best practice always
include account revocation as a required
step in the access provisioning
lifecycle this process should be tightly
coordinated with the human resources
department and track not only
terminations but also horizontal and
vertical moves or promotions within the
organization the next topic focuses on
identification authentication and
authorization
we will now begin the next topic which
deals with different concepts associated
with identification authentication and
authorization in this screen we will
talk about verifying identification
information the function of
identification is to map a known
quantity to an unknown entity to make it
known the known quantity is called the
identifier or ID and the unknown entity
needs identification a basic requirement
for identification is the ID be unique
IDs may be scoped that is they are
unique only within a particular scope
once the user has been identified
through the user ID or a similar value
the next step is authentication there
are three general factors that can be
used for authentication and they are
something a person knows something a
person has and something a person is
something a person knows can be a
password pin mother's maiden name or a
combination to a lock authenticating a
person by something that the individual
knows is usually the least expensive to
implement the downside to this method is
that another person may acquire this
knowledge and gain unauthorized access
to a system or facility something a
person has can be a key swipe card
access card or badge this method is
common for accessing facilities however
it can also be used to access sensitive
areas or to authenticate systems a
downside to this method is that the item
can be lost or stolen which could result
in unauthorized access something
specific to a person is based on the
physical attribute authenticating a
person's identity based on a unique
physical attribute is referred to as
biometrics the next screen deals with
strong authentication methods
in this screen we will discuss the
characteristics of biometrics in detail
biometrics verifies an individual's
identity by analyzing a unique personal
attribute or behavior which is one of
the effective and accurate methods of
verifying identification
it is also sophisticated expensive and
complex biometric identifiers are the
distinctive measurable characteristics
used to label and describe individuals
the two categories of biometric
identifiers are physiological and
behavioral characteristics physiological
characteristics can include voice DNA or
handprint behavioral characteristics are
related to the behavior of a person
including but not limited to typing
rhythm gait and voice biometrics is a
sophisticated technology thus it is much
more expensive and complex than the
other types of identity verification
processes apart from the accuracy of the
biometric system the other factors
important for the selection of
biometrics are acceptance throughput
rate and enrollment time user acceptance
of biometric system is an important
factor it depends on privacy
intrusiveness and psychological or
physical discomfort example in retina
scan the potential exchange of body
fluid is a disadvantage throughput rate
is also called a biometric system
response time it is the time taken to
process authentication requests it
describes the process of authentication
in a biometric system throughput rates
should be around six to ten seconds
enrollment time is the time taken by the
biometric system to register and create
an account for the first time it
describes the process of registering
with a biometric system users provide a
username identity a password or a pin
and then biometric information by taking
a photograph of their irises or by
swiping their fingers on a fingerprint
reader enrollment is a one-time process
that should take less than two minutes
in the next screen we will look at a
list of biometrics used for
identification today
let us look at each type of biometrics a
number of biometric controls are used
today the following subsections describe
the major implementations and their
specific details pertaining to access
control security fingerprints are made
up of rich endings and bifurcations
exhibited by the friction ridges and
other detailed characteristics that are
called minutiae it is the
distinctiveness of these minutiae that
gives each individual a unique
fingerprint the shape of a person's hand
the length and width of the hand and
fingers defines hand geometry this trait
differs significantly between people and
is used in some biometric systems to
verify identity the iris is the colored
portion of the eye that surrounds the
pupil the iris has unique patterns rit's
colors rings Coronas and furrows a
system that reads a person's retina
scans the blood vessel patterns of the
retina on the rear of the eyeball this
pattern has shown to be unique in
different people
voiceprint is a biometric system that is
programmed to capture a voiceprint and
compare it to the information captured
in a reference file this process can
differentiate one individual from
another keyboard dynamics captures
electrical signals when a person types a
certain phrase signature dynamics is a
method that captures the electrical
signals when a person signs a name
facial scan is a system that scans a
person's face takes many attributes and
characteristics into account like bone
structures nose ridges eye widths
forehead sizes chin shapes etc in the
next screen we will look at how
biometrics can be evaluated for accuracy
in this screen we will focus on
passwords user identification coupled
with the reusable password is the most
common form of system identification and
authorization mechanisms a password is a
protected string of characters used to
authenticate an individual as stated
previously authentication factors are
based on what a person knows has or is a
password is what the user knows it is
important that the passwords are strong
and properly managed the main problems
with passwords are they are insecure can
be easily broken inconvenient for users
to remember and reputable some of the
common password attacks are dictionary
attack can be carried out using tools
such as crack John the Ripper etc
brute-force attack using loft crack
hybrid attack which includes both
dictionary and brute-force attacks other
forms of attacks include the Trojan
horse login program which uses password
sending Trojans and social engineering
attacks an example of social engineering
attack is extracting password by
tricking the users the next screen
describes how passwords can be protected
the use of passwords is a common
practice for validating a user's
identity during the authentication
process and most traditional
authentication solutions the password is
the only undisclosed entity in the
transaction hence care should be taken
in the process of creation of passwords
and its management by users and systems
it is necessary to define policies
procedures and controls regarding
passwords a process governing user
password should consider the following
if the user can choose their own
passwords the operating system should
enforce certain password requirements
the operating system can require that a
password contain a certain number of
characters unrelated to the user ID
include special characters include upper
and lowercase letters and not be easily
guessable many systems enable
administrators to set expiration dates
for passwords forcing users to change
them at regular intervals create
policies for password resets and changes
the system may also keep a list of the
last 5 to 10 passwords password history
and not let the users revert to the
previously used passwords use of last
login dates and banners is also
recommended a threshold can be set to
allow a certain number of unsuccessful
logon attempts after the threshold is
met the users account can be locked for
a period or indefinitely which requires
an administrator to manually unlock the
account system can be configured to
limit concurrent connections from the
users an audit trail can also be used to
track password usage and successful and
unsuccessful logon attempts this audit
information should include the date/time
user ID and workstation the user logged
on from in the next screen we will look
at different types of passwords
a passphrase is a sequence of characters
that is longer than a password a
passphrase is secured than a password as
it is longer and thus harder to obtain
by an attacker in many cases the user is
more likely to remember a passphrase
than a password example of passphrase
are I will pass CISSP exam Manchester
United is my favorite team a quick brown
fox jumps over a lazy dog etc cognitive
passwords our opinion or fact-based
information used to verify an
individual's identity a user is enrolled
by answering several questions based on
life experiences passwords can be hard
for people to remember however the same
person will not forget simple personal
information the user can answer the
questions to be authenticated instead of
remembering a password few of examples
of cognitive passwords include what is
the name of the high school you attended
how many family members do you have what
is your mother's maiden name a one-time
password or OTP is also called a dynamic
password which is used for
authentication purposes after the
password is used it is no longer valid
thus if I have to obtain this password
it cannot be reused this type of
authentication mechanism is used in
environments that require a higher level
of security then static passwords can
provide the token device generates the
one-time password for the user to submit
to an authentication server for example
OTP sent by bank via SMS in the next
screen we will look at token devices and
how they are used for authentication
this screen will focus on memory cards
and smart cards which are used widely in
identity verification a memory card
holds information however cannot process
information a memory card can hold a
user's authentication information so the
user only needs to type in a user ID or
pin and present the memory card and if
the data entered by the user matches the
data on the memory card the user is
successfully authenticated a smart card
holds information and has the necessary
hardware and software to process the
information it has a microprocessor and
integrated circuits incorporated into
the card which enables it to process the
information smart cards are of two types
contact and contactless the contact
smart card has a gold seal on the card
when this card is inserted into a card
reader electrical fingers wipe against
the card in the exact position that the
chip contacts are located this will
supply power and data input output to
the chip for authentication the
contactless smart card has an antenna
wire that surrounds the perimeter of the
card
when this card comes within an
electromagnetic field of the reader the
antenna within the card generates enough
energy to power the internal chip there
are two types of contactless smart cards
and they are hybrid and calm being the
hybrid card has two chips with the
capability of utilizing both the contact
and contactless formats the combi card
has one microprocessor chip that can
communicate with the contact or
contactless readers in the next screen
we will discuss some common attacks on
smart cards this stream will focus on
access criteria which are the crux of
authentication granting access rates to
subjects should be based on the level of
trust a company has and the subjects
need to know how much a user is to be
trusted or the extent of information
entrusted to a user are issues that must
be identified and integrated into the
access criteria the different access
criteria can be enforced by roles groups
location time and transaction types
using roles is an efficient way to
assign right
to a type of user who performs a certain
task this role is based on a job
assignment or function using groups is
another effective way of assigning
access control rights if several users
require the same type of access to
information and resources putting them
into a group and then assigning rights
and permissions to that group is easier
to manage than assigning rights and
permissions to individuals separately
physical or logical location can also be
used to restrict access to resources
some files may be available only to
users who can log on interactively to a
computer this means the user must be
physically present in front of the
computer and enter the credentials
locally and cannot log on remotely from
another computer logical location
restrictions are usually done through
network address restrictions time of day
or temporal isolation is another access
control mechanism that can be used if a
security professional wants to ensure no
one is accessing payroll files between
the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
that configuration can be implemented
transaction type restrictions can be
used to control the data access during
certain functions and the commands that
can be carried out on the data an online
banking program may allow a customer to
view his account balance but may not
allow the customer to transfer money
until he has a certain security level or
access right the next few screens will
look at authorization concepts
this screen will focus on single sign-on
single sign-on or SSO is an access
control method where a user can
authenticate once and be able to access
different information systems without
individual rehabilitation in other words
it allows a user to enter credentials
one time and be able to access all
corporate resources in primary and
secondary Network domains in SSO
applications and systems are logically
connected to a centralized
authentication service that controls
user authentication when a user first
logs into an application they will be
required to provide a user ID and
password or two-factor biometric etc the
application and the centralized service
will recognize the user as logged in
later when the user wishes to access a
different application or system the
users logged in state will be recognized
and directly admitted to the application
as seen in the table the advantage of
SSO is the convenience of eliminating
many redundant logins for busy end users
that is user has one password for all
enterprise systems and applications and
only one strong password can be
remembered and used a user account can
be quickly created on hire and deleted
on dismissal another advantage is it
gives the centralized management of
access for many applications and systems
a distinct disadvantage of SSO is it is
hard to implement and get working it can
also be a source of centralized point of
failure another disadvantage in SSO is
if a user's login credentials are
compromised an intruder will have access
to all the applications and systems that
the user has in the next screen we will
look at a few SSO technologies
some examples of SSO technologies are
listed here Kerberos authentication
protocol uses a key distribution or KDC
and tickets and is based on symmetric
key cryptography the secure European
system for applications in a multi
vendor environment or sesami
authentication protocol uses PA s and P
ACS and is based on symmetric and
asymmetric cryptography security domain
is where all resources working under the
same security policy are managed by the
same group directory services is a
network service which identifies
resources such as printers file servers
etc on a network and makes them
available to users and programs then
clients or dumb terminals rely on a
central server for access control
processing and storage the next screen
will focus on Cobra Kerberos is the name
of a three-headed dog that guards the
entrance of Hades underworld in Greek
mythology the Kerberos security system
guards a network with three elements
authentication authorization and
auditing Kerberos is an opt indication
protocol and was designed in the
mid-1980s as a part of MIT x' project
Athena it works in a client-server model
and is based on symmetric key
cryptography the protocol has been used
for years in UNIX and in Windows
operating systems Kerberos is an example
of a single sign-on system for
distributed environments and is a de
facto standard for heterogeneous
networks it uses symmetric key
cryptography and provides end-to-end
security most Kerberos implementations
work with shared secret keys the major
roles of Kerberos are described here the
key distribution center or KDC holds all
users and services secret keys it
provides an authentication service as
well as key distribution functionality
the clients and services trust the
integrity of the KDC
and this Trust is the foundation of
Kerberos security the KDC is divided
into opt indication server or a s and
ticket granting server or TGS
authentication server or a
s authenticates the identities of
entities on the network and TGS
generates unique session keys between
two parties parties then use these
session keys for message encryption the
KDC provides security services to
principals which can be users
applications or network services the KDC
must have an account for and share a
secret key with each principal for users
a password is transformed into a secret
key value the secret key is used to send
sensitive data back and forth between
the principal and the KDC
and is used for user authentication
purposes ticket granting server or TGS
tickets are generated by the KDC and
given to a principal the ticket enables
one principal to authenticate another
principal for example user needs to
authenticate another principal let's say
a print server a KDC provides security
services for a set of principles this
set is called a realm and Kerberos the
KDC is the trusted authentication server
for all users applications and services
within a realm one KDC
can be responsible for one or several
realms realms are used to allow an
administrator to logically group
resources and users in the next screen
we will look at Kerberos steps the
components that participate in Kerberos
authentication are shown in figure
when a user wishes to log on to the
network and access a print server the
following steps are performed client
contacts the KDC which acts as an
authentication server to request
authentication the client authenticates
on the authentication server or a.s this
creates a user session that will expire
typically in 8 hours the KDC sends
client a session key encrypted with
client secret key the KDC also sends a
ticket granting ticket TGT encrypted
with the tgs's secret key back to the
client system client decrypts the
session key and uses it to request
permission to print from the TGS the
client sends the TGT to the TGS to get
authenticated checking the validity of
the session key
of the client and proving the identity
claim the TGS sends the client ACS
session key second session key to use
for printing the TDS also sends a
service ticket or st encrypted with the
print servers key the TDS creates an
encrypted key with an expiration time
and sends it to the client the client
sends the service ticket to the print
server the print server confirms that
the st is still valid by checking the
expiration time seeing a valid CS
session key the server recognizes the
permission to print and also knows the
client is authentic the communication is
established between the client and the
print server in the next screen we will
look at some of Kerberos drawbacks the
components that participate in Kerberos
authentication are shown in figure when
a user wishes to log on to the network
and access a print server the following
steps are performed client contacts the
KDC
which acts as an authentication server
to request authentication the client
authenticates on the authentication
server or AAS this creates a user
session that will expire typically in 8
hours the KDC sends client a session key
encrypted with clients secret key the
KDC
also sends a ticket granting ticket TGT
encrypted with the tgs's secret key back
to the client system client decrypts the
session key and uses it to request
permission to print from the TGS the
client sends the TGT
to the TGS to get authenticated checking
the validity of the session key of the
client and proving the identity claim
the TTS sends the client acs session key
second session key to use for printing
the TTS also sends a service ticket or
st encrypted with the print servers key
the TTS creates an encrypted key with an
expiration time and sends it to the
client the client sends the service
ticket to the print server the print
server confirms that the ST is still
valid by checking the expiration time
seeing a valid CS session key the server
recognizes the permission to print and
also knows the client is authentic
communication is established between the
client and the print server in the next
screen we will look at some of Kerberos
drawbacks
some of the problems of Kerberos are
listed here a single KDC is a sole point
of failure and performance bottleneck if
the KDC goes down no one can access
needed resources redundancy is necessary
for the KDC
computers must have clocks synchronized
within 5 minutes of each other the KDC
must be able to handle the number of
requests it receives on time
it must be scalable secret keys are
temporarily stored on the user's
workstations which mean it is possible
for an intruder to obtain these
cryptographic keys
if the workstation is compromised the
identities can be forged
if the KDC is hacked security is lost
Kerberos is vulnerable to password
guessing the KDC does not recognize a
dictionary attack network traffic is not
protected by Kerberos if encryption is
not enabled Hilde Jakob general manager
IT security nutri Worldwide Inc needed
an advanced security system which can
seamlessly integrate with the existing
web-based application this system should
give an option for one-time password or
dynamic password security token as the
second factor the security team that
Kevin is a part of opted for a
third-party online security and identity
management tool this raised the
confidence among all the employees for
using the web applications and doing all
their online transactions the new
multi-factor authentication system
integrated fully with the existing
application and also fulfilled all the
organization's needs which are the two
factors that Kevin needs to use for
two-factor authentication Kevin should
use any two factors out of something you
know password pin something you have
smart card ATM card something you are
biometrics fingerprint retina
controls are implemented to mitigate
risk and reduce the potential for loss
in this section we will discuss the
various types of access controls in this
screen we will focus on types of access
control access control types or methods
can fall into one of three categories
administrative technical or physical
administrative also called directive
controls represent a broad set of
actions policies procedures and
standards put in place in an
organization to govern the actions of
people and information systems they are
implemented by creating and following
organizational policy procedure or
regulation user training and awareness
fall into this category technical
controls also called logical controls
are the programs and mechanisms on
information systems that control system
behavior and user access they are
implemented using software hardware or
firmware that restricts logical access
in an information technology system
examples are protocols encryption system
access etc physical controls are used to
manage physical access to information
systems such as application servers and
network devices they are implemented
with physical devices such as locks
fences gates and security guards to
understand and appropriately implement
access controls understanding the
benefits that each control can add to
security is vital there are six access
control types preventive controls
prevent actions they apply restrictions
to what a potential user authorized or
unauthorized can do an example of an
administrative preventive control is
pre-employment drug screening which is
designed to prevent an organization from
hiring an employee who is using illegal
drugs
detective controls are controls that
send alerts during or after an attack
Inchon detection systems alerting after
an attack closed-circuit television CCTV
cameras alerting guards to an intruder
and a building alarm system triggered by
an intruder are all examples of
Detective controls corrective controls
correct a damaged
system or process they work hand in hand
with detective controls antivirus
software has both components first it
runs a scan and uses its definition file
to detect if there is any software that
matches its virus list if it detects a
virus that corrective controls take over
placing the suspicious software in
quarantine or deleting it from the
system the turret controls reduce the
likelihood of a vulnerability being
exploited without actually reducing the
exposure after a security incident has
occurred recovery controls may be needed
to restore functionality to the system
and the organization recovery means the
system must be recovered and reinstalled
from OS media or images data restored
from backups etc a compensated control
is an additional or alternative security
control put in place to compensate for
weaknesses in others
in the current financial year nutri
Worldwide Inc has decided to focus on
information security as a part of this
initiative security training on
strengthening the password management
process was arranged kevin was a part of
this training with this training fall
under the administrative controls or
technical controls category this
training falls under the administrative
controls category now that we have
reviewed the access control concepts we
can discuss the different access control
models controlling access by a subject
and active entity such as an individual
or process to an object a passive entity
such as a file involves setting up
access rules these rules can be
classified into three categories or
models
Kevin had worked on a project for the
human resources department last year the
HR department wanted to strengthen the
security model deployed for protection
of highly confidential data the salaries
of executive employees the access to
this data is usually given to the senior
HR managers only what security model is
deployed in such cases when information
classification and confidentiality is
very important the M AC model is used
once an organization determines the type
of access control model it is going to
use it needs to identify and refine its
technologies and techniques to support
that model the following sections
describe the access controls and
technologies available to support the
different access control model in this
screen we will discuss the access
control administration access control
implementations are as diverse as their
requirements however access control can
be divided into two domains centralized
access control and decentralized
distributed access control in the
following sections we summarize the
mechanisms to achieve both types the two
types of access control administration
are centralized and decentralized
centralized access control is
concentrated at one logical point for a
system or organization instead of using
local access control databases systems
authenticate via third-party
authentication servers centralized
access control can be used to provide
single sign-on SSO where a subject may
opt entik 8 once and access multiple
systems one entity Department or
individual is responsible for overseeing
access to all corporate resources this
type of administration provides a
consistent and uniform method of
controlling users access rights the
advantage of centralized access control
is strict control and uniformity of
access the disadvantage is central
administration can be overloaded let us
look at an example the security
administrator entity configures the
mechanisms that enforce access control
processes any changes that are needed to
a user's access control
while disables access when necessary and
completely removes these rights when a
user is terminated leaves the company or
moves to a different position in
decentralized access control resource
owners are responsible for access
control this method gives control of
access to people closer to their
resources who may better understand who
should and should not have access to
certain files data and resources these
centralized access control allows the IT
administration to be closer to the
mission and operations of the
organization with it an organization
spans multiple locations and the local
sites support and maintain independent
systems access control databases and
data these centralized access control is
also called distributed access control
the advantage of decentralized access
control is it is more flexible compared
to centralized access control
however controls may not be uniform
throughout organization which can be its
major disadvantage let us look at an
example a trusted computer system a
system that has hardware and software
controls ensuring data integrity in the
next screen we will look at the
authentication system radius
remote authentication dial in user
service radius is a third-party
authentication system it is a network
protocol and provides client server
authentication and authorization and
audits remote users a network may have
access servers a modem pool DSL ISDN or
t1 line dedicated for remote users to
communicate the access server requests
the remote users logon credentials and
passes them to a radius server which
houses the user names and passwords the
remote user is a client of the access
server and the access server is a client
of the radius server it encrypts only
passwords radius is a client-server
protocol that runs in the application
layer using UDP as transport it uses 8
bits for the attribute value pair AVP
field it is described in RFC is two
eight six five and two eight six six and
uses user Datagram protocol UDP ports
one eight one two authentication and one
eight one three accounting radius is
considered an AAA system comprising
three components authentication
authorization and accounting it up
dedicates a subjects credentials against
an authentication database it authorizes
users by allowing access to specific
data objects it accounts for each data
session by creating a log entry for each
radius connection made the three
functions that radius serves are to
authenticate users or devices before
granting them access to a network to
authorize those users or devices for
certain network services and to account
for usage of those services next we will
look at another type of authentication
system tax and tax plus
terminal access control access control
system tak X is a remote authentication
protocol used to communicate with an
authentication server commonly used in
UNIX networks it is a centralized access
control system that requires users to
send an ID and a static through usable
password for authentication tak X uses
UDP port 49 and may also use TCP
reusable passwords are not secure
hence the improved tack x+ provides
better password protection by allowing
two factors strong authentication it is
not backwards compatible with tac-x it
uses TCP port 49 for authentication with
the tac-x plus server it allows users to
employ dynamic one-time passwords which
provides more protection it is more
secure than radius and encrypts all data
let us discuss diameter in the next
string diameter is radius a successor
designed to provide an improved
authentication authorization and
accounting AAA framework radius provides
limited accountability and has problems
with flexibility scalability reliability
and security diameter also employs
encryption to protect sensitive
information diameter supports all forms
of remote connectivity and uses 32 bits
for the attribute value pair a BP field
it uses TCP port 3 8 6 8 diameter
security uses existing encryption
standards including Internet Protocol
security IPSec or transport layer
security TLS it is a peer based protocol
which allows Lion or server to initiate
communication
it also has better error detection
correction failover functionality than
radius the subsequent screen will cover
the next topic that is accountability
accountability holds users accountable
for their actions this is done by
logging and analyzing audit data
enforcing accountability helps keep
honest people honest for some users
knowing data is logged is not enough to
provide accountability they must know
the data is logged and audited in the
sanctions may result from violation of
policy auditing capabilities ensure
users are accountable for their actions
verify if the security policies are
enforced and can be used as
investigation tools accountability is
tracked by recording user system and
application activities this recording is
done through auditing functions and
mechanisms within an operating system or
application audit trails contain
information about operating system
activities application events and the
user actions items and actions to be
audited can become an endless list a
security professional should be able to
assess an environment and its security
goals the professional should have
knowledge of the actions to be audited
and what to do with the captured
information without wasting extra disk
base CPU power and staff time the
following gives a broad overview of the
items and actions that can be audited
and logged system level events like
system performance logon attempts
successful and unsuccessful date and
time of each logon attempt etc
application level events like error
messages modification of files etc user
level events like identification and
authentication attempts commands
initiated etc the next topic is access
control monitoring which is discussed in
the following screens
access control monitoring is a method of
keeping track of who attempts to access
specific company resources it is an
important detective mechanism and
different technologies exist that can
fill this need as discussed in this
section
in this screen we will discuss
unauthorized disclosure of information
several technologies can make
information available to unauthorized
individual with unfavorable results it
can be done intentionally or
unintentionally information can be
disclosed unintentionally when one falls
prey to attacks that specialize in
causing this disclosure these attacks
include social engineering covert
channels malicious code and electrical
airwave sniffing information can be
disclosed accidentally through object we
use methods which are explained next
object reuse means before someone uses a
harddrive floppy disk or tape it should
be cleared of any residual information
the sensitive information that may be
left by a process should be securely
cleared before allowing another process
the opportunity to access the object
this ensures that information not
intended for the individual or any other
subject is not disclosed
for example old system allocated to a
new employee without erasing the old
data methods for clearing the
information from media include
destruction degaussing overwriting etc
under emanation security all electronic
devices emit electrical signals these
signals can hold important information
and if an attacker buys the right
equipment and positions in the right
place this information can be captured
from the airwaves and data transmissions
can be accessed similar to directly
tapping on the network wire the
equipment can reproduce data streams and
display the data on the intruders
monitor enabling the intruders to learn
uncover an exploit confidential
information countermeasures for this
type of intrusions are tempest white
noise and control zone let us describe
each of them briefly
tempest equipment is implemented to
prevent intruders from picking up
information through the airwaves with
listening devices this type of equipment
must meet the specific standards of
providing tempest shielding protection
and must be rated for the same tempest
refers to standardized technology that
suppresses signal emanations with
shielding material the devices monitors
computers printers etc have an outer
metal coating
- as a Faraday cage this is made of
metal with the necessary depth to ensure
only a certain amount of radiation is
released tempest technology is complex
cumbersome and expensive and therefore
only used in highly sensitive areas that
need this high level of protection -
alternatives to tempest exist use white
noise or a control zone concept white
noise is a countermeasure used to keep
intruders from extracting information
from electrical transmissions white
noise is a uniform spectrum of random
electrical signals it is distributed
over the full spectrum so the bandwidth
is constant and an intruder is not able
to decipher real information from the
random noise or information another
alternative to using tempest equipment
is to use the control zone concept some
facilities use material in their walls
to contain electrical signals this
prevents intruders from accessing
information emitted via electrical
signals from networked devices this
control zone creates a type of security
perimeter and is constructed to protect
against unauthorized access to data or
compromise of sensitive information for
example creating control zones using
Faraday's cage and jammers the next
screen talks about the intrusion
detection system
intrusion detection systems IDS's are
different from traditional firewall
products as they are designed to detect
a security breach in to Xion detection
is the process of the testing and
unauthorized use of or attack upon a
computer network or telecommunications
infrastructure IDS's
are designed to aid in mitigating the
damage caused by hacking or breaking
into sensitive computer and networked
systems the intent of the IDS tool is to
spot suspicious activity on the network
and sound an alarm by flashing a message
on the network manager screen possibly
sending a page or even reconfiguring a
firewalls ACL setting the IDS tools can
look for sequences of data bits that
might indicate a questionable action or
event or monitor system log and activity
recording files although different types
of IDs products are available they all
have three common components sensors
analyzers and administrator interfaces
the sensors collect traffic and user
activity data and send them to an
analyzer which looks for suspicious
activity if the analyzer detects an
activity it is programmed to Deemas
fishy it sends an alert to the
administrators interface IDS's come in
two main types network based which
monitors network communications and
host-based which can analyze the
activity within a particular computer
system a network based IDs in IDs uses
sensors which are hosts computers with
the necessary software installed or
dedicated appliances each with its
network interface card n IC in
promiscuous mode when an N IC is put
into promiscuous mode the N IC driver
captures all traffic makes a copy of all
packets and passes one copy to the TCP
stack and another copy to an analyzer to
look for specific patterns and NIDS
monitors network traffic and cannot see
the activity going on inside a computer
to monitor the activities within a
computer system a company would need to
implement a host based IDs a host based
IDs H ideas can be installed on end of
the
you'll work stations and/or servers to
watch for inappropriate or anomalous
activity H IDS's are usually used to
ensure users do not delete system files
we configure important settings or put
the system at risk in any other way
whereas the nids understands and
monitors the network traffic H IDs s
universe is limited to the computer H
IDs does not understand or review
network traffic and the nids does not
look in and monitor a systems activity
each has its own job and they don't
interfere with the other in the next
screen we will look at access control
monitoring
access-control threats are the agents
that have a direct negative impact on
the confidentiality integrity and
availability of information assets the
objective of this section is to explain
the prominent threats to access controls
the security professional will face we
will also discuss the best practices to
be followed in access control
in this slide we will discuss some of
the common threats to information
security and access control denial of
service d OS or distributed
denial-of-service DDoS is an attack that
disables a service or makes it
unreachable to its users a distributed
denial-of-service DDoS attack is an
attack launched from many places at once
the objective of a DDoS attack is to
incapacitate a system or service in a
way that is difficult to block back to
our tax happen win during the
development of an application the
creator or programmer has the ability to
include special access capabilities
hidden within the application known as
backdoors or trap doors spoofing or
masquerading is the act of appearing to
a system as if communication from an
attacker is actually coming from a known
and trusted source man-in-the-middle is
a form of active eavesdropping in which
the attacker makes independent
connections with the victims and relays
messages between them making them
believe they are talking directly to
each other over a private connection
when in fact the entire conversation is
controlled by the attacker a replay
attack is a form of network attack in
which a valid data transmission is
maliciously or fraudulently repeated or
delayed TCP hijacking is an attack to
gain unauthorized access to information
or services of a computer system social
engineering is the art of manipulating
people into performing actions or
divulging confidential information
dumpster diving is a tactic used by
information thieves to get corporate
proprietary data credit card numbers and
other personal information gleaned from
what people in companies throw away
password guessing is a common form of
attack against an information system it
is an attempt to get someone's
legitimate logon credentials the two
common methods are brute force attack
and dictionary attack in a brute-force
attack an intruder will try numerous
passwords with the hope that one of them
will work a brute force attack consists
of sequential guesses at a password
until the correct value is found this
type of attack can take a long time
there can be millions of possible
passwords for a given user account and a
tutor may use a dictionary attack where
the common passwords are tried to check
if the intruder can get lucky and gain
entry into a target system if the
intruder is attempting to gain entry
using a specific person's user ID the
next step is to try and find out
personal information about that person
such as birth date pet's name partner's
name and try combinations of these to
gain entry to a system Trojan horse is a
general term referring to programs that
appear desirable however actually
contain undesirable content a chosen
horse purports to perform an action the
user once while secretly performing
other potentially malicious actions in
phishing the attacker sends forged
emails that appear to have originated
from a financial institution or other
high-value organization the forged email
will contain instructions that direct
the recipient to click on a link and
provide information on a form the victim
is led to believe that the institution
will be helped by verifying these
sensitive credentials when in reality
they are handing those credentials over
to a criminal in a farming attack an
attacker direct traffic destined for a
specific web site to an imposter site
usually for the purpose of harvesting
logon credentials from unsuspecting
users software exploitation occurs when
an attacker uses a program that presents
the user with a fake logon screen which
tricks the user into attempting to log
on the user is asked for a username and
password which are stored for the
attacker to access at a later time the
user does not know this is not the usual
logon screen as it looks exactly like
the actual logon screen a fake error
message can appear indicating that the
user missed type his credentials at this
point they'll fake logon program exits
and hands control over to the operating
system which prompts the user for a
username and password the user assumes
he mistyped his information and doesn't
give a second thought but an attacker
now knows that users credentials the
next screen will discuss the best
practices for access control
the following is a list of tasks that
must be performed on a regular basis to
ensure security stays at a satisfactory
level deny access to systems by
undefined users or anonymous accounts
limit and monitor the usage of
administrator and other powerful
accounts suspend delay access capability
after a specific number of unsuccessful
logon attempts remove obsolete user
accounts as soon as the user leaves the
company suspend inactive accounts after
30 to 60 days enforce strict access
criteria enforce the need-to-know and
least privilege practices disable
unnecessary system features services and
ports replace default password settings
on accounts limit and monitor global
access rules ensure logon IDs are non
descriptive of job function remove
redundant resource rules from accounts
and group memberships remove redundant
IDs accounts and role based accounts
from resource access lists enforce
password rotation enforce strong
password requirements audit system user
events actions and Review reports
periodically protect audit logs
let us summarize the topics covered in
this domain access controls protect
systems and resources from unauthorized
access to be able to access a set of
data or a resource a subject has to be
identified authenticated and authorized
biometrics based on individuals
physiological and behavioral
characteristics is one of the most
effective and accurate methods of
verifying identification memory cards
and smart cards are used widely in
identity verification authorization is
based mainly on four concepts they are
need-to-know principle authorization
creep access control list ACL and
default to zero controls are implemented
to mitigate risk and reduce the
potential for loss the two types of
access control administration are
centralized and decentralized
accountability holds users accountable
for their actions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
