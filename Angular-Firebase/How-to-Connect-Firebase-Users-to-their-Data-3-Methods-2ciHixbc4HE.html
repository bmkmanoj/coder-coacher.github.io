ways to associate firebase users with
data in the real time database I'll go
over three different methods and when to
use them and also talk about ways to
keep them secure on the backend but
before we get into that it's important
to go over a couple know sequel database
design best practices if you come from a
sequel background you're used to
designing a database that is completely
centered around relationships in no
sequel we care less about relationships
and more about the efficiency of the
actual query that we're making consider
a database design it has everything
nested under the user ID if you wanted
to loop over just the users and display
their user name you'd also have to load
all the nested data further down the
tree which would become very inefficient
if you have a lot of Records a better
way to handle this is to keep the data
shallow so you only query for the actual
data you need now we can start building
some user relationships with firebase
and angular for the first method works
by nesting a user's item under their own
user ID this is ideal when you're
showing data that's organized by user
for example a Twitter feed here we have
an item service and we're going to
import both the angularfire database and
the angularfire auth module then we
create an item class which represents
our data at this point with just one
body string attribute this class will be
returned to us as an angular fire list
observable when we inject the service we
want to subscribe to the angular fire
off state and we'll set the user ID
returned from that off state to the user
ID on the service this allows us to make
queries based on that currently logged
in users ID
now that we have the user ID we can hit
the database for the list that is nested
under that user ID if it's undefined we
just return null it's defined we
interpolate it into the path to the
database if we want to create a new item
it's as simple as pushing another item
object onto this list observable back in
the app we can see that when we create a
new item it's nested under that users
user ID as expected if we logout and
login with a different user we shouldn't
see any items in the feed which we don't
and if we create a new item with this
user their data is nested under their
user ID essentially separating the data
by user this works great on the
front-end but we also need to secure the
backend data with a firebase database
rule in this example we match the user
ID that the data is nested under with
the actual off ID and firebase if it's a
match then we allow the write operation
to take place a second way to associate
users with items is to save the user ID
as an attribute on the item itself this
approach is useful when you need the
Association but you're not querying by
the user for example comments on a blog
post or something similar we can make
this work by modifying three lines of
code first we add a user ID to the item
class then we set that user ID on the
item when it's created then we remove
the user ID from the database path
because we're no longer nesting under
the user ID
back in the app we create a new item and
we can see that user ID is on the item
itself and if we create another item
with a different user we should have a
different user ID on that item but still
both items are coming up in the feed now
in firebase we can see the user ID
attribute is on each item to secure the
backend we see if the existing data in
the database has a matching user ID and
we also allow the write to occur if it's
null because that means the users
creating a new item the third scenario
is when you have items that can be
associated with multiple users in this
case we create a collection of members
that are nested under the item ID and
the key for each member is that users
user ID back in the service will create
a new function to join an item passing
at the items key as an argument
the data will be the user ID for the key
set to true we return the current
members as an object observable then
update that observable with the new data
to leave an item we follow the same
basic approach we query for an object
observable with the current user ID and
if it exists we remove it
back in the app we create a new item
that defaults to no members and then we
can click the join button which will add
that user ID to the list of members when
we log in with a different user we
should see that they can also add their
user ID to this item
going into firebase we can see that the
members collection on this item
it's updated with the key after each
button is clicked that's it for this
