traditional web application behave more
like a native mobile app in this episode
we're going to take an angular 4
application and make it 100% compliant
with Google's PWA spec to do this we're
going to create an app manifest with a
bunch of mobile icons we're gonna cache
our app offline with a serviceworker and
we're going to serve it over a secure
HTTPS connection when that's all said
and done we'll be able to run our app
through the lighthouse chrome plugin
which is maintained by Google which will
tell us whether or not we're meeting all
the PWA requirements as well as give us
some feedback on performance and best
practices not only will this provide a
better user experience but it will also
bring up this add to homescreen banner
on Android devices or any other program
that supports progressive web apps
currently it's not supported in iOS
Safari or Microsoft edge but they are
moving in that direction so they
probably will be supported in the future
another cool feature we're not going to
talk about in this video is push
notifications but I do have another
video covering that topic so make sure
to check that out as well
the first step is to install the
lighthouse plugin for Chrome you can get
it in the chrome store and it's what
we're going to use to generate the
actual audit on the site the next step
is to create the manifest.json file in
the source directory of your project the
purpose of this file is to tell browsers
exactly how to handle your web app for
example your app should have a name and
some theme colors and you'll also want
to tell it whether or not to display and
portrait or landscape then we need to
generate some icons there's plenty of
places on the Internet where you can
have this all done automatically with
just a single based logo you need to
have a variety of icons to handle
different mobile devices and operating
systems after you generate the icons
drop them into your assets folder in
angular and then add them to the
manifest each icon will need to have its
own source size and type specified
that's it for the manifest there's
plenty of other things we could add here
but this is the bare minimum that we
need for now the next thing we need to
do is link our manifest in the index dot
HTML as well as provide some other meta
tags we have a variety of meta tags here
that are basically all telling different
browsers that our site is mobile app
capable then the only other thing we
need to do is link to the manifest that
we just created
you also need to register it in the
angular CLI so we can do that by adding
it to the assets array to ensure it's in
our production build that's it for the
first part of the process now we need to
start building a serviceworker that will
cache the page for offline capabilities
this diagram shows the basic process the
serviceworker will cache the assets on
the user's device and if the internet is
out then it will serve up whatever is in
the cache
to give the user some interactivity when
there's no connection you can actually
test this out now on our live fire
starter demo app first visit the app
with an active connection and then turn
off the internet connection and refresh
the page the website on the left has no
offline cache so it just gets the
standard error while fires start around
the right has an offline cache with the
serviceworker so it gets a full web page
displayed anyway to implement this
feature we can actually pick up right
where we left off in the index.html
we'll go down to the closing body tag
and we're going to write a script that
will register the serviceworker it's
extremely simple it just checks that the
Navigator has a serviceworker and if so
it calls serviceworker dot register
followed by the serviceworker name
currently the serviceworker dot JS file
doesn't exist but we're going to use a
package called sw-precache to build it
automatically in the next step
sw-precache is a popular open source
library developed by Google that we're
going to use to write the serviceworker
code for us automatically first we
install the web pack version of the
library to our development environment
using NPM then create a new file called
pre cache config j/s in the root of your
project inside the file we first import
sw-precache and then we'll set our
configuration variables I'd like to
point out that the navigate fallback
whitelist is necessary if you're using
firebase ooofff so don't forget to
include it if you are sw-precache is
going to create the serviceworker right
after our production build is created in
the dist folder in this example we're
going to cache all JavaScript and CSS
assets but you can customize this any
way you want based on your own app
configuration to use this script we're
going to create a custom command in that
package JSON file we create a command
called PWA for progressive web app it
first runs ng build production and then
it runs
w precache in the dist folder where that
production built lives and uses the
configuration that we just supplied then
from the command line we can just run
npm run PWA as you can see it does our
normal production build with ahead of
time compliation
and then after that's done it generates
the service worker now let's actually go
into the dist folder and take a look at
the service worker we have an array of a
bunch of cached assets that will be
served when the app is offline then we
have a bunch of event listeners in this
file that will handle the management of
the cache for the user as well as
trigger that install banner on
compatible devices the only thing left
to do is deploy the app it's required
that your app be served over an HTTP
connection with an SSL certificate if
you're deploying with firebase this is
configured automatically but any other
hosting over HTTP should work if you are
using firebase just run firebase deploy
only hosting and then we can validate
everything with the lighthouse plugin
you use the plug-in by just clicking it
and running in generate report it's
really that easy at this point our app
is scoring 100 on the PWA score which
means it's installable on compatible
devices but every apps different so you
may have other issues you have to
address beyond this if you get stuck
