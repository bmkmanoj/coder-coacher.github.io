four different ways to share data
between angular components parent to
child
via the input decorator when you declare
variable with the input decorator in the
child component it allows that variable
to be received from the parent component
template in this case we define a
message variable and the parent then use
square brackets to pass the data to the
child now the child component can
display the data in its own template
child to parent via output and event
emitter another way to share data is to
emit it from the child which can be
listened to by the parent this approach
is ideal when you want to share data
changes that occur on things like button
clicks form entries and other user
events in the child we declare a message
of that variable with the output
decorator and set it equal to a new
event emitter
then we create a function named send
message that calls MIT on this event
with the message we want to send
lastly we create a button to trigger
this function in the HTML in the parent
we create a function to receive the
message and set it equal to the message
variable the parent can now subscribe to
this message of that it's outputted by
the child component then run the receive
message function whenever that event
occurs child to parent via Buechel view
child allows one component to be
injected into another giving the parent
access to all of its attributes and
functions when caveat however is that
the child won't be available until after
the view is fully initialized this means
we need to implement the after view in
it lifecycle hook so you receive the
data from the child
you
inside the after view and it function we
can then access the message variable
that was defined inside the child's
component shared data between any
unrelated components when passing data
between components that lack a direct
connection such as siblings
grandchildren etc you should use a
shared service when you have data that
always needs to be insane I find that
the rxjs behavior subject is very useful
on this situation the main benefit of a
behavior subject is that it ensures
every component consuming the service
receives the most recent up-to-date data
in the service we create a private
behavior subject that will hold the
current value of the message then we
define a current message variable set to
an observable it will be used by the
component
lastly we create a function that calls
next on the behavior subject to change
its current value
the parent-child and similar components
all receive the same treatment we inject
the service in the constructor then
subscribe to the current message
observable and set its value equal to
the message variable now we can create a
function in any one of these components
that changes the value of the message
when this function is executed the new
data will automatically be broadcast all
their components
that's it for data sharing see you next
