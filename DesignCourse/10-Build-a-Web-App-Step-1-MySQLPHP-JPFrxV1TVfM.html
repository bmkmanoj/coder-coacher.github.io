comm today we're going to create our
actual MySQL tables and the table
structures and so basically this is a
step that we are going to need to have
done before we actually mess around with
any type of PHP alright so in making the
site basically active so if you've never
messed around with MySQL basically you
do need to have a host eye you can set
it up locally I've never done it but
I've always just used to host and
usually J basically every host out there
they offer MySQL databases so you'll
have to login to your host control panel
to kind of figure out how to do that and
I'm going to be using PHP my admin to
basically set up those tables alright so
I yeah check out design course comm if
you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright so get started
alright so I'm going to be jumping all
over the place on this but my goal is to
basically get the first and second step
done today in terms of making it
actually work and saving it to a
database and all that stuff so I'm going
to get out a browser here alright so
basically I let's go back to the index
the first step you know they enter their
needs they can offer you know whatever
you put in here common area separated by
comma and click on find matches so
there's a few things that have to take
place after they click that so first I'm
going to switch over here I this is
going to be the part where you're going
to need to login to your host whoever
that is and you're gonna have to figure
out how to create a MySQL database so
I've already created one called bar
Terfel and so basically when you create
one you're you know you're given the
option of specifying the name of it of
course and then attaching a MySQL user
to it and you can make a custom eye
MySQL database username and password for
accessing this so you will need be
basically I also the MySQL address so if
you real quickly download the project
files and trying to get out the right
window here I there's a new folder that
I've included in it so this is called
include and it has two files basically
so this DB as in database this is
something that we're going to be
including on the top of every page so
index dot PHP will include it up here I
what this does is it connects to the
MySQL server so you're going to need
four pieces of information you're going
to need your host name and you're
basically your host provider we'll be
able to provide that for you in the
control panel whatever type of system
they use your username that you
specified or along with password and
then the database name goes here alright
so the second file is just this class
I've used for years upon years upon
years and it just makes I basically
taking PHP and querying the database
make it a little bit easier so that's
something I've used forever so yeah
basically this stuff down here will
actually do the connecting stuff from I
up here so yeah I real quickly what I'll
do is in index type PHP at the top I'll
open up the PHP tags and what we want to
do is just type in require once include
and then also the name of our first one
which is DBIA PHP alright so that
basically just takes that file and
includes it into the index dot PHP so
we'll do that twice and include that
MySQL DB class dot PHP alright and save
that now also obviously before you
upload or whatever you're going to need
to save the credentials in here which
I'm going to do off-screen so that
well for obvious purposes okay so I just
paused and saved that file there so we
don't have to worry about that anymore
okay so now what we want to do is
actually create the users table in MySQL
so PHP my admin this is basically I a
script at most nearly all hosting
providers provide and it allows you to
basically interact with your and create
in modify my SQL databases so I've
already created the database this is it
right here Bart aful and inside the
database of course you have your
different tables for storing information
so the first one we want to create is
going to be users okay so basically
whenever I go to create a databases get
out notepad by the name up here and then
I have the individual fields that I want
to create so the name of this table is
going to be users it's going to have
each one basic basically every table I
create has an ID a unique ID that auto
increments and also an email obviously
the city the state so these three things
they enter on the second step and then
just date added this is just a field
that we can specify about you know when
they actually joined so what we want to
do is create the table name right here
and that is going to be users number of
fields is five all right so the first
field is ID and then you have the type
now if you never mess with MySQL there's
a lot of different data or basically row
types and so IIIT just means integer so
if it's just going to be numbers that's
fine the length is how many characters
that this field can hold so 11 would be
you know I don't know how many millions
but I yeah so also over here you have
all this other stuff
I always just make it null for the first
one primary and then AI is auto
increment and then over here we could
put email and that's going to be a
varchar' and that can go up to 255
fields I'm not sure how long the longest
email can be just
be safe always just put 255 here city
same thing I know there's some long city
names I have no clue state I I'm not
sure if we're going to be let me switch
back to our let's see your step - yeah
we're just saving basically yeah
the - two letter values of the name or
not for saving the full state name so
this only has to be two and then down
here dates added this is going to be a
date/time field alright so now we can
hit save and now it creates the table so
up here we have all these different tabs
and I browse basically means you can
browse the data that's you know been put
in but obviously we don't have any yet
alright so basically let's minimize that
let me get back out the HTML editor
we're on index.php okay so basically
what we need to do is at the top let's
also mind form action right here if you
specify an actual script I it'll take
you it'll submit when a person hits the
submit button down here I will submit
that data you know whatever input fields
you have to that specific page but if
you leave a blank it will just submit -
it's the same page itself and so what
you have to do in which is what we're
going to do so what you have to do in
that case is look for when that form is
submitted
alright so there's a few ways to do it
um I usually I just get out now I'd like
for example I need I offer this name
what you could do is if is set and then
post because our we have the method is
post right here and then inside you
could put the name of the field so I
need
and I have to probably be a good point
to put a disclaimer on this I'm a much
better designer than I am a coder but
I've done things a certain way for so
long probably like well over a decade
I'm sure if there any of you are like
really experienced coders and probably
pick apart different things I'm doing
wrong but the point of this is just to
make something that functions all right
so basically if is set that means if
it's if it exists and it will exist if
they click the find matches button I
then whatever we specify in here will
occur all right so just a quick example
I we can put echo and we'll put yey
submitted all right just like that and
if we save this I'm going to bring I'm
going to pause real quick so I can get
those files trim okay so I've
transferred all these new files over to
butter for calm and we bring up the
browser basically I as you can see we
don't have that yay submitted thing here
because that hasn't actually been
submitted but if we hit find matches we
see that it says yay submitted so that's
roughly how that works if you never mess
with PHP MySQL then yeah that's a very
handy thing to know obviously very basic
so and basically I the first thing we
need to concern ourselves when it comes
to people submitting that form is making
sure that both of the fields are filled
out so both are required obviously so if
a person doesn't fill out this fields
then obviously we don't want to save any
data or whatever we want to display some
type of message that lets us know hey
both fields are required so the field
names are I I need and I offer so what
we want to make sure of is they're not
empty so instead of just checking to see
if it was submitted at all the first
thing we want to do is I instead of is
set
we can put i-if post i need doesn't
equal that's a sign for that so it's
exclamation point in a I you know I
equal sign it doesn't equal blank you
know and then put also and - and signs
means and I think you use empty as well
but I've always done like this probably
not smart whatever I offer doesn't equal
that okay so we can check now if we
upload this and oops I need to remove
that one that's why errored so if we
upload this and come back here basically
if we submit this then it's still not
going to show us anything but if we
enter just something in here randomly
yes there's stuff in the field so I if
we just do one we can see it doesn't
work I yeah just like that so let me
come down here
now what we want to do and I shouldn't
have removed that first one is basically
put let's see here we are going to do
the if is set post
I need they're going to keep that one
shouldn't got rid of that close that up
now inside of here also a yeah we want
to change this to or so you know they
could enter one and lead the other one
blank I yeah that would be dat so what
we want to do down here is else so that
means okay well one of them are
basically blank so we have to put some
type of message so I'm going to make a
variable or let's call it error msg
equals you oops you left one of the
fields blank you know whatever you can
make it say whatever you want basically
and then down here what we can do is put
in an area
yeah the Dib class alert so basically
inside here we can put PHP if is set
error msg echo error msg alright so
actually you know I think I'm going to
change how that works one second I'm
going to copy this portion I'm just
going to put echo error msg and then
outside of this just above the div we're
going to put PHP and then paste that
area right here if is that error message
open up the bracket will close that one
right here and then put PHP and then
close the bracket right there alright so
basically save that and we'll reload the
index dot PHP and what we want to do
is go back to the browser all right so
we can Co ahead let's just maybe put one
and see what happens fine matches you
left one of the fields blank I screwed
it up obviously because yeah okay I'm
sorry I I think I drank too much last
night this should be and I should've
left it there there we go Jesus oh man
get out of here stupid accidentally
loaded that up alright so now what
should work correctly sorry about that
so now we just have one blah blah blah
there we go now it's going to work if
they're either both left blank or just
one is left blank we can also you can
also style this a little bit better
obviously that looks terrible I think
what I'll go ahead and do that real
quick let's see here let's go to that
was called alert alright so let's get
out our CSS come down here I'll put this
over here yeah alert and I think we can
text-align:center font-weight:bold
margin I don't know let's try like 30
pixels 0 now let's go ahead and save
that in the CSS and see what this does
okay well yeah that's not bold because
of I where is it at let me come down
here put comma 700 there I think and
then also I
background-color make it yellow and then
padding like I don't know 10 pixels
we'll try that and see what happens also
put in index.php because we change that
all right so that's ticks out quite a
bit
that's fine though all right so I okay
so now that we have that that's good
so let's come back down here to our
index dot PHP okay so both of the fields
are entered now what do we want to do
okay well basically you also don't want
to allow people to proceed if they only
enter like a couple characters for
example like if they put like a or just
one or B or whatever so there's a
function that will be able to count
basically how many characters are by any
given very variable basically so I what
we could do is put um I'll just call it
character count
I need equals STR Len post I need all
right so basically this variable right
here will contain a number account of
how many characters a person entered so
I offer equals the same thing all right
so now what we can do that now that we
have that we can put I another if
statement so if let me just copy that
real quick so I'm not typing out all
these I if character count I need is
greater than we'll say three and then
the same thing basically with a
different variable name
I offer all right and then inside here
is where they will proceed to the next
step and then we can put an else right
here and put another error message you
need to enter more than three characters
or something like that all right so I
let's see let's see if that works real
quick probably won't
all right so okay well I did leave on to
the fields blank so that would fire
first all right so what if we just do
this all right good
what if I do this and this good all
right so now if I do this there we go
nothing happens because we don't have
anything in be inside here okay so
basically now at this point you know you
can probably go through a lot of other
functions to clean up whatever they're
trying to enter like if they only enter
numbers for example you don't want to
proceed but you get the idea now so
that's the whole point I'm not really
serious about this project in terms of
barter for comm and making it successful
so anyhow now let's assume okay we're
here we're happy with the data now what
do we do okay well basically we want to
save in a session the information from
those two fields right here and here for
I need and I offer and the reason we're
going to save it in a session is because
they haven't yet entered their email or
anything so this session variable will
get sent off odd to the second step
basically so first we have to create
those session variables so what we want
to do is put a session and we'll just
call this I need equals and what we can
do is put
host I need I offer all right right
there and then once we've saved that
then what we can do is redirect them to
that second step all right so what we'll
do is header location and this is also
where we're going to put in I and
htaccess file so let's go to file new
file we'll save this as dot htaccess all
right so now in here I'm going to copy
and paste a few things that I just kind
of always included into my htaccess file
and you can use them if you wish i we
want to put I'm going to put this over
here rewrite engine on and go ahead and
put our first rewrite role so basically
when it comes to I the file names you
know we could always just put you know
how to redirect step - to PHP but that
doesn't look nice I would just prefer to
be you know step two well the way you do
that is you write out this rewrite role
so rewrite rule and then what you do is
put here the actual directory or the
name that you want it to be so I'll just
put in sign maybe I'll put final step
all right and then put a forward slash
question mark and a number sign or
dollar sign and then we'll put in the
actual file name step - - dot PHP and
then just put L right here I can't
describe everything or explain
everything
it's just how I've done it I know it
works so I yeah we'll save that and
we'll see if this works
so let me go ahead to here just drag
that htaccess file in to the root and if
we go to and just type in um
what was it final step all right we'll
see that it works oh and that's showing
up because I don't have that if step so
I step whatever all right so now what we
can do I is come over here and we can
put final - step alright so I'm going to
save that and let's see if that works
correctly so we'll enter some data look
what am i doing on line 21 I screwed
something up sorry about that where are
we at line 21 is right here oops I
forgot to semicolon at the end yeah that
happens like 50,000 times during the
course of project all right so now all
right so let's just put a little blob of
a blob of fine matches good so now we're
at final step alright so now what we
want to do is check on final step
because you just don't want anybody to
be able to go to final step without
having that little session variables
present so what I'll do is come over
here we'll go to first I'm going to copy
this stuff at the top we'll go to step
two paste that again and what you want
to do is check first and foremost that
the session variables are present so if
is a set which means that explanation
for it means it's not set
I think you could just put session I
think I'm not sure but I'm just going to
put I need just be certain and you don't
really need to open up with brackets if
you just have one single command so you
can just do this and then underneath
that you can put it in or beside it it
doesn't matter you can put in I like an
error message if you want I'm just going
to treat it by doing a header location I
index dot PHP
it'll just shoot them back to that home
page basically alright so if it's not
set send them there save all right so
now we'll see what happens
all right so why is it doing that well
it's because we have to basically create
the session first and I have a session
include I should have included it from
the start but that's no problem sorry I
had to pause there for a second so
basically let's create a new file real
quick we're going to save it inside the
includes folder we're going to call its
essence session dot Inc PHP and inside
of here we're going to put opening a PHP
tag we're going to put at session start
because you have to start the session in
order for it to be carried on through
the different pages and we'll just save
that and then include
well and require once that and save that
and also same thing here as well and
we'll make sure everything's uploaded to
both of those files as well as the
include all right so now if we go back
to our browser here and we just type in
you know whatever here now it keeps us
at final step because those session
variables are now carried on or there
rather all right so I wow that took a
lot longer than I thought
I've already had 27 minutes basically so
I yeah I think this would be a good
point to stop just because we're done
with step one and then tomorrow we can
pick up with step two and actually you
know getting this this data saved all
into a table all right so the Avenue yet
check out design course comm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright
