Gary Simon here and we got an exciting
one because today this is the very first
video that's a part of a hundred percent
free course that's going to teach you
how to build smart contracts through
aetherium
and it's going to be targeted for
absolute beginners like if you have no
clue what I just said you're the target
demo so this first video is just going
to be kind of like an introduction to
you know what a smart contract is a
decentralized app and also in a very
basic sense what a blockchain is so what
is a blockchain
well like almost everything in life you
know something you don't understand it
kind of sounds scary but don't worry
it's actually very simple
so in short a blockchain is simply a
decentralized database or ledger as it's
sometimes referred to as that contains a
list of records or data so distribute
means that instead of it being stored on
some central device like a computer or
server somewhere well the entire
database is actually spread out on a
bunch of different computers so this is
referred to as being a peer-to-peer
network and now if you remember Napster
that was a peer-to-peer file-sharing
program for music so the individual
records in this distributed database are
stored and referred to as blocks at
which are linked together and secure
through to cryptography so why do they
have to be secured well in the case of
cryptocurrencies which are built on
block chains and there's some exceptions
like the iota tangle I'm not gonna get
into that though security and MU bill
immediate immutability sorry or very
important for obvious reasons you're
dealing with important data so the data
contained in a blockchain is immutable
which means it cannot be changed once
it's been confirmed so in this context
it's tamper proof so there's a lot more
about the technicalities of how a
blockchain works
so instead of me going into details
about that there are two resources
videos that I want you to watch that
were created by other individuals that
give you a really really thorough
rundown about the concepts and also the
technicalities behind blockchains and
how they work so I want you to watch
those in secession alright so now that
leads us to what a smart contract is so
the Bitcoin blockchain stores data
that's specific to keeping track of
currency balances between different
parties now the ethereum blockchain
expands on Bitcoin and that it can store
and do much much more than the Bitcoin
blockchain the theorem allows developers
like yourself to build apps or
decentralized apps
so these decentralized apps are defined
by smart contracts so a smart contract
allows individuals and this is a very
you know conceptual definition it allows
individuals to exchange data in a
trusted conflict free manner without
relying on a third party like say a bank
lawyer or notary
so these etherium contracts are stored
as special transactions on the etherion
blockchain which you can then use to
build applications so you can kind of
think of smart contracts sort of like
decentralized api's now due to smart
contracts being stored on the theorem
theory of blockchain they need to be
validated or mined like any other
transaction so because of this there is
a small cost associated with deploying a
smart contract and also altering its
state like when you update the data so
fortunately in this course we're gonna
be developing in a test environment so
it's not going to cost you absolutely
anything all right so what are the use
cases for smart contracts well because
the unique properties associated with
smart contracts being that they're
decentralized
they're secure they're fast and there
are savings compared to hiring third
third party intermediary intermediaries
in the fact that they're always backed
up then they lend themselves to a
variety of use cases for instance voting
so since the dawn of every government
which I hate we have you know voter
fraud and we have tampering now smart
contracts can make it impossible for
individuals and governments to tamper
with voting records once they've been
confirmed on a blockchain for instance
now I'm also record-keeping so this kind
of goes hand-in-hand with voting above
because votes are simply records that
detail an individual and their candidate
selection but other types of
record-keeping could include establish
establishing and securing electronical
medical records case history for law etc
also digital identities it can handle
there are also use cases for the IOT
Internet of Things real estate and
mortgages auctions etc so there is a
mess of other potential use cases but
hopefully you now have a decent idea of
where this can be useful so now let's
talk I'm not gonna really talk about it
too much but next enter the picture is
how do you actually code a smart
contract well you do that with solidity
so solidity is the language that you use
to code the actual smart contracts and
this syntax is very similar to
JavaScript and it's designed with the
etherium virtual machine in mind so in
this course we will use solidity so that
solidity to create our smart contracts
and we will do this in the next lesson
in a web based IDE called remix I'll see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
