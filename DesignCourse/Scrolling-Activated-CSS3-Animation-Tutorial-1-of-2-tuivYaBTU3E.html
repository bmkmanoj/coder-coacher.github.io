comm today we're going to take a look at
scroll activated or scroll based css3
animations so here's an example of what
I'm talking about
all right so that example there isn't
what we're going to be covering we're
going to be covering something else is a
little bit different I this is going to
span over two days and so today we're
just going to get focused on actually
designing the actual items that we're
going to be animating and then getting
our HTML CSS and jQuery all set up all
right so if you need access to the
project files which are going to if you
want to follow along die they're
available for free description below
here in YouTube and that will take you
to a link on design course comm where
you can download the files you just have
to register it's free and then of course
as always subscribe here on YouTube if
you haven't alright so let's get started
okay so make sure you download the
project file so if you are at design
course comm for this specific video or
you're on youtube click on the link to
go to design course comm and then click
download project files and if you
haven't yet go ahead and join it's free
and then you can access the project
files once you have that downloaded and
the files extracted go to file open and
open up the actual let me go over here
yeah project sorry the grid PSD alright
so basically never messed around with
responsive design using a grid system
well basically right here we have 12
grids and it's basically a way to help
you manage and organize your layout
mock-up here in Photoshop and be able to
and easily translate it once we start
doing the HTML CSS so again the purpose
here is to I basically create a fake
kind of design and so for the purposes
of doing a cool sort of css3 animation
activated when you scroll down on a site
so this is something that we're seeing
that's a little bit more increasingly
popular I would say that front-end
developers are doing and it looks pretty
cool so I let's go ahead I'm going to
hide the grid and hide that as well hit
ctrl H and up here I'm not going to do
much because obviously if this if we're
talking about scrool base activated man
this people are loud out there scroll
based activated I animation well you
have to have something like
above-the-fold as its called
so I'm just going to put a temporary I
basically a rectangle so I'm going to
take the rectangle tool out here and
then just drag down right around there
the height is 766 doesn't matter you
don't have to be exact and then inside
I'm just going to put a tear I've with
the type tool scrolling CSS animations
with jQuery all right can't see it
because it's the same color so I'm going
to take these both and drag them down
and let me make this white ctrl T hold
shift and alt and scale that sucker up
and just try to get it in the middle
here all right so basically I'm using
source sands Pro for this it's a free
font you can find on Google and I'm
using the lightweight alright okay so
now what we want to do is focus on an
area down here where we're going to
basically animate two images into place
okay and so one will be a cell phone the
other one will be a monitor in yet we're
going to make three actually instead and
one's going to be like a tablet these
are going to be like vector slashing of
abstract they're not going to be actual
I you know photorealistic things so what
we're going to do is just take out left
click drag select the rounded rectangle
tool and we'll choose a radius of about
15 for this and the first one will be a
phone over here so I'm holding alt and
just left clicking dragging out may be
pretty big so right around there and the
width and height is right here if you
want to be exact for whatever reason and
I'm going to get the ellipse tool and
hit ctrl H twice and I'm going to put a
circle right there make it white all
right and ctrl H twice and I think maybe
also inside we will take this rounded
rectangle one I'm going to duplicate
that right click and just hit
duplicate layer or I've set up a hotkey
or shortcut ctrl shift + D and hit ctrl
T we're going to scale that and by
holding shift and alt just right around
there for now hit apply take the direct
selection tool and we're going to take
the stroke and make it white and then
take the stroke width and increase that
that's it right around there so with the
direct selection tool still selected
select these bottom points and hold
shift and just scale it up right there
or drag it up rather and then if you
need to make any other adjustments you
know you can do so by let me hit control
H once and moving those up with your
arrow keys alright I guess that looks
pretty decent for now I think I may want
to change the actual color of this
though so let me get right around there
I'm going to copy that color code right
there
hit OK and does it make sense to make
this slightly different maybe yeah when
we could slightly slightly lighter it
okay alright so we'll take those three
layers hit ctrl G and we'll call this
one phone all right take our move tool
move it around here and you know I may
hit ctrl T and scale that down just a
bit because we're going to have a couple
other things which are bigger and then
what we're going to do is we can
duplicate that group ctrl shift D and
we'll go ahead and move this beneath
that phone group right there and let's
open that up let's get rid of the
ellipse all right so now what we're
going to do is take this and ctrl H you
know I don't want to view the guides so
get out of there all right so now we're
going to create the actual monitor it's
going to sit up higher over here we're
going to drag this up
maybe you're on there take the sides
drag them over here and we just want
like a basic monitor shape basically I
think that's pretty decent right there
then what we'll do is take the one
inside and match that up as best we can
the direct selection tool I'm just
holding shift when I move these things
around as well all right so now take
both of those maybe we can make them
bigger holding shift and alt right
around there all right and then we will
yeah we'll just take this will rename
that group to monitor actually I forgot
something though you should put this
kind of like a stand maybe or something
right around here make that color this
alright cool
and let me hide the phone I want to make
sure this is kind of lined up evenly it
looks like it is I'm just eyeballing it
no big deal all right so now we'll take
monitor and we will duplicate that and
this one is going to be named tablet and
let's get that up there get rid of
rectangle too and oops
alright we have these things now take
control T and shift and scale that that
way control T shift and alt drag this in
and hit apply now that phone's like this
like way too big in relation to this so
this is the phone need scale down big
time so no big deal scale that sucker
down and then also this tablet is too
it's too tall looking basically so we'll
take the direct selection tool on this
layer maybe right around there well
shift and drag that in use your arrow
keys if you need to align it better all
right so now we'll take this tablet and
maybe position it right around here all
right so the idea is once we scroll down
here these things are going to be kind
of off here to the side and as well as
the phone will be off over here and as
we scroll down they will animate into
this position okay so now what we want
to do is basically save these images so
what we'll do is we'll take our phone
first and I'm just going to hit ctrl e
ctrl a to select all and then ctrl C to
copy and then ctrl n to go ahead and
create a new document make sure
background contents are transparent then
ctrl V to paste that in and then go to
file save for web and from now I'm going
to use the shortcut which is alt shift
ctrl S or command S and save this as a
transparent PNG 24-bit right here all
right so it's only 2.3 Kb so it's pretty
light and then we'll save this and I'm
going to go to a different I'm going to
pause real quick and go to a different
folder and inside my project folder I'm
going to create some files or folders
rather one is going to be HTML we're
going to go inside of it create a new
folder images enter into that and we'll
call this phone alright and we can back
up a couple times just so we can
maintain those so it ctrl alt and Z
about three times so now you can see
it's not flattened anymore we'll take
our tablet ctrl e or command E ctrl a
and then ctrl C to copy ctrl n hit enter
ctrl V to paste I know I'm going really
fast
and save that again and we'll call this
tablet and I'm going actually really
fast I've done some immense record have
done like two hours of recording today
for a different network that I do
tutorials for and so then we'll take
monitor here well back up a few times
first control
ctrl a ctrl c ctrl n enter ctrl V alt
shift alt s you guys are breaking on me
it's the same process before so don't
get too mad monitor alright alright and
now it is safe oh man I am I am just
wore out today all right so I let's see
yeah I guess it's worth we can key can
continue on a little bit because this is
going to be a two-part but it's only
about 11 minutes into the video so far
so I let's see here I'm going to get out
my editor and it's off screen I'm just
going to go file open folder and I'm
going to undo this off screen I have
three monitors so you're not seeing any
of this right now basically I'm going to
open up the folder I'm using something
called I sublime text - and that's an
HTML editor you can use notepad if you
don't have anything you know it's no big
deal
what we need to do is basically get out
I I'm going to open up the folder here
that I'm trying to find I'll just pause
this alright so now I have this area
open so you know if you don't have
sublime text too don't worry like I said
just die open up notepad or if you're
using Dreamweaver in a no big deal just
create a new file and I'm going to hit
ctrl s to save this and and I'm
completely in the wrong area um project
I think that's it HTML yes alright so
I'm going to name this index.html
alright and so now what we have to do is
start writing out our HTML just to get
everything set up so I'm going to put in
doctype HTML and then I'm going to put
the first HTML tag language equals
English and then head that's our opening
head and then close that up right there
and then we have a bunch of stuff and
I'm going to paste this in off-screen
just basically a couple lines at a time
so if you want to basic
go ahead and just save or take a look at
this and I I'm going to actually going
to offer this as a project file so you
don't have to really type this all out
by hand I and then I'm going to put the
title tag here Andrew let's call this
scrolling based CSS animations you know
whatever and then close that title tag
and then we have another essential meta
tag right here viewport this is all for
making things responsive and then I also
have this here which is a link to our I
don't think we need the that weight
right there for our font source sans Pro
and I you don't necessarily have to use
that I always do though for most my
tutorials and then we're going to put in
a couple lines here and so basically
this is an include for something that
doesn't exist yet and will in a second
is the jQuery right here and then a
custom script j/s file right there and
then finally two more lines I'm going to
copy and paste in and that is going to
be 1140 CSS and then also our custom
styles dot CSS all right
so real quickly I'm going to get this
opening body tag down here this is where
all of our HTML will go why does it do
that all right and then close the HTML
tag down there all right so now we have
to do is download jQuery make sure you
save everything so I'm going to get out
this jQuery comm slash download you can
download this right here you stright
click and Save Link As and I got to go
back and what the heck recent places
HTML create a new folder called that j/s
and then just call this jQuery dot J s
all right and then we have to go to
11:40 px calm
and this is our basically a minimal
responsive framework and then download
that and open that up and let me get
that get out of there it want me to buy
this thing it's just an evaluation copy
I never buy it but I in there we just
have a CSS folder we can hit extract and
basically you want to go to your folder
I'm doing this off screen because I have
so many different folders and projects
from clients and stuff let me go to
design course comm blah blah blah find
this
alright so project HTML and you want to
save that in HTML right there right okay
alright so now if we go back to our
editor oops wrong one sorry alright so
this is what we have we have our GS file
jQuery there we have eleven forty px
that's the SS we have to create two new
files though so new file save this in
j/s this will be called script J s and
then also will have a new file save this
in the CSS folder name this style dot
CSS BAM we are ready to roll all right
so that's a good place to end it so
tomorrow we'll go ahead and start
writing out the HTML CSS and getting it
linked up here and I basically getting
everything working so this you know I'm
not sure we'll see how it goes tomorrow
this may be a one or a two part or maybe
a three part video tutorial so we'll see
alright so as always check out design
