here today is January nineteenth with
our 19th video of the year and today
we're not doing any type of design
instead I'm going to be giving away 5
free copies of wise banner which is a
product that I created earlier last year
and released early last year and it
allows you to rapidly produce banner
sets very quickly so it works in
conjunction with adobe photoshop CC it's
a set of action files script files and
PFD templates so to get a better
understanding of what exactly it looks
like and what it is go ahead and watch
this video
bye
now that you know what wise Boehner is
here's how you win one of the five
copies I'm getting away all you have to
do is first like either the facebook or
the Twitter page for design course those
are both linked below this video and it
takes about two seconds to do after you
do that the second final step simply
requires a comment on this YouTube page
so if you're viewing this on the design
course page just click on the title and
YouTube in that way it'll take you here
to the actual youtube com website and
then I want you to be able to comment
and tell me what type of videos you
would like to see here in 2014 since i'm
doing a video every day so that type of
feedback would be really helpful to me
obviously aside from you guys following
me on the different social networks so
that's all it takes those two steps like
either the facebook or the twitter page
and then just simply comment here in the
youtube comments and let me know what
type of videos you would like to see or
what you don't like to see so then what
I will do is in a few days maybe it'll
be tomorrow the next day it depends on
how many responses i get i will at
random choose the five winners of wise
banner alright so i will see you
tomorrow with a real tutorial and then
also i'll let you know when i decide to
choose as five winners alright i'm gary
symington I course calm and I'll see you
tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
