of course cetera calm and today just
doing a quick recap of the February's
stats for cosecha com I did one last
month for the first time because I've
started to really focus my efforts on
trying to build up my website traffic in
the purpose of these videos of course
it's just to try to help perhaps in some
small way those of you who have their
own websites and are looking for ideas
and I'm just kind of anecdotal
experiences here from my end in terms of
what I'm doing to build up my site
traffic okay so right here we have a
January so just the last 28 days in
january to make it fair because februari
you know of course only had 28 days so
this is from you know the last 28 days
of january and this is from all of
februari last month right here so if we
look at this for sessions here it's
increased by over 10,000 so that's a
good thing positive growth users from
15,000 to 22,000 that's good pageviews
definitely increased 68,000 84 I pages
per session went down just slightly and
that's only because I'm getting a lot
more Google traffic and that means you
know these are the nature of this
traffic there people are looking for
very specific answers they land on one
page they find it and they leave okay so
average session duration that's also the
same reason that it went down quite a
bit to 253 so almost almost a minute
down again that's just because people
are finding there's more people finding
answers quickly and just leaving so
that's the nature of that traffic bounce
rate didn't really change too much it
did increase slightly which you know
again the same reasoning as these two
are being impacted negatively and then
sixty percent just three percent growth
and new sessions so the bounce rate the
session duration and the pages per
session I haven't done anything actively
on the site to try to increase the
engagement that's something that I
should definitely do and make it a
priority perhaps this month in March
coming down here we
have google traffic all right so this is
the one that I've always been like I
leave this on my cintiq monitor usually
and I'm looking at this or the real-time
traffic stats actually I'm not really
usually looking at this constantly but
um basically this is just I all the
traffic from Google and this is from
January first to the end of februari so
this is what this is a monday and had
165 visitor that's what i was there
averaging around that time now it's up
to 756 and what's also cool is since
it's already march forth I don't have
that shown here the chart would be up
here a little bit because we broke the
site broker record is like a 827 so it
keeps on climbing up which is a very
good thing so if i come down here new
content unfortunately i didn't have as
much new content as i would have liked
so starting down here with the fit to
februari just adobe XD it's going to be
a big key words and sometimes really
searched for a lot in the future so i'm
trying to build up my content in that
regard that's why you see there's an XD
XD and XD tutorial right here aside from
that i visited write an article for
microsoft bought framework this right
here how to make an appt to troll your
friends so each month i try to do some
type of article or content or video or
whatever that has a potential to spread
easily or go viral if you will and this
was pretty successful in doing that and
the reason I did that is because look at
this I hoping tennille you k and I'm
sure why calm didn't pick it up but no
big deal so if we look at here dad prank
daughter with broken phone app but it
didn't go as planned we have the mirror
da co uk same thing father pranks his
daughter with a broken phone app but he
made himself but it backfires and then
these people they go all out they show
my daughter's pictures was plastered
everywhere I but yeah I hear another one
is from Daily Mail I don't know why it's
like all co uk domains not a big deal
but who's laughing
natural daughter with homemade blah blah
blah you guys by the way you can see
this video on my youtube channel just go
back to the channel home page you'll see
it's a few videos back why are these
sites doing this and why do I want them
to do it well look at this one for
instance Daily Mail that co2 UK I
posting on his blog about the app you
see just like right here it takes us
directly to the article page that I
wrote on it so I just scored a big link
from a very major website I mean look
how large this website is I of course
it's not going to be elected to a war
it's not going to it's like 161 massive
massive site so it's an authority site
in Google size and Google see as well
they're willing to trust this site
enough to push a link to them I'm then
maybe we should trust it more and we'll
start ranking Disney no corset recom
higher overall same thing right here you
can check out here is happen for the
detail on his website course such a calm
and this time they link adjust to the
homepage I same thing over here
somewhere daughter no this was kind of
like a this is a link to the YouTube
channel it's somewhere in here yeah
right there corsets are calm yeah and
their side again going right to the
article page so I did something very
similar to this odd on in the month of
January what it was that I did I forget
on the way oh yeah no no no I was wrong
I did something similar to this
technique and I did get one link from
what was it called yes right here this
is at Popular Mechanics calm and this is
also a video on my youtube channel this
app simulates vintage AOL Instant
Messenger I right here is the link
pointing to the post on my page and
again Popular Mechanics
it's a huge site 4.2 k Alexa big site so
this is just one technique you know that
you can use and try to create great
unique viral sort of interesting content
that people are going to want to share
or big sites are going to want to write
about it and you can just hit them up
let them know about the content
sometimes they'll even pay you you need
to say hey you can use this link to my
site if you want and then they'll do it
awesome stuff all right so i basically
me close this out that's it I this month
I definitely want to get back on track
with the content focusing on perhaps
angular ionic and I may be changing
corsetry calm here very shortly to a
subscription-based service instead of
just charging per course something like
nine dollars a month would give you
access to everything rather than just
paying nine dollars or fifteen dollars
for a single course all right but I'm
not sure when that's going to happen
hopefully soon all right so look out for
more content very shortly see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
