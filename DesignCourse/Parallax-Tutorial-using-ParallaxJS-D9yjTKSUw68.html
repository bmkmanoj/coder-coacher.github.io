today is February 7th and we are going
to look at parallax jas so what is
parallax Jas well basically parallax is
a new sort of front-end web design
technique that offers some interesting
user interaction with websites so we're
going to first get started in Photoshop
CC and get our design set up and then
we're going to head on over and start
messing with some HTML CSS and
integrating this parallax j/s alright so
it's always check out design course comm
and if you haven't yet subscribe here on
YouTube to go ahead and catch all these
videos that I am popping out alright so
let's get started okay so let me click
on this down here this is the parallax
jas I basically website here and this is
the demo that to have which is pretty
impressive I so what you want to do is
first download click on that little eye
there and just click download and that
way we have everything we need to begin
or in terms of you know once we're done
with actually designing what we're going
to create a parallax out of you'll be
ready so just download that now and then
just kind of forget about it so we'll go
to I also and also download the project
files which are available in the
description below this video here in
YouTube or on design course comm and I
once you download those you go to file
open and we will open up the grid dot
PSD alright so or just a control one to
get 200% but because I'm at a smaller
resolution I'm not going to so ctrl H is
to get rid of those I guides and then
just you can hide the grid we don't
really really don't need it really for
this tutorial but I always use it anyhow
alright so we want to do the first thing
is just take the rectangle tool
and we will hold all and just drag out
an area around that size so I write here
that the pixels are 1290 that that's not
really important as long as it's all the
way and then for 34 here for the height
all right and so what we want to do the
way the parallax works is if I go back
here scroll down you basically set up
your scene through an unordered list
HTML element so each list element or
list item is basically on its own I
layer I guess you could call its on its
own
li elements so the data - depth is kind
of what used to control how things move
based on your cursor position so let's
go ahead and I open up the breathalyzer
- top P&amp;amp;G so this is something we
created in called Omega tutorial in a
previous lesson I in blender and we kind
of created a whole movie out of it or
whatever so I'm just going to reuse this
specific element and if you actually
want to learn how to create something
like this or whatever you can check out
my channel I so just make sure you have
that you know ctrl a ctrl C to copy it
and then we'll switch back and just
paste it in and then scale down just a
little bit ctrl T hold shift in alt I'll
have it like maybe right around there
it's like a move tool hit apply and then
we want to open up the DC - logo this
obviously has nothing to do with the
breathalyzer but this is just for you
know an illustration on how to get you
you know how to get started with that
that parallax ojs so I copy that and we
will paste that in ctrl T and we will
scale that down by holding shift maybe
right around there and let me go ahead I
want to change this to white so
way of doing that just double-click on
that layer take color overlay change the
foreground to white hit OK and then
right click and rasterize layer style so
what we want to do is create a series of
these on just duplicate them so ctrl
shift D to duplicate and I'm just going
to place them kind of randomly alright I
think 4 is good enough for there and
then I'm going to just take these and
group them ctrl G so that's Group 1
we're going to call it large icons and
then duplicate that group ctrl shift D
and I'm going to delete the initial ones
here and then we have this duplicate
right there we're going to make this a
little bit smaller so ctrl I mean I ctrl
T and then shift scale down and then
also take the opacity down a little bit
and then go to filter we'll go to blur
Gaussian blur yeah right around there is
good at 2 pixel also hit OK
and then just go ahead and duplicate
these a few more times
I think right around there is good so we
got five of these small ones and then we
have for the large ones so you know you
don't have to be specific you can do
whatever but also one last thing just to
give the background a little bit of a
texture I'm going to pull up a free
image available via deviantART and that
is right here and I've linked this
resource file in the description here on
YouTube I and this is the individual who
created this I and then you could just I
right-click and I think we can get away
with right clicking and copying that
image it should be big enough we'll see
and then we want to go down to rectangle
one control shift and for a new layer
tab space just to create a clipping mask
there or just click it with your mouse
and then ctrl V to paste it in yeah you
know what it wasn't actually I think can
get away just with that size right there
that's fine so now what I want to do is
go to image adjustments desaturate and
then go to image adjustments hue and set
the image adjustments hue and saturation
I will colorize it take the brightness
down take the hue up to make it like a
blue take the pasady kind of way down or
the lightness rather and right around
there you don't have to be exact it's no
big deal I take the eraser tool
I think 250 would work it's trying to
kind of get rid of the edges here
all right that's mine and alright so
that is going to be it for the actual
design portion so what you want to do
now is go ahead and take our large icons
folder and hit ctrl e and that basically
flattens everything into its own layer
and then the active the small ones
really I didn't really rename that just
ctrl e as well so now these are on their
own layer and these are on their own
layer as well so first thing I'm going
to take the I this Baxter the blood
alcohol content layer ctrl a ctrl c ctrl
n for a new layer hit enter and then
paste that in and then we're going to
file save for web so you can go file
save for web or do the shortcut as I'd
like to do and then we're just going to
leave that 24 PNG 24 transparency
enabled hit save and we're my app the I
didn't save that in the right close that
location so these are all my project
folders for this year right here alright
so if you download the project files I
kind of already had the file structure
for you so save them in images I never
got rid of those so I'll just overwrite
them because I already went through this
tutorial once just to make sure I got it
down and then what we want to do is come
back here ctrl a ctrl C on the large
icons control edie
ctrl V to paste can't really see it
because it's transparent oh and also
when you go to control Danu make sure
background contents are at transparent
all right and then save for web leave it
with all the same settings and we're
going to call these this these are the
large ones right so large - logo just
going to replace mine and then also take
this and just hit ctrl C ctrl n ctrl V
to paste save and make that small - logo
dot PNG all right
and then finally the one last thing we
have to do is save the background so I'm
just going to hide those three layers
and I'm going to kind of just take that
rectangular marquee tool and hit edit
copy merged ctrl n enter ctrl V to paste
save for web we'll change this over to
jpg because otherwise if you leave it at
PNG 24 you're a massive 250 K image
whereas you go to jpg take the quality
down a lot to around 55 percent and
you're only at 20 KB so we could save
there and we'll call this BG dot jpg
replace that okay all right so now we're
ready to actually get started with the
coding portion so get out your favorite
HTML editor or whatever you want to call
it and I'm using let's see over here I'm
using what is called sublime this isn't
lined up with my window there it goes
all right I so if you opened up the
project files that you downloaded from
design course comm there's an index.htm
and that's what I'm currently open so
right now I use sublime text to well it
is it's not free but you know if you
don't have the cache or whatever you can
always use notepad or any type of
character editor to do all this so it's
no big deal so just to explain what's
happening here we're just opening up the
HTML and in the head portion we have I
let's see here
this here is 1140 I dot CSS that's kind
of our grid in the Photoshop was based
out of and that's just kind of a real
minimal responsive framework for HTML
and CSS and then we have custom CSS here
there's nothing in and this is where
we're going to add just a little bit of
CSS not much and then we have jQuery
down you know what we don't even need
jQuery so you probably won't see that
because I'm going to delete that before
we start and then also we don't need
this either this is from a previous
tutorial so don't mind that yeah all
this stuff blah all right so what we
want to do to get start
here is we're going to put a div ID
equals B G as in background and then
just close that up so what this is going
to be is this whole container right here
along with this image so we'll specify
that in CSS so let me go back here now
inside of it we're going to put div
class equals container 12 and that is a
part of the 11:40 dot CSS container 12
that basically that means 12 columns
long and so everything will be kind of
centered inside of this class right here
all right so now what we want to do is
put our unordered list so UL ID equals
seen close that tag right there and then
we'll come into middle and then this is
where we're going to put three different
list items so Li class equals layer ID
well we're not going to give it an ID D
just yet I'm going to put I'm going to
start out just with this so data - depth
and this is from the parallax es equals
zero point zero zero and then we'll put
the image for the actual breathalyzer so
images forward slash breath dot P of G
and then close that Li tag so images we
have that breath this is the let me go
back over here just to reference this
this is where that's going to go and
then we have two more one for large and
then one for small so let's go ahead and
go back here I'm just going to take this
Li there and just paste that twice
alright so the depth is going to be a
little bit different this one this is
going to be I'm just going to try 0.4
and we'll change this to large logo and
then this one's going to be 0.8 and this
is going to be small - logo alright so
right now I all this if we were just try
to view this in the browser it wouldn't
work correctly because one we don't have
the the CSS for a background or anything
div and also we don't have this the
parallax that Jas hooked up yet
yeah that's had a phone call and it
screwed me up I had to pause alright so
now I down here is where we're going to
specify I the part where we connect the
whole parallax at J s so if I bring up
the info page sort of there's an example
when you downloaded that let me go to
here when you download this it opened up
off-screen one second and you open up
that zip file arm we have examples and
we have simple HTML and if you do right
click and just view source if I can get
that up yeah if you page source down
here the way I have it added is just
right here so I'm just going to ctrl C
copy that and we will minimize this and
that'll just ctrl V to paste so right
now we have deploy and then that's
parallax I'm using the mid version the
minimum version in terms of size so we
have to change that to min and also this
isn't a folder down it's just right up
there and so we can get rid of those two
dots and a forward slash and then VAR
scene is right here this is where you
specify the actual scene the ID seen
here and then we don't have to mess with
anything else
all right so now what we want to do is
I'm going to save this I'm going to open
that and just double click on the HTML
portion just so we can get an idea
obviously it looks nothing like we
thought would that's because we have to
work with the CSS so let's minimize that
and I'm going to double click on custom
here and again if you're using notepad
or something it's not going to be as
easy as you know I'm switching between
back and forth these documents but
that's ok no big deal so now what we
want to do is
for instead of ID equals BG so number
sign BG and I'm going to give it the
background so it's background here
that's first the color is of the
background will be black and then the
actual image is you are all images BG
jpg and then no-repeat because we don't
want it to repeat and then top center
height is what we have to find the
height of it or is that um
buh-buh-buh-buh image size 433 so yours
might be different so not a big deal so
just find that and then put that over
here height 433 and then also we had a
margin kind of I think it was like
around fifth probably around fifty
pixels you know it doesn't really matter
you don't have to be exact what I'm
talking about is this portion up here
all right all right so let's go ahead
and all right
obviously the height is it working so
let me fix that and I forgot to do one
thing in the HTML so let me go back
sorry rather the CSS I screwed up what
am i doing I'm sorry I put the height
like what am i doing margin - top there
we go that might be why I didn't work
okay so go back here all right so now
it's looking better so now we cannot
give these an ID those two layers right
here and then also the phone so we can
get those situated properly so let me go
ahead and do that real quick so put this
ID equals I breath what I always always
call that thing a phone so breathalyzer
ID equals L 1 just for layer 1 and then
IDE goals l2 alright so breath I'm going
to put text - align Center and that's
going to Center it and then we also have
to give it some margin here so what
we'll do is come down here I'm going to
put it like margin top 80 pixels all
right now the way that the images were
constructed there's a little bit too
much space here
now you could remedy that in two
different ways you could already just
add another one of these or one of these
over here that way it's filled out a
little bit more or you can just adjust
the margins with CSS so we could do il-1
margin left 50 pixels let's just first
actually see what that does if that you
know maybe fix to the issue a little bit
more and it does look a little bit
better but what I probably would really
would have done
I just put another one right here that
way it's kind of there's not like a
blank area I so we can see it's also a
little it works kind of responsively
but I probably use z-index to make sure
that this stays on top with CSS but yeah
that's basically basically it in terms
of making you know a cool kind of eye
cursor driven interactive effect for
your web designs alright so as always
you check out design course comm and if
you haven't yet I subscribe here on
youtube i'm doing a video tutorial every
day of 2014 and i will see you tomorrow
with a new one all right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
