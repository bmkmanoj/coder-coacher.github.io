calm and being a little bit quiet I'm
doing this late at night I do not want
to wake up the demon monsters none of my
children so right here this is just a
quick video that's going to show you how
to use a carousel package for your
angular 2 plus projects this also works
in angular for this is based on angular
4.2 project and here's a quick preview
of it this works on mobile as well and
right here is just a very simple use
case where we just have thumbnails
although it will work with any type of
HTML all right so again this is based on
ng to Karis alamos I assume that's the
pronunciation and it gives you a little
bit information about how to implement
it but I'm going to show you everything
from start to scratch so you can get a
better understanding of how exactly it
works all right so let's get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're going to find a bunch
of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost of buying me
like expect each month that's it now
also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it so I'm
going to assume that you have all the
prerequisites installed like nodejs and
the node package manager NPM and after
you have that if you don't by the way
just go to node.js org and download it
install it come back after that you need
the angular CLI or command-line
interface because that's how we're going
to start the project so the command to
run that is NPM install angular CLI at
latest like that I'm not going to run it
as already did after you run that
command then we're going to access the
CLI at ng new we're going to call the
project here carousel and we'll set our
style to SAS just in case we want to use
that now by the way I get a lot of
questions about you know which console
I'm using well I'm on Windows so I don't
like to default
command prompt so this is called
commander or if I bring this down you'll
see the name right here CMD e R and you
can just find that it's free just go to
google and type in CMD ER and download
it so you can also style and custom
create custom themes for this which is
what I have done alright so once it's
done we're going to go ahead and CD into
the new project so CD carousel alright
and at this point we want to install the
actual carousel package so we're going
to run NPM install name is ng to Karis
Alamos and save it as a dev dependency
we're sorry not a Deb dependency but
rather just a dependency and also we're
going to run ng serve by the way I
notice I have a space there see if that
affected it I don't think it would
and once it's up we'll see it says
welcome to my app go to localhost 4200
and I'm in the new project folder right
here of carousel so we have to go to the
source app and the app module to import
the package that we just installed
alright so there is a written tutorial
that you can follow along link here in
description to YouTube if you want to be
able to quickly copy and paste these
lines and I'm going to be doing here so
the first one is this line right here
which is empty any importing into to
carousel module take this and copy and
paste it as an import so now all of our
components or future components will
have access to using this ng2 carousel
now I kept on saying ng - that's name of
a but it will work for energy for as
well alright so the way we use this we
save for example we want to go to our
app component HTML go ahead and delete
that
hit ctrl B to go to the sidebar and the
first thing we'll do is create a div ID
of container
next inside of here we'll put div and
ng2 carousel limos and that's a
directive we're going to give it a class
so we can access it if we wish through
CSS then we have a series of property
bindings down here so the first one will
be items and this will be bound to an
items object or array of objects
essentially and we'll define that later
on next one will be the width of the
actual carousel itself and this has to
be in pixels not percentages eye next we
have previous bound to a previous or
pareve local template variable that's
going to be defined within an NG
template we also have next again this is
just for previous and next templates and
then the actual item template and then
we close off the div right here all
right then we put in our ng templates
all right so we're going to put in ng
template provide the local template
variable with a hash sign and the name
so that's what this is in reference to
right here alright and instead of here
just makes most sense to use for
usability purposes like a left or arrow
or right arrow etc so this is going to
be a left arrow right here so we'll use
image source equals assets images left
arrow dot PNG we'll give it an ID of
left so we can access it later on and so
where is this coming from will be a
control B and we go to assets I by
default there is not an images for here
I already created it so make sure you
create this images folder in here and
you want to have some sort of left arrow
also a right arrow as well so
the one I use for the example that I
showed you is based on this right here
so the size I think was more like this
size right here and you just hit
download PNG and use it and it's also a
right-arrow version somewhere in here
alright so do that real quick
and just to show you the folder right
here we have assets images we have a
left arrow or right arrow and I have six
thumbs that we're going to use for the
actual gallery so I went to images
google and i filtered it by i'm usage
rights commercial use free to use and i
just crop these at 500 by 500 pixels so
it could be anything that you want
really okay so after that continue on
then take this copy and will just paste
another one right here this will be next
and this will be right this will be
right as side as well and then we also
have our final ng template and I'll just
paste that this you can be called item
we're also going to add a letter a
couple other things called let - item
and that's going to say that the actual
native way we access the data through
interpolation for instance will be
through item the name of item and then
also let I equals index in case we
wanted access to the actual index
alright so inside of here this is where
we put whatever it is that we want to
repeat inside of the carousel so I'm
going to put in div class here equals
items and by the way this doesn't have
to be like a thumbnail gallery of any
sort doesn't even have to be image based
you can feel free to put any type of
written type based content if you wish
in any manner that you wish it's a style
with CSS but for RK
just make it simple it's going to put an
image source we're going to use some
interpolation on the actual object or
array of objects so item name and it's
really just going to be a URL similar to
this all right
and after that we'll close that out and
that is it
okay so we'll save let's go ahead and
define this items right here items
object and app component file okay so
right here and the actual classes get
rid of this title property we're going
to make one called
items and it's going to be an array of
any like that and then in the
constructor we're going to put in vista
items equals and we're just going to
hard CO and raid hard code and array of
objects ordinarily this could be coming
from a database of some sort
so we'll say name will be assets really
it's not a name it's a URL but I was
just kind of lazy was going off the
example
all right thumb dot with thumb one P and
G now we'll just take this and I'll just
paste it a bunch of times I have six
thumbnails alright that looks good and
I'll do it one more time just to repeat
and that's it so let's save that and
then let's give it some actual style by
the way if you look that in the browser
this is what it currently looks like and
it actually works but how do we actually
style it so let's go ahead and check
that out we'll go ahead and reference
our container ID with 100% margin 5m on
the top and bottom auto right and left
will Center it padding:0 and background
will make white next we'll have our
items class now this items class is
added
- right here so this is a good wrapper
around the image in case you wanted to
add other stuff aside from the image so
this will be max width of 300 pixels and
this will let you define the actual
width if you try to use width alone that
will not work so you have to use min
width or max width I found out the hard
way because we're working with flexbox
height of 300 pixels and we'll say
background will be ececec but we're not
going to see that though because these
are all same size so now it's coming
together pretty well already
let's move the left and right or the
previous and next buttons with margin
pixels of 30 pixels all right and then
one final thing because I'm a little bit
finicky just to create some separation
we'll go ahead to our styles and just
add body background easy easy easy
alright and that is it so like I said
this of course will work with other
content that isn't just images so just
to show you real real quickly if I go
back to a our I our component file for
instance and I change this up real quick
I'm going to pause this and then just
show you the change I made right here to
the items or sorry array there we go I
changes just a bunch of names right
there we'll go back to our app component
HTML get rid of this here and then we go
back to our CSS real quickly change max
width to minimum width save it and maybe
I'll just do one more thing
font-family:arial font size 2m yeah
we'll leave it like that for now say
it and then go back and there you go
awesome stuff so you can make it
supports opa-locka happen that looks
ridiculous but yeah that is it so you
know hopefully you've enjoyed this quick
tutorial to help you out in one of those
cases where you needed a carousel
alright guys I will talk to you later
make sure by the way to check out corset
eurocom for more awesome tutorials a lot
of it angular-specific stuff a lot of
free courses as well alright see you
later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
