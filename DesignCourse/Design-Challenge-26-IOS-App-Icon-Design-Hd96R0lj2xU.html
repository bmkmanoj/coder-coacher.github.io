for tomm welcome to design kors design
challenge number 26 and this is all
about designing an iOS app icon or
sometimes known as an app launcher the
little icon that you click on your phone
in order to launch a given app alright
so also i'm going to be doing another
giveaway in this time it's not going to
be any type of course it's going to be
for the new design course com live
training that I launched where I do
one-hour sessions and then there are
about sixty five dollars depending if
you order multiple or not and I'm going
to be giving away one hour for free and
we're going to do it the same format
that we did in the last week's design
challenge where all you have to do is
submit an entry for this design
challenge and I will add your name to a
random name picker and I'll choose
random name like one random name from
there ok so also I also released a
course that I previously had up on
udemy.com and that's for iOS and Android
app launcher design so if you're
approaching this design challenge not
knowing how to do iOS app icon design
well if you have a few bucks to spare
i'm going to link it here in the
annotation youtube or you can go ahead
and just purchase that and watch this
and then submit your design of course
you don't have to buy it you know in
order to submit an entry alright so
let's go ahead I and get start on the
entries member you have till Sunday to
submit the entry and then I'll do the
review on monday alright so I'll see you
then goodbye alright so this is the
contest thread or challenge there i'd
rather and if you've never designed in
iOS icon before or android check out the
course right here there's a brief intro
video here and some other information
it's only ten dollars so check that out
if you wish and so the objective is
design an iOS app icon which if you look
at the inspiration that's this is what
they are I for a fictional app called
neighbor secure it's an app that's meant
to serve as a social networking platform
for neighborhoods with an emphasis on
security so think of it like a digital
version of neighborhood watch
trolls essentially so the requirements
are do not include the full name
neighbor secure in the app icon it's too
many letters for it to be understood at
the actual usable size on a Apple phone
essentially so don't include neighbor
secure that's just kind of for a point
of reference focus on creating is
symbolic representation of the app
instead so kind of like these these are
symbolic and it should be simple and
easy to see and understand small sizes
and it's best to create an icon for at
least 512 by 512 pixels with 80 pixel
corner radius now you can go higher like
1024 x 1024 but please scale it down so
that we can actually see it you know
like if you presented us with a size
like this that would be fine maybe a
little bit bigger but I wanted to be
able to fit on this screen when I do the
review here in about a week and then
submission deadline of course as always
is sunday june twenty jun 14th rather at
12pm user standard time and we're also
doing a live training giveaway as i
mentioned at the beginning of this video
and you need to submit an entry to this
contest in order to be eligible to win
this right here which is the hourly
design training that i launched
yesterday okay so check this out and
check out the promo video i'll be
uploading a youtube video here this week
announcing it formally and yeah and make
sure you put in effort though if it
looks like you just slap on something
and there is no effort or time spent in
to it i'm not going to add your name to
the list of potential winners alright so
yeah this is needs for inspiration and i
look looking forward to seeing what you
guys come up with alright so subscribe
