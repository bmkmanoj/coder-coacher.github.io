and today is January eighth and we're
going to be continuing on our squeeze
page designed from yesterday for the
fictitious paperclip company so
basically we're going to finish
everything for that squeeze page mock-up
in adobe photoshop CC and obviously if
you're watching this video you already
have the project file so nothing really
dimension there but just a quick note
check out design course calm if you
haven't already and please try to like
us follow us on the different social
networks which are linked in the
description of the YouTube video alright
let's get started ok so the first thing
I want to do is take this paperclip
layer which is for me as layer one and
just delete it I think it looks silly I
then I want to take rectangle 1 + ctrl t
hold shift and scale this up now down
here I'm just going to have an area of
three different features so I and then
beneath that there be like two
testimonials and that will be it so the
first thing I want to do is take the
rectangle tool and those three features
will be kind of in this container a real
light grey container so we'll take the
double click on that just make it a
light color so for the icons open up the
project file and the first one here I
created on layer 1 is what we want you
to take control a control C to copy
let's get out our grid and ctrl-v to
paste and we're going to put it near the
center vertically in this first grid or
call them rather and I'll just call this
files and it will do the same thing over
here copy that and this one will go on
the fifth each one of these are is going
to span basically
for columns
alright we want these to be kind of all
centered up if I take this here all
right that looks good all right and then
what I want to do is take the type tool
drag out the width of three columns and
we'll type in upload any type of file
anytime you wish and then duplicate that
drop it down just a little bit move this
over here will change this one to you
get 1tb at some terabyte free for a year
and then it's only two per month and
then right-click and duplicate that one
final time here and what this one will
say control when and where your files
are backed up all right so i zoom up a
hundred percent here you can see looks
pretty good and go ahead and zoom out I
think we could
decrease this I height a little bit so
hitting ctrl left clicking will
automatically select the layer so you
don't have to click that little check
box up there and then what I want to do
is take auto select layer and select all
those and then go ahead and deselect
those two layers we don't want this and
we don't want the grid layer as well
then once we have them oops d select
that one as well then just move them up
into vertical position with the arrow
keys alright so we got that far now all
we have to do is just put in like two
testimonials right here so now what we
want to do is get up these two pictures
right here and we'll go ahead and show
the grid and we want the ellipse tool so
we'll i'm going to hold shift and alt
and basically the size of one of these
and then let me get rid of the grid or
hide it rather and ctrl shift n and then
make sure this is checked for creating a
clipping mask and then ctrl v that now i
just take the magic wand just so i see
where it got pasted it into and then
it's loops d select auto suck layer let
me get back over here damn it all right
now we got it now i can scale it down
hit ctrl T shift and alt right there
alright simple enough and then one final
time we'll go ahead i'm just going to
take this layer right there right click
duplicate that get the grid out pull
this down and then with the type tool
selecting oops select in there and we're
going to drag this out to the width of
five columns and i wish i had this text
already prepared you could just use
lorem ipsum if you wanted to but i'm
just going to type most file storage
services just store your files but paper
clip takes it a step further and
organizes them as well okay and then I'm
going to hit enter twice and I'm going
to put in theory Simon of design course
com so now let's hide that grid and I
think that looks pretty decent we want
to make this top text going to make this
all black all right and I want to make
the file actually I do want to make the
font size just a little bit bigger like
20 all right now that's better and we
can also move this up just slightly like
right around there and then I'm going to
zoom out here and then we're just going
to duplicate to everything right here
and where's that text is right there and
then we will just duplicate this get the
grid out right click duplicate layers
deselect auto select layers and then put
that right there and we can just take
her real quick and do the same thing I
select control a just to select all and
delete and then ctrl-v to paste in we'll
see where she was paced she's all day
down there that's probably not a picture
you would use for a testimonial but it
was one I found on facebook and my wife
so they'll have to do and you know I'm
not going to mess with the text we get
the point so I let's see everything
lines up here alright so basically that
is it you wanted to like show this we
could take the square marquee tool and
copy merged and that would be in my
opinion and effective squeeze page
there's a lot of white space
provides information it's minimalist
single call to action and that's what
makes a good squeeze page alright so
tomorrow I believe we are going to focus
on creating a mobile GUI graphic user
interface kit so that will be exciting
all right so i will see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
