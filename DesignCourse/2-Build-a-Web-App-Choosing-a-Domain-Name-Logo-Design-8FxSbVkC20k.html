comm today we're going to be focusing on
picking a domain name and designing the
logo I'm going to completely scrap the
idea in the introductory video about
creating like a web app that's based
around connecting communities and
neighbors or whatever I'm going to scrap
that idea because my wife had mentioned
to me last night that people are
increasingly using Facebook as a way to
barter
so bartering of course for example you
know let's say for example I needed a
refrigerator fixed well I could go ahead
and mention any type of products or
services that I would be willing to
exchange I in order to have somebody
who's skilled in appliance repair fix it
so basically it's it's a way to attain a
service or a product without actually
paying cash for it all right so
bartering you know it's real big I think
it would be cool to have a web app or a
website dedicated specifically towards
that goal so that's what we're going to
be focusing on all right so I already
came up with the name the name and I'm
going to go over in a little bit about
how I chose that name of what site that
I use to help pick the name and that
name is going to be barter full com kind
of like beautiful accept barter ful calm
alright so you're going to also I pick
your own name and it could be something
similar or not it can be completely
completely different but yeah I'll stop
rambling so I yeah if you haven't yet
check out design course calm and
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so if you're trying
to come up with a domain name a great
way or to get started basically is to
use the thesaurus com so we know our
website is going to be about Barty or
bartering exchanging so you just type in
barter it will give you a list of
synonyms here as well as antonyms and
this can give you a starting point to
begin to start searching for domain
names so over here on this tab I have a
site called bustin name com
and you can check that out slightly
different than this page I and I'm going
to use specifically the word maker and
the way I found my name is I I just
typed in barter and you can set
different options here so you can make
domain names that start with or end with
this specific word I make domains that
look very natural or less natural etc
and you can just experiment with these
of course and you can also limit the
characters here as well so I left it at
10 and I you can also specify ComNet org
and when it comes to the domain name
extension you know there's a lot more
than it's just listed here I so you're
not you don't necessarily have to use
this tool but I left mine at just calm
so if you hit go here you can see it's
very quick eye and you can just kind of
get some ideas if you want to go this
type of route I most of them are going
to be just you know they're not going to
be good names to choose from i but one
that i found that stuck out well for me
is was barfle calm so if you click on
this I'll show you you know the
different pricing and you can use
whatever host you want to use um I
actually registered this already so that
is now my doe name alright and so this
is just a temporary landing page that
the host sets up for a new site so you
know when it comes to choosing a domain
name it's always a good idea to kinda I
go to Google and just type in the name I
and see if anything else has ever you
know come up so Larter fool and so what
I saw was very interesting is
introducing bar default calm so this is
already a website that somebody let
expire which is completely ok and I did
some more research on this and this was
basically a college project that was
started last year but they obviously
didn't care about it so they let it
expire all right so that's no big deal
um so basically come up with a name I
you you don't have to use barter
in the name at all you can use anything
else that you might think is relevant I
yeah using the thesaurus or whatever or
you could come up with a name that is
completely you know just unique in and
of itself like a new word I mean it's
cooked entirely up to you so just try to
find a name and then just go to one of
the Reg don't domain name registrars and
register it and you should probably get
away with only having to pay for what
for example you just click here and it
tells you the domain name prices so just
choose one it doesn't really matter too
much who you use so I use some obscure
host that I started using a long time
ago like twelve years ago so yeah any of
these will probably be fine so I yeah go
ahead and do that and once you have your
name chosen then I that's obviously
where the next step comes into play
which is designing the actual logo so
I'm going to do that now because we're
going to be working with a different
name I you know it's kind of open into
to interpretation so but anyway I am
going to show the actual process of me
designing this logo so I I'm going to go
file new in Adobe Illustrator here and
for the name just going to call this
logo number of artboards I'm going to
put two three and I'm going to take the
width I'm going to use 860 and then the
height I'm going to set at 600 and that
just kind of fills up my current
resolution it's not too important anyhow
so then go ahead and hit OK and hit
control 1 this will take you to 100%
view of the first artboard alright so
again my name it I've for the company is
going to be barter fool.com alright so
if I just type in barter full I already
found a rounded font that I like and I'm
going to link that in the description if
I can remember I and that is called
station medium alright
and real quickly I'm going to take the
take this character it's negative 15 for
the tracking so alright right around
there and ctrl shift and the letter O
we'll convert those to outlines all
right so basically the idea I had I'm
not going to create a specific separate
symbol it's just going to be there's
going to be a word mark and the idea I
had is I the idea of bartering for
example that's basically to exchange or
to connect with people so I figure out a
way that we could just real quickly
represent that in an abstract manner so
if I take these here and we're left
click them and hit ungroup after right
clicking each individual letter now is
independent of from the other ones and
basically I just wanted to kind of
create a connection or a flow between
these two letters and then also between
the e in the R here all right so we're
going to use the pen tool and I'm going
to come over here and it's not going to
have a fill it's going to be a stroke
choose black and I'm going to just start
out a ten points for the stroke width
and just see if this lines up so I'm
going to zoom up a little bit closer
here and just for this the purpose of
this tutorial doesn't have to be perfect
but ten points seems to work pretty well
for the for matching the thickness of
the letter so it's going to leave that
over here and I'm going to take the pen
tool again and I'm going to start right
around here and then I'm going to
connect it near the center of this point
by left-clicking and dragging right
around there so now we could take the
direct selection tool up here and move
around these oops move around these
individual points as needed
and down here we can adjust just some
the goal here is yeah right there looks
pretty good you could probably play
around with this a little bit more to
make sure it's everything is even and
then I'm also going to take it and then
control C and control F to duplicate
that and come down here get my layers
out drag this one beneath make it make
the stroke here or actually go back to
gradient and select I will make it white
and then just use my arrow keys what I
want to do is take this in and that way
we create some separation there alright
and then I'm going to take those two and
let me get my layers out again ctrl C
and ctrl F and move those over and this
isn't going to line up perfectly zoom up
here alright and then I'm going to take
this Todd's direct selection tool also
I'm going to come over here with my move
tool select it hit stroke and then make
the cap rounded alright and I'm going to
take the pen tool I'm going to click on
this
just try to kind of match it so that it
looks like it's flowing into the are
correctly this needs moved
and I'm going to add an anchor point
here let's see take a left click drag
out select add anchor point think right
around here take the direct selection
tool trying to make this flow in a
little bit more evenly all right that's
a little bit better because you want
this kind of flow naturally and I I
think that's good for now there is a
little bit of an edge here but I can fix
that after we convert these here thing
same thing with over here so what I'm
going to do is I delete this one and I'm
going to just select everything and go
to object path and outline stroke so
that basically takes any strokes that
are in to selection and outlines them so
now it's no longer a stroke that we can
modify I so also we want these to be
more even in terms of the space after
this little swoosh which that just
eyeballing it looks pretty decent so
then what we want to do is take both of
those layers by holding shift and left
clicking go to window will go to
Pathfinder and then we will select this
one right here now that just basically
makes this portion invisible or
transparent and same thing right there
alright so now if I get control one I
pretty simple the idea is just conveying
you know in an abstract way a connection
between two entities so I I like that so
yeah I mean depending on whatever name
you have you can try to do the same
thing if you want or not no big deal so
I yeah so now what we need to do to is
to consider color so color psychology is
very important there's if you do a
google search you can research different
colors and their meanings I so I found
one just real quickly and I've paused it
and I have up here I mean if you go to
Google Images and you can really just
find some quick references and also it
suggests
searching the web and really getting a
strong understanding of what the each
colors tend to mean I and reflect so I
our site obviously is about money or
saving money by bartering which is a
great thing so I'm going to use a green
color life growth nature money freshness
and then also you know you can also mix
in other colors and make something like
a green yellow or more on the yellow
side and so intellect friendliness
warmth I the friendliness is what I want
to really emphasize as well so I'm going
to take a color here I'm going to select
everything and let me switch back to
foreground here control H to get rid of
the outlines and basically if I double
click over here we can see I we go in
this middle range between the green and
yellow hit okay I think that's a little
bit too it's not enough contrast going
to a slightly darker pink right around
there is okay and so that's just going
to be the very simple logo along with
the color that we're going to use so the
reason I created two other artboards is
just to copy this and move this over
this will be a black version right here
and then down here we can have a white
version which would be used on darker
background so just make that white you
don't really want to put a background
behind it because when you go to open it
in a different application like
Photoshop I won't be transparent and
there we go so now you just want to save
this sorry I had to pause that real
quick I did want to mention another
thing also um if you did want to if you
don't yet have a host I basically have a
link here to one and 1.com they are well
known hosts and also a demain registrar
so you can have both your domain
registration and hosting here if you
want and there is an affiliate ID a I
set up an affiliate account with them a
long time ago like six years ago
because I wrote a tutorial
and so I was basically advising people
to you know who want to host go there
and I get a small Commission every time
somebody you don't have to use it with
the affiliate ID you know no big deal
but yeah this is just I they're pretty
popular host the domain registrations
very cheap I believe obviously you just
click on domains and you could do a
search and you can register real quickly
and also the hosting we check out the
hosting here I click on View packages
they're all like really cheap like
starter like only $0.99 I that we pre I
wouldn't even mess with that I probably
what would be sufficient is probably
this $5.99 a month or this 1099 one a
month and so if you're serious you know
about doing web development or web
design of any sorts then yeah you should
definitely have a hosting account so
this is just one site you can check out
and you don't have to do it right now
you don't have to register the domain
right now although if enough people are
watching this you guys might I I
wouldn't wait too long to register any
domain name that you have but for the
web hosting you know you can wait for
that if you want we're not gonna be
doing any file uploading you know in the
next couple days and I'll think so yeah
you have time um so yeah once you have
your your logo you're good to go I in
tomorrow we're going to beginning we're
going to go into a Photoshop and begin
designing a mock-up I believe for like a
landing page alright I alright so yeah
check out design course comm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright goodbye
