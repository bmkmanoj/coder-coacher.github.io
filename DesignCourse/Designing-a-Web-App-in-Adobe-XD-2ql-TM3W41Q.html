process includes creating a mock-up or a
prototype of some sort so the importance
of this is extreme because if you simply
just hop into a project and start doing
the HTML and CSS to structure a layout
usually the end result is going to be
ugly so it's always easiest to first
design it in some type of graphics
application so in this course we're
going to use Adobe XD or experience
design which is an app and website
prototyping app so what we're going to
do is first design a homepage and then
when a user clicks on one of the
tutorial listings that the part of our
code post on that project will also
design a page that lists out the details
and then also finally a third page for
when people want to post a tutorial
through a forum and then at the end
we'll create an interactive prototype
where you can actually click on the
elements in the prototype and you'll see
how the page transitions work and how we
intend for them to work in the final
result alright so let's get started
alright so I launched Adobe XD or
experience design and here we have with
the initial screen making us choose to
open something recent or start a new
project so what we want to do is start
here with a web 1920 by 1080 version
right here so let's click it and I just
pause to fit it within the recording
area and I'm going to hold alt in my
mouse scroll wheel to zoom up a bit here
hit the spacebar and left-click to drag
and if we click on this little title
right here web 1920 what we can do is we
can adjust the artboard as needed so we
have our width and height over here
so if we
simply left-click and drag up or down we
can adjust these values as we wish and
what I'm trying to do is basically just
get it to extend to a good portion so it
fills out my screen just for recording
purposes so for me recording at 1920 by
1080 so this happens to be 21 68 by 1369
as long as you have the proportions
pretty close to the 1920 by 1080 you'll
be fine again this is just a prototype
alright and then also another thing that
we want to adjust is I the viewport
height if you want that's what this
little dashed line here is I you can
make it even with this if you want and I
think I will as well okay so the first
thing I want to establish is the
background color again we select on the
artboard here to establish the fill
right here now I personally really like
this a very desaturated dark blue so if
I click on this the way you can find in
the way I never gate and found it
initially just go to this blue over here
kind of close to this teal color and
just come down here near the D saturated
dark portion so the specific color code
that I ended up using is 2 a 3 1 3 6 so
we'll hit enter okay next we want to
import the SVG that we created for the
logo so we'll come over here
we're going to import and choose our
logo SVG alright great so now to scale
this down just a little bit and I'm
going to drag it up near the left corner
maybe right around here will be pretty
good now so the design I'm intending on
is going to
be centered something like this so we'll
just keep that in mind that we want and
eat roughly an even amount of space on
the right left all right
so we'll just pull this down just a bit
use my keyboard down in your ear okey
and next I'm not really planning to have
a navigation just because this is a
pretty pretty simple project so what I'm
going to do instead is just have a
button called post tutorial right here a
call to action so I'm going to take the
type tool it doesn't really matter where
it's at because we are going to adjust
it and it's going to be post tutorial
all right so I'm going to increase the
font size by left clicking and dragging
up and we're going to go ahead and make
it discolor right here our accent color
now something that's real handy is if we
take this and we go to fill and we can
come over here actually the eyedropper
and we can get the exact color right
there and then we click on this and
click this little plus and I'll add it
to the swatches so that we can quickly
reuse this and access it when designing
other user interface elements all right
then next we're going to go ahead and
take a rectangle tool and draw it around
it of course we can see it but we'll fix
that we don't want to fill here instead
I'll have a border and this border will
be our accent color additionally we also
want a border radius just slightly that
looks pretty good so let me go ahead and
zoom up here just so we can show you I
can show you what it looks like so now
we can just select the type and position
it with our keyboard arrow key all right
all right this is what things look like
so far and they're pretty good
so get a good idea for positioning right
there looks good all right great
let me bring it down just a bit all
right so now the next let's go ahead I
and draw or design rather
this section right here and we're going
to focus on that in the next video I'll
see you then
all right so now what we want to do is
design the actual tutorial listings that
are going to show up upon the app
loading so this is going to be you know
what is essentially the home page of the
home screen all right so what we want to
do is we're going to make this in such a
way that there's three or four different
panels that are featuring each
individual or latest tutorial all right
so to do that zoom up here just a bit
I'm going to come down we want to decent
that amount of white space between our
elements you know sometimes when you get
a little bit too close
it really clutters things you want your
design to breathe especially on the
desktop version so I'm going to draw out
something roughly right around this size
now of course we can always adjust these
and make adjustments as needed in terms
of the width so that they really fit in
with the sides of our layout so we kind
of just want to eyeball this so that
three of these can fit across
temporarily we can choose repeat grid
and just drag it out look at it's almost
correct there in terms of the size but
that's not doesn't really matter because
we can also scale this down as needed so
if I take I this one oops
take this one then we can scale so it's
even so if you look in the very right
it's aligning to the right side of the
post tutorial button along this edge
alright so I'm going to back up just a
little bit just so we're here and it's
no longer a part of the repeat grid and
now I'm going to choose a color for this
so do we want really this absolute white
then I kind of don't like that I think
it's just too much contrast that's
coming out and it just kind of breaks
the flow of the layout so what I want to
do is just make us very slightly lighter
color of this background so to do that
we'll come over here and we don't need a
boarder by the way so we can uncheck
that and we can real quickly get our
background color and then just choose a
slightly lighter color so we're almost
like that now I chose a very specific
one when I was developing the app
earlier and I'm going to paste that in
here actually wow that was I think that
was the same sac color code what are the
chances of that happening all right so
it's three six three four five that's
the color code that we want hit enter
all right and now what we want to do is
create the title portion of it so I'm
going to zoom up here just so we can get
a good look of what's happening so for
the title I'm going to left-click drag
out maybe right around here I'm planning
on having a little circular eye arrow
that can be clicked to bring you to that
particular resource so creating a - duze
app with the mean stack and either four
so this is just some type of bogus title
essentially so now for the color here
make it white and the size obviously
needs drastically increased and so we'll
scale this down and I'm going to be
using a Google font called a railway so
over here if I type in a railway will
find it and I want this variation right
down here which is going to be we'll see
you light ya light now where can you
find that if you just go to google and
type in download railway font this is
the first result you download TTFN and
install it
alright and looking at this as is I
think we go a little bit less maybe
about 40 and also we can increase the
line height so I'm going to just drag
this up slightly that way it's a little
bit easier to read
so again I think going to come down in
size just a little bit yeah that looks
good all right great
so now on the right hand side we're
going to focus this on that that little
circle I was talking about at the end of
this lesson so let's also focus here on
a description section so with the type
tool I'm going to left-click drag out an
area roughly right around here
all right so I'm just going to asdf a
real quick here just for a second
because we're going to get up a site and
that is Lipson com
here's the address and you just gives
you some lorem ipsum text that you can
grab real quick and integrate as place
filler text so I'm just going to copy
that paste it in okay so we want to make
some adjustments here first it's too
small so I'm going to increase the size
by the way let's change our well railway
font real quickly and we'll make this
light the size just a tad bit smaller to
around 26 and then also we want to
increase the line height to around 39
right there alright so looking at that
that's pretty good so far and now we're
going to have a call-to-action button
which is going to be a more info button
we're going to style it the same as this
button over here so control C control B
drag that guy over here and scale it
down holding shift roughly right around
there so this is what your design should
look like so far and change this here to
simply more info and we'll drag this guy
in oops there we go
all right perfect now let's go ahead and
design that little circle real quick so
I put back into Adobe Illustrator and I
open up our logo SVG file I real quickly
I'm going to save this as a new file
we'll call this here icon or let's call
it just external a temporary pause then
I got into my r8 project folder here
based on the lesson so external we'll
save that hit OK okay so the reason I
opened up the logo is just so that we
can create a certain similar aesthetic
in terms of the arrow that we create and
so this helps sometimes in terms of
creating an overall consistent type of
aesthetic so what do I mean exactly well
we see we have a certain angle of our
slant here this isn't quite 45 degrees I
think it's a little bit higher but what
we'll do is I'm going to right click and
ungroup this and then we have this one
isolated we can delete that and what I
want to do is simply take our rectangle
tool and then hold shift select both of
them get out our favorite tool ever the
pathfinder - front right click we can
ungroup this so we can delete this and
now we just have this certain slash
essentially so what we can do now is we
need to create an arrow out of this so
we want the same thickness so I'm going
to ctrl c ctrl F and that creates a
duplicate on top I'm going to take our
free transform tool and skew it eyeball
is close to straight up and down as I
can and unfortunately it doesn't align
to or really allow you to know where
that's at actually another method of
doing this which sorry about that kind
of a brain fart there just to simply
take the rectangle tool and roll out
right there perfect now we have the
exact width that we need so now we can
come down oops now we can come down here
and then also hit ctrl C ctrl F we're
going to make sure we can rotate it hold
shift so that's one hundred percent on a
100 degree 180 degree angle alright and
then what I want to do is take this here
this anchor point with the direct
selection tool we want it to follow the
same angle right there same thing with
this one up top except we're going to
drag everything down because it's a
little bit shorter all right so now it
doesn't really look very good and
there's a couple issues with that that
are contributing to that first this is
kind of isn't aligned here exactly in
the center of these two and also when we
skew it we change the width of this
because if you skew it enough you'll see
how much thinner it will become alright
so that's what's happening there so
we're going to make a few adjustments so
first we're going to take the direct
selection tool we're going to move this
up I'm no longer kind of interested in
maintaining the same angle or realize
that was kind of a bad a judgement call
so that's okay now taking the direct
selection tool you just left-click and
drag or the add Anchor Point tool sorry
and we're going to create just two
anchor points here and I'm going to drag
this one hold shift and select this one
and we're going to drag it down to
increase the thickness alright and then
I'm going to drive this one let's see
here straight up so that's in line with
this down here alright so now it's
looking better
and so really just required those two
steps to get it looking pretty good
so now if I I could probably stand to
move these so that's more in line with
that angle alright that's looking pretty
good
alright so it's still unique enough and
I think it does follow this the general
aesthetic looking at this and me want to
move this over just slightly alright
alright I like that
so now what we'll do is take the ellipse
tool and we're going to come right in
the center which isn't quite the center
yet I'm going to drag that here to the
bottom we're going to take these three
we're going to join them and then we'll
make it white and we'll scale it in just
a little bit all right so I like that
right there
all right and one thing I'm going to do
instead of making it white we're going
to make it I the same color as our
background of the website so or the app
rather so what you can do is just take
this color code right there
copy by default it has a selected and
then I'll change it here and hit OK
so now let's go ahead real quick and
take our artboard get it scaled in scale
it in yeah sorry about that was a little
bit tricky I kind of ended up going a
different route than originally planned
but that's okay all right so now we'll
save that xvg we're going to bring back
XD we'll go ahead and import here's our
external graphic alright and we're going
to stick it you know right around there
let's see them up a little bit oops
right around there seems pretty good
alright and then next once we have all
this done this entire panel will take
everything and hit ctrl G and then
repeat grid so now we can drag right and
obviously it's extending too far so
before we address that let's drag this
down three columns right there or three
rows rather and then what we can do is
increase this to even size as well all
right that looks pretty good and now at
the end let's go ahead and click ungroup
grid and hold shift and we can scale
these in so that the right sides line up
to the end of our post
toriel section alright so that looks
pretty good right there alright so I
wanted to increase this just a bit I so
to do that just to show this bottom
portion here and we'll get rid of a
couple just to show what it might look
like naturally also adjust the bottom
portion for the same height for the
aiport oops ok great so now if I hit
play woo got real big on my screen scale
it down here
there we go good stuff ok now in the
next video we're going to focus on a
detailed listing or what happens when
you click on one of these panels
