comm today we're going to continue on in
Photoshop by designing the second step
mock-up along with a login page and then
I know a lot of this is I kind of boring
right now we're only focusing on
Photoshop but tomorrow will be the last
day where we actually designed the
interface where a person's logged in and
they can see all the different potential
matches I and then after that we'll
focus on some HTML and CSS all right so
if you haven't yet check out these nine
course comm and subscribe here on
YouTube alright so today we're going to
go ahead and just make a few adjustments
I for the second step after a person
enters their needs and their once ok so
let's go ahead and save this and I'm
going to name this one I homepage step
to our home step two alright so what we
want to do is just change this here to
great just one more step and we'll bold
this right here alright and then we have
to adjust these down here so first we're
going to change this to email address
and we have to change the width here
because we're going to have three
instead of two so what we'll do is make
this initial one just three grid columns
I'm where's that at I think it's right
here take the direct selection tool and
just select those right portions and hit
shift and left click and drag over and
then we will take our move tool oops if
you don't want to yeah it's a good idea
just to make so you cannot select that
when you have that grid view and so with
auto-select layer and move tool select
those two hold shift just move these
over holding shift and we want to make
this one your city
take the move tool our direct selection
tool rather three columns long and then
we'll take these as well do your your
city text and this and hit control shift
D or just right click and duplicate
layer' move it over holding shift and
this will be oops hate when I do that
select on the text and then edit it that
way your state alright so you know I'm
not sure if I want like the idea of
putting your I mean obviously it's going
to be that so just to make it more
simple city state alright there we go
and then I just to real quickly just for
mock up purposes just as you know state
that this is going to be a drop-down
menu I'm going to put in with the move
tool it make sure shape is selected I a
quick down icon I'm a holding shift to
do this as well I hate this my keyboards
been jacking up lately okay I get a new
one alright so double click that portion
of the layer bring up the color picker
and we'll just make it just a mid gray
color and move it over alright so
control one museum out and I'm going to
change this text right here to let's do
this oops
and down here we want to change this
text as well so an email is required in
order to save your information it will
never be shared
alright and then ctrl s to save that and
alright so that's basically going to be
the step that shows up after a person
enters that information so we will use
PHP sessions to save the previous two
inputs that they did on the initial page
and now would be a good time to also
create the mock-up for a login page all
right so simply because we we already
have the text boxes and such out so I'm
going to make sure you save this and
then we're going to save this as login
all right so I haven't actually designed
this page before doing this so I'm going
to do this kind of you know hopefully it
goes well I mean a login page is pretty
simple so I'm just going to left align
this text and change everything to login
here and what we'll do is let's see here
we have one to many input so I'm going
to take the move tool with auto-select
layer take our state text hold shift
select the background that Square
portion and also this triangle and
delete those and let's get out our grid
so we can see everything and when it
comes to logins you can approach it from
two different ways we could do a
horizontal as we have been doing it or
we can stack them on top of each other I
think that's still route I'm going to
take so what we'll do is take a city and
the container right here will make them
I'm thinking the length of maybe five or
six will see Outlook so I'm going to
take the direct selection tool select
this one right here hold shift and move
it over to way around yeah we'll try
five at first and then do the same thing
with this one right here hold shift move
that over and let's edit the text right
here this is going to be just some
asterisks to let them know that is the
password and so when it comes to the
password as well you'll notice we didn't
really put a field for them to specify
password so we're going to use PHP to
automatically generate a random password
for them and so that's the idea behind
that
I and that way it's just one more field
that they don't have to enter in the
hopes that it will increase
you know people using the service as
much as possible alright so over here
let me move this stuff down I'm going to
get rid of our magnifying glass portion
and take the those two layers and we're
going to need a forgot password area
right here ctrl shift D and just going
to take that text and stick it over here
and this will be forgot information and
that will be a link I don't really care
that I had that set up that way this is
just a quick preview over here I'm going
to put this pie right here and I'll edit
this real quick I know typed it right
there and we can just move these
existing things over right around here
and then left align it and this will be
we'll put some text here you could put
the forgot information password right
over here I you could put any bits of
text that you want like joining is free
let me go ahead and actually let me
adjust this real quick
okay
actually yeah no I'm not going to put
that I'm going to put on don't have an
account question mark register here and
this will be a link so I'll underline it
and so right here
alright let's hide the grid real quick
yeah you know what I'm going to move
this over here I'm going to put this at
the top and make that linked as well
and then I'll come back down here let's
see I'll put in if you're having any
difficulties logging in please
and I'll put contact us we'll make the
contact us portion a link right there
and alright and let's change this text
down here login now move these up a
little bit alright very simple I and I
think that will be sufficient for now
alright so tomorrow we're going to go
ahead and I believe the next step will
be to actually design the mock-up for
the page that actually shows the full
interface it'll show listings and and
all that good stuff alright so I will
see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
