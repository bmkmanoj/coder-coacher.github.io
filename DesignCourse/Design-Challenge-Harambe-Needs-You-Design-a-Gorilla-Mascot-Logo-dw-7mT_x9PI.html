this design challenge is to design a
gorilla mascot logo here is Simon of
corsetry calm and today we have the
third design challenge for corset row
and this time it's based on a logo
design although you have no type or a
word mark to worry about so let's switch
over here to the monitor and I'll go
over the very limited details we don't
need many it's pretty straightforward
for the design challenge so of course
you can find the challenge here in the
link in description or by just going to
corset Rio calm and then click on
challenges you'll see it at the top so
it ends six days from now and challenge
description very simple we'd like to see
a team style mascot logo design based on
the grill ahead I and do it for home so
yeah it's town this town is going to be
really testier ability to effectively
capture you know the shape and the
aesthetic of a gorilla but also do so in
a minimalistic in iconic manner so what
do I mean I mean these are some examples
and an inspiration of what I'm talking
about we if you just click on you get
larger versions here and you'll see you
know we all seen these type of team
mascot logos this is the type of
aesthetic that I'm looking for they're
not literal there abstract and stylized
that's what we want so going over the
requirements this time I just want to
make it a white background only and this
will keep uniformity in the entries I
it'll just make everything a little bit
more simpler to judge and it also keep
the entries a little bit more simple as
well so it should be vector or via
photoshop just no pixilation it needs to
be large enough so that we can easily
see it no type no text just the head
symbol don't copy other entries I know
you you may browse entries here but try
to stay away from copying specifically
you know different aspects of entries
you're free to use color but black and
white is fine when if you do use color
limited just the two primary colors we
have a couple color variations in here
although when it
comes to a gorilla there's no color
associated it's just a black and that's
it I let's see don't over use cheesy
effects this is so important so get so
many entries that do this the soft drop
shatters the gradients inner gloves out
or glows to stay away from it just try
to keep things flat as much as possible
all right so prizes this time you know
we have the free access to our Android
app design and development course and
also free access to the upcoming design
challenge course that I'm going to be
creating and releasing hopefully within
a month or two and all it is going to do
is really just I walk you through a
number of different projects the type of
projects you're going to see in these
design challenges and really just help
you get a sense of what solid design
