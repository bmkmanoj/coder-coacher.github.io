welcome to part two of or to rather of
the landing page tutorial here for 2018
and in the first video we designed this
right here this very simple landing page
for in-app and now we're going to take
that and we're going to write HTML and
CSS to make it a reality in the browser
we're also going to do a little bit of
animation with the SVG graphics
themselves so the first step that we
need to focus on here oh but real quick
before we begin make sure you check out
my site course cetera comm where you're
gonna find a bunch of courses on modern
design and development a lot are free
and others you can access for the cost
of by me like a six pack each month
that's it now also it probably wouldn't
hurt to subscribe here on YouTube and be
sure to make sure the notifications are
turned on alright let's get back to it
he is exporting all the various assets
that we're going to need and I went
ahead and kind of skipped just a tad bit
but the only thing I did was group up
some of these things some of the assets
into groups so the very first group that
we want to concern ourselves with is the
candlestick background you want to make
sure that all the individual lines here
and these thicker rectangles are a part
of the same group called candle BG and
so again just to select for instance if
I wanted to show you real quickly I the
process of doing this it's very easy to
group things so if I just lets do unlock
and then let's go ahead and ungroup so
now we have all of these freaking layers
how would you select all of them very
simple so let's just select everything
and then a hold shift to deselect the
parts that I don't want so I don't want
any of that so now I just have the
background so ctrl G it's in a group to
rename it you can double-click on it or
right-click and rename and we'll call it
candle BG alright so that's the first
group that you want the next group is
going to be this monitor in and of
itself not the
little chapped lips on top watch if I
move it you'll see that's the only thing
that should be its own group name it
monitor right here also each of these
three should be their own group so
inside each of them and by the way one
is named iota the others - and the
others ETH if I double click on this
you'll see that we just have mainly just
three different paths here all right
so once you have all of that ready to go
then what we can do is go ahead and
export I which will be an SVG format
what we need alright so what we'll need
here is the logo now I'm holding shift
while selectees you can also hit the
ctrl key the logo of the candle BG the
monitor and then our three
crypto-currency chapped lips once you
have those six selected we can go to
export sorry my phone's going off make
sure it's on SVG and we reuse in bed we
use file size optimized we're just going
to minify it and you want to change this
into a new folder I called it LP demo
this is a blank folder I created just
for this tutorial here so go ahead and
create a new folder whatever you want to
name it and then we're going to choose
store these inside of a new folder
called yeah we'll just call it images
you call it assets whatever select
folder and then export okay so with any
luck everything will have worked and now
we'll go to our code editor so I'm using
Visual Studio code it's a free code
editor from Microsoft they actually used
electron to build it which is something
I cover here and we have the Det new
folder LP demo opened up we can see our
images all that stuff right here awesome
so the first thing just to get out of
the way I'm not going to be using a
robust development environment for this
I really just wanted to keep it simple
strict HTML and CSS that's it so I'm not
going to be using
so I'm not gonna be using live browser
browser reloading just want to keep it
very simple so we're going to create a
new file called index.html and I'm going
to hit the exclamation point and just
hit enter and I'll give us some quick
HTML boilerplate going now I want to
link a new style sheet it's a really
cool style sheet make sure by the way
I'm gonna hit ctrl + to get a little bit
larger style sheet and then href equals
we'll call it I CSS forward slash main
CSS so let's go ahead and create that
folder CSS and then side of CSS we're
gonna make a main dot CSS alright and
now we are ready to rock so I'm gonna go
ahead and kind of do like a split
well maybe not no I'm not going to do
that sorry what I'm gonna do is we're
just gonna start off with HTML and get
all that out of the way first
so going back to basics we have to ask
yourself so we have to try to think in
terms of containers so the biggest
containing element that we have is just
this entire piece itself and that will
contain and hold this background right
here so we're going to make a div ID of
home container alright and then we're
going to have a div ID of inner inner
will be in relation to this section
right here so it's going to be column 1
column 2 will be this monitor alright so
we're gonna call that column 2 let's see
illustration because that's essentially
what it is alright so I'm gonna hit
control B by the way to get rid of the
sidebar so next we're gonna have the
content that's inside of inner which is
the logo headline sub-headline and
call-to-action so we'll just do heading
1 here this is crypto + chat equals
crypts I'm in the crypts man
not quite
hélène nerdy white kid I will never be
in the Crips slack meets real-time
crypto-currency I think that's what it
is something like that and then we're
going to have an a href going nowhere
for now we're gonna give it a class
though of call to action or CTA and this
will be join up or sign in by the way I
did in the mock-up have a little
triangle here icon I'm not gonna mess
with that you could export that as SVG
and put that in as an image inside of
the anchor but yeah not gonna mess with
that so that's it for that section oh no
I missed the actual logo so image ID
equals logo reference that and CSS and
then source is let's see here
when I name that images okay so it's
images forward slash logo SVG alright so
next we have our illustration column and
that is simply a series of images so the
first one is let's see assets nope sorry
it's images /wel - SVG the ID is going
to be dashed so we can reference that
specifically to position it and then
class is going to eco let's see here
what I want to name it we'll just call
it crypto icons
alright so in Visual Studio code we can
hit shift alt into down arrow key and
we'll do that three times alright so
next is going to be iota next after that
will be aetherium or e th and this is
the monitor
this doesn't need that class alright so
that's it for the HTML as you can see
absolutely dead simple not doing
anything really too complex here okay so
let's go ahead and just saw for the heck
of it open this up in a browser reveal
an explorer double click this it's gonna
look like garbage I guarantee you and
yes of course it does okay so let's go
ahead and get this a little bit better
looking alright so the first thing I
want to do is we're gonna import
employee gave me a talk import the
montserrat font in our main CSS so this
is what that looks like we're gonna
import URL here is the URL and we're
using the weights of 300 and 700 alright
so next we'll have our body and HTML and
we'll say font family is menthe sir at
if that's how you even pronounce it to
say I'm serif and then we'll make height
100% and margin zero also for body I'm
going to have a background and this is
going to be our background color in the
mock up which is F 4 F 4 F 4 and the URL
is going to be images and candle BG SVG
alright so actually I think we should
make that go out a folder alright so
then we can say background size is cover
so let's save that real quick we'll
refresh we can see the background behind
all this large
crap back here so that's good so far now
let's go ahead and we will start doing
the rest of the CSS so we're gonna have
we're gonna use the CSS
grid which is a new way to structure or
a relatively new way to structure your
layouts and it's going to become very
popular in 2018 for sure so we're gonna
say a home container which is our first
development display grid we're gonna
have grid template columns and this is
where we structure the actual columns of
the layout so if we look here we could
see that we have really one column here
and another column here I find it easy
there might be a better approach I might
have found it most easy just to have
four columns with two empty ones right
here so to do that we're going to use
0.5 AFR and that's a specific unit for
basically applying kind of fractions one
fr and one fr these are going to be
equal and then point five fr so I don't
think fractions was the best way to
describe that but what's happening here
let's just save this real quick
actually this added a couple more
properties grid gap will say ten pixels
so that's the the amount of space
between the grid columns and then real
quickly grid template areas are going to
be left right and period so the each one
of these is a value that's in relation
and it's naming each one of these
columns right here okay so the second
one is left which is in reference to
this section and then right is right
here okay
and finally we'll put in height a
hundred percent let's save this all
right so we're getting there but not
quite so we have to define where it says
left and right on to our inner and
illustration divs so to do that we'll
just put in
let's see here inner grid area left and
then we're also going to do a line
self-center and justify self center now
let's also real quickly do the same
thing for our illustration div and this
is going to be grid area right aligned
self all that stuff we're gonna take the
width from 100% to 80 because the one
portion was showing up too large so now
as you can see once we gave it a grid
area name of left it shows up where it's
supposed to be as shown here all right
so we're making progress slowly but
surely alright so coming or continue on
let's go ahead and focus on the logo I'm
gonna put image logo that will be width
of a hundred thirty pixels a margin
bottom of one point six am and I'll go
back real quick and refresh that's
better and then we'll also have our h1
for our headline text transform we're
going to make it all uppercase color is
going to be five three five three five
three by the way if you need to
reference to your specific colors that
you're using you just click here there
there you go the hex is right there same
thing with the background you click on
the name of the canvas here's the fill
and there's that
alright so also continuing on and then
margin bottom we're gonna give ourselves
some space
what 2:00 a.m. so now let's go ahead and
refresh that alright coming along and
then we're gonna have P dot subtitle
this is going to be a font size of 1.4
e/m color is not quite black so it's
eight five eight five eight five and
margin top is zero
the other reason I know how to give them
specific margins is because when I went
through this beforehand I was noticing
some areas
we're not aligning so that's how you
define margin or or do you experiment
with the margin in the padding as you
need to so let's also do the
call-to-action button and that is a
class of CTA so that's background color
and at a zero nine let's see BBE nine
that blue padding of one am color inside
for the text is white will have
font-weight:bold a margin top of two am
display:inline-block border radius is
going to be five pixels and then text
decoration is none true okay let's I see
what that does
all right a lot better all right so
that's basically it for that section
so now let's worry about the actual
monitor and all of that good stuff so
the monitor div let's find that real
quick or define it rather is going to be
actually it's not gonna have anything
right now we're just gonna leave that
empty and a blank we're gonna focus on
the crypto icons class which each of
those have and so that's going to be
position:absolute and we make the width
about twelve percent so for refresh you
can see now this size is much more
consistent and you want to use
percentage simply because if you don't
if you use like say fifty pixels if it
scales down it these won't scale down
with the size of the monitor so you
don't want that alright so let's
continue on all right we also have let's
see here we have dash
and this will be a margin top of
negative 4% a margin left of 9% so if I
save this right away and we'll see that
it is now placed it where roughly we had
it in the mock-up I believe at least so
let's copy this and we'll make this e th
and iota so e th for margin top is nine
point five percent down from its
original position and then the margin
left is 18% so it's pushing it over
quite a bit actually I was wrong that
was that was supposed to go here all
right so that's four aetherium all right
and then iota is supposed to be 5% in
negative one point five so 5% here
negative one point five there so let's
see if that works
perfect exactly as we want it all right
so this obviously if we scaled this into
like a mobile it's not quite mobile
friendly but I'm not going to really
worry about responsiveness in this
tutorial just kind of want to get moving
on so now we're going to make this
animate in such a way that it should
look interesting so to do that we'll go
ahead and see here well the first thing
we'll do is animate the monitor we'll
just kind of have that fade in and down
so animation we're gonna call it monitor
in it's going to be about one second
long and we're going to use ease in out
and then we'll say for words because we
don't want it to repeat we're also going
to set it as pasady zero by default
also don't forget about your vendor
prefixes I'm not going to do that here
alright so for monitor in we define that
through at key frames monitor in from
this will be transform translate Y on
the vertical axis negative 30
pixels and then the pasady is zero I'll
copy this just to make your life a
little bit easier and paste it change
this to and this will be 1 and 0 alright
so let's see how that works out
alright cool so it's overlapping right
now simply because we need to do a
little bit of work on getting those
those little icons to show up the
chapped lips so now for - for instance
we'll go ahead and we'll say the
animation oops I can't type or spell
animation is going to be called chapped
lips at 0.5 seconds for this one ease in
out and we'll say a delay of 2.7 seconds
and then for words the opacity is going
to be 0 and the z-index so it stays on
top of the monitor will be 2 and I'm
just going to copy this and paste it in
each of these and this will be let's see
here we're gonna change our aetherium
right here to 1.3 seconds so they're not
gonna all come in at the same time and
the iota one will be 1.7 seconds
nope 1.3 sorry about that
alright so now we have to define chapped
lip so it's copy this oops and paste
this chat blips alright so for this one
we're gonna actually use hi more than
just from in - we're gonna have a
multi-step animation alright so if you
check out angry tools comm /c SS 4 /
animation it's one of the many keyframe
based animation tools for CSS and it
will give you just some ideas so if we
choose at the yeah the sample like
bounce in for instance you'll see it'll
show you what it looks like when it
bounces in we're going to use that one
so to use that one we'll go ahead and
just come down and copy only the
percentage values here and I'm going to
paste those right in here it's good at
save ah
that was terrible one second yeah we
have to make an adjustment real quick we
have to say opacity he's gonna stay at
one right here and I think two of these
have the same yeah sorry about that
let's go ahead in will make aetherium
1.9 and this will be 0.8 there now let's
go ahead and try that again yeah awesome
so you could even take this a step
further and animate the individual
elements inside of this SVG file right
here but we're not going to do that I
think that's a pretty good stopping
point for where I want to be all right
so yeah make sure you know if you
enjoyed this to subscribe here I'm going
to be doing a ton of more tutorials here
in 2018 and also check out corset ro
calm alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
