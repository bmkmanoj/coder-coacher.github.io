course comm and today we have an all new
video for you and an all new topic today
is January 9th and we're going to be
focusing on designing some mobile GUI
graphic user interface or GUI elements
so the first one we're going to start
off with today is going to be rather
complex so we're just going to start and
focus on that one today only and that's
going to be like a radial percentage
loading bar so we're going to use Adobe
Photoshop CC to do this and as always if
you need access to the project files
they're available for free in the
description below this video and also as
always check out design course comm and
put in your email address alright let's
get started let's go to file new and I'm
going to leave this at 8:55 550 and I'm
just going to zoom up here to 100% I'm
going to get rid of these panels now for
the background color let's go ahead and
choose basically color code is three a
three a three a and let's go ahead and
take the ellipse tool and I'm just going
to choose a slightly lighter color and
I'm going to hold shift and drag out
right around there okay so I basically
this is going to be a circular
percentage loading bar so there's any
number of ways we can approach this so
this is just a design that I came up
with so you'll find it's going to be a
lot of copying laters
duplicating layers and a lot of work
with the layer style panel so we'll go
ahead now basically I want this initial
one to be black here so we're going to
change it to black and then we're going
to duplicate it and we're going to be
duplicating a lot of layers so
I would just do this shortcut so hit
ctrl T + Shift + Alt + right around
there select the move tool and hit apply
and this one we're going to make lighter
so we'll get that color but maybe just a
little bit lighter right there alright I
now actually I do want to make this a a
gradient so what I'll do is just double
click on the right side of the layer
bring up great this layer styles choose
gradient overlay and we'll make this one
35 for the angle and then we'll click on
this and we'll choose the first preset
which is always your foreground and
background and I'm going to make this
isn't going to be so white just turn it
down right around there
which is seven six seven six out of six
and then this one is just going to be
slightly darker over here which is for a
for a for a so it's hit okay and then I
also want to put in inner shadow so
we'll select that will just change blend
mode to normal right to capacity 100%
just for now I'm going to take the size
to zero in the distance to one alright
and then I'm going to go ahead and take
the color now if we take this color
right here you want something just just
barely stands out so you'll see a very
slight edge basically where we can see a
highlight alright so now we have that
done I now I want to actually create a
bar in here like the actual loading
portion which is going to be green so to
do that I'm going to go ahead and take
this first layer right here right click
hit duplicate and hit ctrl T and just
scale it in slightly I'm going to say
maybe right around there
it'll apply and for the color we're
going to change it here actually will
change the color will do that
differently what we want to do is a
control shift and for a new layer and we
want this to be a clipping mask we'll
just call this green and then hit OK and
then we take our pen tool make sure
shape is specified and change the color
here to like a lime green and I'm going
to just click outside here at the top
somewhere and then come down here and go
all the way around and connect it and
then hit control H all right then what
I'm going to do I'm going to take this
top layer right here select it without
it select layer or you just click over
here and we're going to double click on
the right side to bring up the layer
styles and I'm going to choose an outer
glow I'm going to change the blend mode
to normal on second this is going
off-screen unfortunately just choose
normal on blend mode and then we'll take
the color down to black and we'll take
the size up now you may want to
experiment with this spread in the size
for now I'm just going to leave it there
okay and then I want to take the this
layer right here and actually no we're
going to choose this layer above
double-click it choose inner shadow
rather inner glow sorry about that
choose normal once again and we'll take
the color here to black
and I think that looks pretty good just
for the time being all right and I also
want to take this layer right here and
give it an inner shadow or maybe a drop
shadow instead yeah a drop shadow we'll
go ahead and select normal take the size
down to zero and the distance to one
opacity up to 100 and then change the
color to something lighter I create
around there so we have this little rim
going around there hit okay and then
okay and with our type tool we'll put in
will save to 65% drag this to the top
control T scale it up to right around
here apply change the color here to
white and I'm going to get rid of the
percentage portion and I'm going to
duplicate that push it over here put
percentage and then select move tool hit
ctrl T shift and scale up right around
there looks good and we take both of
these and move them okay I so then what
I want to do is now this may or may not
be necessary as a design element but I
figure I'll show show you how to do it
anyhow I basically right above this
green layer we're going to create a new
layer and we're going to take the
ellipse tool and we're going to hold
shift into scale right there and then
what we want to do is take the direct
selection tool which is right here and
we're going to change the fill right
here to a gradient and then also radio
will invert that so the white is in the
center and we'll take this color and
make make it just the background right
here
and then also take this top color picker
here and hit zero for the opacity all
right so sit control T just to scale
that up select apply to move hopefully
you can't hear any of my stick children
downstairs dislike barfing up long is
crazy anyhow I then what we want to do
I'm going to go back to that so direct
selection layer click up here we're
going to push this down and then put
another one right here and then for this
middle one we're going to change it just
to like a very light green so it kind of
has now has like a green hint but in the
center it's white hit OK alright and we
can also duplicate this real quick so
duplicate that layer put it above and
then just drop down the intensity just
so it kind of over or casts on to this
rather okay so I now what we could do is
take this background layer just call it
background real quick and create a new
layer ctrl shift n just hit enter and
we'll take the gradient tool left click
and drag out we'll take the background
color and then just choose a slightly
lighter color and then I think that's
okay
just to kind of make it look like a
shadows being cast and then finally if
you wanted to it's not necessary but I
just for showcasing we could take a
color here to block the foreground and
we can select right around here hold
shift and select out
then I'll alt here and left-click and
hold shift take the direct selection
tool take both of those by holding shift
and get it what we want to go right
around here right around here all right
and then we'll move this to the top well
actually now we'll move this let me see
where that's at right there all right
hit ctrl H and then we can right-click
in rasterize that layer bring down the
opacity and take the eraser tool click
1:56 looks like it would work kind of
well and then take the blur tool
and then we could take the eraser tool
again get a larger brush around 280 and
take the opacity down like to halfway
and that way it kind of just fades off
all right yeah I'm not sure if that was
really necessary but I I think that
would be a good place to end already at
11 minutes so I in the next I video for
tomorrow we'll go ahead and add more
interface elements to this design all
right so as always visit design course
calm and please I drop down that
