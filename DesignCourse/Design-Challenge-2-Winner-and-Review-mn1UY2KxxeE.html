calm today I'm going to announce the
winner of the design challenge number
two of flat icon design and also do a
quick review of each of the submissions
alright so if you haven't yet check out
design course calm and subscribe here at
YouTube ok so let's go ahead and go over
the requirements real quick just before
we look at the entry so 256 x 256 falta
needs to be flat design display all
three icons in the same reply and
basically if we come down here we'll see
the criteria design consistency the
versatility so is it simple enough to be
seen and understood at smaller icon
sizes executional flat design and good
icon design aesthetics alright so let me
come down here and our first entry is
from the design prodigy and i do like
the colors there's contrast which is
good so you have this kind of this
pinkish type of five color although it's
not real saturated and then the white on
top that creates for good contrast
that's good the second thing in terms of
simplicity these are also good I don't
see any issue with you know scaling them
down a lot and then being able to
decipher what they are I would say my
only criticism which is kind of minor
it's just there's not a lot of white
space i would say between the containing
element of the icon and the actual icon
design itself so over here there's not
much white space there's not much margin
but not that big of a deal so all right
so we'll come down here to matrix and i
would save right off the bat it would
probably get rid of this drop shadow
type of this hard drop shadow i would
say type of element i would say it's
kind of a needed I and then secondly
when it comes to
you let take this calendar icon for
example when it comes to the real thin
lines you usually run into an issue when
your scale down so if I right click and
copy image go into Photoshop get a new
document out here paste that in and
we'll scale it down say to an actual
size although this is probably be even
larger than would be used on a website
for example you'll see that they become
a little bit hard to distinguish when
you scale them down a lot so we could
see over here you did use thicker
strokes and lines so you could still
basically see the the general idea and
the shape but over here becomes a lot
difficult so that's just something to
remember when you're designing icons try
to stay away from the real thin lines
like this and also design consistent
because death design consistency will
see that you know over here use thicker
lines which is good over here not so
much so there's not much consistency i
would say in terms of you know just this
one over here these two are definitely
better because the thicker all right so
just let's move on to the second one
here and i'm not going to try to
pronounce that i totally just go see man
up here so all right so over here on
this one i would say a big the biggest
issue that points that pops out to me is
contrast or the lack thereof so over
here like this calendar icon i it's it's
blue on blue basically and i know this
is a little bit darker but it's still a
little bit difficult to distinguish even
at a larger size like this so if we copy
this and we go into photoshop we scaled
that down to like an actual size it
might be used on on a web site becomes
pretty difficult to see you know what
exactly is going on here because almost
all the elements with exception to the
two top rings are blue
alright and i would say maybe probably
the same thing almost for this as well
there's not a lot of contrast in I
between this blue and this orange
because this is a lighter blue this is
also a lighter orange and so they're
kind of creates a little bit of a clash
that's why a lot of people just use
white because that's that will provide
for the most contrast for most colors
all right pretty same thing to say with
this sigh the green over here as well
now the blue definitely sticks out and
contrast even though they're both blue
but this is almost almost like a black
of us so that will work all right all
right over here I really like these I I
just have do have one scrap discrepancy
which is what I was talking about up
here and that's I the contrast is not
too much over here I this blue with this
type of yellowish color there and
they're almost they're very similar the
only thing you're changing is just the
color so the contrast isn't too much
same thing over here although this is a
minor I mean this is this is not white
you can see this isn't white I they
could probably definitely improved just
by being white and you that way you can
see them better but that's just a minor
criticism because I do like everything
else with these oops with these icons so
you can still tell it's a shopping cart
edit and a calendar so that's good so as
we could see there's a lot of I there's
a lot of white space around there
between the containing element and the
icon I I probably would save like
another minor one maybe get rid of some
of these if I don't need so many because
that's smaller sizes you would see that
it becomes like a blur almost but that's
just a minor you know these are good
otherwise all right let's come down here
we've got a different type of container
which is completely fine again we bridge
the issue with contrast over here with
this green and blue kind of
makes it hard to decipher where the icon
begins especially when you're going to
be at smaller sizes also not much white
space between the icon and the
containing element I yeah otherwise you
know I like the design of this this does
almost stick out enough this yellow this
pencil and yeah so continue on all right
same thing here with the not a lot of
white space so I would say it would be
worth scaling the actual icons down a
little bit the actual designs contrast
it works out very well you know because
we just have a simple I darker sort of
orange and then a complete white I
design on top of it so that works just
another minor issue just some tiny
nitpicking things I guess you could call
them you know when it comes to the
stroke or the negative space that's
right here we can see that's not the
same thing right here it's kind of like
goes right into it and yeah otherwise it
good I'm going to go them here too and
ooh now this one has a lot of white
space we can see that you know between
the containing element I it fits well
and over here another issue with the
contrast I would say this pencil could
be lighter or the background be a little
bit darker but yeah pretty much pretty
good I mean you'll be able to tell what
these are at smaller sizes so that's
good all right and all over I one thing
that kind of threw me off right away is
like the app the calendar icon is just
kind of stuck up at the top and not
centered not a big deal though another
issue I would say I for these two you
know this is these are real I alluded
this to one of the first one so this is
I the white here is real thin and then
adding a 1 pixel stroke on top of it
makes it kind of difficult to see if you
were to scale that down i would say so
if we took that one to scale it down
it almost becomes indistinguishable so
yeah just something to know i mean the
fix obviously is making a thicker so and
then maybe the same thing with in here
although not so much because you could
see like a like the background and a 1
pixel manner and back there so when it
comes to the scaling it down those type
of things kind of get lost and blurred
out all right otherwise good all right
and then we have psyops over here and
one thing I notice right away you know
when you have a lot of detail like this
like these tiny thin lines and also he
went through the work of putting all the
actual numbers in I you know add a
larger icon size that's fine but if you
were to use the same one and scale that
thing down all the numbers would get
lost and it would just become blurry it
would take away from the overall icon
for the most part in my opinion all
right and I would also say some contrast
issues like the top bar up here you know
this gray and they're kind of don't
stick out as much as it could all right
I'm going to move on in an to all right
so this is the second entry this is
similar to one of the ones he showed let
me find that up here so I think he
increased the size basically let me see
here yeah which is fine I it still has a
decent enough white space between the
containing element and the icon all
right Oliver and we looked at one of his
before and he got rid of the stroke
which is a good thing I still say
probably the stroke the recall the
weight of this line these lines can be
increased for sure I but yeah it's
definitely an improvement from the
previous all right and sauron we have
over here I like the icons just looking
on right off the bat there I there's no
contrast issue so everything kind of
contrasts
we have I the the white space between
there is good I right click and copy
those so we can see that they probably
scale down well there might be an issue
here because there's a lot of lines at
the bigger version so if I scale that
down you could still generally see
what's going on though right tons er we
have I i would say kind of some like for
this one here in the middle this real
light yellow that creates an issue of
contrast between white backgrounds
obviously so you can't really see a
defined shape almost I in terms of the
white space that's good nothing's really
getting too close to the edges or
anything so that's definitely good the
design and simplicity of each icon is
good this might be a little bit too thin
on this bottom portion but that's being
nitpicky the shadow there's a very faint
shadow here and it's kind of working
opposite of how a shadow would work you
would think because it's actually
lighter than the this background
containing element I think an
improvement I mean again this is kind of
nitpicky but an improvement would be to
make it darker the shadow so you can
kind of see that it's an actual shadow
and not like a glow otherwise that's
pretty good and everything's pretty
simple and then we just have one final
one down here and that's from Oliver and
I like this because that they work
really well at this size for sure so if
we were to take this of course and go
into Photoshop and just scale it down
real quick leaf like it you know trying
to get out of sight at a size that we'd
actually be used on a website maybe like
this you would see kind of like a blur
now designing specific like for example
if you were to take an icon set and
design these real intricate lines that
work well at these very large sizes
that's fine as long as you were to also
design redesign it basically for it to
work in the smaller icon so that would
mean having to get rid of a lot of these
lines may be thick picking some things
up and just make everything very simple
so just having a simple outline along
here of the pencil making it thicker you
know getting rid of all these lines in
the middle and getting rid of a lot of
these that would be fine I but that of
course creates a lot of work nothing
wrong with that I but of course we
wanted for this contest we wanted to be
versatile I like the designs as they
stand right here but all right so I
basically out of all these I would say
that if it came to sorry but kids
outside my door being loud I had to
pause for a bit I out of all of these i
would say i know i think i was going to
choose this one because it has a lot of
I a lot of contrast which is great it's
simple a lot of white space I but you
know I brought into Photoshop and the
size of this portion is not 256 and I
know that's being nitpicky but as a
requirement I kind of have to stick to
that because i know people we get all
pissed off probably hopefully they want
it i don't know i but what I think he
was probably going for it part is 256
because he included these I the shadow
things which I would say generally
probably want to stay away from with
because then it's not very versatile on
people wouldn't want to use it as an
icon sat at least I but yeah so if I'm
going up here this is a close contender
I would say this party even more so it's
the same one except he scaled it up a
little bit larger but I think it still
works maybe somewhere in between those
two is a good size between the white
space but still we have the issue kind
of you know the contrast just issue it's
not a big deal but I just to be just a
critique it in a sense and then we have
this one over here I would say we
compared these two
this and that I definitely like the
design for example like this shopping
cart better than this one but these two
are very close there is slight contrast
issues with both of them but I do like
the overall design a little bit better
than this one so that's why I'm going to
name Maddy the winner of this week's
challenge alright so if you didn't win
listen a lot of these we're very close I
almost want to stop having to pick a
winner and just stick with I just doing
to critique just to help people because
it is difficult when a lot of them are
similar I so yeah alright so i will do a
third design challenge soon not exactly
sure when party and a few days i'll
announce that if you want to throw out
some ideas i probably want to stay away
from doing like a full website design
because that just becomes a huge amount
of work for everybody and we probably
wouldn't get many submissions due to
time constraints so you know if you have
an idea that's something that is
relatively you know quick I you could
throw that out there my part I think I
have a few ideas of my own anyhow so i
will announce that soon alright so
hopefully you guys learned something um
and yeah i will see you guys tomorrow
with a new design video all right
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
