letter and design course comm in this
tutorial we're going to take a look at
one tool in one tool only and that is
the pen tool and let's go ahead and just
get started right now go to file new and
I have a set of 800 by 500 you can use
the same if you want otherwise if you
have a bigger desktop resolution than me
because I'm doing a small just so you
guys can see most of everything I you
can just set that at a higher pixel
count so it's setting me at 66.7% if
that is doing the same for you just take
the magnifying glass tool click once and
that brings us to 100 you may have to
click twice though depending on what
your resolution is so let's go ahead and
get started let's I click on our
foreground color and change it to black
hit OK and with the pen tool select and
make sure up here it says shape layers
on which is selected the other ones
paths okay so with shape layer selected
let's I just real quickly overview how
the pen tool works we can create lines
like this just by left-clicking and you
can see it begins to fill in whatever we
want to do very easy alright so let's go
back and ctrl Z then ctrl alt Z a bunch
of times to go back to the beginning
alright so we can create straight lines
very easily i we want to create curved
lines we can do that with tangents and
the way you do that let's just click
right here drag this time and do not
click and let go so if we drag out we
can see it really you can create any
type of curve we want and then you can
see I'm this line right here will affect
wherever we put the next point now we
can go back and actually edit these as
well by holding alt and then just
clicking them and as you can see we can
really change it in any direction that
we wish
so that
how for the most part the pen tool works
so I'm going to get straight into i
creating a really cool looking tattoo
and we'll see that we can get it done
very quickly i so let's get started go
ahead and just try to follow along as
best as you can so let's click right
here then hold shift and click right
here that creates a perfect line that
forces a perfect line we can also do
that for vertical and 45-degree angles
now while still i'm holding the mouse
button we're going to drag up and then
come right around here we want the same
distance apart and then hold shift and
there we go just click once now let's
click right here and drag out and then
fix finish it there now as you can see
it's kind of overlapping it went too far
that tangent that was affected there
alright so the way we can fix lines well
after we've already closed the shape
let's click right here to get rid of
that on the path from showing now let's
click right here we have two different
tools you drag out and click we have
direct selection tool well if we click
right here we can see these tangents so
just click and hold and now we brought
it in so that it doesn't I overlap
anymore so let's take our move tool
let's right click over here in the shape
hit duplicate layer hit OK we're going
to move it up right click duplicate
again because we're going to create a
third one get rid of the paths and let's
move it up now if you need more fine
control just use your arrow keys and
that I will fix it okay so now we have
this cool-looking design here I what
else can we add well really that's a
part of creativity you can add anything
you want but right now I'm just doing
this to show you what the pen tool can
do so let's click right here with the
pen tool and then right around here and
then create like a like an arc over
these three designs that we created
now hold the Alt key and click right on
the last anchor point that will get rid
any tangent affecting the next point so
let's go back to the first point close
it up and drag and there we go
I let's go ahead duplicate that by
right-clicking duplicate layer hit OK
now let's take the bottom one the very
first one and change it to white now you
just do you just double click er and
then change the color now let's go to
the move tool and use our arrow keys get
down and left a few times creates like a
little shadow there now let's take these
two layers you can select them by
holding ctrl right click duplicate
layers hit OK ctrl T hold shift and drag
out to create like a bigger one right
here just above it select move tool hit
apply now we're going to select the
original two these ones right here do
the same exact thing we're going to
duplicate it again duplicate layer hit
OK now let's move them above now all
three of them are kind of low just I
want to readjust them a little bit so
select the top layer hold shift and then
select the bottom layer for these three
that we created and just move them up
alright so so far we have a pretty
cool-looking design but we can add a
little bit more to it so I'm going to
zoom in right around here with the
magnifying glass tool and just drag out
go back to our pen tool click right
around here and then right around here
and drag hold the Alt key then select
the anchor point once and then come back
to the original point and drag out and
create something like that now let's go
back over here and do the same thing pen
tool select here hold here drag out hold
the Alt key click the anchor point come
back to the original drag out end it
right there right-click actual pixels
and there we go if you want to move it
more just like move tool use your arrow
key alright I let's do one more the one
over here just for the fun of it let's
change the color up here to white and
let's select right around here
drag out right here in the middle of
this part try to make it follow the same
path and then just click right here
alright and then do the same thing let's
move this over to the bottom one which
is the opposite area I'll click bring it
back drag and there we go
right click actual pixels and there we
go we have a really cool looking eye
design here and the possibilities are
obviously endless with this real quickly
to show you something else say for
example you wanted to do your signature
well this is where this tool would come
in which is the path tool let's create a
new layer new layer hit OK and let's
make sure we have black selected for a
foreground now the difference with this
tool is that you see it doesn't really
fill in anything it's just the path
alone
nothing gets filled in very important to
remember that let me go back here now
let me do let's just try to do our
signature this is a real good way to get
familiar with the pen tool my name is
Gary so I'm just going to do Gary real
quick
there we go now if I right click go to
stroke path use the brush hit okay right
click and then delete the path guess
what we have our signature so that's how
the path tool kind of works and you can
do other things with the path tool as
well which I will get into in future
tutorials I'm going to go ahead delete
that layer and there we go this is our
tattoo I'm like I said possibilities are
endless and I that is it go ahead and
check out design course comm you'll see
a promo video at the end of this and if
you think this tutorials cool you'll see
some really awesome tutorials that will
show you full website design and logo
design all right talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
