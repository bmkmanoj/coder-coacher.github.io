today we're going to focus on the third
portion of our photo manipulation
tutorial so if you need access to any of
the resource files check the description
below this video check out design course
calm if you haven't yet subscribe here
on YouTube let's get started alright so
let's continue on here I'm going to just
make sure you save everything and so now
what I want to do is I want to add
another group of individuals because
neither of these two groups are holding
a flag which is kind of important for
the purpose of the actual I poster so
I'm going to use this one right here and
the large 1024 will work right click
copy image come up here and paste that
in and again i'm not using any specific
group of soldiers or nationality I'm
just finding one ones that I seem like
they'll work well with the scene
and I'm just going to keep on going on
this one I'm not going to really bother
pausing you can just fast-forward real
quick if you need to because you already
know how to do this I I'm not going to
include that stick thing whatever that
is all right again I'm not trying to be
perfect just about done right click make
selection hit ok control shift I copy
ctrl D delete and ctrl-v to paste ctrl T
will scale that down we'll put it right
around here hit the move tool alright so
image adjustments desaturate and then we
will name this soldiers 3 and we will
give it an adjustment layer of course at
with brightness and contrast make sure
it's only selecting are affecting that
layer let me give this a levels as well
so come over here hit levels and let me
now i'm just playing around with it just
to see all right I think that's good and
then again we have to add control shift
n for a new highlight layer alright so
we'll zoom up and let's see we'll take
the brush tool and we'll make this
overlay
and then we'll come in about six and go
around each individual here inside of
their arms
this is just a great way to make things
look a little bit realistic as if
they're in the actual image
all right and I'm not going I don't want
to make this look like I'm trying to
target a specific country so i'm going
to get rid of the actual flag design so
we'll go ahead i think the the way i
want to do this is let's see here we'll
take it and take the hmm yeah we'll try
the clone stamp tool so we'll take the
size down try 13 oops so all I'm doing
so am i holding alt left-clicking and
then moving this over
I'm going to take the size down a little
bit
um all right let me hit control John
just to see what this looks like all
right I let's see I'm going to hmm it's
a little bit blurry around the edges
here so like what i can do is take the
path actually i'm back up cut that part
out right click make selection hit OK
control shift I delete all right that's
better and I'm just going to add an idea
one thing I can do underneath the
highlight layer ctrl shift n make
another layer take the brush tool we're
going to use a blood-spatter brush and
the size needs to go down quite a bit
yeah like that blood-soaked flag okay
cool alright so now what I want to do is
take the yeah we'll take our flag layer
and we have to add highlights to these
as well so ctrl shift n create a
clipping mask I'm not even bothering
with renaming things right now I kind of
want to move along make sure it's a not
luminosity I'm sorry overlay okay flag
to select above on the layer adjustment
layer rather right that's over here
sorry make it overlay
same thing with like three which is
right there ctrl shift n I hit tab in
space real quick to select the actual
adjustment layer I mean clipping masks
sorry and then do the same thing with
our flag for ctrl shift n tab space and
enter and we will make this overlay
nice ok so this zoom out here just to
see what what's going on may want to
adjust move these a little bit around a
little bit more so take those three push
this over take this ok and to make it
look a little bit more realistic we can
add a shadow underneath one each one so
just underneath the flag one layer ctrl
shift n hit enter and we will take our
brush tool right around that size will
choose black for a foreground left click
once ctrl T alt and scale it down that
way it looks like there's a brief
basically shadow underneath that and
what I'll do is duplicate that later so
right click and hit duplicate layer on
the actual layer or set up a hawk or
shortcut like I did which is ctrl shift
D go to edit preferences and set those
up if you wish and I'll move this over
there duplicate again oops I just just
now I've selected something by accident
unselect auto select or deselect it
rather right around there and then
finally duplicate one more time and put
it over here alright so let me zoom up
to see how that kind of looks some of it
may need you can take the opacity down
on some of them so
alright that looks pretty good alright
so I'm going to zoom out alright so
we're ready to actually put in I the
main kind of focus on on this image so
that image is right here so I'm going to
use the 1024 version right click copy
image go up here paste it and once again
you guessed it we got to cut them out
alright so I i will speed this up so i'm
going to speed this up right now you
already know how to do this
you
all right and right click make selection
hit okay control shift I control see the
copy and ctrl D to deselect and then hit
the Delete key and paste that in all
right ctrl T hold shift and alt
right around there looks good for the
size and location and all right so image
adjustments desaturate and we will also
add a brightness and contrast make sure
it only affects that layer alright and
yeah right around the looks pretty good
alright so now what I want to do is hit
I actually I don't like into this
portion real quick I want to clean that
up so I'll take this just select around
it make selection control die and
delete oh wait wrong one I'm screwing
this up that's why yeah control shift
thought I was on a long wrong layer
that's why that wasn't working alright
that looks a little bit better and then
what I want to do is create a new layer
on the top make it a clipping mask we're
going to add our highlight so we're
going to choose red I don't go and fast
but you've already done this thing you
got back you have a group of it already
hopefully and make sure it's i overlay
all right just like that roughly all
right and I now what I want to also do
is add some more of those those fire
things I guess keeps a home blood / fire
or whatever I'm going to call that fire
hi I don't know why now I'm starting to
rhyme okay so big the brush tool and I'm
going to experiment with some of these
just see what might work best
alright so what I did is just click it a
few times to fill it in a little bit
more there's some a pacity with that
brush I'm going to hit control scaling
it down a little bit it's like move till
it apply I'm going to delete or a race
rather with a hard brush make sure
opacity is a hundred percent
alright as if it's about to like consume
him or something alright I ok so now
what I want to do is just look and see
if there's other areas that i can
improve so this cloud appear that is
cloud 2 i'm going to take the eraser
tool downs like 75 loops we want it to
be a soft brush so hard is 0 and take
clouds one
alright that looks pretty good so far I
this I don't like where his legs are
like kind of overlapping that flag so
bring this back all right and I'm going
to take these soldiers hmm let me see
I'm gonna try experimenting with this
pacity what I want to do actually I
think I want to take the background
layer that we fir tisha Lee created I
want to make that black I think just to
see yeah maybe not entirely what i can
do is create a new layer so i just i
undid that and hit enter control shift
then enter and then make that black
bring down the opacity where i want it
get these soldiers over here i thought
it's like layer make sure we're on the
actual layer right there alright so if
you have a smart filter applied and I'm
going to keep that we go to right-click
and let me see here and just hit
rasterize that applies it just kind of
get rid of the feet area I do also want
to keep things consistent will take
soldiers three convert that to smart
object go to filter and Gaussian blur at
point three alright alright that is
pretty good so far all right so I
actually one more adjustment beneath him
I'm just going to call this help
beneath that layer ctrl shift and Hannah
take the brush tool will make it a
feather brush 114 looks good click right
underneath him ctrl t hold alt you can
rotate it slightly so it looks like
there's a shadow underneath him alright
that's good alright so that's a good
place to stop I think and then tomorrow
we're going to finish this up alright so
if you haven't yet check out design
course calm scribe here on YouTube all
right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
