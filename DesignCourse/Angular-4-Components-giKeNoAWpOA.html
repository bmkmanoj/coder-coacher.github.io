likely spend the bulk of your time when
developing your app angular 4 components
are simply classes that are designated
as a component with the help of a
component decorator so every component
has a defined template which can
communicate with the code that's defined
in the component class so let's take a
closer look at how components are
structured but first we want to get a
project set up so that you can follow
along with this so we want to make sure
that the angular command-line interface
or the CLI is installed so at the
command line or your console you want to
type in ng - B and this will give you
the current version of your command-line
interface if you have it installed now
if it's not you're going to go ahead and
need to install that now in the previous
lesson as a part of this free course I
already showed you how to do that so if
you're arriving at this tutorial without
having to watch that first video go
ahead in this course and go back ok so
let's go ahead now and with the angular
CLI let's start a new project so to do
that we're going to type ng new and I'll
just call this components 101 all right
so I'll pause this while it installs all
right it is done so we want to go ahead
and open up the project in our code
editor and I'm using Visual Studio code
and the first thing we want to do is
look at the component that the CLI
generates by default so in source app
we'll see app component TS all right so
basically the way the angular 4
component is structured it's structured
into three different sections so let me
just go ahead and get rid of real quick
the side bar and I'll increase the size
of this just slightly and the three
different sections that are find
that you see here that are currently
outlined we'll see we're going to start
with the very top one which are the
imports so the way you make a Class A
component is by importing the component
member from the angular core library now
some components may have dozens of
imports based on the needs of that
component so this is also where you
import any services that your component
may use through dependency injection
which we'll get to a little bit later so
second we have the component decorator
and basically we make something a
decorator by adding the @ symbol and we
can see in this case it's at component
and we can see that's also in reference
to the import statement so we're using
component that was imported from the
above import line this is what makes
this given class a component so within
the component you have a variety of
configuration properties to help define
this giving component so the first
property you see we have selector this
is the name of the tag that the
component is applied to so for instance
if we go to the index.html we'll see we
have app root this is what it's
referring to right there so let's go
back to our class here a component and
we also have template URL and style URLs
and this defines an HTML template in
style seat sheets associated with this
component now you can also change these
to template in styles which define
inline HTML and CSS which we'll get to
you later
in the course so there are other
properties that you can define inside of
this component decorator depending on
the needs of your component so it's also
where you define animations and then
finally right here we have our component
class so this is where the various
properties and methods are defined any
properties and methods that are defined
here are also accessible from the
template and likewise events that occur
in the template are accessible within
the component through different data
binding
and we'll get to that later as well so
it's also where dependency injection
occurs within a constructor which gives
you access to various services and we'll
see that constructor and how the CLI
generates that for us automatically
momentarily when we use it to generate
our own component so let's go ahead and
do that now with the help of the
command-line interface tool so I'm going
to go back here let me clear this real
quickly
all right let's CD into the project that
we created which is CD components 101
alright and then let's go ahead and
generate the actual component so to do
that we invoke the CLI with ng and then
G or we could specify generate it
doesn't really matter G is just
shorthand for generate and then what
exactly is it that we want to generate
well in this case it's a component and
then the name of the come out component
so it would be my new component alright
so it's very quick and you can see that
it is generated for different files so
let's go back to our editor and take a
look at those so we can see now here in
our source app folder we have the name
of the component that we just generated
so you can see we have a CSS file which
is blank we have the template file which
is HTML we have our component file right
here and then we also have a spec ts
file and that is used for unit testing
ok so also what happens when we generate
a new component aside from it generating
this folder and these four files right
here well the other area that it affects
is in your app module ts file and it
does two different things here so first
it imports it and we can see it in this
line right here and then second it also
adds it to declarations and we can see
our app component is there as well as
well as the name of the my new component
component now of course it looks a
little bit redundant simply because name
gave it so let's examine real quickly
how we can use this component and nest
it into the default app component ts
that we have already so if a control B
we can take a look at my new component
here and we could see the HTML that's
associated with it my new component
works I'm just going to change this rule
quickly - I've been inserted we'll save
that okay and then also if we look at
the app component ts right here or the
my new component rather we'll see that
we have a selector called app my new
component right here all right so let's
copy that we're going to go to the
default app - component TS right here
and we notice that the h2 the template
URL is - app that component - HTML right
underneath the title let's go ahead and
add a selector for that so what we'll do
and we'll save that just like that we'll
go back to the console and I'm going to
type ng serve and once it's complete you
can visit localhost 4200 on your browser
and you can see I've been inserted so
really we have two different components
taken place right here which is default
app component DES and then be my new
component right here and that in a
nutshell is how components work now of
course there's a little bit more to them
once you get more indeed in-depth in
detail but that is the basic
fundamentals of components so now that
you understand components we're going to
take a closer look at templating in
angular 4 in the next lesson see you
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
