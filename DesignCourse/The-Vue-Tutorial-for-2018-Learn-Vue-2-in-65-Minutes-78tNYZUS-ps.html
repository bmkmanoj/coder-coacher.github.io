hey everyone Garry Simon of course etro
here and today we have a good one for
you I've been working on is quite a
while and this is going to be a crash
course for view js2 and you're going to
learn pretty much all of the core
concepts and so this is definitely very
much a beginners course we're not going
to get in depth into any one specific
area but we're gonna cover all the
pertinent topics and also do so in an
example format because we're going to
create an app in doing so alright so let
me just show you that app real quickly
and this is the app obviously very
simple kind of just like a your typical
kind of a to-do type of list app but it
has a different unique it says enter a
skill that you have whatever all right
so first I without using it so far we
can see that I you know we're gonna be
handling basic templating and covering
interpolation and stuff like that also
iterating over arrays kind of like how
we are we're also going to cover CSS and
more specifically class and style
binding here in view and then also we're
gonna handle form input so if we put in
something like des I for instance will
see that this little form validation
comes up so we're going to be covering
form submission in validation as well if
I just put Dez I put diz in design fully
we'll see that goes away we can now hit
enter and it will submit it we have
animation occurring I we have enter and
leave animation so if I get rid of this
we can see we have a unique animation
occurring we're going to show you how to
tie that in with other animation
libraries also we're going to cover
routing so yeah we can go to different
pages and I have a URL parameter here
that we're showing in a template so I'm
gonna show you how to do all this basic
stuff and yes while it is very simple
you're really going to gain a lot
especially in a very short relatively
speaking amount of time alright so in
this tutorial right here in this lesson
we're gonna talk about the obvious how
to install view Jas and so we're going
to cover three different ways
so the first way is going to be using a
CDN which is very quick and easy to get
up up and running with the second way
will be to use NPM to install it with an
existing project that you might have and
then the third and final way that we're
going to use for our project is using
the view CLI or command-line interface
so let's go ahead and get started
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it so the first thing
oh by the way that's wanted to mention
every video lesson here also has a full
written version so you can find that
here into the description and then you
can just you know if you need to grab
code or whatever you can do that there
as well alright so the first method that
we're going to use here I is just
basically using a CDN version so open up
your command line or console and I'm
going to create a new folder for this so
make der view CDN and then we're also
going to put double ampersand to CD view
and then CDN so I'm just gonna create it
and then hop into it
alright so now I'm just going to type in
code in a period and that will open up
visual studio code that's the code
editor I use you can download then
install it for free if you wish it's
from Microsoft and then you have access
to that console command so now we're
just going to create an index.html file
by the way you don't have to follow this
if you're not going to use this method
if you're just interested in jumping
into with the method we're gonna use you
can fast forward to this video where I
start to cover the the view CLI all
right but for now this boilerplate code
that I have that I'm about to use you
could just hit exclamation point and
enter and also in the written version I
do have a link here for the script that
we're going to use so if you want to use
the CD
version always to do is just paste this
right here take control B to get rid of
that sidebar I and we can see we have
script source and this is how we're
including view J s right here and that's
from a CDN or a content delivery network
it's basically one of the fastest ways
of getting up and running with a project
with view J s so I if we save this now
and I hit control B to get the sidebar
right click and reveal an Explorer real
quickly and I double click on this let
me get this out over here and I hit ctrl
shift I here on Chrome will see in the
console it says download view dev tools
extension for a better develop
experience you are running view in
development mode so yes we have view up
and running and ready to go already
alright so I just to demonstrate how I
even to the fact that this actually is a
view app I we can go back to the console
alright
control B here and what we can do is
just underneath our script right here we
can have another script and inside of
this we can actually construct our view
app and one quick way of doing this
let me just died because we're not going
to be using this method
I just want I'm just going to copy and
paste from the written version all right
and so you'll understand what this stuff
means in a little bit but I'm just gonna
paste this here and then also at the top
we're gonna add a div and right here is
interpolation and by the way if you
don't know what this means don't worry
I'm going to be covering that but we're
using interpolation to show a property
called message the message is defined
down here say is hello view so if we
save this and we go back and we go -
oops I have the wrong area up there we
go we refresh this says hello view right
there that way we know this is an actual
view js2 app alright so that's how you
get up and running with an actual CDN
we're not going to do that though it's
not as dynamic and flexible of a way to
to actually use view so
the next method to use view Jas I'm not
even going to cover it instead what I'm
going to do is just show the written
version of this tutorial and this is
under the section of installing view
through NPM alright so basically you
know you can use it to install view
within either a new or existing project
all right so one of the first steps you
need you have to make sure you have no
js' installed along with the NPM and
then we could make a directory just like
we did before and then we would run NPM
in it why to create a package.json file
if you don't already have one and then
we would use NPM install view and then
save it as a dev dependency by the way
you can also use the yarn package
manager if you're used to using that
alright so then at this point you would
create an index.html file with the same
exact contents as a CDN example above
except you would change the script
source to node modules view dist and
then view Jas
because NPM installs it locally so you
wouldn't be using a CDN alright so I
we're not doing that method the way
we're gonna get our project up and
running up it with is the view CLI
alright so that's what we're gonna do
now so the first thing we need to make
sure we actually have the view CLI
up and running let me close this out
here so to do that I want to go back to
my console I'm gonna get out of there
and what you would run is NPM install
and by the way if you have you want to
check to make sure you have your NPM by
put running NPM - V if not make sure you
install node.js from nodejs org alright
so NPM install global that's the hype
and G we're gonna say at view forward
slash CLI hit enter and that will
install I'm not gonna install it because
I already have it installed it'll take
maybe about a minute or 30 seconds
alright once you have it installed and
it's ready to go if you encounter any of
errors of course make sure I you
obviously go in google it to fix it and
once it's ready view create and then
name of the project we'll just call this
view skills
all right so hit enter and now it's
gonna take well usually in I'm used to
other CL eyes and installing quickly now
first it's going to give you a prompt
please pick a preset and you can use
your arrow keys to choose whichever this
is just a default version where it will
include just some minimal options or you
can choose manually select features
we're not going to manually select the
features that include stuff like you
know the sass pre-processing the view
router and there's several other ones
but for now we're just gonna choose
default alright so at this point then
it's gonna take a little bit of time to
get up and running it's usually about
thirty seconds or so and I will come
back when that's done alright great so
now it's done we can see here at the
very bottom it tells you go ahead and CD
the project name and then yarn serve
okay because it's gonna use yarn so CD
view skills yarn serve alright alright
so now we can go ahead to this localhost
I already have one running so that's why
it's at 8:08 one instead of eight zero
eight zero yours will probably be eight
zero eight zero so just go ahead and
copy that and then you can open up a new
browser window here did I really just
copy eight localhost:8080 and it's all
ready and set up alright so we're gonna
continue on by learning about view
components in the next section view
components are the basic building blocks
of your view app it's where you have
three different things you have your
templating you have your logic and you
also have your styling so to show you
more specifically what I'm talkin about
let's go back to our code editor make
sure you have our new project opened up
and in the view skills folder and this
is what you're going to see alright so
all so most of our time will definitely
be spent in this source folder right
here and so the view command-line
interface or CLI
it generates all these files for us and
we want to look at app dot view
okay so there's three things happening
here and really just to demonstrate
what's happening I'm going to get rid
you don't have to do this just of the
stuff that was inside of these three
elements here first we have the template
this is where all of our HTML will
reside and there's also other stuff that
goes there like view directives and also
view component wrappers and we'll get
into that we also have this script
section and this is where the logic of
our app resides and then also this style
section this is where the CSS is placed
down here all right so it's obviously
structured in a very simple and
understandable way for you to use all
right so let me back up real quickly
here all right so let's talk about
importing other components because if we
go back and we look at the actual
starter project we'll see we just have
you know one block of HTML for this UI
here well if we look real quickly in
this side section right here we have
this custom HTML element that doesn't
exist in normal HTML but it's called
hello world and we're also seeing this
msg equals and then some value here what
that actually is is that's importing
another component which resides in this
components folder called hello world I
the way that works is first we reference
the name of the component here as a
custom element in the template section
and then in a script section we see we
can import hello world from and then the
path to it alright and then we can also
see I under components we have hello
world that's referenced now let's look
at hello world of dot view itself and by
the way we notice that this is a pew and
this is hello world dot view so the dot
view extension denotes the fact that we
are working with a I it's called a
single file component alright so looking
at this hello world dot view file here
we could see it looks very similar to
the structure of the app dot view
because we can see we have
a template section albeit there's a lot
of it here and then we also have a
script section with some logic and then
also a style set the section so for our
purposes we're going to be creating this
this app that allows you to specify your
skills so let's go ahead and rename this
file first to better accommodate our
needs so rename we're just going to call
this skills all right so let's also here
and the script section of the logic set
your section rename this to skills right
and the props we don't need anything in
there that's short for properties we'll
cover that in a little bit and then also
let's adjust the entire template section
we're gonna get rid of actually
everything with exception to do the
first div and the template and we're
just gonna for now just say skills we're
gonna save that and then we're gonna go
back to our app dot view and we have to
rename this from hello world to skills
as well as the name of the file and then
right here will say skills and then
finally up here remember we have to
reference the actual name so it is
skills and we're not going to be passing
along any data all right so just like
that so also we don't need this logo so
let's save and now it's gonna look quite
different we simply have skills right
there so that is the basic I you know a
demonstration of what a component is and
so again at the most basic level a
component is consists of three different
things like I mentioned our template our
script or a logic of our component and
the styles alright so in the next lesson
we're gonna go ahead and take a look at
template encase oh we're going to take a
look at view templating and in the
templates section again you're able to
specify HTML view interpolation as well
as view directives so let's go ahead
give that a more specific look so let's
open up source our components and our
skills dot view file all right so the
first thing we're going to cover is
interpolation so the main the most basic
form of view interpolation is called
text interpolation and it's simply the
process of displaying a string that's
defined in your component logic
somewhere right here all right so let's
go ahead and define a property and we're
gonna call it name so let's go ahead and
get rid of this right here we're going
to put in data and then we're going to
open it up in squiggly braces we're
going to return and this is where we can
put our properties and you can think of
them like variables so we're gonna say
name and we put a colon and then the
value course set row all right you can
put whatever name of course that you
want here all right so now to display
this in the templates section up here we
have to use what are called
interpolation squiggly braces as I call
them so or a lot of people call them
mustaches you put two of them and we're
going to put in the name of the property
so this is simply name very dead simple
stuff we save this then we'll see it
says course set row hooray okay so let's
also talk about then interpolation in
HTML attributes for example if you have
like an image source equals that would
be an attribute this is an attribute
here so one important thing to note is
that you can't use these interpolation
braces within view within attributes all
right so to demonstrate how this
actually works let's create a boolean
property and set the disabled attribute
of a button based on this property so
let's go ahead and I'm going to put in
just underneath here a button and we're
going to say V on and then we'll say
click now V on and we're going to get in
more in-depth into what exactly V - all
this stuff is is
it's basically a directive right here
and saying on click so when somebody
clicks this button then we're going to
call a custom method called change name
all right we'll define that shortly and
then we're also going to have another
view directive called V bind and we'll
say disabled so this is an attribute
that's in normal button HTML we'll say
BTN States so we don't do this
that won't work we're just going to put
in the actual property button state all
right so then just give it some text
here and then close out that button so
then in the logic what we want to do is
create that boolean value
BTN state so we simply put right there a
comma
BTN state and we'll said it's true in
other words disabled will equal true
based on this value right here of true
so it's going to be disabled so let's go
ahead and save this and we'll open this
up now we can't click it because it is
disabled all right so that's how
interpolation in attributes work so
let's also talk about expressions in
interpolation so right now we're just
displaying a single name up here let's
add one where we're going to demonstrate
the fact that you can put in JavaScript
expressions within these interpolation
braces so for instance we can use a
ternary operator which is like a
conditional statement within our BTN
state boolean so let's go ahead and add
this so interpolation braces BTN state
alright we're going to put in a question
mark and this is basic JavaScript
ternary operator it's basically an
if-else so it's saying if button state
is true then we'll say the button is
disabled and then else when we use that
with a comp or colon rather the button
is active
so let's go ahead and save that and now
we'll see this message that's telling us
the button is disabled because it
currently is disabled so you can also
utilize other AI JavaScript functions
such as math I within this interpolation
here so it handles a lot of just basic
JavaScript and some things that you
can't do but we're not gonna get all
into that
so now let's also talk about view
directives so in view templating you
will find yourself utilizing the various
directives that exist just as we did
right here all right so a view directive
is a very is a view specific attribute
that's prefixed by a V - as shown right
here alright so each serve a different
purpose and I just want to bring over
the written version this tutorial just
to show you how many exist we have you
know it looks like there's roughly a 12
or so right here so we have V text HTML
show if else else if they'll handle
pretty much everything you're going to
need in other words I'm not going to go
into depth into all these but let's try
giving for instance some you know one
that you're probably going to use a lot
which is v4 and this attribute allows
you to iterate through a list like an
array or an array of objects so first
let's create an array of objects in the
component logic so right here we're
going to get rid of this name and button
state stuff right here we're gonna go in
to create an array of objects called
skills alright so we open up the array
brackets and we'll have an object here
with a name or a skill property rather
and we'll set it to view Jas that might
be a person's skill set hopefully it'll
be yours after this I'm gonna hit shift
alt in the down arrow key to replicate
that line and have an another one maybe
front-end developer okay
so now we have our array of objects
property called skills alright so next
in the template section let's go ahead
and gut all this stuff right here
all right we're going to put in a div
class we're gonna call it holder and
I'll be referencing that stuff in CSS
shortly and so now we're gonna have an
unordered list and by the way we're
going to be keeping this HTML throughout
the course so this is stuff that you
need to do if you're going to follow
along so we're gonna have a list item
and this is where we're going to use the
v4 directive so V - 4 equals and we're
going to put in first the some
parentheses that will say first the data
and then we're going to need to put
comma and in index to gain access to the
actual index and then we're going to say
in and then this is going to be the
skills array of objects so also to get
access to the key we put in colon key
equals and when we're going to give it
the key and a name of index that we can
reference if we wish so now just to show
that we're going to have access to the
index we can put through interpolation
index we'll put a period and then we'll
put data dot and notice this is this
data this name right here is coming from
the fact that we gave this first
parameter and a value of data and then
what do we want to show we want to show
skill we want to show the actual name so
we're going to put skill right here
alright so let's go ahead and close that
list item alright so now let's go ahead
and save this and if you did it
correctly it's now going to show us
right here view J s and that's I've the
Ray index of zero and then one of
front-end developer
alright very simple stuff let's try one
more though let's put a V if directive
along with a V else for an if-else
statement in the template so just
underneath our unordered list and by the
way we're not going to keep this I just
wanted to demonstrate just for a little
bit more of muscle memory with
directives so we're gonna say I we're
gonna have a paragraph a VF
equals we'll say if the skills dot
length and that's gonna copy how many
skills right here they have obviously we
know it's two if it's greater than or
equal to one will say you have more than
one skills I hope you do and then we'll
say P V else we'll say you have less
than or equal to one skill alright so we
know what this is going to be if we save
it we'll see you have more than one
skills because there's two all right so
if you wanted to try to remove that one
of these you you get this obviously all
right so and that's basically how view
directives and templating as a whole
work obviously on a very fundamental and
basic level now we're gonna focus on CSS
within view J s now view makes it very
easy to handle your CSS and you can
choose to write your CSS directly within
the style portion of your component or
you can write it within an external CSS
file I'm especially if it's there's a
lot of CSS and you want to try to keep
organization there's also class in style
binding that you can use within your
template alright so we're gonna cover
all this right now and the first thing I
want to talk about is understanding what
scoped means in view alright so
basically this means that any CSS
defined here if we have scoped added
then it's only going to apply to the
template HTML that's defined in this
component here so to demonstrate you
know how this works
let's open up our app dot view and we
can see that this right here this style
does not have scope so let's go ahead
and remove this rule set here let's put
in body background color and we're going
to say 6yz and that's a light gray color
alright so if I save this and we open up
our
while we could say now that we have a
light background like that if we add
scoped to this however remember this dat
hTML is defined in a different file and
we save it we'll see it is now
completely white all right so that's an
important very simple concept to
understand but when you're you know
dealing with a larger app then it's
important to understand you know when
and where to use scoped so generally
speaking when it comes to global CSS
that you want to apply to everything you
want to remove scoped all right okay
so now let's talk about linking to an
external style sheet or CSS file I
within view so at the moment our CSS
rule sets for our two components are
confined within the actual component
itself so we have our CSS here in this
component same thing with our app dot
view well i if you have a lot of CSS you
may may make more sense to separate them
into separate CSS files so to do that in
the skills view file that we have here
we're gonna make the following
adjustment first ring it's going to get
rid of everything in here and we're
going to say source equals and then the
location of the CSS file so we'll say in
the same directory we'll have a skills
CSS file so now let's save that let's
create that skills CSS file and we're
just going to put just some basic CSS
right here and then we'll go ahead and
save this so if we look at our project
now we can see that if we go back here
make sure this is saved there we go
yeah I had to refresh that in order for
it to work we can see now that this CSS
is applying so that we know that the
external stylesheet is working all right
so we're not going to be using this
method so I'm going to remove that
source we're going to back up here just
get rid of that and then also get rid of
this
right here okay so let's also talk about
view class binding so both class and
style binding and view use the V bind
directive and we know what a directive
is already from the previous section
so this directive allows you to
dynamically control when and if CSS
classes and styles are applied along
with the CSS properties and values so
let's go ahead and adjust our template
in our skills view file by the way I'm
going to right click and delete that CSS
all right so let's go ahead and adjust
the template section up here so first
I'm going to go ahead and get rid of
this demonstration down here with a two
paragraph tags and what I want to do is
we're going to add a div and we're going
to say V bind that's the V bind view
attribute and what do we want to bind
well the attribute will be class so
we're covering class binding so V bine
class equals just like it normally would
in HTML just think you know if we did
this that would look perfectly fine but
because we want class binding we're
gonna put V bind with a colon
all right so V buying class equals now
inside of here we put in just in single
squiggly braces we're gonna put in alert
show alert all right so what exactly is
happening here okay
well by the way before I get to that let
me just close that div out okay so we're
using the V bind our directive on the
class attribute and then we're saying to
insert the alert class right here as a
value only if the boolean show alert
property is true so let's go ahead and
define that real quick so just after the
skills property we're gonna put in show
alert and we're gonna say true all right
so then just to demonstrate how this
works we need to add the actual alert
class
right down here in the Style section so
I'm going to put in alert and then we
give it our properties so we'll say a
background color of yellow a width of a
hundred percent and then also a high of
30 pixels just so we can see it so let's
say this and now we can notice this I
yellow you know rectangle essentially
that recreated now if you want to show
alert only if show alert is false then
we could use the explanation point up
here and save it and there we go we see
it gets removed because this expression
didn't evaluate all right to true so
that's how you can do very simple class
binding in view so you can use V bind
class equals and we can attach this this
class only if this certain expression
values the true or not okay so we can
also handle multiple class binding in
view because there's maybe me there
might be times when you want to add
multiple classes so how would you do
that
all right well we can update this part
just by putting in a comma after our
show alert right there and then we'll
say another class we're going to wrap
this one in semicolon so we're gonna say
another class that will be name of the
CFS CSS class that we create and then
we'll put in show class so of course we
would simply define another I show class
well actually I'll just do it I wasn't
going to show you because it's so simple
but I'll just do it anyway we'll put
true and we'll say show class and we'll
say border five pixels solid black
alright so now if we save this it should
have yep let's go ahead and back up
right there there we go another class
sorry I gave it the wrong name I gave it
the name of the the boolean there we go
and it works as expected all right so
let's also talk about using V bind class
right here this too
directive of V bind with an object
instead of all of this stuff I mean
because you can imagine this will get
pretty I you know pretty cluttered if
you have a bunch of classes so there's a
better approach to handling that
scenario and so what we'll do is instead
we're gonna take this and then we're
just going to reference a property here
called alert object all right so now we
can create alert of object right here so
we'll say alert object and then we
created an object with the squiggly
braces and we'll say alert is true and
then you can add more eye properties
down here or a boolean values if you
wish and then we could just say we'll
save it and we can see it still works
now let's go ahead and talk about style
binding all right so you still use the V
bind directive except instead of
specifying class equals it'll be style
equals so let's go ahead and adjust the
template for that so view style equals
let's go ahead and get rid of that open
it up in squiggly braces and we're going
to need to say background color and it
doesn't usually use the same type of
property values of CSS in terms of
naming its using camelcase here and
we'll say bind this to a property called
BG color we can also specify a width
here BG with a height of BG height okay
so now in the component logic what we
can do is adjust this so that we have BG
color we'll give it a property a CSS
property value of yellow a BG width will
say 100% and BG height will be 30 pixels
all right so now if we go ahead and save
we'll see that we have the same result
essentially that we had before okay so
now what we'll do is let's continue on
by styling our actual project that we're
going to be developing and working on so
now obviously if you've been following
along we've been working on this simple
project it's called skills where people
can add their skills and at this point
it doesn't really have much of a user
interface at all so let's change that by
adding some roll sets to make it look
better and keep on learning so we want
to adjust the template section up here
let's go ahead and get rid of this I do
the following so for now I'm going to
put in a paragraph down here we're going
to say these are the skills that you
possess all right and then also we don't
need the index we don't need to show
that so we'll just go to put data dust
skill and that's that then in our Style
section and this is where it'd be handy
to see the written version of this
tutorial you can just go ahead and just
copy all this because I'm not going to
sit there typing this out it's just
standard CSS very basic stuff I'm just
going to paste it right there
so also let's also let me get this out
let's also add some CSS based on the our
app view file so I'm just going to take
this copy it we'll go to our app view
file and paste that so we're just
importing a custom font here or a font
called montserrat we have our body tag
HTML again all simple stuff so if we go
back to our project we will now see and
actually looks a little bit better all
right great
ok so let's talk about handling user
submitted data within view and that
means dealing with forums and also form
validation all right so let's go ahead
real quickly and the first thing we'll
talk about is the view v-model directive
so when you need to capture user input
you can use the v-model directive on
form input
in text areas which enables what's
called two-way data-binding
and that basically means you can
communicate from the template to the
logic and also from the logic to the
template all right so to demonstrate
this let's go ahead and our skills view
j/s file that we've been working on and
we're going to add real quickly a text
input so input type equals text
placeholder enter a skill you have and
then we're going to use that v-model
directive and we'll say equals skill all
right so this right here is a property
that we need to define a boolean more
specifically right down here so what
we'll do first is get rid of these three
properties we don't need them anymore
well I'd skill and oh by the way I
thought it was gonna be a boolean it's
not it's just an empty string and then
also why we're in this file let's real
quickly put in a rule set just to style
up that input that we just added all
right you can get this from the written
version right here it's just basic CSS
and also just underneath this I forgot
let's put through interpolation skill so
we can show the process of capturing
user input so we're gonna display what
the user is typing essentially so enter
a skill you have here's the input so
I'll just put in coding and there you go
so this is demonstrating the fact that
you know we're sending the user input to
the actual the component logic section
section and then also displaying it here
in the template alright very simple so
let's also talk about form submission
and view so let's I go ahead and right
now we obviously don't have an actual
form so let's wrap this in a form so
form and then we're going to say in
order to capture that user input we're
going to say sat submit and then we're
going to put a period prevent to prevent
the page from reloading and we're going
to call once it's submitted a method
called add skill
all right so we're gonna create that
just in a second
all right so now this is the first time
you've been experienced how to define
actual methods in the component logic
was simply put in here methods all right
so what's the method and skill and then
you just write out normal JavaScript
like any of the time so we'll say once
add skill is called we'll say this stuff
skills dot push and we're going to add a
new skill with the name of skill to this
dot skill and that's all that it takes
so it's also to clear out the text area
and remember the value of the text area
is bound to skill so we'll set this dot
skill equals nothing very simple so now
if we go ahead and save this and look at
it let's say coder yeah so it works very
easily as you can see so obviously let's
talk about handling multiple user inputs
because like I mentioned obviously
unless you're building a chat app or
something really simple like this you're
probably gonna have multiple form fields
so let's go ahead and just temporarily
we're not going to leave this here but I
just want to demonstrate it let's add a
check box so a type of equals check box
ID it goes checkbox and v-model is
checked all right so we're using v-model
and we have to now define something
called checked this will be a boolean
value so we'll go ahead and put in at
the top
checked and we'll say false all right
then let's modify our add skill to
demonstrate just real quickly through a
console log that we have access to that
check box of value so this check box
value is and we'll put in distict
all right so now if we save this refresh
here we'll go ahead and say control
shift I to get out that console will say
coding and let's not check it so it'll
say false all right
coding again let's check at this time
and it's true very very simple so we're
not going to use that though so let's go
ahead and just back up just a few times
here's let's get rid of this let's get
rid of this and then finally also let's
get rid of this section right here so
now let's talk about view form
validation so there's several view form
validation packages that you can install
via NPM or yarn and a popular one is
called V validate and you could find
information about this plug-in here I'm
not going to cover everything about it
probably having it on a very large
tutorial just on on what it offers but
I'm gonna cover just the you know how to
use it in a very basic sense especially
in the context of our app alright so
first in order to have access to it
we're going to install it I so you can
either go to the console here or you can
go to view integrated terminal which is
right there and we can say yarn add and
then V - validate so let's do that real
quickly and then next in order for it to
work and I'm just going to you know get
this out yeah we can close that right
now it's done already we can hit control
B we have to in order to be able to use
it we have to go to our main J's file
and then we're going to import at the
top and it's going to be V validate from
V validate and then also in order to use
it we say right here view use V validate
very simple okay so let's go ahead and
save that and now we can actually use
this validation plugin so to validate
our input field right here
we're going to add to it right here at
the end we'll say V one second
we're gonna say V validate equals and
then we're gonna put a double quote and
then single quote will say minimum or
min will say five characters so the
skill that they enter has to have at
least five characters all right and then
also will say name equals skill it needs
to have a name in order for this to work
properly all right so let's also show an
error message if the validation is not
acceptable so we'll go ahead and put a P
class of alert and we'll say V if which
is another view directive we'll show it
only if the errors and this is a object
that's produced from V validate itself
we don't have to create it ourselves if
the errors has one for skill then we're
gonna show this interpolation errors dot
first and then skill that's the name of
the error that's going to show for this
particular input all right so now we
save this and we go ahead and put in
just some initial type look the skill
field must be at least five characters
but if we get to five it goes away
let's style that real quickly to make it
a little bit better looking so I'm again
I'm gonna copy this off-screen paste
this down here again the class is alert
just some basic CSS save it try that
again
there we go so the skill field must be
at least five characters and then we get
beyond it there we go now one of the
problems here is the fact that even if
we put in two characters hit enter it
still submits it so you obviously don't
want that so to fix that let's go back
to our add skill section here in our
methods and we're gonna wrap everything
right after add skill is opened here and
this dot validator validate all then
we'll say result ok so inside of here
will say if there's a result that means
that all the validation is successful
again you can find this information by
the way at that V validate github URL
and the documentation and then we'll say
else console.log or you could show
something in the template if you wish
we're just gonna say not valid alright
so we take this copy it and put that in
the area where it is successful in terms
of the validation all right so now if we
try this we'll get up our console here
and we start typing and try to hit enter
it won't let it so well now and won't
allow it and it says not valid so now we
can do it
alright awesome stuff you two offers you
the ability to add animations within
your user interface and this includes
common elements such as enter and leave
animations and also state transition so
we're gonna take a look at this and also
apply some animations to the project
that we've been working on alright so
the first thing we're going to do is
talk about probably you know what the
biggest use case for animations ours
which is enter and leave animations
alright so if these animations you know
if done correctly they do add a nice
touch to the UI instead of simply just
instantly showing elements so to
demonstrate this in our skills view file
we're gonna modify the template and the
part that we're going to focus on is the
ID the error portion right here for a
form validation that we worked on in the
previous section so we're going to wrap
this around or wrap a custom component
wrapper as it's called in view called
transition
all right so transition and we're going
to give it a name and we'll say alert
now let's go ahead and close transition
here alright so basically the important
thing to note here I is we give it a
name and this is alert in alright and
this is going to serve as the prefix for
some CSS animation classes that we
Devine you know very shortly and so this
transition wrapper here that we have
it's going to apply animations in the
following cases based on what's being
wrapped within it and so that could be a
something with a V if directive
conditional rendering V show that's
something we haven't covered but it's
also a directive dynamic components and
also component root nodes as they're
called
so in our case this p class right here
this is using a V if directive and
therefore it will work so in order to
make this error message animate we have
to create a CSS class for it in the
Style section
so remember alert in is the name we gave
it so it's come down here to the bottom
and we're going to say a class so a
period alert in and then after we're
going to say enter - active and so we'll
give it a CSS animation property with a
value of bounce - in 0.5 seconds and
then also let's copy this and simply
modify alert in this is going to be
leave active so when it leaves we'll say
the same thing except we're just gonna
reverse it right here and then we're
going to put in some keyframe animations
I'm not going to cop type this all out
instead I'm just going to copy and paste
it from the written version and so we're
referencing the bounce in animation name
we reference to here and here and this
is just a keyframe animation of zero
percent we're gonna transform it we're
gonna make it 0 in terms of scale so
it's going to be nothing at 50 percent
of this 5 second duration it's going to
be one point five the original times the
original size and then back down to one
at 100
cent alright so we're going to go ahead
and save this and we'll go ahead and
look real quickly so now if we start
typing just watch the animation taking
place and there you go it may not appear
very smooth in a video because of the
framerate but it does appear real smooth
if you actually use it and by the way
notice when we get rid of the value and
when it leaves it also animates -
awesome awesome awesome now the
transition classes that you have at your
disposal outside of just interactive and
leave active are also enter enter to
leave and leave to outside of
Interactive and leave active you can
always you know do your research if you
need to learn more about those for your
use cases but this is a crash course so
I'm just covering the basic stuff
alright so let's also talk about using
an anime animation library instead of
having to define your own animations
which you may find tiresome or bad at so
in this case we can use a third-party
animation library such as animate dot
CSS and this is a popular one right here
you can just experiment with what these
are and it will adjust the logo here
based on what you want so in order to
access that let's go ahead real quickly
we're going to modify our template up
here and RIT where says our transition
name equals alert let's add enter -
active - class equals and then the class
is associated with our third-party
animation library so animated flip in X
that's one of the options from that
animate animation library and then also
leave active class and we'll say that is
equal to animated again
and flip out X there all right so now in
order for this work we have to actually
import or have access to that animation
library and in this case we can just
very simply in the Style section add it
as an import right here alright so we'll
save this and now type it and there goes
it kind of does this little flipping and
it overrides anything that you have
that's custom awesome okay
let's also talk about animating lists so
in our project we have this list this
unordered list right here that iterates
through this array with the help of the
v4 directive now we can animate this
list with the help of transition group
and it's very simple so all we have to
do is in our unordered list section
we're gonna wrap this custom component
wrapper called transition group and
we're gonna give it a name of list and
we're going to add in the same thing
that we had here to apply animations to
it so I'm going to copy this I'm gonna
paste it right here except I don't want
to use the same type of animation we're
gonna use one called bounce in up and
then the second one will be called
bounce out down so right here
bounced out down alright
and then let's close that and we'll
close this transition group oops this
would be like this
all right right so now let's go ahead
and save it and we'll watch the magic
happen so we'll just say coder enter
there you go fun stuff now in a little
bit we will add a little delete things
and that way we can see the opposite
effect take place maybe you can do try
doing it yourself if you wish right now
alright so for the final section of this
crash course we're gonna talk about a
very important topic which is routing so
view 2 offers a view router which is
their own own very simple routing
library that we're going to use to
demonstrate how to I switch between two
different components in the view and
also access I queries and URL parameters
all right so let's go ahead and back in
our project the very thing first thing
we have to do is go to our console or
the integrated terminal I'll just die
yeah go to the integrated terminal right
here and we're going to real quickly let
me drag this up I wish I could increase
this size but we'll go ahead and add a
yarn add in a view router now you
wouldn't have to do this normally if
when you started the project with the
view CLI you chose the manual option and
then just check the ticked off or
checked off the the view router option
but because we didn't do that we're
gonna set it up manually and don't worry
it's not that hard alright so once
that's installed we're going to create a
source router file so inside a source
will create router ojs alright and we're
going to paste this and this is all in
the written version of this part so
we're importing view router skills and
about so this skills dot view we already
have it about W does not work but the
rest of this is basically what the CLI
generates for the router right here for
the rest of this file so we can see that
we have we're exporting our new router
called
in here is just an array of objects we
have a path name and in component
associated so this will be the path in
the URL in order to access the view or
the component the view that's associated
with the component right here okay so
now let's go ahead and create that about
component view file right here so let's
do that about that view and this will
just have a template section for now so
just as this is an about page and then
it has a paragraph of lorem ipsum text
not a big deal let's also go back here
and save this and also let's visit our
main j/s file because we're not done
with this setup yet and we have to
import the actual router and then we
also have to specify router and then a
comma right there and we're good to go
alright so now let's go ahead and visit
our app dot view file and we're going to
make an adjustment to the template
section alright so right now we're just
showing skills but we don't want to do
that instead we're going to create a
navigation so a nav inside of here we'll
have a router - link Emeril say - and
think of this as href this is just to
the the route or the home and then we'll
also copy this real quick and then this
one would be for slash about and about
all right next in this next part is very
important wherever you want the router
components to display the templates or
the templates you put in router - view
just like that very simple all right so
I while we're here in app view we're
going to style our nav a little bit and
also change up a property so I'm sick of
a copy just to role sets
all right and then also there's a couple
I didn't want to center it vertically
anymore so all I'm doing is removing
aligned items and this is CSS grid stuff
by the way just relatively new and then
I'm gonna put just padding - top 50
pixels alright so let's go ahead and
save this and we will now see that we
have our home and about if we click
about we'll see about in the URL board
our board in the URL section and then
also click home there we go alright so
that's how you set up very basic routing
so you may in the future obviously want
to pass and read router parameters up
here
so to do that let's say for instance you
know the about we're passing for some
reason some type of URL parameter that
denotes a person's name it doesn't make
sense in the context of the app but let
me just show you how it's done so let's
go back to our router JS file and right
here for path of about we're gonna put a
forward slash a colon and name so this
name could be anything like XYZ that's
the name that you're going to use to
grab the value in that URL perimeter so
we'll say name save that and then we're
going to need to visit our about view
file and we're going to say hello and
through interpolation we'll say their
name that property doesn't yet exist
we're going to do find it momentarily
alright and then we're gonna add a
script section to our component
and we have all the same stuff that's
usual in fact I'm just gonna copy some
of this stuff right here
in fact I'll copy the whole thing just
to make my life a little bit easier all
right so we don't need any method so I'm
getting rid of this
we'll keep data we're going to return
just one property and so that's going to
be right here we'll say there a name and
it's simply going to be this dot route
params for parameters and then the name
that we gave it in router J s all right
so let's go ahead and save and now we go
back if I put in Gary hello Gary
Joe there we go very very simple all
right great
so that's it for you know the the bulk
of this course basically in especially
for just handling basic router stuff I
did has a final bonus and to finish off
this crash course I wanted to add a
little delete option here just so it can
be a little bit more dynamic all right
so what we'll do is in our source
component skills file we're going to add
in I just in our list item section right
here just after our data dot skill we're
gonna add in an eye class of fa4 font
awesome we're gonna include fun awesome
and this is going to be - circle my
voice is about to go out I actually have
bronchitis and I recorded all this in
one take so V on is a directive on what
click so when somebody clicks this we're
gonna call a method we're going to pass
in the index and tell it which one to
remove and /i
oh and then under methods we're gonna
add one called remove and we're going to
pass an eID and we'll say this does
skills dot splice and then the ID and
then one and that will remove it for us
so next let's add in font awesome so
we're going to import just as we did
with the animate so this is the URL to
the animation or the font awesome
library rather then we'll go ahead and
we save this oh and by the way I believe
we're gonna have to add some styling to
that but yeah right click that
let me style that real quickly this
isn't actually contained in the written
version but I think I can you know get
over get get away with doing it myself
just I as a selector float:right should
be all we have to do there we go alright
so now let's add something real quick
alright let's get rid of them great you
could also change I real quickly
cursor:pointer just so it gives us that
signifier BAM and there we go
all right guys hopefully you learned a
lot throughout this crash course I know
you know I didn't want to cover too much
all at once otherwise you would get
bogged down with way too much
information but hopefully this gave you
a really strong starting point from
which you can begin to further develop
more intermediate to advanced topics
within view j/s so make sure you check
out course tetra comm I know at this
point I don't have any up yet but you
may be watching this a week or two or a
couple months down the road when I have
a lot more content based on view which
is what my plan is so check out the
courses the very cheap paid courses
where I show you how to build full
actual apps people might want to use and
you will probably find some new content
there for view j/s alright so i'm gary
simon make sure you check how my voice
is going
corsets are calm make sure to subscribe
here i on youtube if you're watching on
youtube and i'll talk to you later
