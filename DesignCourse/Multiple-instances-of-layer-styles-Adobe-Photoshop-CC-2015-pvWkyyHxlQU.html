Gary Simon here of design course comm
adobe has released its UCC 2015 updates
and one of the updates I'm excited about
and it's gonna make life a little bit
easier there's multiple instances of
layer styles within the same layer so
traditionally in the past let's say for
example you wanted to have two or three
different strokes applied onto the same
object
you would have to replicate that layer
two or three different times and apply
the stroke in different widths so
basically now you can use the same layer
and have multiple layer styles and
multiple instances of the different
styles that you have so let me show you
exactly how to use this new feature
alright so we'll just go to file new
real quickly I'm just gonna leave the
width and height 860 by 600 that fits
well within my current resolution and 72
all that good stuff transparent
background yada yada alright so I
basically what we want to do is to
illustrate these multiple instances of
layer styles I'm gonna use a text layer
so I'm just gonna left click and we're
just going to type in fantastic
alright so hit ctrl T scale this thing
up bit just so we can see what's
happening and hit control one to get
200% in here we go I before we get to
the layer styles let's go ahead and just
add a little bit of warp text on to it
so I'm gonna choose flag I think there
we go
nothing too drastic hood ok and this is
where the fun begins so we're going to
right click and traditionally when we
wanted to add multiple strokes for
example we would have to add duplicate
rather these let this layer over here
like multiple times and then add the
stroke that way this way everything here
we can see these new plus signs which is
excellent I by default I see that
there's like three already here but this
must be because I was previously
experimenting it with it and it saved
the previous settings basically so if
you want to delete these ones that are
extra
here you just select them hit this trash
icon so let's go ahead and give this a
drop shadow and by default we could see
you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna move
this just down and up so that I have
enough room to show you the full dialog
box and the design alright so let's go
ahead and I'm gonna make this I just for
now a light blue actually a little bit
darker just so we can see it distance
we're gonna take this in maybe right
around 7 all right and then we're gonna
make it white and then we're going to go
ahead and hit this plus sign which
basically duplicates what we have here
and because it's white we can't see it
but this one's underneath it and so what
we could do now is take this color and
let's increase the distance just by a
little bit maybe just by 10 yeah what
was it 7 before yeah 7 let's try to
let's just double it by 14 all right and
we'll go ahead in this one we'll take
the opacity now maybe instead of doing
the pasady bowls come over here make it
that color now let's do this one more
time here or maybe two more times rather
this time 14 will say 21 and we'll make
it white and then do another one make
this one I think maybe what was come out
here and this one will do 28 and you can
see exactly how easy this is to add
really interesting sorts of effects
without having to duplicate the layer or
replicate it multiple times so you can
do this not on every layer style
obviously only on the ones to have the
plus so when it comes to inner shadows
stroke color overlay gradients and now a
gradient overlay multiplied here a
couple
times would probably need to rely on
either using special blend modes or
transparent gradients so you can see the
other gradient that you're applying but
that is pretty much it I so let me play
around with this a little bit more we'll
do inside maybe take this color here
maybe make it slightly like that
yeah and there we go
one single layer and you can see they're
all noted right here and you can
experiment by hiding some of them or
showing them and of course what's great
is in the past if you were working with
a type layer like this and you had all
these strokes and you had to replicate
it the layer itself so many times you
wanted to change the check text well you
only have to do with one layer now
fortunately you scale it down everything
works well alright so that is it that's
definitely a huge improvement to the
workflow of Adobe Photoshop so check out
design course comm if you haven't yet
and subscribe here on YouTube alright
goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
