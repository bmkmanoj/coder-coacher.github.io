that are predefined we
with a package manager so these settings
address colors topography spacing and
more now if you want to change these
settings there's a specific file that
you can use to redefine their values so
in the code editor oh but real quick
before we begin make sure you check out
my site course cetera comm where you're
going to find a bunch of courses on
modern design and development a lot are
free and others you can access for the
cost of buying it like expect each month
that's it now also it probably wouldn't
hurt to subscribe here on YouTube and be
sure to make sure the notifications are
turned on alright let's get back to it
let's go ahead two node modules we're
going to go to the bootstrap folder and
we're going to go down here to a custom
CSS alright so we can see that it's
labeled bootstrap overrides and the
instructions are to copy the variables
from variables dot staffs to this file
to override the default values without
modifying source files alright so this
file right here in custom is where we
make adjustments to the theme colors and
those other settings that I mentioned
alright so what we want to do first
before doing that let's take a look in
variables s CSS right here all right
so we scroll up we have a table of
contents because this is a massive file
so as you can see we have a lot of
options from which we can go ahead and
make specific customizations to usually
I would be things like colors at least
at the very least so down here this is
the color section and we could see that
it defines or it assigns color names to
the specific hex value so green blue
yellow pink purple whatever and then
also down here we have our brand so
primary success info warning danger and
verse now you can also notice at the end
of every single one of the variables
with their variables that are defined
within this file we have this little
default right there added at the end and
what that basically means is it kind of
works the opposite of the important rule
so if you have a variable that has not
been defined elsewhere such as into
custom SAS file which will do
momentarily then it will default to this
value here all right so what we want to
do is make some custom adjustments based
on the layout that we're going to be
designing here throughout this course so
I'll bring that up real quickly and
here's a preview of it just a screen
shot and as you can see we're using this
sort of teal color so let's go ahead and
define that so we'll redefine that
inside of the sass file so or the custom
sass file rather so what we want to do
is I'm just going to copy all these just
in the section up here for the colors
and we'll go back to our custom sass
file and I'll paste them now I'm not
going to just redefine all these um but
really just one so we have that teal
color or turquoise basically which is
closest closest to green so let me get
rid of everything with exception to
green also all this and everything else
except for brand primary so I've really
only just used two here so the color
scheme that or the color the hex value
of the color that we want to use is
actually 0 0 FF C for now we also must
remove default where this will not work
alright and then we also have a brand
primary we're going to assign this to
green also remove default all right we
also have a couple of other ones so
another one is called link color and
again this is defined within the
variables sass file and we're going to
make this green and then also we have a
body DG for the background color and
this one we're going to make a specific
x value of 1 a 1 B 1 D and that's like
basically almost a black
and then finally we have one more that
will define which is for our type our
font family I'm just going to paste it
in here and that is font family
sans-serif and I'm changing the primary
font to railway which we've included in
the index index dot HTML from the Google
web fonts so we'll go ahead and save
this and now we're done with any of the
customizations basically that we want to
work here there's a one other one that
we will be defining later on in the
course based on spacing but we don't
need to do that now so I'm going to get
rid of all that we're going to collapse
our node modules folder we're going to
source we're going to go into our style
dot sass and I'm going to get rid of
this all this stuff right here just hit
save so now we want to do is go back to
our console we're going to run gulp and
if you already do have it running just
hit control C and hit Y to get out of
there and then rerun gulp and this here
is the result as you can see it's using
that dark it's almost a black background
color that we define in that custom sass
file so that's how you know it is now
working and using what we need based on
that custom file so in the next section
we're going to need to begin writing the
HTML for the very top portion of our
project which will be revolving around
the nav bar in the navigation ok so
let's go ahead and define our nav bar so
we will be working within a source in
our index.html file right here ok so the
very first thing we need to do and again
I'll refer back to the mock-up as you
can see here we have this size this
background you can just barely see it
it's like a watermark background of a
game screenshot and we need to create an
ID or div that will span all the way
across so let's go ahead define that
HTML real quick so it's going to be
simply div ID equals hero and we'll
define that momentarily here let's go
ahead and keep on focusing on the HTML
so ctrl B will get rid of that sidebar
there in visual studio
code and then inside of here we're going
to use our first bootstrap for specific
class which is div class equals
container all right so this gives you
basically a fixed width container that
it does adjust and is responsive based
on the viewport width then we also have
div class of row
all right so inside of here is where the
actual navbar goes that's the very next
element that we have to worry about so
to define a navbar we use nav and then
class of nav bar all right next we're
going to define nav bar toggleable - MD
and what this does is it specifies that
it should toggle or show on medium
viewports and down and then also we're
going to add nav bar - inverse and this
is specified for dark backgrounds which
it makes the nav bar light now the
inverse case of this if it's a light
background you can use nav bar - light
alright and again where am i pulling
these classes out well certainly not of
my but again the bootstrap forward
documentation all right so next we're
going to have the actual game logo logo
so we're going to define an a H ref and
it's going to go nowhere and then we
give it a class of navbar brand and
again this is specific to bootstrap for
and then also text - primary and that
will be bound to our primary color that
we specified in that custom class file
previously and then we're going to give
it an ID of logo and then we'll be able
to reference it and then game logo
alright so we'll save that and this is
what your result should look like so far
so none of navigation but this is our
navbar okay so now what we want to do is
add in the HTML for our actual button
for the toggle button so we do this by
defining an HTML element button and then
a class of
navbar - toddler right and then navbar
toddler right so navbar toddler right
and that will move it over to the right
essentially and then we give it a type
of button and this next part is very
important we give it a attribute of data
- toggle and then equals collapse and
then data
- target equals and then we put in the
ID of the HTML element that we want to
make it show or reveal upon clicking so
that will be our menu which we haven't
yet done we'll do that just after this
element so navbar supported content and
then we're going to define area controls
equals the same ID here without the hash
sign there and then I'm simply going to
paste in two more right here and here
and by the way these eye area specific
attributes this stands for accessible
rich Internet applications and they're
basically there to make the content
accessible for people with disabilities
so with screen readers and stuff like
that so are they required no but it's a
good thing to Adam so I'm going to go
ahead and close this element out and
we're going to go back down here and so
just underneath our button this is where
the actual menu will reside so right now
it's going to be a we in case a
unordered list or a UL element inside of
a div so the div is going to be div
class equals collapse navbar collapse
justify content end in this will I help
push things over to the right and then
ID the
idea of this element has to match the ID
of the data target right here so I'm
going to copy that right there we'll go
ahead and close this and close that div
and then inside of here this is where
our unordered list starts so UL class
equals nav bar - nav again this is all
specific to bootstrap for classes inside
of here we're going to have an Li of a
class nav - item and then also inside of
there we're going to have a link so a
class equals nav - link again this is
all specific to boots our classes will
make it the primary color of our color
theme text primary href it's not going
anywhere
and then we'll name this first one
overview all right then we close out
that knob item so now we can copy these
three lines and paste them three times
and then we just simply change up the
name here based on our mock-up suspects
FAQ and purchase all right so let's save
that and yeah it definitely won't work
just yet I forgot to actually close out
this element right here this button so
let's go back up there real quickly we
have to add a span element inside of
here with a class of nav bar toddler
icon and then close out the button this
will actually give us our clip make sure
you close that out as well our three
line hamburger icon menu there so now
we'll save that oh yeah and I have
welcome so yeah you might want to fix
that cheese and then save and there we
go so obviously some work needs to be
done to this and I let's go ahead and
fix that real quick so we're going to
hop into our style dot sass for file so
let's hit control be styled SS okay the
first thing we want
to reference is the navbar class itself
alright so everything will be embedded
in here which SAS allows you to do so
what we'll do is I first we're going to
give it a width of a hundred percent and
then a background of none and important
and next after that we'll go ahead and
we're going to reference a media query
some media max width of 34 a.m. so we're
saying just on mobile devices only we're
going to say background is going to be
black and important so if I save this
you'll see now it moves over to the
right and if I bring it in by the way we
can see how this toggles right at the
medium desktop size and it also works if
I toggles it will show a black bar here
at the top which you don't have to add I
just decided to alright and coming down
after that we're going to reference
navbar toggler change the cursor to a
pointer and then outline 0 because I
don't like that blue outline that
applies also nav link text transform
uppercase also font weight is going to
be bold by the way this text transform
uppercase you don't necessarily have to
add it here you could add that as a
class actually on to the right here and
I believe the class is text - uppercase
that way you don't have to write out
that if you don't wish we will be doing
that in the future but I want to show
you both ways so then finally also nav
item and we're going to change the
padding here so I mean right now if I
save this we'll see where we're
currently at right here things are a
little bit too close so we'll fix that
all right
go ahead and put in just padding:0 on
the top and bottom in one REM units on
the right and left we're going to use
another media query here max width of 34
a.m. and we're going to put padding 0 so
we're splitting padding:0 on everything
at a like a smart phone resolution and
then also nav link which is embedded
within nav item and we're going to just
put in a media query again of max width
34 a.m. this is the last rule set we're
going to do font weight is normal and
we're going to make the color white just
to separate it from the logo a little
bit so now if we save this go back I
think things are pushed out a little bit
more and there we go
all right great so now in the next
section we're going to focus on the hero
section and getting the background and
all that going along with a heading and
subheading and a little graphic alright
I'll see you then alright now the first
thing I want you guys to do is see we
have this assets folder which is
currently empty is to download the
project files so if you're watching this
on YouTube for instance I go to my site
and you have to register and you'll be
able to access the project files for
this course otherwise if you're watching
this on a different network then the
project files will be there somewhere
for you to find them ok so I'm going to
right click and just reveal in Explorer
and let me get this size down quite big
right there so inside of this folder
we're in place just I believe three just
three graphic assets so I have a
different folder here we're going to
just put them in there actually I don't
want to get rid of them there there we
go so you should have BG overlay in
screen one that's the only images that
we're going to be using alright so I
inside of or at the top of our Styles
CSS we're going to reference our hero ID
which if you recall was a very first
HTML ID so hero
put in a background of URL and this is
going to be assets BG JPEG and no-repeat
then background size will make cover
fills everything up and then background
position we're going to put it at zero
and then from the top 60% this is going
to actually put things push things up
all right so now if we go back here
we're only going to see a portion of it
because we don't have enough content
inside the poppy row yet to push it all
the way down to see the full eye
background there so let's go ahead and
work on that section so where this is
going to reside is actually just after
this div right here we can see our nav
we have a closing div and then right
here alright and so this is actually
this closing div is in relation to our
container right here and so it's out of
there we're going to put in a div class
of a new row and we're going to give it
another custom class of hero content and
then I we're going to leave it for there
for now
we are going to add more classes to that
momentarily but I wanted to show you the
result in the browser first so you can
understand it and inside of this div
we're going to have our first usage of
columns here in bootstrap for so we're
going to reference call - the screen
size that we want to target which is
going to be medium so MD and then a
length of six columns and then also a
column of small so SM and then 12 so
we'll see how this works momentarily in
the browser so let's close that out and
then we're going to reference our h1 for
our heading so the class we have several
classes we're going to use that are
specific to text so remember I mentioned
before we can use text - upper case to
make them all uppercase by default we're
going to use text center and this is
going to Center the text all the way up
until we add text - MD
for medium left alright so medium and
greater this text will be left justified
anything underneath it will be centered
alright so now we're going to put in
destroy all of humanity
cheesy headline and then we're going to
simply copy this here and paste it and
control B to get rid of that sidebar and
we're going to change this to an h4 and
this text is simply going to be capture
enemy territory and beat them down like
rodents aren't ia great copywriter
alright so we're going to leave all the
same classes here for this as well so
let's save that any of those who really
can't see it because of the text color
so before we look at that let's go to
our style CSS or at the topper is going
to reference body and then we're going
to make color white with three F so now
we'll go back okay so first we have a
couple issues here obviously one being I
there's not much padding and stuff but
let's also bring this in and show you
remember it's all left aligned currently
until we get beneath right there a die
the medium sizes so now you can see that
they are Tech Center and then text left
okay so let's fix the padding issue
because we want you know when it comes
to design you want a lot of room to
breathe especially when it comes to your
hero section so to do that what we're
going to do is in this class right here
for a row we're going to add a few
specific classes for padding on top and
bottom so the way we do this is we put
in padding so this P right here that's
for padding however if you wanted to use
margin you would use M and then you
either use top or bottom so P so
Petey that means padding-top you could
put pb4 padding-bottom
or mt4 margin-top or mb from
margin-bottom
so we're going to put padding on the top
and then put a dash and we're going to
specify a screen size for this so large
so we're going to put six alright right
now that's not going to work because we
don't even have a spacing size of six so
if you recall earlier I mentioned we're
going to have to go back into our custom
sass file to add one more override and
we'll do that momentarily so then we're
going to put in P be large sub
padding-bottom four large will also be
six and then we're going to put padding
top overall will be five okay so these
numbers right here five six six the
higher the number the more padding
you're going to get it by default only
goes up to five but I wanted a little
bit more part my margin than what they
were offering so we're going to add our
own side here at six so I'm going to
save this and we'll just take a look at
the result in the browser again we have
padding top five at it already so let's
drag this in a bit we'll see nothing
really changes let's go back to our
custom sass and this is all located
inside of right here alright so with
this open let's go to our variables and
we're going to find this right here
spacers we're going to copy this entire
section right here okay we're going to
go back to our custom I'm going to paste
this in and we're going to get rid of
the default rule there and then we're
going to add one more size right there
so we're going to put a comma a six open
it up in parentheses
and then the XY we can just copy this
one right here
and instead of by three we're going to
put by nine we're going to have a ton
right here so you can see it goes from
like point two five five one point five
three nine so we'll save that and right
now we're not watching this file here so
if we go back to our console we're going
to have to rerun this real quickly so
gulp all right so now you can see we
have a bunch of padding and it really
just makes everything just stand out a
little bit better so now you can see I
right here it's all the way using that
number six version but then it comes
down to five which is substantially less
and more ideal for these smaller screen
sizes awesome
okay we also have a graphic over here
that we imported in the assets so let's
go back to our code editor go into index
dot HTML we're going to copy this real
quickly so that call right there
paste it and we're going to get rid of
these two type elements and we're going
to put in simply one which is going to
be an image source equals assets overlay
dot PNG class is hero - image we're
going to reference that ourselves and
then MT which is margin-top and put it
f5 and then MT which is margin-top at
medium reports zero all right so let's
save that oh by the way we also want to
add one class up here text type and
center that will Center the image all
right so now if we look at this it's
going to be this large nasty thing right
here and that's because this image is
not yet responsive so what we'll do is
head on over to our style sass
we're going to put in just down here
we're going to put in here Oh a class of
hero - image width of 80% so let's save
that there we go
and then also let's fix this over here
the type doesn't look very good so we're
going to just above that we'll put an h1
font weight will be bold and then font
size will be 3.5 e/m save that there we
go
all right much better so now let's check
it out responsibly the thing looks good
all right and there we go okay so in the
next section we're going to take a look
more closely at columns by defining a
secondary piece of content that will
span across the entire browser down here
that will show features associated with
the game essentially</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
