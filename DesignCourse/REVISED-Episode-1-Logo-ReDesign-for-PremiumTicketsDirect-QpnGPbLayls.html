random mound generator just as a way to
generate ideas now hi that could relate
somehow to the e-commerce industry or
business in general so I'm just gonna
hit generate here and see so Jennifer
that's not a good one so I'm gonna keep
on going until I come up with something
that will make sense okay so theater and
when I'm specifically looking for our
advertisers on Google Theatre yeah I
think we can use that for theater
tickets so the part there's probably a
variety of different advertisers with
their own websites so that will work so
now I'm going to I get a new tab here
and incognito mode and Google here and
I'm gonna type in movie tickets all
right so let us see here so the top
portion here are advertisers and usually
if you go to maybe a second page you'll
see
oops no not that if I go to page two you
might see advertisers on the right which
we don't unfortunately so I'm just gonna
take a look at the top three here now
Fandango already know they have a good
logo I'm gonna be gonna mess with those
let me just open these sites okay so
this let's see here go home let me sure
what I'm looking at yeah I let me know
what's going on not a good candidate oh
okay so this looks like it will work all
right so I there's a lot going wrong
with this logo so premium tickets direct
comm never pay service fees again okay
so you know again the point here is not
to you know criticize a logo see how we
can improve it so I'm gonna take this
actually what I'll do is just I hit alt
and print screen so I can just get a
screenshot of my current window
and go in here to Adil Adobe Illustrator
and go to file new I'm gonna leave at
860 by 600 and RGB and hit OK and then I
actually first before I do that I'm
gonna go into Photoshop and just crop it
okay so I'm gonna go to file new here
and hit OK paste it in and I just want
to get this selection right here and
copy
alright and then go ahead and minimize
this paste that in alright so this is
the initial starting the previous logo
now not just for yeah I think we're just
gonna start off with it they type here
just to get that going so premium
tickets direct alright so scale us up
let me shift and you know when you're
doing a logo redesign you still want to
vote for the most part you know for most
instances you want to maintain eye as
much as if it as you can as possible so
this looks like some sort of I I'm not
exactly sure what font they use directly
I you know this one but probably pretty
close I if I take this down maybe 250
you know this would be pretty close I'm
not I don't really want to focus too
much on the type although the dot-com
being up like that I'm not a fan of that
I but for now I think what we're gonna
do is just stick with yeah we'll use
black and also I'm gonna go to character
change this tracking maybe to make
negative 20 and that will work for now
alright and so now I what I want to do
is we'll use the same colors that they
have for the most part so if a premium
here I changed to that color and also
when we have this color here we'll drag
it over here to the swatches panel that
way we can easily
access it in the future and just for now
I think what we'll do is because I want
to work with this on a white background
not this one so if we use this yellow
color it's not gonna it's gonna there
won't be enough contrast so it'd be hard
to read I'm guessing so if we did this
becomes too difficult to see so for now
I'm gonna leave it there
just until I specify this color over
here and we'll see it's it's a little
bit there's not enough contrast so it's
hard to see I don't like that all right
so what I'm gonna do is take this and
just make it black all right and
additionally I will control C and
control F that and we'll make this a.com
scale it down we'll put it underneath
here that way it just really seems to
just break up the flow of the type
everything's on one line and on you know
a completely horizontal path and then we
have this kind of just flicking up here
and just breaks the path the major issue
with this logo though it comes right
here and that's what it has the kind of
the pixelated movie tickets in the
background that go behind the type which
is a no-no so I there are multiple ways
that we can approach this to redesign it
and make it more effective we could a
redesign into such a way that it is
separate from the text or B keep this
idea but execute it better so that it's
not literally behind the the type right
here in premium so I think also what I
want to do is take the type tool and
I'll just type I never pay service fees
again three periods and then I'll go
ahead and just make this regular scale
it up
very referee around right around there
and I may come back to this I just
wanted to get them the mean elements on
here and ready to go so now what I want
to do is go ahead and focus on this part
and really just try to come up with a
you know a plan or an approach for how I
want to do this yeah I think actually
what I will do would probably stick with
this idea of you know making it part of
the type as well instead of a separate
symbol or separate mark and that way
it's it's it's closer to this idea
originally dia just accept executed a
lot better so let me think here ideally
you know we're dealing with a couple
different concepts here so never pay
service fees again we have premium we
have tickets and we have direct alright
so really that's three ideas and the
idea that you know you have tickets and
they're premium as in special in some
way and then direct as well so I think I
you know I have one idea that I'm kind
of coming up with but we'll see I again
this this is not pretty scripted I
didn't do anything beforehand and this
is just a hundred percent new project to
me so we'll see how this works so let's
go ahead and let's see here all right so
I think what I'm gonna do is take the
idea of this ticket kind of just folding
here to the right and then inside
perhaps maybe with negative space have
an arrow that's kind of pointing down
towards premium and this will kind of
help emphasize the idea of being direct
so we have the ticket and then we have
direct kind of emphasized in this mark
so I I'm gonna zoom up here and see just
how well I can freehand this and
hopefully I don't screw it up too bad
initially again try to get a good idea
of how I want to do this
and again when you place these points
here you can always kind of just
readjust them and work with them by
using the direct selection tool up here
oops
I'm down here two layers and make sure I
can't move this here lock that come back
here so I'm not sure if I want to fold
it quite that much as I did initially
bring this up a tad bit
all right and yeah we need more of a
oops an angle on this
all right and all right let me think
about this
ideally we'll have this up here kind of
more evenly matched up and alright
somebody hit ctrl one just to see what
this looks like so far
gonna probably move this up a little bit
alright so now what I want to do is I'm
going to try getting the white here and
I need to try to really consider how I
want this arrow to appear within this
portion here so think what I'm going to
do is outline this inner part of the the
ticket here is that the feature that you
see pretty much on most tickets so I'll
go ahead and start right here and it's
just going to be a stroke it's not gonna
have any sort of feel fill to it and
yeah I think we could start right there
and then come back down
alt and allow me to drag that all right
and then I could take it and click on
you know get rid of this and then give
it a stroke of white all right so we
need to work with that just a tad bit to
make sure it's a little bit more rounded
out actually I think I'm gonna increase
the size of everything a little bit like
that all right
and then fix this a little bit
all right I think right there is fine
for now and all right so now what I want
to do is try to figure out how I want to
get in this arrow in some way shape or
form so let's see here what we'll do is
I'll start off with the actual head to
the arrow and I think I'll put it right
around here not you know I don't want it
to have the stroke on it so click on
that and then make it white all right so
try this again maybe right around there
take control wine
I'm already come up with a separate idea
I'm not sure if this is gonna work it
may be a little bit too much in terms of
all these lines and stuff but I'm coming
up with a separate idea just in case
yeah it's not too bad right off the bat
let me see here
all right and you can still have the
idea of having two of them so let me
control C control F edit no I'm not in
Photoshop right click transform reflect
vertical hit ctrl G just to group them
and put this one behind everything
move this one over like that maybe take
this one as a whole and push it down
just slightly just to create some just a
little bit of difference between them
all right and then what we can also do
is I'm gonna have to fix this down here
as well it's not that big of a deal
though move that up and then I can also
do is add in kind of like a shadow and
the way we could do that and was one of
the most effective ways I would say is
to I let me get this lined up a little
bit better there we go I will take I
black here and we'll start out right
maybe right around here and then just
drag up like that and I'll put this
beneath that these layers right here
come back down and move it over here
with my arrow key there we go so then
what we could do is take the this tool
here and just move it to the bottom of
all the opes no we want on top of the
group though right there and then take
the opacity down
we'll try 20%
all right and you know there's still
other ways that we can tamper with this
I want to take just these and group them
up real quick and then hit ctrl C and
then ctrl F to duplicate them and one
thing to note is when you when you have
a stroke here and you try to resize it
the stroke width doesn't stay
proportional so you notice it looks a
lot thicker there so the way you combat
that is you take everything go to object
path and outline stroke take everything
scale it up now it's more accurate all
right and one thing I would like to do
is to take make sure this is 100% flat
out right there so just take a rectangle
so it's completely 100% smooth or
horizontal rather and hit object path
divide objects below and then we'll see
at the bottom you meup here use the
direct selection tool left click and
only choose the bottom portion right
there all right so that's better
all right so now let's move this over
control C control F and we can
experiment with maybe using this color
here for the inner color or possibly
using it for the lines right here or
inste maybe instead of white using a
orange color so we'll try that just for
that give it that real quick so I'm just
using a direct selection tool and
holding shift while selecting all these
and we could take this color and it's
not bright enough we could use this
there we go
and we can see that does give us a
different look a bit maybe leave these
white and we'll see what that looks like
so you can see there's any number of
different ways that you can really
approach it let's go ahead and take all
these scale them down and I'm gonna move
this over create another one
and in terms of yeah I think you know in
terms of creating like gradients or ever
it's unnecessary I think it's more
effective just to leave it like this for
this particular scenario we already have
lines and you know it's already a little
bit complex in and of itself so I'm not
at the end of adding more complexity
through gradients so yeah I think this
will work pretty well so I think the
version I'm gonna stick with here let me
take this and delete it I'm just gonna
take this down here stick that over
there
and that the yellow gives us some extra
color as well so I think that's pretty
effective yeah and probably scale this
up a little bit more I like that some
messing with the type a little bit kind
of getting things more even out all
right so I like that as is okay so I may
unlock that layer all right so I'm going
to group this control shift o convert
everything to outlines that's the same
thing it's going object-- path and I not
like yeah all right forget just
converting it to outlines control shift
and oh I can't remember if that is a
custom shortcut key or not that I set up
anyhow I and so now what I want to do is
create one that matches their background
so I let me take this and get the
background color here with the
eyedropper tool and just extend out here
and I'm gonna drag it to the bottom lock
it
the control wanted to get to a hundred
percent take this which will see control
F and get it up in here alright so now
you could see this these colors don't
work well with this darker color so this
is where having one come in maybe where
we take just the tickets right here make
it this color so it really stands out is
more effective and then also this text
here and perhaps making it white ah that
gives it a little bit too much contrast
I think but I want to experiment with
the colors though so I'm gonna ungroup
these and I'm gonna ungroup the text as
well and then just take everything and
group them as their individual words
there I just made it hit ctrl G for each
of those and on your experiment here
with different colors to see what I
think I would stick out the best
there definitely is enough contrast
between this darker red and this orange
right here so I think that's fine I
think that's almost too much honestly
right there let's try yeah they almost
have it right by making it just a color
like this right like right there I think
that works well and perhaps let's see
here making this white maybe no or
making it yellow yeah that's a little
bit too much as well we want the tickets
to really stand out so allowing it to
you know have this this yellow color
right here I think we'll think works
pretty well
but yeah the major improvement like I
mentioned is right here making sure
things aren't overlapping and there's no
glows and stuff or like they've added up
an outer glow right here and it's darker
to try and combat the issue of the
contrast that's being in clutter really
from
tickets going behind the text so this is
a way to separate things and make them a
lot better so let me I real quickly take
a look and see what this how this works
when I just take this these two white
things here and make them the same color
oops
hit ctrl H oh it's because this is a
group ungroup that there we go
there we go now take this yeah it's not
so bad I mean it feels like it's not
sticking out enough so something tells
me we can make it an adjustment for this
so let me I take both of these and
instead of making them in that color to
try this color here yeah that does stick
out more I would say and again this is
all about experimenting one thing that
you do I'm going to back up again
oops no edit step forward redo take this
I'm just experimenting again this is not
necessarily what I want to do that
really makes it stick out I'm yeah I'm a
fan more of this I think I yeah it's a
tough call I think I almost want to
stick with this idea yeah
you know what I think this is good in
and of itself so we have the white
outline here yeah I like it yeah so that
is it for the logo redesign so you know
we went from this up here to this and so
real quickly what I can do is just print
screenshot this real quick go in back to
photoshop here and we can replace it
real quick what I could do is just I
take the direct selection tool
edit fill okay
control D control B to paste
I'll just get this in real quick
well one issue that I have is this
things that should not be placed there
leave it like a right around here and
then I'll also take this and hit shift 5
and hit okay there you go
so yeah this looks a thousand times
better than this right here so as you
can see big improvement in the overall
approach and this would definitely work
a lot better and when they get it
printed behind different material you
don't have all these different tiny
little colors right here in the glow and
the contrast issues so yeah what I will
do is I send these guys the logo for
free and see if they'd like to use it or
not
either way hopefully this was a helpful
logo design tutorial for you guys in the
first episode of DS and I course com
revamp alright goodbye
