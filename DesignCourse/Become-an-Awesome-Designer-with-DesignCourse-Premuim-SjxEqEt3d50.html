today I'm announcing the official launch
of design course premium which will be
tomorrow alright so tomorrow you'll be
able to sign up and become a premium
member and what that means is you're
going to get access initially to three
different products the first being viz
ID which is the visual identity design
course which is a set of videos that's
going to help you become an awesome
visual identity designer for companies
and that includes things like logo
design stationery colors etc and the
second being wise banner and wise banner
is a product that launched last year and
that allows you you to use Photoshop to
rapidly produce banner sets so if you
ever seen banners on websites that's for
display advertising and this is a set of
photoshop action script and PSD files
and it makes creating banner sets of
different sizes really easy and then the
third product is going to be mentor and
that's really the core of design course
premium because that's what I'm offering
that basically nobody else is offering
like the big sites like Linda calm I
that is going to be one-on-one training
with me so what does that mean if you
want to become a better designer
watching video tutorials you know like
the type that I put out every day that
can take you only so far because you're
just reproducing the steps and it
doesn't really help you when it comes
time to design your own project so if
you follow a logo designed to tour for
example you find that okay you can do it
pretty easy I but then when it comes to
designing your own logo it doesn't
really look as good and that's what
one-on-one design training with mentor
will help remedy so you'll submit
fictional projects and you'll check out
their briefs once you submit them I'll
take a look at them and I will really be
able to easily identify areas where you
need to improve in terms of design
whether it be colors contrast white
space
clutter complexity etc so just being
able to hear a video response based on
your submitted design work whether it be
for a logo design web design anything is
going to help you tremendously become a
better designer so tomorrow is the
launch of design course premium look out
for an email I'll be shooting out an
email if you subscribed and also a video
announcing the official launch and being
active tomorrow alright so yeah I hope
you enjoy it and you know if you really
do want to become a better designer it's
going to be well worth the money and so
yep check out design course com if you
haven't yet in us always subscribe here
on YouTube
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
