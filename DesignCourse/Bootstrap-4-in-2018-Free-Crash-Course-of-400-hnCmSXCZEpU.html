and what do we have here we have version
4.0 point zero we're out of alpha we're
out of beta and just four days ago on
the 18th of January they released the
official version after quite a long time
several years in development this
bootstrap for was in so I already did a
bootstrap for course last year and is
free but that was when it was alpha so a
lot of stuff has changed since then so I
decided I would do a real quick sort of
elongated tutorial slash crash course on
the basics of getting up in running and
using bootstrap for to build a layout
which is exactly what we are going to do
so just a preface I before we begin
there is a complete written version of
this tutorial on my website corsets or
comm it's linked in the description and
one take the first line in the
description here on YouTube and this is
just for your reference there's going to
be code here everything I do is going to
follow the flow of this written tutorial
here in this video tour tutorial that
you're about to watch alright
so to get started we are going to I
cover integration or you're integrating
your bootstrap for alright so I there's
a couple ways there's a really quick way
and then there's a not so quick way and
each has their drawbacks so we want to
get started as fast as humanly possible
then if you visit get bootstrap comm the
docs and we go to introduction we scroll
down just a little bit you'll see this
starter template section right here oh
but real quick before we begin make sure
you check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on
alright let's get back to it all you
have to do literally to get started is
just copy this go to your code editor
paste this in say this as an HTML file
which it's not yet that's why it's not
formatting any type of colors and there
you go you get started it includes
primarily three different things alright
so actually I should say four and that
is the bootstrap CSS right here this if
you visit this and this is through a CDN
in the browser you copy and paste that
you'll see this massive minified version
of bootstrap it's going to be massive
but it includes everything that you
would want to use and then down here you
have your required JavaScript okay
that's all you really need to get up and
running with bootstrap however the
downside to this of course is the fact
that you don't have any sass pre
compiling which are pre-processing
rather and also you're including the
kitchen sink essentially so you can't
choose which elements you want and so
that means it's going to be large this
is ideal for prototyping quick quick
projects something like that so we're
not going to use that method we're going
to use the more robust method where you
can customize a lot more thing you have
the power of sass and we'll do that by
installing boot shop for via the node
package manager so this means that
you're going to need node J s installed
and a check go to your console or
command line node - 2 V and you can see
I have a version if you don't go to node
J S org download the appropriate
installer based on your operating system
install it with the default settings
then reload your contour command line
and then you can have access to node an
NPM which is the node package manager
alright so once you have that let's go
ahead make a directory burn call this BS
for bootstrap not not the other BS 4 and
after it creates it we're going to CD
into BS 4
okay so now we're going to use the NPM
and NIT command to create a package.json
file which simply stores our project
dependencies so NPM in it I'm going to
add the why flag here and that's just
going to give us all the default answers
otherwise if you omit that it's going to
ask you all these questions prompted
that all right so now we're going to use
NPM once again to install several
different packages as development
dependencies so NPM install now instead
of just winning install we can just use
I same thing
all right so gulp that's one of the
things we're going to install that's a
JavaScript task runner browser sync gulp
sass and then save it as a development
dependency all three of those packages
alright so as this installs right here I
again I'm gonna reiterate what those
three packages are so gulp is a
JavaScript task runner and you're gonna
see how that works shortly if you're new
to it browser sync automatically
refreshes our browser for us upon file
changes which is really handy when
you're in the process of developing a
layouts and then gulp sass enables sass
compiling with our project and if you
don't know what sass is I really
recommend you know because I'm not gonna
need to be covering basics of sass here
but I really recommend I you know doing
a search for a tutorial or a course or
something on that okay so I'm just going
to pause this until oh wait there it
goes it's already finished okay and
we're going to use NPM one final time to
install a few regular project
dependencies so this first three that we
created they're only needed for
development purposes but these three are
going to be needed for actually
production purposes so NPM I for install
bootstrap obviously we want that we want
jQuery and popper ojs and we're just
gonna save without the save dev flag so
of course we know what bootstrap is
that's why you're here
jQuery is used by bootstrap and then
popper J s is also used by bootstrap and
it allows for positioning of popovers
and tooltips
they used to use to tether an alpha
version so that's one of the things that
they changed alright so next I if you're
using Visual Studio code like I am and
most other others are who create these
tutorials then you can simply type code
in a period and that will launch our
Visual Studio code editor here for us
automatically so I'm going to position
this real quickly yep alright and now I
we're going to create the following
folders here so it's pretty typical to
create like a source folder so SRC and
then decided there we're gonna create a
few other folders so another one will be
like assets another one will be CSS
another one will be js4 javascript if we
want that and then s CSS for sass okay
so inside of our source folder which
we're currently in let's create an
index.html file alright now let's also
we're going to paste the following
contents I'm not going to sit here and
just type it all out and I'm gonna be
Kara life a little bit easier but just
to show you what's happening here in the
pertinent areas is I we just have some
real quick basic HTML happening we have
right here
fonts I'm using a railway font I didn't
very easy to include this from the
Google web fonts I am using font awesome
for fun awesome icons
I just realized are particularly layout
throughout this little crash course I
don't think I actually use this so we
could probably omit that but it's nice
to have if you want icons are a bunch of
them at least and then also we have our
main bootstrap CSS and this gets
compiled or we use sass to create this
file with gulp and you'll see how that
works shortly and then also a custom
styles CSS like it gets included after
our bootstrap right and then finally
down here we have those three JavaScript
files that we need okay so let's go
ahead and save that and
next just before we get to gulp section
we're going to hop right into our
scss sass folder and we're going to
create a style sess CSS file so Styles s
CSS is where our custom s CSS is going
to go so I'm going to put in V G color
this is a variable we'll just call it
red and then body background will set to
BG color now the reason I'm doing this
is you know we're not going to use this
but I want to make sure right when we're
done with this the gulp process that it
is actually you know taking our sass and
converting it to regular CSS just kind
of like a test alright so now we're
going to create and this is the final
process by the way of this this
integration process we're going to
create a gulp file J s and we need to
name it gulp file dat Jas and I'm going
to paste this in series and again all
this stuff is at that written tutorial
just just for your reference I'm gonna
hit control B to get rid of this sidebar
we can see things a little bit better
and hit control + so we could see things
easier so the first thing we're doing
we're creating variables and we're
importing the three packages that we're
gonna need so gulp browser sync and
gulps ass alright next we're going to
create let's see here um we're gonna
start kind of at the end of this file
just so I can explain it a little better
any gulp task that's name is default
just means we can type in gulp in the
command line when we do that and hit
enter it's gonna run whatever we specify
here so it's gonna run two tasks called
js4 javascript and serve all right so
the serve task I'm gonna paste right
here alright so the task here is named
serve this is what this is in relation
to and it is also going to pass in sass
which is a task that we haven't yet
defined we will and all this does here
this task is just run launch a localhost
3,000 on port 3000 a server and then
it's going to watch I these files right
here I'm going to make this a little bit
smaller and that's I then in the node
modules bootstrap SCSS bootstrap dot SCS
a file here it's gonna watch that and as
well as source a CSS and any file inside
of this folder right here it's gonna
watch these okay and then it's going to
go up watch any HTML file right now
we're only going to be working with
index dot HTML throughout this whole
thing and it will reload it on change or
if we save it that's all that means
all right so let's also get our
JavaScript task here all right so what's
happening here all right so basically
we're returning this file right here and
you can you can navigate to that file if
you want to in the node modules and as
well as jQuery and as well as this
popery nsj file it's taking those from
the node modules folder and it's placing
them into the source j/s folder that we
created all right and then we have two
more let's do our sass right here and
basically as the comment suggests it
takes either sass compile sass into CSS
and auto inject it into the browser so
it's looking at golf source it's looking
for the bootstrap sass file and also any
of our custom sass files like our styles
that CSS and it's using the pipe method
it's gonna put it's gonna run sass on it
sass pre compiling and then it's gonna
take that compiled regular CSS and put
it into source CSS under the same names
right here and then this will reload the
browser alright I actually let's see
yeah I that was all was I thought there
was another task but there's not sweet
alright so let's go ahead and save that
and let's go ahead if everything is set
up correctly then once we run gulp then
a browser will load up on localhost 3000
and it should have a red background and
it better let's see
you know sweet worked all right cool
so I'm gonna get this position in here
okay awesome awesome awesome awesome so
real quickly just so I don't forget
let's go ahead and go back to the here
let's go back to styles get that out
there we don't need that and so by the
way if I go back to here we could see it
automatically reloads which is the power
of browser sync okay so let's go ahead
I'm gonna focus on the very first thing
that I think would be most relevant so
the starting point of your bootstrap for
project is almost always going to
revolve around let's go ahead and our
index.html file it's going to revolve
around the grid container so the
container class a class of container
allows you to horizontally Center your
layout alright so we define one right
here we'll say
div class equals container and we'll put
test alright so if I save this alright
we'll see we have tests here but what
does that even mean let's hit control
shift I just here on Chrome to get out
the inspector and then I'm gonna click
on this little selector and we're gonna
click rate or hover around right here
you could see that our container is just
a fixed width sort of container for our
content alright so in the case or this
or the scenario in which you wanted 100%
fluid layout you would use instead of
the container class you would use
container - fluid right here okay we're
not going to do that we're gonna have a
fixed width alright so I the next
element out outside of this would be the
navbar which is pretty typical you mean
yeah you defined your container now you
want to have a navigation of some sort
maybe your logo and you know the
different navigation items on your
header portion so one real very
important thing about this very quick
crash course is the fact that I'm not
going to be covering every single
element in the documentation maybe just
take far too long just to show you just
how vast bootstrap 4 is I mean you can
look through all of these there's a lot
of different things you can do but my
goal with this crash course is going to
be reverting back and forth with this
documentation just to show you how it
works that way you can have more power
going forward understanding how to use
all these things yourself based on the
few that we do use so the navbar is
gonna be one that we use right here and
the way the document by and large the
documentation by and large is set up is
you have all your different sections
here and then on the right hand side you
have all these different sections here
and they're just quick links where you
can get to you know different parts of
this page and the different parts of
this page they pretty much show you an
example of what the HTML and the classes
are doing here and they also describe
what's happening so it's it's a really
thorough documentation so that's great
so for the navbar I were gonna say most
header navigations they include a
company logo so we're gonna go with what
is most typical and it's usually left
aligned and we're also going to include
a navigation that's I right aligned
inside of that same area so to do this
it's get room rid of tests here what
we'll do is we're going to start with a
nav class of nav bar nav bar expand
large nav bar dark and BG primary ok
you're probably wondering where the hell
did I get all those classes what do they
mean well in the nav bar documentation
it'll show you the kitchen sink example
right here I mean this is going to show
you the full thing whether in terms of
what it's capable of producing and this
is the example that they show if you go
down beyond that it's going
start at the absolute bare bones basics
like navbar which is the class that we
just created an Africa are light and
beachy light all that stuff so this is
where you're gonna find information on
the specific classes that we just use so
you always start for a navbar you use
the nav element with an app bar class
and then for instance this right here
and now if bar dark is for color and
this is for a background color and so
let's continue on if we want a logo it's
an a class of nav bar brand href not
going anywhere
company name all right so again if I
save this we're not going to see too
much happening we see this that's all we
see that's not exactly what we are
well--why yet although we do want our
logo here it is sweet okay so next after
that to actually define a navigation
where there's menu items we're gonna put
a div class and we'll put oops sorry
a collapse class as well as nav bar
collapse alright and this is important
this stuff is important here for a
responsive navigation so ID equals
navbar supported content you'll see how
that's worked shortly and then we're
gonna put in not that we're going to put
in a UL class for unordered list of
navbar nav and then I'm also going to
add ml - auto
so it's margin-left:auto that's what
pushes it over to the very right in the
documentation examples i they have mr
auto and and that means you're actually
I'll just describe I'll show you real
quickly what that does instead of just
sitting here talking but it's all about
alignment essentially so to create an
individual list item we give it an
abiding class and then we put a a class
of nav link
we'll put an HR f2 and then finally home
so let's copy this we'll paste it a
couple times I hate how that happens and
we'll do this so we're gonna have a
total of four I'm just gonna shift in
tab to get that spacing correct out or
about rather and then products and in
contact so let's save this real quick
and see what it looks like oh great
awesome looks horrible let's see what
happened okay and I realized that's not
showing up simply because this right
here should not end until after this div
right here so sorry about that but now
there and you'd better show up haha what
is going up here we go sorry I was
freaking out for a second so it's
because we are on a smaller viewport
this is when a little toggle buttons
gonna show up momentarily when we do
that markup but there we go we have our
home about products in contact showing
up real nice and neat right there
awesome okay so now what see life it
takes for instance to add a drop-down
once again all of that stuff will be
found in the documentation that it just
showed you a little bit ago for navbar
but just to show you real quickly what
the the drop-down or how to do with
drop-down we change let's say we want
our products to be a drop-down so the
first thing we do is we take nav item we
add a drop-down class alright and then
we put in a class of nav link and then
we put drop-down toggle so we add those
two classes of drop-down and then drop
down toggle on the actual link we have
to give this an ID as well so I'm gonna
shrink this a little bit ID is going to
be navbar drop down alright and then
data
Ivan toggle and then we're gonna put Rob
down
all right so then outside of the actual
a but still inside of our list item
we're going to put in a div with a class
of drop-down menu and then inside of
here we're going to put individual
anchors so we're going to put drop-down
item for the class H ref that's not
going anywhere because we have other
pages product one now if you're using
Visual Studio code you can shift all in
the down arrow key just a few times and
if you want to put a separator you can
do that too this is all from the
documentation so drop down divider okay
so now we can go ahead and save this and
hopefully there are no more hiccups and
we'll see we have this little drop down
and there we go voila awesome stuff
okay so how do we actually make the I'm
this little hamburger section show up
and make it function here in bootstrap
for all right well very simple we're
just going to come up here to the top
just underneath our our a here and we're
going to put in the following mark in
and then this is going to be a button
and this by default gets hidden on large
viewports because this is only supposed
to show on smaller ones so this is going
to be nav bar toggle for the class type
equals button data toggle is going to
equal collapse and then data target is
going to be equal to the ID of navbar
supported content right here so we just
copy that and we'll put a number sign
here alright and that's it for that and
then inside of the button we put a span
class of navbar toggler icon and you can
put something custom there if you wanted
to but that takes care of the appearance
of the actual button so if we save this
of course we can see it's showing up
as it shouldn't but if we save it their
theories that grieve we have it showing
up and then I have to figure out why
that's showing up right here and that's
simply because this is supposed to be
toggler sorry about that boy I don't
usually make that many mistakes all
right now it looks better look at that
awesome and of course it's responsive
okay all right so I let's talk about
okay what would be another common
section that would fall underneath kind
of a navigation here well usually a hero
section and when it comes to bootstrap
for it's called a Jumbotron okay makes
it sound more exciting I guess and so
again you know they have a Jumbotron
section it's considered a component so
if you look at the documentation here
you're gonna find everything you want to
about the Jumbotron we're gonna use it
real quickly so I let's come up
underneath our nav our closing nav tag
right there so div class equals jumbo
tron very simple
we're gonna have a h1 with a class of
display four and then simple elegant
awesome okay and then let's put in a
paragraph usually there's like a small
subheading so in that case you use P
class it goes lead you can find all that
in that the typography section of the
documentation I'm just gonna use some
lorem ipsum text right here so I'm just
gonna paste this in if you want to find
that and you can go to lip simcom li PS
um com
after that we can also have let's see
here and again you're not you can add
whatever you want in this section I mean
it's you know it's not something that
where you're constrained to whatever the
documentation shows we're gonna add it
another lead section with a call to
action button so class equals BTN of
course this is all coming from bootstrap
you can find this in the button section
BTM primary and beach
and large LG rather going nowhere the
roll is a button and then we can put in
learn more all right so let's save that
and see now what our layout looks like
see looks pretty good at this point okay
sweet all right so let's also talk about
one of the most important aspects when
it comes to bootstrap for an
understanding you know what's going on
and that is the grid system so it's
based on flex box and if you're
wondering no the grid system in
bootstrap 4 is not based on the new CSS
grid unfortunately now bootstrap board
was developed for years and years and
they were already dedicated to flat flex
box and so many other components and
their system relies on structure with
Flex box that you know they would take
them forever to readapt it to the CSS
grid but flex box at this point at least
I'm recording it is a safer bet usually
because the CSS grid is supported at the
time of recording this around 76% of
browsers and flex boxes almost at 100%
so you can go - can I use com to find
out what it currently is that so the
grid documentation I for flex box I mean
for the grid system rather is very
detailed so if you look at it real quick
you can see all of these sections I mean
they look at all this yeah there's
there's a lot to take in of course I am
NOT going to be covering everything but
I will show you and try to demonstrate
the core aspects and fundamentals of how
it all works so let's say for instance
that we want to have underneath this
section or this section right here right
run here 3 columns of equal width where
we have content in each one of them like
they could be features associated with
this service whatever all right so to do
that just underneath our Jumbotron we're
going to start off with a div class of
row so when it comes to bootstrap for
classes the row class is probably one
that you're going to be using most often
all right so it defines a actual row
like a horizontal row and then when you
want call
inside of those rows you use div class
and call all right now of course you can
use a lot of other helpers we'll get to
that momentarily but you use call if you
just want to be able to have like equal
width columns all right so I'm just
going to put in one and this is
temporary two and three and then I have
to fix this of course because I don't
know why maybe somebody can chime in
like why does it do that so annoying so
if I save this and we go back to our
project we can see our three columns
kind of we have r1 r2 and r3 and in
terms of responsiveness we drag this
thing in they stay right here
I'm going to show you how to make that
responsive momentarily now these this
just looks stupid obviously so we're
gonna have cards in here and a card is
something that you can find it in a
documentation it's a component and
you'll see what it looks like in a
second so let's just have a div class of
card and sorry it didn't close
automatically and inside of it we're
gonna have div class equals card body
text Center all right and we're gonna
have an h5 class of card title again
this is all coming from the card
component documentation section so we're
gonna have our card title here and then
we're gonna have a description card text
and then some quick text to build up on
the card title and then finally a button
of some sort so HRF going nowhere in
class equals card link because this is a
link so another link all right so now if
I save this and we see it right here
this is a card so it's just like a panel
it has padding in there already built
into it we use Tech Center just to
Center everything
and it has this little faint border and
it also has a corner radius that's all
what card it is so let's just copy this
that whole card section paste it there
we go being annoying
all right and then the same thing right
here all right so now it should look
like this looks pretty good in my
opinion but that doesn't look like all
right so let's say let's go ahead and
figure out okay how can we create custom
sizing what if we don't want equal width
for all these what if we want this one
to extend further beyond well very
simple the grid system is based on 12
columns so we could add a - like that
and one through 12 so let's add 6 so now
the middle I a card here is gonna take
up or the column rather six actual rows
and these ones will automatically adapt
to fit that pretty awesome alright so we
don't want that though we're gonna go
ahead and remove this all right and now
let's let's focus on being responsive so
right now you collapse this nobody wants
to read text like that on us on a phone
right so how do we fix that all right
very simple let's go ahead and we'll
focus on the first one so we're right up
here where it says call we're gonna
change this so we're gonna say call -
small s m12 so what that means let me
just save that real quick I'm gonna show
you what happens right now as you can
see we this first one that we adjust we
applied that class - or those classes -
was I it's assuming all 12 columns and
that's true on all the viewports because
we we specified it at I small right SM
small so if you don't specify a
different size for sizes above that like
on medium or large
it's just going to assume whatever is at
the mobile viewport so let's go ahead
and add call for medium in up it's gonna
assume just four columns because 12
times or divided by four or three which
are three columns here is four so let's
go back tada
so notice we're going from this is
medium and larger so it's assuming four
and then at small it assumes twelve all
twelve of them so that's how that works
very very easy we're gonna leave it like
that to we'll say for instance that this
is a really important one and I'm moving
devices we want to you know we'll give
it precedence okay and then these down
here these aren't actually hard to read
they look pretty good at this viewport
you if you wanted them all to have the
same behavior you would simply copy and
paste those classes that we just added
on the first column so let's also talk
right now because it's relevant about
margins and padding here in bootstrap
for look how these are just sitting on
top of each other looks like garbage
doesn't it well we can fix that
through adding the margin and padding's
system in bootstrap 4 which is actually
pretty cool the way they've set it up so
let me show you real quickly this is
spacing so this is under the spacing
section it's going to show you how you
would set this up in terms of classes so
you first start off the class if you
want margin which applies to outside of
a element that you're applying it to you
use em and then if you want to apply
padding you use P which is opposite so
that would be inside of an element to
add spacing and then after that you put
either T for top or padding Tom B for
bottom left right X would be on both
left and right
y would be on top and bottom to add
margin or padding and then blank and for
classes that set margin and padding on
all four sides of the element and then
after that on the final step
you put a hyphen and then a size zero
through five okay so let's go ahead and
try that real quickly so we would add on
our first card container which is right
here we could add margin because we want
it to be outside of it bottom and we'll
use four so now if we drag this in we
have our space awesome all right so
let's also talk about working with type
here in bootstrap 4 so I want to add a
section underneath our cards here that
demonstrates just some type and it's
going to be two columns and let's define
those right now
using what we've learned so far so this
will come just after this tag right here
this closing div is for the container we
want everything to be inside of that so
we're gonna put in div class equals row
and we're going to add some margin here
because what I found when I was doing
this before recording there is margin
issues some of the sections in terms of
the the cards on top of it and the
section we're about to add there wasn't
enough margin so I'm going to put margin
top on small we'll say 4 and then margin
top on medium 0 so those are classes
that you can use and again you can find
those all in the documentation for
spacing and all that and then so we're
going to put in here div class equals a
column ok so on small devices we want it
to go 12 and then on medium devices we
want it to be 8 medium and not brother
right so that'll be one column let me
just go ahead and copy this and this is
going to be our second column here this
is gonna be call yeah we're gonna leave
that here
and then we're gonna change this to 4
not 3 to equal 8 or 12 rather sorry
about that and so inside of here we're
gonna add to some general type so h3 and
important
heading and then underneath that we're
gonna put a peak class of lead and this
is means basically it's a subheading
it's it's a little bit larger than
regular paragraph text and it's also by
default like gray I believe so
I'm gonna I'm just gonna paste in what I
have from the written tutorial all right
and then we're just going to have two
paragraphs of text just to illustrate
what they look like and they're all
lorem ipsum right here right there like
that alright so right here I'm just
gonna put saft you have will go ahead
and remove that momentarily so this is
what the the type looks like here and so
bootstrap four has a typography section
and it's gonna tell you all the stuff
that the relevant stuff that you want to
know about type issues and stuff it also
has a section for utilities and helper
classes right here and that's gonna give
you the classes that you need for text
alignment like if you want to Center
your text left right and it's also
responsive so if you only want it like
text to be centered or on small devices
then you would add this so all very
handy stuff that I'm not going to cover
but just to let you know about its
existence all right so let's go ahead
and come back here so we have this
section here and let's go ahead
oh and one thing I wanted to demonstrate
let's check take a look at this here on
the smaller viewports let's say for
instance on you know the smaller
viewports we wanted this to be centered
how will we do that
alright well again I was just showing
you those helper classes so right here
for this column we would add text small
Center and then on medium and larger we
want it to be left alright so we go back
and if I can find it
there we go it's centered and then it's
left very very easy stuff so let's all
as one final element that I'm going to
show you before we get into
customization of all this stuff let's go
ahead and have a vertical navigation
that's another common thing that you may
want so inside of that column which is
this text let's add in a h3 and we're
gonna say margin bottom for that
something might discovered I needed to
add secondary menu for the title and
then our actual menu here our navigation
so for a vertical navigation we add UL
class of a nav and it's going to be a
flex column and we're gonna have nav
pills so you can look up all that stuff
in the documentation for the nav section
which is a component in the
documentation and like I'll show you
actually what it looks like without nav
pills it's just a different way to kind
of style it so then we have our list
items nav items is similar to the
navigation we already defined up top a
class equals Naville Inc we can add
active just to show what that looks like
href going nowhere and then we'll say
active let's just copy this and then for
this let's remove that I will just put
link and this is coming pretty much from
the documentation very simple stuff
Wow I hate doing that and then we'll
have yeah we'll have one more
well to say this is what it looks like
to be disabled
simply add disabled and that's that
so if we save this and go back this is
our menu
all right cool stuff so the pills like
if we remove that I wanted to
demonstrate real quickly let me go back
you can see that's all it is the pills
to just give you a background color
based on what's active so yeah believe
it okay so I got a beer by the way of
course this is responsive we can check
it out down here there we go awesome
alright so I think I've demonstrated
enough in terms of you know how to use
the documentation for adding elements
based on your needs okay so now let's
talk about customization in bootstrap
for because right now this is cookie
cutter it's pretty standard and you're
probably going to want to customize the
look of this alright so we do all that
in the styles sass or the S CSS file
that we created so let's go back to that
real quick right here and initially we D
we put the variable overrides right here
at the very top and then we want to
import bootstrap sass files okay so what
we do that is through import we'll say
node modules bootstrap a CSS and
bootstrap alright so this will include
absolutely everything all the imports
and if according to the theming section
from which if I bring up right over here
and the documentation there's two ways
to go about this and let's come down
here yeah so this is the first method
that we just did and that's that
includes everything and then you can
just include only what you need and if
you include only what you need then
these three imports are required and
then these are optional so if you want
to make custom adjustments to say just
the grid then you
it just a grid right here alright so
hopefully you understand it but to make
it simple where it's gonna import
everything so now let's talk about some
probably the most common desire here and
we want to change the theme color here
in bootstrap for for our layout so we
don't want that blue because everybody's
probably using that blue especially the
newbies so to get an idea of what you
can control like which variables we're
gonna go to the node modules bootstrap
folder all right Kerry or is it that
there we go and we're gonna go into our
s CSS folder and we're gonna look at
variables s CSS alright so looking at
this this is a huge file by the way it's
all separated into different sections so
the first section is at the top
fortunately called color system so we
have all of these variables here and say
for instance we wanted to change some of
the theme colors well all the theme
colors are defined right here under the
theme colors map alright so we have
primary secondary success so we can see
that primary is just another variable
primary but if we go up and find primary
ok geez it's another it's another
variable but if we go up and find blue
well as I that is the actual blue that's
currently on the website and I'll just
you know I'll go back real quick that's
that blue right here so what if you
wanted to change that
very simple we'll come here we'll just
rear efference theme colors and we put
in parentheses and we're going to say
primary is now going to become I don't
know D nine five seven zero zero okay so
let's go ahead and put a semicolon at
the end and would save that so now
what's gonna happen sweet it becomes
this fiery orange type of color very
very simple so if you wanted to change
more of the default colors based on
whatever components that you have here
then again
you just go back to the variables you
see what you can change for secondary
success info warning danger light-dark
blah blah blah and you specify your
custom adjustments right here in your
styles and you just put a comma right
there and add them it's very simple
let's say for instance we want to change
the background color well if you just
study up enough.i we can find it I know
it's here somewhere
ah body so the body BG is by default
white and we also have a body color here
so let's go ahead and take that and
let's say we want to change our about
our body background color from white
let's say to like a light grey so that
happens to be let's see here Edie Edie
Edie and by the way and just to show you
here in Visual Studio code if you hover
over to this little section you can
change the color with a color picker
like that so now if we save this and go
back we'll see now we have our gray
background very light gray background
but it this looks like crap though right
because this is also gray it's actually
a shade off or whatever for our
jumbotron background and so you can also
make custom adjustments and so if you
wanted to change something specific that
you can't figure out how to do with
variables or maybe there's no variables
for it if we control shift I and we
click on the element that we want to
change all right we see that it says div
clash class rather Jumbotron and it has
a current background color if you want
to experiment right here in the browser
you can do that by clicking this and
we'll make it white for instance I like
that I think it looks a lot better
so we'll just change that div class of
jumbotron and if it's already defined
you may have to use the important flag
so it's called jumbo tron and then
inside of here background color
and important let's also add like a like
I guess you'd say like a shadow at the
top it makes it look like the navbar has
a shadow just something very very very
slight
so we'll say border top three pixel
solid RGB - nine - and nine - a nine the
only reason I'm using that is because I
actually that's what you know when you
change stuff here it uses RGB here so if
we save it now it's going to be white as
it refreshes and now we can see if I get
rid of this we have that very slight and
I'm sure if you can see it you know
custom adjustment that we have here
so now awesome alright so hopefully that
was a decent enough crash course for you
to really start getting your feet wet
you've learned how to integrate it in
terms of just being really quick and
just you know using the whole kitchen
sink with a CDN but also using in a more
robust development environment that
enables sass and then also learning how
to use this documentation which you know
it's huge if there were a proper course
done with this it would be hours upon
hours to try to cover every single type
of element which i think is unnecessary
all you need to understand is how to
read that bootstrap for documentation
here and it's they made it very simple
it's not complex and I think going
forward if you watch through this whole
thing you should be able to achieve
almost anything you want I in terms of I
you know you bootstrap for theming in
creating layouts essentially alright so
make sure you check out my site course
cetera comm and also of course as always
if you liked it subscribe here I'm going
to be having a ton more content at least
every couple maybe two or three or four
days for sure here on YouTube and on the
