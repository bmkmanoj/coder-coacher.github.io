letter and design course calm in this
tutorial we're gonna take a look at how
exactly to design this Microsoft logo
I'm gonna have to go really fast because
I only have about nine minutes or so I
with the promo that I have at the end
and the intro at the beginning to get
this tutorial done because ten minutes
total is the maximum time I can upload a
YouTube video that's their stupid
restriction I don't know why so let's go
ahead and get started it's gonna file
new with 800 height I'm gonna put at 500
you can put whatever you want just
something to fill up the space of the
screen and we're gonna start here with
the ellipse tool if that's not selected
just hold and drag out and select the
ellipse tool now choose a dark color for
our background it ok and then just hold
shift and get a perfect circle started
right here in the center okay so now
let's go ahead to the pen tool well
first we're gonna change our foreground
color to something like a real red slash
orange color then we're going to take
the pen tool with the shape layer
selected and we're just gonna try to get
the basic shape first and we'll be able
to reuse this for the other three window
panels I guess that's what you can call
them all right so dragged out and I'll
hold the Alt key click once get rid of
that tangent come down here you know it
may take you a while to get it right and
the shape at first hold alt and then
close it up now it looks like this side
is off too far so if you want to make
adjustments just go to your direct
selection tool select on the Anchor
Point and then use your arrow keys and
you can make finer adjustments alright
so that looks good now we have to give
it an emboss effect so let's break
double-click on
the right side of the layer with the
left mouse button that brings this up
let's go ahead and select bevel and
emboss and you see it makes the updates
in real time and let's go ahead and
change depth to something around 32% and
size down as well okay maybe just the
size can be up a tad bit all right and
then we want to change the top highlight
mode here that color to something like
almost in an orange a light orange color
and then the bottom one to something a
little bit darker okay all right then
we're going to give it a gradient
overlay so it's like that and click here
on gradient first Brannock cancel first
we're going to change it to a radial
gradient and then come over here and
move it to right about there and then
scale it up all the way angle also
changes the scale a little bit too we
want to come around here to make it big
and then click on gradient and then
select this first one right here and I'm
gonna do is just put one right next to
it and then get rid of this one you just
drag and pull it off bring this one all
the way over there double click on this
one we're gonna make it lighter like a
yellow so that gives it kind of a cool
effect hit OK hit OK and hit OK that's
our first one so what we're gonna do now
is duplicate it right click duplicate
layer hit OK and we're gonna move it
over
ooh as you can see I kind of messed up
this line should be adjusted more so
we're gonna delete that and we can make
a quick adjustment but go into a direct
selection tool selecting this one over
here we want these two lines to be
parallel basically let's see if that did
anything
duplicate layer' let's move it back over
all right that's that's better now we
have to flip this because it's not in
the right orientation so go edit
transform flip horizontal edit transform
flip vertical
all right there we go
all right so that's not too bad let's go
ahead and edit this one actually better
yet we'll take these two layers hold
ctrl and select both of them right click
duplicate layers hit OK and drop right
down so that they line up alright so
let's take our second one which is this
one right here and that one's gonna be
green so you just drop this down click
on gradient overlay click on the
gradient color this is the lighter color
so it's going to be a color like around
here hit OK and then this is gonna be
the darker green select right around
here hit OK hit OK and then move it over
here alright ok then we could change
bevel emboss so you could tell I there's
a little bit orange up here we could
just change this to a green and then
change this one something around there
hit OK then we got one over here this is
gonna be a blue one so let's click on
gradient overlay change it to a light
blue right here but ok double click on
that one
darker blue hit okay and above emboss
changes to light one change this one to
darker there we go
what we have to go back real quick gotta
put this right position hit okay and
then we have a final one right here same
steps let's click over here it's gonna
be actually it's gonna be very close
maybe just a little bit brighter and
then this one's gonna be near yellow
alright and I think it looks good
so it's sorry did the same exact thing
last time we go back over here and just
move this in the correct position hit OK
alright so those are our four little
layers I create this icon here and if
you have more time you can play further
refine the shape to make it look exactly
like what theirs does but now it's
focused on the background let's go ahead
and create a new layer so you can do
that through his keyboard shortcut or up
here new layer and we're gonna use a
previous layer to create a clipping mask
just like that hit OK then we're going
to choose the brush tool at like 300
feather brush then we're going to take
the foreground click here into this
background color and make a real light
blue and then just click once right
there pretty cool effect now we're going
to create another ellipse ok just above
it hold the shift alt and ctrl key all
at the same time after you click and
we'll put it right around there we want
it to be Center then we're going to
right-click rasterize layer' and then
change first i want to change the
brightness here
that doesn't affect it then what I want
to do is take the eraser tool and just
delete this part down here or get rid of
and we can change with the up ASA D make
it a little bit less and that is it as
you can see it's pretty easy to go ahead
and create something that looks pretty
impressive in a very short amount of
time alright that is all for now
Gary Simon here and go ahead and check
out design course comm if you haven't
already there are a lot of awesome
tutorials and I will see you later
good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
