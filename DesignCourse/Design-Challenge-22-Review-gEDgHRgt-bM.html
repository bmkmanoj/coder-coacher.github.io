the second or 22nd rather design
challenge review and it's time we had an
interesting result for the submissions i
would say out of all the logo design
challenges we've had I was most
impressed with these results and I think
that's probably because we restricted I
you to using nothing but perfect
circular angles so the result while you
know they were kind of similar the end
result was better when you get a new or
an aspiring designer 100% creative
freedom so anyhow I'm going to go down
here and just begin checking these out
okay so the first one we have from Mario
and this isn't I not bad i like the fact
that it's kind of a unique almost
perfect circular approach just seeing
right here now when I initially saw this
as i go well if you scale this down
that's going to get blurry there's not
enough way space you know you could
perhaps take the stroke weight down but
then he resubmitted and we could see
it's a bit better right here still
probably might be a little bit issues
maybe just take down the stroke of it
but overall I like the execution of it I
quite a bit so thanks for that I so we
have one from mo design lab here this
one I'm not too much of a fan of at the
top just because there's a tiny like
it's less than 1 pixel stroke on the
eyes and that's a little bit blurry it's
kind of like a no-no and we come down
here it's a front view I kind of still
kind of hard to tell what it is if you
didn't know initially I'm but
nonetheless you did stick to the
circular grid approach which is good
coming down here we have Dara and
looking at this I so I see with the
spiral thing so that's definitely fall
within you know a circular approach um
and looking over here it's not bad and I
sure it almost makes sense seems like
these these two should be connected I
but yeah overall I like the approach
definitely interesting and how you chose
to show the grid right here so thanks
for that insomniac I so they did decide
design in ArchiCAD I've never heard of
it but this is an architecture student I
like it definitely this is a good result
here for what we were trying to do so I
don't have anything negative to say
essentially about a very good job oops
let me come back up here alright so
another one from mo design lab I this
one I would say he's a little bit better
than the other ones for sure and here's
a different version of the one they
submitted before I I would say
definitely an improvement from the first
entries for sure all right bye mr.
pierre and this one wish we could solve
on maybe without the circular grid but I
no big deal I think I kind of blurred my
vision a little bit i could see it
without the red lines and overall i like
it definitely a unique kind of
perspective angle to approach on it kind
of like the other one up there too I
like that good job and this person
doesn't have any photo editing programs
I well that sucks i guess severe okay so
i say first attempt all right you know
overall this is not bad looking at this
I i'm not sure what this part is do they
have like a nose part coming offers it's
just the two antennae i have no clue
what this part is but either way I think
I you know everything done here is
pretty solid for sure so thanks for that
submission good job coming down here
been w yeah I think this definitely has
potential for sure but there are a
couple issues I you know the the spiral
or the circular shapes here a little bit
too small our way to smaller odd too
thin so if your scale it down you would
lose that it look blurry of course but I
like the general form of this and the
shape not too certain about the keys of
blues and greens and here i like the
general
form of this for sure so thanks for that
all right so we have Marilyn I'm not
sure what's going on down here just
because it seems separate from this guy
and in terms of you know thinking about
like a logo for instance there's way too
many lines here I it almost becomes you
look at it and it feels like one of
those illusions essentially so I would
look at you know so to some of these
other examples in terms of simplicity
and try not to get too technical with
everything you're trying to portray
thanks for the submission anyhow this is
just another version with the grid
alright so just looking at this all
right yeah that's it's definitely not
bad it's interesting approach i think
the just a tad bit too bright on that
here right there and some of these are
just a little bit too thin you know as i
mentioned them for money the other
entries off we thicken this up quite a
bit actually i think it would work
pretty well maybe just make a black
version just so we could see a little
bit better but either way it's
definitely a unique perspective and an
approach at this so it is great create
that creative thanks for the entry this
one initially I had no idea what was
going on because I couldn't see it the
form because it kind of looked like a
big nose was hanging out here in this
mouth with teeth and stuff but then I
realize you know this is the negative
space is a space between the eyes and
it's kind of just bending over very
interesting right the most creative
submission that we have here so I like
that good job for sure all right I
coming down here aye bruh him I think
that's how you pronounce that I so yeah
I'm not sure I would if I like this too
much I just we have this circular part
in proportion here but I'm not sure if
that's really the actual shape of a
snail head because it kind of just ends
here we have like a sharp angle right
there I think another thing that's
throwing it off for me is the eye
stroke right here is very thin one pixel
to pixel stroke that's going around
every single line I would get rid of
that entirely because it just adds
clutter and I would also get rid of this
as a whole as well right here just so we
can focus on the shape itself having
said that you stuck to the circular grid
approach which is good so thanks for the
submission that one looks like a
slightly angled approach and here's
another one right k PES so this isn't
bad if i get rid of the the shadow right
here just because it's unnecessary but
looking at the grid construction
everything's done well and yeah i think
that the colors kind of conflicted with
each other so i think if you changed one
of them to something else that goes a
little bit better it would be a little
bit more ideal but the shape itself is
good all right so when it comes to I
this one I'd say the the gradients are
kind of throwing it off a little bit
plus if you diesel divided the objects
you can kind of see little tiny pixels
in between the individual lines and
that's something that you can run into
sometimes when you do it that certain
way and then there's a tiny gradient
coming right here that's just kind of
throwing it off as well in my opinion
but the shapes not bad in and of itself
all right then I brahim I I like this
one I need to submit a couple other ones
previously we looked at already I like
this one the most I think out of your
submission so this is definitely an
improvement I and this one is amazing
like I've never seen in a submission
this good in my entire life I oh wait
that's me yeah I decided to submit one
just for the hell of it for the fun of
it I found that when I tried filling
this in with color I did not like it but
I did like just the stroked variation
but anyhow I hopefully you guys found
that to be a fun sort of challenge will
go ahead and for design challenge number
23 you guys can throw out some ideas I
think I you know these type of
simple / visual identity / logo design
challenges or something you guys like a
lot so I'll try to think of something
and you guys can throw out ideas if you
wish and I also I'm just about finished
with a course it's going to be a paid
course I'm getting rid of design course
premium I'm going to cancel that for a
while at least and I would be just
selling premium video courses I up there
project based so the first one can be on
responsive web design using foundation
the front-end framework and be taking
you from the mock-up design in photoshop
all the way to the final HTML and CSS
and show you some interesting front-end
technique so look out for that I within
the next week or two and it's not going
to be expensive at all anyhow that's it
so if you haven't yet check out design
course calm and subscribe here on
YouTube alright goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
