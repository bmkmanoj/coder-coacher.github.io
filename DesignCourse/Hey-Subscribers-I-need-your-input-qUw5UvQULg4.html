design course calm and I apologize for
the month that I've been away now before
I continue I just wanted to know what
you're looking at here is something I
want you to take so if you click on the
very first link in the description of
this YouTube video you'll be led to this
page and I would like you to fill it out
I before I'm also going to describe why
but first I due to the absence that I've
been away for you know the month or so
it's been basically due to a couple of
factors first I've been working a lot on
an Android app design and development
course with Viv's from slider calm and
we hope to have that done in a couple
months at the latest and then secondly I
wanted to use that time to evaluate the
direction this channel should take so
I've been a bit unsatisfied with the
viewer engagement which is stuff like
comments views and likes that each of my
videos have gotten and that's because
this channel is very diverse in the
topics that it teaches so I've done
videos on logo design web design 3d
graphic design illustration photo
manipulation unity etc etc you get the
gist and because of that you know my
61,000 subscriber base here is spread
out over a lot of different topics and
generally speaking that's kind of a bad
thing so I really wanted to start
focusing on just one or two different
topics so that's why I need your help
here I need you to click on the first
link in description this video as I
mentioned and very quickly it's only two
questions as you can see and submit this
very quick survey so you know which
topic would you like to see videos about
the most you know web design or the
graphic design illustration you know
basically you know how did you find my
channel and what are you most interested
okay and then what type of content would
you like to see the most would you like
to see tutorials live video training
google has this live thing I've never
done one but you know we'll see what the
interest is in there I the design
challenges are more other and just
specify you can only choose one so
whatever you would like to see the most
go ahead and choose it all right and
then just hit submit and it's going to
allow you to see you know
other people's answers as well so
additionally I've also been really busy
learning a lot about digital painting
and I'm definitely considering launching
a brand new channel specifically geared
towards that topic covering portraits
landscapes fundamentals and more so look
out for that and of course when I do
launch that channel you'll be notified
here with a video on at this current
channel just to show you something that
I've been working on recently is if you
haven't checked out that the show it's a
new show by you on USA called mr. robot
it's really cool show anyhow this is the
main character and this is a portrait
that I did of him so yeah very excited
to start learning about digital painting
and i still have ways to go so that new
channel won't be coming up anytime too
soon but just wanted to show you that
with that with you and why I've kind of
been gone for the past month and I'll
fill this out and let me know of any
thoughts you have in the comments and
I'll see you later alright thanks in
talk to you later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
