calm and finally a new logo tutorial and
this time we're going to be focusing on
a logo design one that includes an
animal of some sort like a mascot and
also one that is also designed within a
circle or an emblem alright that's a
type of logo mark basically so this type
of logo of course would be ideal for
organizations that have mascots or
animal mascots like sports teams
alright so to follow along the only
thing you're going to need is a copy of
Adobe Illustrator CC and to make this a
little bit more challenging
I found a random animal generator online
and it's a website I just click a button
and it generates a random animal now
assuming it doesn't give me some crazy
animal I've never heard of before and
trust me there's a lot of them I'm going
to force myself to use that animal to
design and I suggest you do the same
thing just to make this a little bit
more challenging if you don't already
have an animal in mind all right so I'm
going to forward over to the screen so
you can watch me pick this animal
alright so I'm at random let's calm
forward-slash random animals and I found
that on a quick Google search and I'm
going to type in just one for the
quantity and hit enter what the hell is
a springbok I want something a little
bit more recognizable than that an
opossum alright an opossum not exactly
the most frightening animal I advise you
never to choose it for a mascot if
you're ever going to have a sports team
the damn thing
plays dead when it's frightened so
anyhow I'm going to stick to it though
we're going to design a logo for this
type of animal alright let's get started
so here in Adobe Illustrator I'm going
to go to file and new and for the width
in height I'm going to specify something
that works well at a hundred percent at
my current resolution now I am on a 4k
resolution on a monitor but I'm working
at 1920 by 1080 resolution for this
video so I'm going to specify 1350 by
870 and we also have advanced down here
color mode I'm going to leave at RGB
just we have brighter colors to work
with the name we'll just type in logo
here and everything else should be
consistent with this and we'll hit OK
alright
so if you hit control 1 that gives us
200% and I'll get our documents centered
here if your artboard is kind of too
large for your 100% view you can click
right here for the artboard tool and you
can simply drag this to reshape your
artboard you can also old hold alt to
make it affect both the top and bottom
or right and left all right ok so the
first thing we're going to do is I'm
going to change to the ellipse tool and
because we're trying to create an
ellipse logo that's the very first shape
that we're going to specify so I'm just
going to left-click hold shift and alt
and I will scale it from the center and
we'll create a size something right
around here doesn't have to be exactly
consistent with mine for the stroke
we're going to have a pretty large
stroke I'd say right around for this
size around 27 points and this is going
to be a very important number because we
want the rest of our strokes that define
the character to be 27 points as well
now consistency is extremely important
when it comes to logo design you want to
make sure that you're consistently using
colors you're also using your style
consistently and also things like stroke
widths so consistency is king so now
that we have our ellipse it's now time
to make some important decisions such as
the orientation and position of the
character you know where's the head
going to be do we want to show the full
body do we want to show just one aspect
of the body these are all important
considerations and there's no right or
wrong answer so it's just about
experimenting really and so the decision
I've come up with is to have the head
just kind of low following this ellipse
portion right here and it's going the
body's going to flow around like this
and the tail is going to end up over
here kind of wrapping around because
then opossums tail is very long and thin
all right so the first part I'm going to
focus on is the head in particularly the
nose which is going to end up right
around here so at this point you can
either choose to do this
all on illustrator on the computer with
your mouse or if you have a tablet you
can do that as well or you can just
sketch on pen and paper to get your
ideas down there's really no right or
wrong way it's whatever you feel
comfortable with all right so I'm just
going to take the pen tool here and
right here if I click right on this
stroke path it's going to add an anchor
point we don't want that so I'm going to
back up and instead I'm just going to
lock this layer and that way we can't
really use it however if you could just
barely see it if you hover over at the
center of your stroke you can see a
little pink path name it's very tiny on
my screen so it may be hard to see but
you want to be able to hover over that
and that's a smart guide and basically
you want to try to whenever you're
creating these anchor points you want to
make sure that you're using these guides
to know exactly where you're clicking at
all right so I'm just going to click the
left click once right here with the pen
tool so now you can see we have this
anchor point with this line
you know dictating wherever the mouse is
at now I'm just going to create a
another portion right near where the
mouth is and then just come up slightly
all right and then I'm going to hit the
Escape key and then what I want to do is
just beneath this portion I'm going to
have it like a little mouth here and
just for reference if I go to Google
Images and type in a possum we could see
you know that the mouth if we find a
good side profile the mouth the bottom
of the mouth is very close to this
general shape and if we find the side
profile here where the mouth is closed
we could see that more easily
identifiable but it's basically a cone
so the the bottom of the mouth is not
very prominent so I'm just going to
click right around here and then come up
right around here so I'm left clicking
and dragging I'm holding the mouse
button like this to create a slight
Bezier curve in the shape that I want it
alright so if I select this and we can
see right here we have the foreground
color and then we have the stroke color
well we don't want a foreground color at
all for our strokes so we're just going
to over here in the swatches click this
red dash and that will get rid of any
foreground color that shows up and
starts overlapping another thing I want
to do at this point I'm going to take
both of our paths I'm going to click on
stroke right here and we're going to
make these rounded so watch what happens
when I click this there we go very good
so we have the basic part of a mouth
here and one of the great things about
the pen tool is you can use the direct
selection tool to modify your anchor
points that you placed initially so if i
zoom up and I want to make some slight
adjustments to the position of these
anchor points we could do that with ease
so if I wanted to make just maybe make
this eye a little bit shorter I'm using
my keyboard arrow keys and maybe I want
to bring this in just a tad bit I can do
that as well we can also take these
these little handles and you hover over
it and you can make adjustments to the
Bezier curves all right okay so now I'm
going to add in an eye using the ellipse
tool so I'm just going to take the
ellipse tool left click shift alt and
it's going to be a pretty small eye now
we don't need a stroke on this so first
I'm going to fill this with black on the
foreground and then take the stroke off
right there okay all right now next what
I want to do is focus on the body
portion the belly that wraps around this
way all right so I'm going to go ahead
and click on one of my existing paths
and I'm going to take the pen tool and
we're going to hover over the path I'm
going to left-click probably somewhere
right around here and I'm going to just
left-click
drag to create a Bezier curve and we'll
have it end somewhere right around here
now this isn't a very perfectly smooth
flowing sort of shape you can see it
kind of extends out here and then it
abruptly falls off so the way we can fix
this is by taking the direct selection
tool we'll click on this anchor point
right here so we can see both the
handles and we can make some adjustments
to make this flow a little bit better so
I've a control one this is basically
what I have going so far okay so now
what I want to do is go ahead and work
on adding kind of a foot that's coming
down here so I'll go ahead once again
and take the pen tool and I'll start
roughly right around here and I'll
create just the leg portion just like
that
I'll hold alt and left-click and what
doing that does is allows you to put
your next anchor point without any of
the directional Bezier handles affecting
the path so if I were to click right
here that's creating a shape that I
don't like so if I alt and left click
I can now create kind of a very very
small simple foot alt left-click and
maybe come down around here alt left
click right there and then create the
next portion where as the back of the
leg and it's just going to flow very
simply into this path just like that
alright so now if i zoom out we'll see
this is what we have now you may at this
point need to make some adjustments so
I'm just going to take the direct
selection tool make a tad bit bigger and
make some just small adjustments
basically like that I mean want to take
this make it just a tad bit thicker
and right there's good all right and
another thing I want to do is go ahead
and make a tail kind of wrap around here
and what I'm going to do for this
portion instead of just creating a tail
from scratch using the pen tool I want
it to be very spear like so what we'll
do is I'm going to unlock this initial
layer right here I'm going to go to
window and we're going to go to
transform which is showing up at the
bottom of my screen it's going to bring
up this dialog box and we're going to
make sure scale strokes and effects is
turned off if it's left on let me show
you what happens first I'm going to
duplicate this stroke so I'm going to
control C control f it's now duplicated
you can see down here there's two of
them and if I scale this down it scales
down the stroke as well which we don't
want so what we need to do is turn off
scale strokes and effects so now when I
scale this down the path itself the
stroke maintains the same 27 point
stroke width that we specified okay so
now what we want to do is get this
scaled down to the size that we want it
and we want it to naturally flow around
this portion to make it look as if it's
another part or just a natural extension
of this path right here alright also
another thing that we could do real
quick is we can turn off the fill
because we don't need that and I'm just
going to scale this up holding shift and
using my transform tools just to get
this into a position that I like alright
so if I hover over both of these we want
these paths to basically intersect as
you can see they're not there yet there
they are so now they're very close to
each other and the position of this as
well is also very important
you almost want it to make it look like
this right here coming off of this leg
is a natural extension as well of this
tail that comes off we could also choose
to make it just a tad bit bigger
reposition it alright I think I like
that position right there pretty good so
now what we'll do is take the add Anchor
Point tool and we have to determine
where we want this thing to end so I'm
just going to add an anchor point right
here on that path then I'm going to take
the direct selection tool we'll go ahead
and select these two anchor points
holding shift and then hit delete all
right so we have an issue down here and
although I'm not really concerned about
with that we do just back up real quick
and we can add another anchor point
right around here and then we'll take
those other two and hit delete there we
go so now what we want to do is take
this path that we just created and we'll
go to stroke little changes to round cap
okay so now I'm just control one and
we'll see what that looks like okay so
it's not very impressive so far almost
looks kind of like a fish but when we
add more details like the air the air
it'll look a lot better so now I'm going
to do is focus on that ear portion we'll
take the pen tool and we're going to
left-click right around here I'm going
to left-click and just create a Bezier
curve that kind of creates the top
portion of an air an ear or not air
right around there and I'm going to alt
and left click and drag that bezzie a
handle in just a little bit alright to
create a ear shape that's just roughly
right around there so I'm going to click
on this and make sure we're back to the
round caps alright and I'm going to zoom
out I also want to create a quick nose
so I'm going to zoom up down here I'm
going to take the pen tool left click
right here on this path and left click
right here on this path create a slight
busy angle there now I also want this
mascot to look a little bit fierce so
the way I'll do that is I'm going to
make sure that we get rid of a stroke
and we'll just have a white fill we'll
take
depend tool and we'll click right around
here and just cut out the top portion of
the eye to create kind of like a eyebrow
and it makes them look just a little bit
more fierce instead of just real cute
and cuddly which we don't want okay so
now I want to focus on this ear portion
right here and creating some white space
between this outer path in the ear
itself as well as cutting out this
portion right here from the tail all the
way to the nose okay now as far as our
strokes are concerned our main strokes
that use this 27-point width right here
I'm complete so at this stage what I
want to do is take everything and I'm
going to hit ctrl C ctrl F that
duplicates everything and then ctrl G
and that will stick it up in a group and
I'm going to simply hide it and the
reason I've done that is if in case I
need to go back well I already have it
maintained here because now I'm going to
make sure you hide that by the way I'm
going to select everything that we have
and I'm going to go to object path and
outline stroke it's showing up off the
side of my screen so just make sure you
click on outline stroke from this pull
out menu here so notice what it did it
basically took all these paths that I
created and it created paths out of the
strokes themselves so you can no longer
edit the stroke width of these paths
that's why I created a duplicate copy of
a group right there okay so now all we
need to do I want to create some
separation between this stroke right
here and the ear it makes a little bit
difficult to see what exactly is
happening so to do that I'm going to
take a white foreground color here no
stroke and I'm going to click right here
on this path and I'm just going to
follow the path angle right around here
alright and I'm going to follow it down
right around there and then I'm going to
click up right around here and then
follow it back around like this right
around here all right so now if hey
control one we'll see
the basic effect that created and you
want a lot of space because when we
scale this down to smaller sizes you
don't want any pixelation or blurring
there it still maintains a good white
space between those paths so now I'm
going to do basically the same thing
right here to get rid of this section
over here so we'll take the pen tool I'm
going to left-click I'm just going to go
straight down or create a pointy nose
which is no problem now I'm going to
come out right around here
left click create a Bezier curve here
alt left click I'm going to come up
around this path and follow this general
shape right there now I'm going to
probably have to make some adjustments
to that but that's no big deal now we
want to subtract this here this shape
that we created from this shape right
here so to do that first have to select
this and you'll notice there's different
paths in here it's in a group I'm going
to right click and choose ungroup so now
we could just select this single path
here and I'm also going to hold shift
and left click and select here and then
we'll choose minus front so notice how
it gets rid of that right away and now
we have just a slight issue right here
and all we have to do to correct that is
we could have to create another shape -
- front that or we could just bring this
in slightly to match that path and there
we go okay there's also one other slight
issue down here I want to fix we can see
this is kind of sticking out just
slightly so I could take this anchor
point right there and bring it in
actually I think what I'll do is leave
it where it was and I'll take I the pen
tool and we'll come out on this path and
just slightly barely angle it out there
we go so I just created another path
right there to fill those in now you can
see when you go back to 100% it looks
like it took away our work but it didn't
really
all it did is we have it right here we
can drag this above and now we can also
subtract that from this shape just like
that so now there's no white path there
which is important because if this is
placed on a different color background
you would see this white blotch and it
would look terrible so now what I want
to do is we're going to add a secondary
texture or color into this design for
just reinforcing just the eye area and
the fur so I'm going to start with the
first section first and real quickly
this keeps on showing up and I hover
over it so I'm just going to lock that
and I'm going to zoom up and and this is
going to be a little bit repetitive so
I'll show just the process of what it
takes the first couple times and then I
will speed up the video so you have to
sit there waiting needlessly through
this portion so I'm going to start right
around here and I think I'll start it
right here so I'm just dragging out to
create a slight Bezier curve and then
I'm going to alt left click and I'm just
going to come out here right around here
with a slight Bezier curve alt left
click and then come up right there
another slight pezzi a curve and then do
it again all right and then come up here
slight bezier curve and come down again
and i'm going to do this all the way
down to here right so now i'm just going
to speed up the video so you don't have
to see here do the whole thing
actually instead of using this I gray
here we're just going to make it black
and so I'm going to select this color
right here and we're going to start
right here come down create a Bezier
curve and I always want to match up with
my next anchor point right on this
outline or the path rather I'll come
down here and I kind of want them to
flow with the ones I already put so
there should be around an equal amount
all right and sometimes you may I select
the it'll select a different path by x
and then you just have to select back on
I'm going to go ahead and speed up at
this port point
all right so that is done I'm going to
go ahead and come up around just the
same way we did before all right so if I
control one this is what it should look
like so far and now I want to add one
final detail in terms of fur and so I'm
going to take the pen tool we're going
to use this color here
and I'm going to start roughly right
around here I'm going to create just a
slight Bezier curve then I come down
right here like that so just to show you
what this this shape looks like that's
what it basically looks like and then
sorry about that
then what I'm going to do is I take this
control C control F to duplicate it move
it over we're going to rotate it
slightly hold shift to scale it down and
we kind of just want it to flow with
this natural angle here and if you scale
it up you know or down too far you can
always scale it back up using I control
T all right and then we're going to keep
on doing this a few more times and again
I'll go ahead and speed this part of the
video up pretty unnecessary
all right and that adds basically just a
little bit more detail I another part I
wanted to add some details right here
first of all let's use the Pathfinder to
cut this out so let's go to window I
let's see here a Pathfinder your where
are you now we already have it open
transform right here I will go ahead and
select this and - front ok now we want
to use this color the same color here
and the reason I want to add this is
because if you look at the opossum we
have just a dark portion underneath the
eyes and it also kind of comes out to
this side as well so I'm just going to
add some shading there I'm just sort of
trying to make it look more like an
opossum so I'm going to start here I
here here and down here and connect it
up there and then just drag it beneath
that eyelet path which is right there
control 1 and of course if you want to
make some adjustments to it with the
direct selection tool you're free to do
so okay so this is the general shape
pretty much completed now I did tamper
with the idea of adding you know a leg
up here or one would actually exist but
it really just ended up cluttering
everything and so I still think it looks
effective without it shown now of course
you may be asking yourself I you know
it's a little bit bland very
monochromatic well that is pretty much
consistent with how a an opossum looks
they don't have color however you may be
making this for a school and you have
school colors that are that need to be a
team rather that need to be integrated
into the logo itself so colorizing this
isn't that difficult so I'll show you
how to do that real quick first I'm
going to take everything we have here
make sure none of the layers are locked
real quick just by scrolling up and down
and I take it and we're going to hit
control C control F and then control G
so we have a new copy here of the black
and white version of this logo now we're
going to take this as seen here and
we're going to add a lips behind it
pintos clicking left clicking and
hitting shift and alt while dragging out
and it doesn't have to be perfectly
placed initially we'll go ahead and
worry about that in a second and what we
want to do is let's say for example
we're going to make this a blue color
okay so let's make this a little bit
larger we need to make sure this is
centered perfectly as possible right now
I'm just eyeballing it alright and so
now we're going to make this blue and
we're gonna try to make it stand out a
bit more already I see a problem here we
have this eye white layer I think we can
get rid of that I'm just going to hit
delete all right I real quickly I though
another thing I wanted to do is kind of
fill in this ear a little bit more so I
think what I'm going to do real quickly
is take this right here I'm going to
keep this layer even it's at the very
bottom all the rest I'm going to delete
real quickly I'm just going to back up
real quick I'm going to make my
adjustment here on this black and white
version because you want all your
versions to have the same form so that's
why I'm doing this and it's going to be
just a little bit thicker because the
ears are quite black on an opossum just
like that alright so it just makes the
ear stand out a little bit more I'm
going to go ahead and put this into that
group here ok so now I'm going to take
this control C ctrl F I'm going to right
click over here ungroup it alright and
we're going to hide the copy of it you
can eat it alright so now we're back to
where we were
I'm going to go ahead and use the direct
selection tool to select that white and
delete it ok so now how would we
colorize this well this gray looks
really bad because we change the
background from white to blue so what we
need to do is select all of our gray
object layers just right here just
holding shift to select all of them and
let's go ahead and use the eyedropper
tool to make it the same color as the
blue
and then we'll go ahead and double-click
it and make it slightly darker and hit
okay and still I think we could probably
go even darker than that all right and
now what I want to do is add this color
we just created to our swatches so I'm
gonna left click hold down and drag it
over here so let's look at that now now
I think the this character here the
actual animal can pop out a little bit
more so what we could do is make it an
even brighter sort of blue in this area
so what we'll do is I'm going to zoom up
and I'm going to just outline this
character here I'm going to start right
here and we're going to make it come out
this darker blue that we're going to
eventually use all right to around here
all right and I'm going to keep on going
all the way around down to here now
because I can't see it I'm going to go
ahead and take this I could just take
the opacity down or just drag it to the
almost to the very bottom there we go
and now we can see of course it's not
going to be this darker blue color that
it currently is I'm going to change that
after we get down to here all right so
now you take this color and first I'm
going to get this color right here and
then double click and make it quite a
bit brighter so now it even stands out
much more now I think this color right
here that it shows is a little bit too
dark so I'm just going to select these
real quick and get this color and then
just make it a little bit darker like
that control one okay um if you wanted
to you can make this stand out just a
little bit more by doing something like
adding a shadow beneath it I'll show you
how to do that real quick we'll take
this black we'll go ahead maybe right
here kind of just create a little shadow
that goes maybe from here to there
and we can use the opacity to change
this so we'll take the opacity down
maybe around 36% it just kind of gives
it a little bit more depth at me kind of
makes it pop off and you can do small
things like that if you wish and I now
let's say for example you want to add a
second color well let's go ahead and
take everything and group it ctrl g +
ctrl c ctrl F hide this bottom one and
now let's create one that's like a two
color variation so the way we do that
we'll take the direct weight because
it's already in a group if you try to
select any given layer it's not going to
work so you can use the direct selection
tool just to select a specific path and
now we can make it a different color
like that for instance which doesn't
look too bad I although one real quick
adjustment we could make I this clashes
a little bit what we could do is take
this color the red color and make this
come out like that and then we could
take this put it right there and drag it
to the very bottom of that group all
right just something like that okay so
now what we could do is take all these
if I take them all three of these make
sure they're all selected scale it down
move this one over here and then this
one over here and there we basically go
I my OCD is not going to let me end the
tutorial with this kind of not aligned
correctly so I'm going to move it just
over there a little bit
and I'm going to take this control C
control F and we're going to drag it
into this group the blue group and put
it right at the bottom we're going to
move it over and then make it this blue
just so things are matching up correctly
I think what I did is move the wrong one
of course I did
one second all right there I go I pause
that and I made that quick adjustment
real quick alright so here we go one
thing another quick adjustment going to
make this isn't using absolute black if
we click this using a direct selection
tool and double-click this will find
that it's actually not six zeros which
is a hex color code for black it's kind
of like the CMYK black version so what I
want to do is double click on my magic
wand tool make sure to fill color
specified at 32 will select this it's
going to select all the black and
actually I may change this down to one
okay and there we go now what I did is
use this and go all the way to the very
bottom it should now be six zeros and
now we have a much more darker black
basically and that is it hopefully you
were able to learn a lot throughout this
video
just remember it's all about pinpointing
the features that make the animal the
most recognizable and then simplifying
those features if you do that you'll
have yourself an effective animal based
logo right on Gary Simon with design
course comm and I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
