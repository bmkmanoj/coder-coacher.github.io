and today I'm covering a real small sort
of topic but it is huge in the world of
CSS and that is CSS variables now in the
past as many of you know you would have
to use a preprocessor of some sort like
sass in order to use the power of
variables in your CSS but now that's no
longer the case and we can see that if
we switch over to can I use calm we can
see currently it's at 87% supported so
there's a lot of support for it it's
only going to grow and so therefore you
know if you're a front-end guy it's
something that's definitely worth
considering and checking out in the
future so of course the big advantage to
this being is that you know you don't
necessarily have to use a preprocessor
just for variable support oh but real
quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera com
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on all right
let's get back to it
all right so just to demonstrate how
they work I have open visual studio code
along with an empty folder so just
create an empty folder somewhere and
open it up and you'll see the same
screen here so I'm gonna create a new
file just an index.html and then also
another new file called main CSS and in
our index.html I'm gonna hit ctrl B to
get rid of the sidebar and let me make
things large so you can see them
I I'm going to get some just some
starter HTML so you just if you're using
Visual Studio code just hit the
exclamation point and enter okay so also
by the way make sure you check out the
written version of this tutorial if you
want to just copy and paste some I'm
HTML and CSS as we're working along here
and that of course is in the first link
of the description here in YouTube okay
so the next thing the very first thing
we want to do is go ahead and just
create a reference here to
our main CSS file right here
alright let's just go let's rename this
I'm kind of like compulsive about this
okay
and also our body tag here I'm just
going to put in some basic HTML to
demonstrate the CSS portion so div class
equals wrapper we'll say I will put in
another container here and then inside
we'll just have a few type elements so
like an h1 with my awesome CSS variables
alright we'll also put in a paragraph at
this point I don't really want to sit
here typing out a sentence so I'm just
gonna copy and paste that content and
then also just a button should you want
to experiment further I don't actually
think I style this down here I'm gonna
have one more paragraph element and
we'll use this to demonstrate CSS
inheritance in terms of variables so I'm
another paragraph down here outside of
that container class okay alright so
we'll save that we're good to go there
and let's go to our main CSS so now the
topic you've all been waiting for how do
you define an actual CSS variable well
very simple all right and it is quite
different though in comparison to
something like sass so what we do you
know when it comes to sass you would put
like your variable up here and define
the property in here you when comes to
inherent CSS variables you I have to
specify them within a a rule set of some
sort with a selector so we're gonna use
the root pseudo class here and we're
going to put in a variable so the way
you start a variable or a custom
property as it is technically you start
off with two dashes and then you give it
a name so we'll call this this property
name or this variable site - BG alright
then we put a coin as if it's just a
normal regular property and then a value
so we'll say
one e9c five which is like a washed out
yellow color and so now in order to use
it we can let's say we'll put well you
put it on the body element we'll make
the background color the site BG
property so background and we'll say far
now this is how you use the variable
that we just defined above for the
property so we put var and we put in the
name all right so if we want to see this
in the browser and don't worry I'm gonna
describe what's happening up here
momentarily so they hit ctrl b to get
this up reveal an explorer and just
double click and let me get rid of that
there we go we can see we now have the
background changing and this
demonstrates of course that the CSS the
custom property your variable is now
working before of course you can never
have done this without a preprocessor
okay so when you add or you define a
custom property on say for instance this
route the pseudo class here that means
that all the elements within the HTML
document are going to have access to
this property defined right here all
right so that also means logically that
you can apply this to other selectors so
such as body such as like maybe just a
paragraph and you'll see if you did save
this as right here if you left this as a
paragraph this would no longer work
because this right here doesn't have
access to this this paragraph that's not
it's it's not a child element of it all
right so let's say I switch back and go
back real quick and now let's go ahead
and actually give a better demonstration
of inheritance when it comes to CSS
variables sorry my throat is like going
crazy so you can define these CSS
variables on these other selectors and
not just route as I mentioned so let's
say for instance that we want only the
type within our container
to be bold outside of say this one so to
do that let's go ahead and we'll say on
container will define a property called
type weight and it will be bold alright
so then let's go ahead and say container
and we'll also add wrapper and we'll say
font weight again we use the VAR
function here and we pass in type weight
all right so all we're saying is we're
pet we're making the font-weight:bold
alright and we're doing it for both the
container and the wrapper all right so
you would think okay I we see that
wrapper inside of wrapper is a paragraph
element but inside a container is
another paragraph out of it so it's
gonna make both of them bold all right
well if we save that wrong one and go
here we'll see just the top one is bold
and not the bottom one which is
contained within wrapper class and
that's because we've only defined the
actual value of type weight inside of
container and not wrapper all right
so to also I demonstrate another feature
of this function right here I we can use
what are called CSS variable fallback
values so what we can do is I when we
have this variable and we're passing in
a custom property we can put a comma for
a second argument in which we can
specify a fallback value if this is not
defined right here so we can just say
bold so if we save that refresh and
there we go this one is now bold all
right so a I mean that's basically how
the CSS variables work in a nutshell
they're very simple there's not much to
it however we can also access the CSS
variable
property or the values as in we can also
set them within JavaScript itself so
just to demonstrate this real quickly it
will just use I vanilla vanilla
JavaScript as it's called just raw
JavaScript down here and the first thing
we have to do is we'll say we'll get the
body element so document query selector
body and then we'll say if we just want
to get it then we'll say okay my var
equals get compute computed not
computation computed style of body and
we'll say get property value and what's
the name of the property well site BG is
one of them that we created the first
one and just to show that we have the
actual value of it we can console.log my
var so now if we go back here hit
control shift I to get the console and
refresh we could see right there is the
actual background color we can also set
it through JavaScript as well so for
instance I let's go ahead we'll set it
body dot style dot set property the
property is site BG and the value that
we want to set to we'll make it a new
value obviously as well say ffcc o which
is like a yellow orangish color I
believe and then we'll just leave this
here as well and we'll still console.log
it to show that the property or the
variable value has been overwritten so
to this to this value right here so if
we save go back we'll see it right there
that's the initial one refresh and there
we go all right so just a very quick
rundown as you can see it's really
simple to use these but it's a really
big topic I mean how long has CSS been
around like 25 plus years or whatever
and so do you know with that said it's
been a long time coming I mean they
should have had the
I mean my estimation a long time ago but
it's only gonna get better so in the
world of CSS exciting things are kind of
happening with the CSS grid I that's you
know pretty much at the same level of
support if you even if you check out can
I use calm and now the variables alright
so make sure you check out course cetera
