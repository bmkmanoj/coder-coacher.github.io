of design course comm and today is
January 14th with our 14th video of the
year and we're going to focus on
designing a really cool gamers type of
website in Adobe Photoshop CC so as
always you can access the project files
beneath the video for free and also
check out design course comm where we'll
have paid courses in the future we may
have it right now depending on when
you're watching this right now there's
just an email submit there so that you
can be notified when we do release full
paid courses okay so let's get started
okay so first you're gonna want to
download the project files that are
available beneath this video in the
description and once you've downloaded
that I also by the way I've updated my
site so that it will require a user
registration so that's just a one-time
thing so I basically go ahead and just
register it's free of course and then
you'll have access to downloading the
files and then once you get them
extracted we'll go ahead to open them
and we have these three files right here
so the grid is what we want to open up
first and it's a large file so I'm gonna
hit ctrl one just to go up to 100% and
I'm on a 1280 by 720 resolution just for
this video usually I've got 1900 by 1200
but I if I just zoom out once I'm at
66.7 and everything fits within the
screen and so basically if hit control H
and get rid of the guides right there
and if you turn on grid you'll see the
grid this is a 12 column grid now it's
based on I 1140 IP XCOM I believe and
basically that's a responsive framework
so when if you were to take this into
HTML and CSS then you would want to you
know use this this grid PSD and if
you've never really designed a website
based on a grid system you understand
how it works once we get started all
right so I the first thing we're going
to do this is going to be for a gaming
website so I'm going to make the website
the background darker so let's go ahead
and change our foreground color here to
an almost black I'm just gonna choose
somewhere around here you see we have 19
19 19 for the color code I'll hit okay
and then I'm just gonna fill that in and
now what I want to do is get a header
going so let's get that started we'll
take out make sure you got the rectangle
tool selected here and we're going to
change the foreground we're gonna do a
color pick the background cut the
current color here and then just go
slightly lighter up to around here hit
OK and then we will pull up just like
that and I held all the Alt key just to
get it to work correctly like that
because otherwise if you do this then
holding alt will change how is it is
drugged-out all right so now what I want
to do is go ahead and just get a logo
I'm not gonna really spend the proper
time making a proper logo since this is
just more about the actual you know the
website design so I'm gonna just get a
real quick logo designed right here so
I'm going to type skull Wars that's the
really cheesy name I came up with this
and we'll take the type tool here change
the foreground to white and make sure
it's left in line there ctrl T and we'll
scale up a bit
let's see right around there looks good
so you know 100 percent just to see what
this looks like now we want it to be in
line with the first grid so the column
rather so that looks good let me scale
that down just a little bit and in
control T okay so real quickly I'm just
going to give it a a couple layer styles
here so double-click on the right hand
side of the layer and bring up the layer
Styles dialog and we'll
go ahead and choose a gradient and take
the gradient editor here and we'll make
this like a mid gray color and then we
will also get a drop shadow very
slightly take the angle around 120 and
take the size down just a little bit and
right around there so 1 0 and 3 here for
those values we'll hit OK alright so
that is our logo for a game and I'm
gonna zoom out here real quick and then
we want to have a navigation over here
I'm a fan of simple navigations and not
really elaborate buttons or anything so
that's what I'm gonna do here let's get
off the grid and we're gonna have this
span
we'll see we'll just say out to the last
six columns so left click hold drag out
and I'll type in some navigation links
here so the game so I just spaced out
about 13 times based on my current size
and font and then I'm just gonna take
everything from here to there and then
just paste about that many links so then
I'm gonna change the individual names
here register help helper support so and
then contact and then just gonna write a
line nice ok so let me get rid of the
grid here I'm gonna get these into view
and right now we're at Arial bold I
could just change this to regular I
could zoom up here see what those look
like at full size and we can use their
up and down arrows to position those a
little bit better
now the signify which link is currently
selected or which page we're on I'm
going to take the last 4 change the
color here
just to slightly like have a mid gray
color right around there all right all
right that looks good
and now I'm gonna hit control one or
rather I'm going to zoom out and now
what I want to do is just give this a
very light gradient so I'm going to call
this navbar and I'm going to double
click on it and it will bring up the
layer styles and we'll choose a gradient
overlay and let's go ahead and I'm gonna
select the preset one right there and
let's see
just slightly darker here we could see
it's very light faint gradient okay all
right
so I then just one more thing zoom out
once again and I'm gonna hold shift with
the line tool one second and that way it
stays perfectly horizontal and we could
see let me zoom up here now take the
move tool and use your up and down
arrows and we want it to go I think
right there so if we zoom up a lot you
see how that looks all right so far so
good so what I want to do is take all
these layers and I'm going to group them
so take a lot of them hit ctrl G and
then we'll just call this nav all right
or you could call a header all right so
so far so good now I'm going to create
another rectangle and we're gonna
position that beneath the header it'll
start just a bit below it or above it
rather and dragged out to right around
there change the foreground color to
black
all right and now we're going to get a
little bit technical we're going to do
a little bit of photo manipulation so
we're gonna get out that skull and let
me get up my browser window here this is
where I got this skull from from I
demand faith and so if you want to visit
this URL I also have it in the linked in
a description and this will be also the
second image that we use alright so this
is a really large image so I we want to
clean this up and get rid of the
background so to do that we can use the
background eraser tool so you left-click
drag out and select it and I'm going to
choose a larger size and alt click there
and then just go around and the way you
want to do this is you don't want to
select inside here where this little
crosshair is you just want to go outside
and then we will probably have some
areas to clean up so we just keep on
going around
and around okay so once you have that
cut out take the alas Oh tool here and
we're just gonna go all the way around
we could fix that I went into the skull
a little bit but we'll just wait till
after we're done there we go and then
you can hold shift if that happened to
you and just go like this now you go
ahead and hit ctrl C to copy and then
we're gonna control V to paste and
you'll see how big this thing is
so hit ctrl T alright so we want it to
be right around this size alright it's
like the move tool hit apply and we're
gonna drag him up above okay I actually
the cut out looked pretty good so I
don't really see anything too much or we
need to edit out any of the white spots
so we can go ahead and close this out
and now what I want to do is take it and
desaturate it so we'll go to image
adjustments desaturate so that gets rid
of that little hue that had and then
what I want to do is take the
rectangular marquee and right
where it's about halfway you want to
select half the skull hit ctrl C delete
and then ctrl V to paste now ordinarily
if you were designed a game website for
another company they would be providing
you with game artists up but we don't
have that luxury so we're gonna try to
make some some type of appealing cool
image out of this skull so alright so
now what we want to do is I'm going to
take half the skull and stylize it
differently so I'm gonna go to filter
stylize find edges and then I want to go
to image adjustments invert alright so
now we have kind of like a cool x-rays
looking
image so real quickly I'm gonna take the
square marquee tool again and you could
see it kind of has like this straight
white edge going all the way down
because I've found the edge of that
layer and then just take your selection
right on that pixel hit delete
oops apparently I need go far enough and
then you can move it over if you wish
just a little bit all right so now what
I want to do is give it an actual hue so
if I go to image adjustments hue and
saturation select colorize and then mute
move our hue over and I'm trying to look
for kind of like a a bluish color it may
be right around there I think is good
I'm gonna take the lightness down just a
little bit all right and then hit OK all
right so that looks pretty cool so far
now what I want to do is kind of add a
sort of I guess kind of like a heads-up
display design around here on this eye
so let's go ahead and I'm gonna call
this skull left and this one is skull
right all right so let's go ahead and
we'll select on top of both of those
layers we'll take the ellipse tool we'll
hold shift and scale up and see it right
around here and then we're gonna get rid
of the fill so you click on there hit
that slash right there and then click on
here to give it a solid color color and
we'll make it white so let's hit control
H to get rid of those outlines all right
or just like a move tool and then I want
to double click the right side of the
layer and give it a outer glow will make
the glow white
and you can just play with the spread in
the size if you wish I just want to give
it a faint glow and we'll hit okay
and we'll go ahead and duplicate that
hit ctrl T scale down maybe right around
there and I was i held shift and alt to
make sure it's scaled correctly and you
can also play around with the thickness
of these just to give it some diversity
and you can even turn off some of these
if you wish and then we'll do it one or
two more times and you can even change
the opacity if you wish down just a
little bit all right
and we can I think that's okay for now
and then real quick I wanted to show
just kind of like a cool technique to
create wires or tubes rather or maybe
wires so what we can do is we'll take a
new path here with the pen tool and
we'll create kind of like a cool effect
where we'll click once here and we'll
drag out
maybe right around there and we'll get
out we'll take the direct selection tool
right here and we'll get rid of the
outer glow that's why it's doing that
it's not supposed to have this and
that's because I was selected on path so
just hold ctrl alt and Z a few times if
you did the same thing make sure we have
shape selected all right so now we can
do that maybe right around yeah sorry
I'm kind of changing my mind here about
how I want this to look okay
and we will change this to black or just
click on here and select black and then
we could take the size of this move it
up I have around just an even 5 and you
know what I'm gonna change out the 6 all
right
okay and then what I want to do is give
it kind of like a shadow inside of it so
the way we can do that is let me zoom
out here we'll take the pen tool and
I'll just select right around here oops
ctrl shift and for a new layer and hit
the enter key and will come up right
around there and then come back down and
try to follow this path and then close
out on the one that you began
all right ctrl H a couple times they
control one and we can change this color
here maybe to right around there and you
can add one more real quick just so
we're being consistent here right around
there
I'm going to zoom up a little bit closer
all right
control H all right and now one last
thing is will select beneath those
layers that we created and we'll zoom up
and we'll add kind of like a shadow so
I'm gonna change my foreground to black
here and let me go ahead and see how
this it would come out like this right
around there and continue right around
here right there in the previous eye
when I sit here that doesn't didn't hold
so what I want to do is go ahead and
take this to nothing and put this block
all right so then we can control H get
rid of the view there and we'll right
click and we will rasterize that and
then we can drop down the opacity and
then take the blur tool right here just
a little bit and it control one okay so
if you really wanted to get elaborate
you can create these things all over and
just create a cool image but I don't
want to get too much into that as this
is not a photo manipulation tutorial all
right so so far so good I'm gonna zoom
out here and we're already at 20 minutes
so I think what I'll do is just a couple
more things let's find our alright so I
think these three are the wire so yeah
wait we'll put that in there too so
those four layers will call wire and
then we have these three which are these
three circles right here we can I group
those all together and we'll call these
circles there might be a better name and
I want to duplicate those so right click
duplicate group
hit okay drag them beneath this go
actually we're gonna drag them right on
top of this rectangle one and we're
gonna going to right-click and then oops
cancel right click and then go to
ungroup layers and then with all three
of those selected right-click and click
on create clipping mask alright so now
we want to hit ctrl T shift and alt and
scale those up apply and we can move
these over if we want and then take down
to the opacity quite a bit maybe it's
something very faint just like that
alright okay so I then what we want to
do I'm gonna file open take a look at
this massive warehouse picture ctrl a
ctrl C and then exit out and then we
want to create I we're going to paste it
in that layer so click on rectangle one
control V hit and alt after hitting ctrl
T to scale this down a bit we will move
it up make it maybe just a tad bit
bigger
oops come back over here alright move it
up so we can see basically the whole
building and I'm gonna go to image
adjustments desaturate and then go to
image adjustments go to brightness and
contrast we want it to be just barely
noticeable just to create almost like a
texture alright and then one and finally
if you were to take this you know to
really prepare this correctly for the
HTML we would take the eraser tool we'll
get out a normal brush here a feather
brush with a large size we'll see what
that looks at that'll work so around 300
pixels
and then just get rid of that the edge
is just barely that way if you have a
large monitor like 1900 and the
browser's maximized then you don't see
the ends kind of just abruptly ending
there all right so I think that right
there is a good area or a good place to
stop no you know what I'm gonna keep
going because I just want to finish out
this entire area and then tomorrow we'll
have stuff down here to design so real
quickly we'll get our grid back and
we'll go ahead and say that this is
we'll say five columns wide so we'll
drag out pull here all out action get
rid of this grid and we can't see it
because it's at the top here all right
we'll change it to white there and all
right we're gonna do we'll stick with
bold for now and I'm gonna change the
size here or something a lot larger okay
large in the net maybe we'll make this
bigger here
all right so I pulled it to 6 grid her
columns wide and it's right aligned so
let me go ahead and hide that and then
let's zoom up so a hundred percent let's
give it a light gradient and so you know
what I think we can use this so
auto-select layer with the move tool
right click and go to copy layer style
which is right here
alright then click on that and then
right click and paste layer style
alright that looks good and then we will
do this once more bring up the grid and
drag out right around here we'll adjust
this afterwards and then we'll just be
kind of like a submenu so it'll be all
caps of play the latest fps in the brand
new franchise skull Wars ok can't see
that because I actually once I can get
the grid off here
okay so that was strange I had to pause
it just so I can find it if I
double-click on here there we go that's
the issue
oops so I had to drag that out we're
unable to see that correctly so we want
this whole lot to be a lot smaller and
let's see here
I'll try I'm gonna type type in sixteen
and we do not want this to be completely
bold so it's got a regular
move it down here maybe right around
there okay so let me zoom out just so we
can get an idea all right okay
and then we're gonna have a
call-to-action button right here so
let's get out our grid I'm gonna move
this back down now that I can actually
find it and then take out rank the
rounded rectangle tool we'll leave it
around four pixels for the radius get
out the grid and pull out holding alt
here maybe right around here about four
all right it's really it's twice and I'm
gonna bring this down as well get rid of
the grid double click to change the
color here we want something that really
pops out for the call to action so right
around here all right that color code is
ff6 and three zeros oh my god why did I
do that
ff6 I hit cancel by accident okay and
also play with the blend mode up here so
if we take this and hit the down arrow
key just so we can barely see the
background and then we'll take this text
right here that'll select layer we will
duplicate that and let's see where this
is from relation so we'll take this
duplicated portion put it above and
we're going to change that color
all right play skull or is now now I
want to take the size drop it down start
30 try 25 and we'll put it right around
there and then we will change the couple
things here we'll change the gradient
overlay and I'm going to move this off
to the side and take the gradient editor
I make this black and then over here
we'll make this maybe slightly lighter
it okay
the drop shadow I don't like how that
looks so mmhmm yeah I want you to I want
to get rid of that I'm going back to our
gradient though maybe just lighter okay
so you zoom up to see what this looks
like and then real quickly one last
thing we could take the this layer right
here
duplicate that and we're going to get
rid of the fill so take the direct
selection tool and get rid of that take
the stroke we're gonna make a white one
and let's try just one pixel and move it
slightly right click and duplicate that
one more time and this one's gonna be
black oops wait we have to go to over
here direct selection to change the
color to black
and we can't see it because we have the
mode to screen all right and then just
kind of like that right there
take the move tool oops
still messing with that all right right
around there and that's just kind of
like just to wait for it to slightly
stick out I don't know was it necessary
maybe not but all right
so zoom out here all right so I think
that's a good place to stop for now I so
definitely tomorrow we're gonna work
down here and it's gonna have more of a
flat feel it's not going to be as
intense as you know all this this
graphical work up here and so look for
that tutorial make sure you subscribe to
YouTube that way you'll get an email
when I release these tutorials I'm
releasing a video tutorial every day and
my goals do that for at least a year
so also check out design course calm and
I'm Gary Simon all right so I will see
you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
