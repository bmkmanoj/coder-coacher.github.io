the 14th design course calm design
challenge and this time it's going to be
based around designing a wordmark logo
for a fictional gem so a word mark
simply means there's no external symbol
as a part of the logo and it's based
around the business name essentially so
the name of this fictional businesses I
going to beef it Fox which is a female
only gem again it's fictional doesn't
exist just for practice also something
new with our design challenges I've all
design entries are now blind so in other
words your design will not be revealed
until the contest is over
so when you come to this thread and you
post your design entry what will happen
is instead of showing your design it's
going to show a fake little graphic that
I made that says design submission that
it will be revealed once I go ahead and
do the review of the design this way it
will cut back on whether it's
intentional or unintentional any any
inspiration that people are gather from
the previous entries that were submitted
so this way it's you know it's
undoctored in a sense of that you're not
gonna have anybody that's copying what
again whether that's intentional or
unintentional so I think that's a good
thing to integrate so yeah so the
requirements of course just include fit
Fox I use only the type fit Fox for this
logo don't include any external designs
images or symbols make this word mark
relevant and unique include some sort of
reference to the idea of a gym and/or a
fox
so for instance you know we have thread
and it looks like there's thread here
tonic it looks like there's you know
it's a reference towards fluid of some
sort trident and you have the e as an
actual Trident so try to think outside
of the box here and use the words fit
Fox to try to come up something that is
relevant to the idea of a gym and or a
fox alright so make sure the logo is big
enough for me to see so that you know I
don't have to try to zoom in for it so
it should be at least this size and at
least this big right here preferably a
little bit bigger and doun please don't
use or overuse effects such as bevels
drop shadows gradients try to focus on
form and keep it clean so you don't have
to add a ton of drop shadows and stuff
even though this one does have a drop
shadow it's used very simply it does
it's not a soft shadow it's just a hard
shadow and you can barely even notice it
so try to focus on and using if you're
going to use effects like that use them
very minimally and then the submission
deadline October 4th that's a week from
today today's eye September 27th at 12
p.m. Eastern Time and then I'll go ahead
and do the review and switch the thread
to I the mode of which everybody can
view all you know each other's entries
and I'll do a video review of it each
entry all right so yeah that's all I'm
