if you don't have hosting you need
hosting and so the way to do that
I you can visit a site like GoDaddy
Bluehost there's tons of host sites out
there GoDaddy's very cheap Bluehost very
cheap Hostgator then there's so many out
there and you can do your own research
about you know which one you think has
the best reviews but if you're
ultimately just looking to experiment
you don't want to spend a lot of money
you can go to a site like this I and you
want a first kind of on a domain and
hosting account so you need two things
so the domain I there's a lot of tools
for you to search for your own domain
see what's available out there I'm not
going to cover that I but real quickly I
will show you busting name com
it's a really cool and clever tool that
allow you to search for domains that are
available and it's real it's instant
it's really cool I you can use it to
make just cool things so let's say my
last name is Simon I go so it shows you
all these lists of I domain names that
begin with Simon you can limit the
domain names to ten characters my name
is five so see if there's any with six
available I mean no not at all seven
yeah Simon you know you did a really
cool thing for creating brandable domain
names and then also this is its own tool
as well so it gives you a lot of
different options and I'll find your
domain name at they're very cheap to
register a domain name they're like I
don't know ten dollars on average for a
year and then you've got to have your
hosting account as well so hosting a
site like GoDaddy they give you a lot of
different type of options of the type of
hosting you want I web hosting very
cheap 3:49 a month I mean absolutely
cheap pretty much all of them contain
what we need to have which is it
includes PHP and MySQL so with that said
once you get your host your domain
registered and your hosting account up
and running you want to log in to the
backend I like GoDaddy has its own
they all have their own back-end where
you can control and manage your your
hosting account and you need to find
your databases section buffer MySQL and
so when you I find that you want to
create a new database and you do that by
adding it in the backend like of the
GoDaddy admin panel and give it a name
like quote fuel for the MySQL database
name so that I'd be quote fuel and then
you also need to specify a user and
password for it and so you can give the
username you know whatever you want and
the password whatever you want as well
after that you're gonna run to load up
PHP my admin and that's something that's
almost universal as well when it comes
to being able to manage your database
for MySQL so PHP my admin once you are
able to find that link and load it up
it'll ask you to log in and I once you
log in you'll see your database you can
click on it and there's currently no
tables in the database so we have to
create a new one so we can give it a
name and the name I can simply be quotes
and in the number of fields that we want
to go into that database so I'm just
going to put in I think just two fields
and then hit OK and then once you do
that it's going to ask you to specify
the field name so this is just going to
be ID and then this field name is just
going to be the quote so very simple I
the type here the ID is just an integer
so for each quote that we add it'll
automatically of this we'll just put in
something like 11 I which means how many
how high will count to essentially or
how many characters it will be and then
down here automat increment we want to
check on as well and I'll check on null
as well and then quote over here this is
not an integer to quote I can be I think
I'm just going to use what's called long
yeah yeah long Tex right
keep on going past it there we go long
text and that means we can put in just a
very lengthy amount of text here even
though our quotes are going to be
relatively small and then once we have
that we just hit go oops
no I did not want to add a third one I'm
just gonna hit save see it allows me to
save it there we go
so this is the table that's created we
have an ID in a quote field currently
there's nothing there's no records in it
though so if you hit browse it's not
gonna let us because there's no records
there's no quotes yet so we can just
manually insert a quote here and
basically if we just specify the quote
so we'll use the quote that we've been
using before and that is sweat is pain
leaving the body or weakness weight is
not pain weakness leaving the body okay
whatever and just hit go we'll do
another one I'll read that actually I'm
gonna I want to make these all cap off
by default so take care of your body
oops and it's the only place you have to
live and then just hit go and then now
if we hit browse it shows both of our
entries into this database this is where
the apps gonna pull it from so I'm gonna
add several more and I'm gonna pause it
and I'll come back and just show you
real quick what I did alright that's
enough right there so I've added 12 very
simple quotes or whatever based around
motivation and fitness and all that
stuff alright so that's all we have to
do on that front now you could get into
creating an admin area to where you
create a form in HTML that allows you to
easily submit to it by using a web page
and clicking a submit button and editing
them but we're not going to get into
that I kind of goes beyond the scope
that the tutorial we just want to keep
this simple
um so editing and adding removing the
quotes it looks like
my mouse is about to die one second all
right back but yeah so this is where you
would edit all of your I your entries
and add them and remove them delete them
whatever all right so now the next step
is we're going to get up the we're going
to create a file structure for the PHP
documents that we're going to create
that will randomly pull these from the
database so I I have my directories up
here this is the project director we've
been working in I'm gonna create a new
folder call it HTML all right
and inside there that's where we're
going to place our different ph that our
PHP file that is essentially going to
connect to the MySQL database and pull
from it and print a random quote so I
this next part you can use in HTML or
code editor if you have one if you don't
you can use notepad or WordPad or
whatever all it is is just text for this
coding alright so I like to use out
what's called sub line text editor and
right here and I currently have opened
the folder that we just created from
here and so what we want to do is create
a new file so file a new file and we'll
go ahead and save this ctrl s and I'm
not currently in the right folder so one
second there we are and we're a new
right folder that we just created and
we're gonna call this one DB PHP and
what this is is DB short for database
and you can name it really whatever you
want I but we need to basically connect
to the database in this file
specifically here so when you're
connecting you have basically four
different variables that you have to
define so to begin a PHP document you
have to open it up with a tag like this
and then close it all of your code in
goes inside right here I so this next
step I'm just going to paste in the the
code that we're going to use instead of
sitting here typing it all out
and I'll explain it so just gonna
control V to paste this in I already had
the PHP tags there and I take all this
an indent alright so basically we have
to create the connection this is the
variable name right here all variables
are started by creating a a dollar sign
and then the name equals MySQL MySQL I
connect and this is where you have to
specify your host user name password and
database name so again all this
information is available to you in your
hosts control panel and so this is where
you want to put that information and
then to check in connection if this is
the part where it actually executes the
connection right here and then this
basically means if it failed then echo
failed to connect MySQL so something
important to note is that the database
name and such are case sensitive so make
make sure that you have that correct so
I'm gonna go ahead and put in my real
variables I in a second but I'm gonna
put in first I a new document file new
and we're gonna save this ctrl s and
we're gonna call this just index dot PHP
and then we're going to include this
right here at the top of this page so
first let's open up the PHP tags and
then I'm going to put in require once
and then DB PHP and then semicolon to
end that line and then save this and
I've just put in my actual data here so
I'm going to close that alright so now
it's connected to the database at this
point with our file now we actually have
to grab the results from this table
write this table right here quotes and
we have to only make it choose one
random result and then we'll print it
out and display it and we'll be able to
visit the page in the browser to see it
work so we have to set up our query so
give it a variable of query equals
quotes select all from quotes which is
the name of our table order by brand and
that's short for random limit one and
then end the quotes and semicolon then
we put in result equals mysql all i
underscore query and then we put in the
connection variable from the DB PHP
which is con which connects to the
database and then query from above and
then we put while row equals mysql i
underscore fetch underscore array result
which is what we just previously defined
then open up brackets and put print JSON
encode and then row equals the name of
our specific column we want to print
which is quote and then and the producer
semicolon at the end and that's all so
now you save this and you upload it to
your ftp so there are different ftp
applications out there basically we have
two files here
we want to drag this over and upload it
to the server and again your ftp
information all can be found from within
your your hosts control panel and you
could set up an ftp username and all
that so I have mine stored on a folder
called quote fuel off of design course
comm and so I'm gonna bring that over
here real quick and so I'm just gonna go
to Jean course comm forward slash quote
fuel and then enter
oopsie sometimes that happens one second
says on line ten there was unexpected
yeah this is line 10 right here
yeah there should not be an equal sign
in there there we go
let me just upload that again real quick
all right we'll bring back our page
right here there we go so if you refresh
you'll see it'll select a random
document or not talking about but quote
as seen here the more you have the less
likely you're going to you know do two
in a row which can definitely happening
alright so that is it for this tutorial
I in the next lesson we're going to go
ahead and get back into Android studio
and connect this to the button click
event and make it show up in that
textview that we have all right I'll see
you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
