today we're going to do something new at
least for this channel and that is step
into unity now unity is a game
development engine and there is a paid
version and a free version so go ahead
and download the free version I'm going
to link it in the description below this
video here on YouTube and all you also
need is just a plugin from Nvidia for
Photoshop and that is free and that will
be linked as well so basically what
we're going to do is first in blender
which is also free we're going to create
a simple plain UV unwrap it and then
take that into unity and then we're
going to spend most of our time
switching back and forth between
Photoshop and unity and experimenting
with the different basic shaders in
unity and you'll see how you know all
these different shaders everything works
together to really create some depth in
what is basically a very simple plane
with no mess geometry or anything
complex like that all right so this is
geared towards being a beginner and so
if you neck access to any project files
are available on a free in the
description below this video and if you
haven't yet check out these on course
comm and subscribe here on YouTube
alright to get started alright so the
first thing that you need to do is make
sure that you have the Nvidia plugin for
creating height Maps basically so you'll
know you have it if it's down here in
filter and video tools so basically it's
free if you don't have it then I will
link this and you can download it and
basically it's going to be something
that we use for the textures alright so
once you have that download installed
the first thing we're going to do is use
blender and if you've never used blender
real quickly I do this for every
tutorial I to just look around you use
your third mouse button or middle mouse
button and to zoom up use your scroll
wheel to pan you hold shift in that 3rd
mouse button
and select objects you right-click them
and everything else pretty much you know
I'm not going to try to go too much in
depth because we're not going to be
doing much in here at all
so I'm going to hit file new just to
reload the startup file just so we're
looking at the same thing I'm going to
hit delete and enter for that cube and
then shift a add a plane all right and
so this plane is basically going to be
the only piece of geometry that we use
for unity so what we need to do though
is UV unwrap it so whenever you try to
import a 3d object a mesh into unity and
you want to apply a texture to it
you have to unwrap it otherwise and
textures will not show up on it so to do
that it's very simple especially for a
simple object like this what we want to
do is pull this window over here by lift
clicking and dragging and we'll change
this view to the UV editor and all we
have to do is go into edit mode for this
object right now we're in object mode so
edit mode to switch you can switch here
or you can just hit tab and you want to
make sure everything is selected which
it currently is and just to be sure a
clicking a or hitting a will deselect
everything and toggling will select
everything then all I have to do is hit
the letter U and then unwrap very very
simple all right so once you've done
that what you want to do is save this
file and obviously to do that file save
as and I've already saved it as wall and
there we go that's all we need to do in
here basically so I let's go ahead and
close that and now we'll go ahead in
unity now I have the unity pro version I
but everything we do is going to be
something that you could do in the free
version as well so don't worry about
that so I'm going to go to file new
project and I'm going to import the
following packages the character
controller that's what's going to allow
us to put in
it basically allow us to walk around and
see what we're doing and let me see if
there's anything else that I want to add
yeah I want to add the skyboxes and that
will allow us to add like a sky um and
yeah that's that's all for now all right
so I'm just going to go ahead and hit
create and it's going to reload the
application with everything that we need
I'll go ahead and pause just in case it
takes a little time all right that was
only a few seconds so basically I this
is what we're working with and it's it's
not - I guess you could say intimidating
at first it's I'm not going to try to
explain everything I'm actually somewhat
of a beginner myself so I'm just kind of
teaching one up I've been learning
lately so what we want to do is import
new asset and that's what's going to
allow us to import that blend file that
we created in a pause so I could
navigate through all my folders I don't
you see on my porn stuff now I'm just
kidding but I but yeah this is the blend
file and that imports are you know
whatever we call this right here drag it
on there there we go nothing very
exciting it's a square eye but we can do
a lot with it as you'll see so I
basically at this point what we want to
do is basically duplicate or replicate
this and so what's cool about what we're
about to do when I texturing this is
these are all squares and they're all a
sort of a way that they're
interchangeable so you'll see that you
know as we go down the road with its
tutorial I so just to duplicate
something just hit ctrl D and you can
see over here this is kind of like the
Photoshop equivalent of layers over here
and there's also the equivalent of
groups which are called hierarchies and
all that stuff but we'll get to that
when we get to it and so basically we
have two of them and if we want to move
this over now you could try to eyeball
it which is a terrible idea but there's
a way to snap it to this object over
here to make sure it's
perfect and that's to hold the letter V
and then just left-click and drag it to
it very simple all right so now what we
do is just hold shift and select both of
those so you can see they're both
selected and also just to navigate it's
slightly different than blender I
basically to look around like this I'm
holding alt in the left mouse button I
to pan you hold shift in that 3rd mouse
button to kind of look around like this
I'm just holding my right mouse button
so you can get it and you can also do a
search so I'm not going to go over all
that stuff but we have both of them
selected ctrl D move them over and hit V
and there they are so now we have four
of these and let's take those four
holding shift with all four selected and
ctrl D and then go ahead and move these
over as well V hold it down left click
drag it over alright so that's good for
now and what I want to do at this point
is get our standard our character
controller so if you click on standard
assets double click on character take
this first person just drag them over
there and then drag them up you want to
make sure he's on top of the planes that
we've added and he is I also want to
scale them down so to scale it's the
letter e know it's R and then just
left-click and drag alright and then to
move W and as we saw e is to rotate so
I'm going to rotate this guy around
because he's looking this way all right
so if we clicked play right now watch
what happens you just fall through the
damn floor okay so the way you fix that
I let's select all these so if you
left-click and drag you can select
everything make sure you don't have any
of the cameras or anything selected I
what we want to do is add component type
in Collider right here and you'll see
mesh Collider so now a mesh Collider has
been added to these basically you can't
fall through the floor anymore so hit
play there we go
and this looks terrible as it's supposed
to be at this point let's go ahead and
add like a skybox to this so if we go to
edit render settings we have a skybox
material area over here so the skybox is
if we click on this we have these
different type of skies that we can add
so if we add like the starry night then
hit play now we're looking up at a sky
looks kind of cool you know and you
could experiment with easy you can your
alert interchangeable basically we have
a sunny sky you know just kind of really
just completely changes the feeling but
I'm going to stick with moonshine
actually because there's a moon up there
there it is pretty cool alright so now
what we want to do is I'm going to edit
some a quality setting so if you get
edit project settings we go to quality
right now anti-aliasing is turned off
it's disabled by default if I just I'm
going to change my up all the way to 8
pixels in our 8 times or whatever the
hell it's called multi sampling and then
you will see as we see the edge
everything just kind of looks a lot
better you know have that aliasing there
all right so now here's where we're
going to have fun in Photoshop so I'm
going to minimize that
get out Photoshop we're going to get a
file new and we want our width and
height by 2 0 4 8 by 2 0 for 8 and you
know you can go down to 1 0 to 4 or you
can even I go up to I think double this
or maybe just to 6k Tetris or whatever I
we want to make sure the background
contents are transparent and hit okay
all right so this is obviously massive
because it's only at 25% I what I want
you to do now is head on over to CG
textures calm and if you I let me just
take you through the beginning of it if
you've never been here it does require a
free registration to download these
textures and use them I but if you head
on over to metal base and then this one
right here we have this metal texture
you can use any of these and use
whatever you want I so if you just if
you log in you can download this I and
that's going to be the one that I'm
using so if you want to follow along
then you can use that
alright so I've paused and just open
that up and this is obviously in a
separate document and if you control a
control C control V to paste that in
what I want to do is you know when it
comes to a texture like this you kind of
want it to not look like it's repeating
so much so you get one way of dealing
with that is taking the clone stamp tool
I'm going to go down to like a 600 pixel
point right there hold the alt
left-click just or somewhere around here
we can I
sorry I wasn't sure why it was I making
it lighter that's because the mode
somehow got set to screen so yeah come
look over here so you just tell these
edges over here gonna when they're
repeat they're gonna look weird I cut
off basically so you can just minimize
that a little bit by doing that all
right so basically if we want to save
this well one thing I'm going to do is
make it a little bit darker so image
adjustments brightness contrast turn it
down maybe just right around there hit
okay now what this is all we're going to
use for our initial layer our texture
rather so let's go ahead and save this
now blender can I not blender unity can
accept PSD files so if we sit by hitting
ctrl s and bringing this up we'll just
call this panel one dash diffuse all
right so the diffuse texture is
basically kind of what it looks like
there are multiple different types of
textures which we'll get into shortly so
let's now go back into unity and right
now now we have just a default sort of
eye material and right click import new
asset choose the PSD now if we go ahead
and select one of these oops
no that's not what I do we want to drag
this panel one left click and drag over
here on top where it says none textured
so now they have all just updated with
that texture that we added in Photoshop
so I'm going to add a couple lights
though first because if we hit play you
can't even see anything practically so
what we can do is go to assets create
know a game object create other point
light all right so we can see it's real
big if we use our scroll well just rule
to zoom out we hit W we can move this
thing up and over
maybe to the middle now if we hit play
we'll see what we can actually see this
floor all right let me real quickly
because I want this to be a little bit
bigger what I'm going to do right now at
this point is kind of just create these
like if we're if you're experienced with
Photoshop you can create layer groups
obviously to easily manage things so you
can do the same thing here in unity and
you do that by going to game object
create empty and so it creates this game
object a little layer right here
basically if we take all these that
comprise of this floor and just drag
them into game object now we can select
game object as a whole and move it over
now we could still access these
individually just by left-clicking them
so that's kind of important all right so
what I'm going to do is just duplicate
this so ctrl D move it over V and left
click and snap that over so now we have
like have a bigger area to work with now
if we take this light I want to
duplicate that as well ctrl D and move
it over so now we have kind of like a
bigger area just to look around and see
what the hell's going on alright so now
what we want to do let's say for example
we wanted to add add just some
interesting detail or depth to this
floor by default what we're working with
currently is if we click on this we'll
see it's just a regular diffuse shader
so you see we have all these different
things that we can kind of play around
with so we're going to mess around with
a bump diffuse layer so if we click on
that you'll see now we have two areas in
which we can specify a texture so we
have the base which is the diffuse right
here then we have what's called a normal
map this is where that plug-in will come
in handy from Nvidia so let's go ahead
and head on over back to Photoshop
all right so we have our diffuse texture
here what I want to make now is the
normal map so I'm going to go to file
save as and I'm going to call this panel
one - normal alright so a normal map
basically what we want to do is create
kind of like a cool sort of I guess you
could call it like a panel that's raised
up on the floor alright sorry I had to
stop depend pile about thirty minutes
my wife he's out because yelling at me
downstairs and my four-year-old puked
all over both of them so I had to watch
the one-year-old I'm telling you life
with children it's not easy anyhow I so
basically I'm going to take the yeah the
rounded rectangle tool so ridiculous I'm
going to left-click once and I'm going
to make the same exact size as the
document which is two zero four eight by
two zero four eight and the radius I'm
going to change to 25 so take each of
these make them 25 and hit OK now I'm
going to move it here so that it's
centered up hit ctrl T shift select
apply and you know what I kind of wanted
to change my mind now sorry do that real
quick again I thought that would be
bigger in terms of the core radius so
I'm going to try to leave it back at 50
all right so let's get it in the center
there you can use your arrow keys ctrl T
shift and alt and I'd say somewhere
right around there looks good it's like
move till it apply alright and so I'm
going to show you something kind of just
interesting here what I want to do is
I'm going to hide this layer
and I'm going to create a new layer
control or command if you're on Mac
shift in n so that makes the new layer
shortcut I'm going to take the Paint
Bucket with a black make sure it's all
the way black and fill it in back here
also I noticed a on when I had the
hidden there's a stupid I what you call
yeah stroke on that so if we take the
direct selection tool come up here
you just select this and that will
remove the stroke alright so when it
comes to a normal map bump map whatever
it I it just it's based on a grayscale
so if you have something that's black
and white for example like this what I
want to do is control a edit copy merged
and that will just copy everything
that's currently you know in this
selected area as opposed to hitting ctrl
C which is only copy what's on the
current layer so if I do that and go to
file new hit OK ctrl V to paste go ahead
and go to filter take our Nvidia tools
normal map filter and if you want to
match up everything that I have here I
you could just pause and just you know
match these up and then hit OK you'll
see that it kind of creates this if I go
up to 100% by hand control one just this
area this is massive just as very fine
you know
purplish area so I just want to show you
what that basically does as is so what
we want to do is save this I'm going to
call this one panel one - normal wait
did I already okay
no I what we'll do is let's call this
normal map then I want to overwrite that
one over there alright so if we go back
to unity and in that normal map first we
have to add that so right click import
asset to this one right here now I have
to do is select on select this drag this
over here to normal map and then when
that happens you have this texture is
not marked as a normal map fix now
all right so you can't really notice
anything yet but if we hit play and we
look we can see it is as if that you
know there's actually geometry on the
panel's here and we could see that the
based on the light it will add the
shadows or a highlight all right but
it's not too noticeable
so there's several ways that we can fix
that so I'm going to go ahead and just
hit pause again to get out of there
let's go back to photoshop what we want
to do now is take this rounded rectangle
double-click on it and if we add an
inner glow change the blend mode to
normal the color to black the size
increase it quite a bit so as you can
see the more we increase the bigger it
is so you can really exaggerate it if
you want but I'm going to go just right
around here it's around 50 pixels and
then you can also adjust the choke size
I'm just going to leave it at 0 the
opacity you can put that up to 100 as
well so very simple it's just a slight
change i me make it a little bit more
pronounced so I went to 76 on the size
and hit OK
so now if we select all copy merged come
back here we can just back up by hitting
ctrl alt and z a couple times and paste
over that weight and do that correctly
did I edit copy merged and paste there
we go now if we just take that go back
through the normal map filter hit OK
now see it looks a lot different so
let's save this go back to unity
unfortunately does an auto update so
what I just do and if somebody knows you
know a quick way of doing this let me
know I just delete this right click
import it again now we could see
something a lot different already
happening
we can see now that this floor is a
little bit raised alright so I'm going
to add some more lights a little bit
dark over here so what is this one just
like that and I'm going to change the
range here actually I'm going to remove
this one real quick why it's doing that
it's kind of like only doing half way it
should be
maybe it's let me try real quickly
well I paused it trying to figure out
why it seems like it's only lighting up
half and I can't figure it out
ridiculous oh I'm just going to leave
like that's fine
anyhow I so now what we want to do is
kind of play with this a little bit
further what I want to do is come back
here to photoshop on also real quickly
in unit unity you can also play around
with the textures here by adjusting the
color so those will make it darker or
Tennant different color I'm just going
to make it a little bit darker right
around there so I have a play now we can
see this situation down here alright so
now what I want to do is switch back
here to photoshop and let's see here
going to open up our diffuse
so now that we have the normal map which
is this right here I back up real quick
just copy that and place it onto here
and paste it rather we can take this
actually put it beneath change this
blend mode now if you select it like
this and then use your down arrow key
you can filter through these and to see
one that you think would work well I
think this would work pretty well right
here and the point is to kind of change
up a little bit the texture so if we put
around 39% and then we save the diffuse
layer ctrl s and switch back to unity
and get rid of that right click import
now see it is quite a bit different so
now it has the actual shadows and such
from the diffuse and also its texture
just a little bit differently so yeah we
have to fix that that's what happened
yeah I would thought that didn't look
correct so now that's a little bit
better all right so I'm going to go back
here to photoshop and what we want to do
now to make this you know basically what
we're doing is creating a modular sort
of environment and the idea that we can
take these squares back here in unity
and we can mix and match so we haven't
actually created a second material I
that's what we're going to do right now
so the idea that I have is to take
basically these over here these four and
these four and give them a set
texture I but make it feel as though
this is one entire floor so what we'll
do is come back over here to Photoshop
and to the right side of this I want to
kind of add like bars that go here so
remember we have two things we have to
worry about we have to worry about the
normal map and we also have to worry
about the diffuse texture all right so
we have right here the normal map let me
turn this now we have to remember this
is very important what I want to do
first take both of these control G we
create a group and we're going to call
this diffuse final all right and you'll
see why this is important a little bit
and then I'm just going to duplicate
that group and I have a hot cash or cut
key set up custom for that control ship
indeed or you just right click and
duplicate group it okay and I'm going to
hide this one and I'm also going to
ungroup these and bring these back to a
hundred percent for the diffuse layer
alright so what I want to do real quick
is just edit this diffuse layer so that
oh and by the way it's probably a good
idea at this point I'm going to save
panel one diffuse we're going to call
this panel oops we're going to call this
wine file save as panel - all right
let's bring these back now what I want
to do is take this select the move tool
move it over maybe to right around here
and then fill the rest in with black so
we're at the rear all right and then
over here create two bars basically so
if I take the rectangle tool
hold alt left-click and drag out and it
has a stroke on it so if I select direct
selection tool and do that to take the
stroke away and then I'm also going to
make it a white instead of black I'm
going to double click on it and go to
inner glow and adjust those settings
real quickly again so I'm taking the
screen off going to normal right around
there looks good hit OK control T hold
shift by hold Alt key and that way it's
not cutting off there we want to look
like everything's kind of connecting
along each tile all right so now what I
want to do is duplicate that right click
duplicate layer or hit ctrl shift D all
right this is so easier to create like a
shortcut key for that because you
duplicate quite a bit all right so this
would be our actual I bump map or normal
map so if I control a edit copy merged
we'll go back over here ctrl n paste
this in and go to filter normal map
filter hit OK now we're going to save
this one and call it panel dash panel 2
- normal alright and then we have to
worry about the actual diffuse so we
want to make sure that this is
consistent then this is set up properly
so let's take both of these pipes I
guess you could call them and move them
down and remember when we had this
diffuse fine over here for the first
panel this right here the diffuse layer
was set at soft light 39% this is soft
light still but it's a hundred percent
so if we go to 39 that will help us out
there
actually this isn't a part of it
basically we need the full final normal
map so if we control Z select all by
ctrl a and then ctrl C come back here
paste this in I would delete that change
it to soft light at 39% now we basically
have this situation over here and let's
just see what it looks like like this so
save it panel to diffuse make sure it's
not overwriting the other one and we'll
come back here and what we want to do is
take this unnamed material and hit ctrl
D to duplicate it and then import new
asset we want the panel to diffuse and
also the normal and let's select the
duplicated copy change these real quick
and then what we can do real quick is
drag this on those over there and we'll
have to rotate those panels also fix now
for that alright and to rotate these we
have your options up here you want to
want to do it with this really so I just
real quickly if I hit E we see which
value changes which is that Y in the
middle over there on the right and
basically these need to be
negative 180 for them to work right so
we'll take each one and put in negative
180 come up here so you can see this
Oh get out of the way you there we go
alright negative 180 so let's just hit
play and see what this looks and feels
like it is so dark here one second
control D W well that issues not really
there anymore so that's good
all right they don't look really good so
there's a couple things that we can do
let me get out of there so if we click
on the unnamed one layer here or layer
I'm so used to Photoshop I we've been
using a bump diffuse if you want to try
a bump specular you can see how
significantly that change is already
things we changed just this shininess
slider all the way to the right and we
can also do the same thing for this over
here change this to specular that way
everything kind of matches up and we hit
play now everything is a lot more kind
of shiny looking and you could play with
it further with these settings by
changing or messing around with the
colors here if you want to make them a
little bit darker or you want to change
the actual specular color I think I'm
going to try that real quick and I can
add that as a preset actually never mess
with this before alright and come over
here change that there we go now they
all match up
so as you can see when it comes to the
bump Maps I or the normal Maps it really
does add some interesting sort of
visuals and it lets you basically sorry
about that
I lets you basically create geometry
where there isn't geometry physically on
the actual mesh so now what I'm going to
do is go ahead and we're going to take
everything I want to create actual walls
out of this so if we select game object
we can see that it selects that right in
left right there I I'm gonna hit control
D just to duplicate those and then I'm
going to hit E and then I'm going to
hold ctrl and rotate it holding ctrl
make it kind of easy to get it to 90
degrees hit W remove this over move it
up and I'm going to get in over here
real quick
I'm going to hit V let me select that
game object real quick there we are
there we go and then that way everything
is kind of connected there now if I hit
play you can see this second wall right
here all right
and real quickly I'm going to hit ctrl D
move that over here and we need to flip
that so I'm going to hit E and while
holding ctrl and now I'm going to hit W
and then V select that game object again
so I had to get closer here and hover
over the specific virtus hit V oops
make sure game object selected this can
be a little bit tricky apparently I just
had it and I undid it because I paused
well that's a big pain in the ass isn't
it okay so what I had to do is just move
this a little bit closer hit V left
click alright so now that is connected
all right and then real quickly one more
time I will take this game object ctrl D
hit e holding ctrl W move this
and V left click and then actually I
lied one more time
patrol D move it over hit e ctrl key and
V oops w and then V so now we are in an
actual room alright and just for the
hell of it I might as well create a roof
as well so if I take this I game object
right there and as well as here I hit
control D move that up and then e
control oops nope
yeah control right there I think will
work and then try hitting E or W rather
and then V I play alright now we are in
actual room and obviously we're only
using what one there are two textures so
now the goal will be to basically kind
of create a lot of other panels in which
you can kind of just insert into
different places and I'm going to mess
with the lighting real quickly so if I
select this give this some different
color maybe right around there now range
will really make it light or not I kind
of want to make it a little bit darker
here and so I want to take I create
another texture here and let me hit play
real quick and do it so that we're
looking at it
it looks kind of like I like a sort of
like a honeycomb to sight type of thing
so let me go ahead and get out there and
something to make sure there was no
other lights actually yeah there is a
light out here I want to get rid of this
light right there let me hit play again
all right there we go
we'll have to lighten this up a little
bit but basically what I'm going to do
is switch back to photoshop and now what
I want to do is come and file save as
calls panel three diffuse
all right and I want to get rid of this
all right and I do have to remember this
is all black and it's at 39% so I'm
going to create a new layer real quick
control-shift-n fill it with black
change it to soft light at 39 all right
so now if we were to save this then all
it would look like one panel would
basically look like I like it back in
there basically look like this right
here as if there's not one of these
squares there all right so what I'm
going to do is add a an ellipse and hold
shift and left-click and drag out to get
right around there you can just Center
it by eyeballing it and then I what
we'll do is create another one inside of
it ctrl D ctrl shift D that's my
duplicate shortcut ctrl T shift and alt
and hit apply and these have those damn
strokes on it all right
and for this one I'm going to double
click on it and I'm going to go to
pattern overlay and I'll link hopefully
I'll remember to do it to this honeycomb
pattern right here so if I increase that
scale 200 2% seems fine hit OK and then
I want to right click and rasterize the
layer style we can see we kind of like
this speaker sort of thing so I want to
take the ellipse here ctrl H we'll get
rid of this outline right here
double-click on it inner shadow no no
sorry will do inner glow normal there's
a way to make presets out of these I
should do that but I'm just kind of
wasting time obviously oh this has to be
black and the actual shape has to be
white our color has to be white for a
shape and let me do that real quick
double click make that white go back to
inner glow and that looks fine right
around there
all right and let me go ahead and then
control shift and a new layer make sure
it's 100% black and we will save this
code not save it but select all copy
merged control N enter ctrl V to paste
that and we want to go to image
adjustments brightness and contrast
because this lot it's not quite black in
there so yeah right around there hit OK
filter normal map filter hit OK oh I
don't want to save that for web what am
i doing save that we're going to call
this panel 3 - normal we're going to
backup ctrl a ctrl C and go back to
panel 3 diffuse and I'm going to real
quickly hide those 3 paste that in and
we want to change this to soft light 39
all right and yeah 39 that'll be fine
and then real quickly just kind of look
at this and see what it looks like so
we'll go ahead and save that ctrl s go
back to unity we'll take this control D
will be a third panel right click import
panel three diffuse and also the normal
map click on the unnamed to get this
over here and what am i doing I don't
see it in there did I do the right one
on second there we go I'm not sure if
then it didn't look like that's saved
correctly panel three diffuse there it
is okay
hmm that doesn't look right one second
here let me just drag it on anyways and
then we'll change let's try this one
yeah it's like this well that's right
nope that's not right one second okay
yeah back in Photoshop I had this layer
that was not supposed to be saved so it
looked a little darker so save this now
as the diffuse so that's why it's
important you want everything all your
textures basically to line up evenly so
let me delete that right click import
and we'll get the right one oh I just
did a normal accident sorry import new
asset panel three diffuse there we go so
now if I hit play we can see this
interesting sort of design there and I
wanted to show something else real quick
if I take this and I man this is hate
working with this tiny viewable area
just because I for the video tutorials
at the record at I 1280 by 720 anyhow I
if I take let's say for example yeah
this one and I come down and change it
to a parallax actually I'll change it to
the a parallax specular eye we have a
third option down here and that's called
a height map now a height map is
basically I'll just show you real quick
let's say for example we wanted to make
this look as though it was kind of like
just bulging out a little bit well what
we could do is in Photoshop will come
and take the brush tool will make it
large yeah a lot bigger than that I'm
going to try like 800 now maybe like
twelve hundred yeah
and we'll take a white color create a
new layer
control-shift-n and you know what I want
to do is also take up the hardness a
little bit see what this does
we'll try it right around there maybe
scale down ctrl T right around there hit
apply and then we want to hide all the
other layers real quick and just leave
it like that and then well we will save
ctrl shift s we'll save it as a new
document
we'll call this panel three dash height
and my hard drives being a little bit
slow come on all right there we go
now go back to unity import that file
and what we want to do is select this
alright so let me come back out here and
just randomly change a few of these
let's see here you can even add it to
the floor if you want although I'm not
sure why you would want to but just to
give you idea that died it's now pretty
easy to envision what you can do like in
a serious environment this is just
messing around of course I I wanted to
show you one more thing and that is
transparent textures alright so let me
go ahead and look over here so let's say
for example we wanted to kind of add
like some type of like a gate type of a
chain link floor on top of this well you
could definitely do that as well and so
what we'll do is go over here to
Photoshop we'll go file new to 0 for 8
by 2 V 2 0 for 8 and I'm going to take
the rectangle tool and I'm going to fill
in the background here real quick just
temporarily just so we can see things
well with black and then go ahead and
make the foreground color white
and I'm going to hold all in is dragged
out something around that size control T
shift and we'll make that a 45-degree
angle and apply right around there
duplicate it and I'm just going to kind
of eyeball it real quick so I'm going to
take both of these merge them duplicate
them if you wanted to be exact you get
out the grid and snap to grid and all
that stuff but I'm just going to kind of
do this quickly and maybe one more time
over here alright and then take all
those merge them ctrl e and then
duplicate them right around there looks
good and merge those and then we want to
duplicate those edit transform flip
horizontal well they have that annoying
stroke and get rid of that stroke all
right and if you can take both of them
hold ctrl and select both and try to get
it so that they might match up I'm not
sure if they will probably won't but
that's okay
hi you can also always hit ctrl T and
mess with the scale a little bit but I'm
not going to that's fine I know there
are tools that I will help you kind of
make it so that they lat overlap but I
haven't really messed with that well I
was I think that's fine for now just for
the demonstration and then for a height
map we can take this bottom one double
click on it inner
you know why instead of doing that again
let me go ahead and show a quick way to
sort of do that over where am I now I
just need to find one of these we're
okay right here if we would take that
right click copy layer style go back to
the file we're working with right click
and paste layer style and let me see
what happened exactly
okay it's just because this glows eye
size is up there quite a bit so we can
see it stay right around there is fine
43 right click copy that style right
click and paste this this and something
like that for the actual OS ES and there
I don't have that one far enough I'll no
big deal copy merged paste that and we
will bring up the normal map filter oops
well I'm so used to saving for web for
web projects always do that so ctrl s to
save call this eye panel for - what was
that call normal back up real quick got
that copied and now just use that same
metal texture we've been using here so
let me bring up that I just take that
layer ctrl C go back over here yeah
right here and get rid of this I'm going
to take both of these merge them and
then I'm going to
well we'll leave that there for now I'm
going to try creating a new layer ctrl
shift n make a clipping mask it okay and
then paste that in and then mess with
the blend mode using my down arrow keys
and yeah I think I might leave it just
like that and then use this as a
transparent diffuse layer so we will
ctrl s or not just sitting there panel
for - diffuse alright now we'll come
back here and we'll do is take all the
floor layers or panels rather actually
they're both game objects right yeah so
I could take this in this okay take both
of those ctrl D move them up just just a
little bit and then we will take just
one of these layers I think what is that
and the layer is unnamed so we'll take
this ctrl D and we will import those two
new assets panel for diffuse and then
panel for normal and take our unnamed
three here take the panel for diffuse
and put it right here and the normal
right there we're going to change this
to transparent and I think bump specular
or work alright and then move on to
these right here oops yeah
also HitFix now for that
oops yeah that's fine
all right so let me hit play yeah they
didn't line up too well I
and also another tip here is if you want
to take this and adjust the tiling so
there's twice as many you change this
like two two two two and two
so now hit play they don't seem so big
and it would be ideal obviously if they
kind of match up and they tiled
correctly but that's okay and that is
basically all I'm going to cover for
today we're already over an hour I think
and I yeah so I have plans to really you
know kind of go after a full tutorial
where we're really creating an
interesting scene rather than just
messing around trying to learn the
different types of shaders so I'm not
sure when that will happen but I yeah
hopefully you learned a lot especially
if you're new and yeah check out design
