Gary Simon of course cetera comm its day
we're going to begin an exciting journey
here at corset row in covering
cryptocurrency blockchain development
and distributed Ledger's and using all
this stuff to create decentralized apps
and so today we're actually gonna start
out something it's really simple and
that is using an API from service called
crypto compare calm and gathering data
based on the current cryptocurrencies so
this is important of course if you're a
developer going forward because this
stuff is going to explode in popularity
as it has been essentially so with this
tutorial we're gonna be focusing on view
j/s but we're also going to be doing
react and angular coming up so if you're
watching this you know like a week down
the road after the upload date good
chance it's already done so you can
check the description in YouTube and
also Coursera calm so let's get started
so I first we're just going to be
creating a very simple interface that
will essentially just list out some
predefined cryptocurrencies along with
their US dollar price their current USD
price but I this crypto compare service
it gives you a ton of other options and
data that you can work with so this will
start as a serving point just to get you
up and running in these three popular
front and JavaScript frameworks oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on YouTube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it alright so first
prerequisites as always you know or most
of my to Tory's you're going to need
nodejs
in npm open up your console a command
line type of node V and then NPM V and
if they give you version numbers great
if not you're going to need to install
it so you're gonna head on over to
node.js org go to the downloads
like the appropriate installer based on
your operating system install it with
the default options and then reload your
console or your command line and rerun
these commands and it should work this
time okay so now starting the view jas
project we're going to use the view
command-line interface or CLI to get a
setup with a basic view project so once
you have node and NPM installed we're
gonna go and type NPM install view CLI
and global so that installs it on our
machine we don't have to do this once
and I'm just going to pause while this
goes through alright once that is
finished hop into wherever you place
your projects I'm in my code folder and
we're going to use the view CLI we just
installed to create a new project so the
syntax for that is view that's it just
basically accesses the actual CLI an it
which means to initialize our start
we're gonna use the web pack starter
template which is a build tool for
handling assets and then view
- crypto and that's going to be the name
of our project so this is going to run
through and it's going to give us a
series of prompts as we see here so I'm
just gonna hit enter enter author blah
blah blah yep enter we'll say yeah in
case we want to have a router later on
we're not going to in this tutorial but
just do it anyhow
yes standard and I'm just gonna hit no
on this option or question rather and no
here as well alright so then we're gonna
CD into it
so CD view crypto and then we're gonna
we're on NPM install to install all of
the dependencies based on the package
shot Jason that was created when we ran
the view at NIT command so I'm just
gonna pause this because it can take a
little bit of time alright once it's
done simply run NPM run dev and this
will launch the default starter template
that was installed and I also a local
development server so it just popped up
off-screen I'm going to pause and bring
that into view and there we go
very very very
easy as he could seize just to you know
get started with a VJ s app so next
we're going to focus on you know what it
takes to connect to the cryptocurrency
API via crypto compare now in first in
order to do that we need to install an
HTTP client library I'm going to use one
called Axios so again we're going to be
working in our server here or a console
rather and I'm using them by the way I
get a lot of questions on you know what
I'm using for my console emulator I'm on
Windows here this is simply called a
commander or CMD ER and at the bottom if
I bring this up if I right-click we can
launch a new console hit start honking
back go back to CD code and then CD into
the project folder which was crypto view
I think no there we go Dyslexic and then
right here we're gonna run npm install
Axios and save it to our package that
jason has a dependency all right so now
that is done all right so I have Visual
Studio code which is a free code editor
from Microsoft it's very popular right
now and I have the project folder open
of you crypto so now what we need to do
is to hop into our source components and
hello view now this is the component
that's responsible for this landing page
that we have right here and so you're
unfamiliar with view it's the files or
the components are separated into three
different sections we got our template
we have our script which handles the
logic and then we have our styling which
handles appearance down here we're gonna
start here in the middle with this
script because this is essentially where
we make our get call to crypto compare
so the first line we're gonna put an
import
Axios from Axios alright so we used of
course NPM to install that and Axios is
here if we search down here we'll see
right there in the no modules folder
next we're going to within here we're
gonna leave the name value here but
we're going to adjust our data right
here so I'm going to change this into
well first I'm just going to gut this
real quickly out of here this return and
we're going to change this into a arrow
function and then within here oh yeah by
the way we wrap this in parenthesis and
then within here we're going to
reference the various properties that
we're going to need so I'm going to make
name one called Kryptos and this will be
an object or array of objects and then
errors for any potential errors that are
returned and so that's all we need right
here we're gonna put a comma because
then we're going to define the created
method and this is called when
components are loaded so anything within
the created function will be run or
executed when the component loads so
inside of here we're going to reference
Axios by the way I'm going to control B
to get rid of this sidebar so Axios get
and then the URL I of the API endpoint
so this would be probably a good time to
actually look at the crypto compare
documentation so to do that when you
have it right here so the address here
is just cryptic compare.com forward
slash api then you click on data and
this is where basically they've
organized the different different types
of data that you can get for our purpose
we're going to use price just to list
out the prices and they have a couple
different ways of doing this and it's
all kind of just described here along
with the you know the the JSON data and
so we want price multi this section
right here and it tells you the
parameters and it has an example down
here so I have a URL already prepared
off screen I'm just
to copy and this is based on the written
tutorial at course Entercom so you can
go there and grab it too if you want and
this URL is right here so what we're
saying is we want I Bitcoin which is BTC
ETH which is a theorem and then IOT
which is iota and then we say I for this
another argument for T simms
we want the US dollar amount of each one
of these three so we can specify other
currencies here as well so if you're
unfamiliar with you know where did I get
these these essentially these acronyms
it was BT 8 BTC or whatever I if you go
to a site like coin market capcom oops
and you click on one of these or get
them up in a new window you'll see we
have ETH up here so it kind of tells you
what the acronym for the cryptocurrency
is so going back let's continue on we're
going to put then we're going to take
the response and we'll say this ty
cryptos equals the response data it's
also console.log the response all right
so I'm gonna save this and of course fix
this little typo right there it's not
going to work also real quickly I'm just
going to gut everything in our template
and then also put our catch here so
we'll say error and this dot errors stop
push the error all right
and then also this is created sorry
about that I keep on screwing things up
yeah has to be created not create once
you do that we'll go back to the browser
and if you get out the console we'll see
that we have a data object and we also
have another property called data which
stores they were specified
cryptocurrencies here and then further
we open this up we'll see we have our
USD and this is the current US dollar
value of Bitcoin all right so as you can
see you know this object returns a bunch
of other properties we only need data so
that's why right here we're just finding
this crypto here this property to
response data all right so now what we
need to do is to find the actual view
template above to display this stuff and
we'll do that with a div ID of I'll call
Krypto - container and then we're gonna
use the v4 and that's a directive for
iterating over I like an object or array
and we're going to pass in we want the
value and the key in kryptos inside of
here we're going to put in a span class
just a left we're gonna put the key
which is going to be you know BTC ETH
etc and real quickly to make your life
easier control shift or no I'm sorry
shift alt and down will replicate the
line and then this will be the value dot
USD and you can figure out kind of what
you need to do based on looking at that
console.log data we're by looking at the
documentation where they have the
JavaScript output all right so that's
all and this could be extremely simple
obviously coming here we'll see we have
it listed out Bitcoin aetherium and iota
but let's format a little bit better so
let's go down to our CSS here we're
gonna remove scoped because we don't
want to limit the CSS just to this
component and I I'm gonna copy and paste
just some quick CSS right here so I'm
gonna get rid of all this stuff and just
paste in just yeah actually just for
rule sets one for body changing the
color to light gray eye crypto container
div we're going to make it white blob
bla bla very simple span laughs we're
gonna make that bold and then it's being
right we're gonna float it right save it
and then before we go back we're gonna
control B to get our sidebar
we're gonna go app view and get rid of
this logo save that and tada
wait that's not work this is supposed to
be floated over here one moment oh and
that's because also in here
and just get rid of all this stuff
actually no I only want to get rid of a
couple things here Tech Center is one of
them oh yeah I forgot to change that too
right all right and there we go very
very very very very very simple as you
can see but it's actually really quick -
it's just refresh and it's like there
instantly so you know obviously going
back to the crypto compare API we have a
lot of other things we can do so for
instance we have this coin list
this doesn't mean accept any URL
parameters if we take this and we change
this right here for instance paste that
in I mean just look at the console log
coming back here
we'll see
oops we can see this I this right here
xml httprequest cannot load no access
control or are allowed origin this is a
common issue but you can install this
cours plugin here on Chrome and if we
just turn this on and refresh we got our
data don't even look at this simply
because we haven't structured it
properly for this call but if we come
down here we can see all the data
associated with this so if we go to data
and then we go to data right here I'm
gonna see a massive massive list these
are all the currencies that they support
ma it's just a ton so if we click on
each one there are objects themselves to
pull properties that give you the full
name the coin name the pre mind gives
you an image URL a name just a lot of
information that you would ever probably
want for your project if you're allowing
people to interact with this data
somehow and so that's basically it I'm
just gonna undo that real quickly and
save it and come back and there we go
I hopefully this has provided you with
you know a pretty quick starting point
from which you can begin to build a more
robust app obviously this is nothing but
yeah so what I'm going to be doing here
is in the next video tutorial and also
written tutorials gonna be based on
doing the same thing here except in
react and then also angular by the way
you can obviously fix this stuff fixing
the decimal points and all that stuff on
your own but yeah that is it and make
sure to check out corset Raycom I'm
gonna have cryptocurrency development
courses I hear in the near future so be
sure to check those out all right talk
to you later good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
