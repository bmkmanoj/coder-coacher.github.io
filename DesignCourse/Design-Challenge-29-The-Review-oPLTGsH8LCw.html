design course calm welcome design
challenge number 29 to review now we had
pretty good entries this time around
which tells me I'm actually doing my job
and you guys are getting better so
that's great alright so before we get to
the review first check out design
cotorreo that is my new five hour free
one hundred percent free course on iOS
and Android app design and development
all right so check that out let's go
ahead and do the review alright so this
is the challenge thread I'm just going
to run through these real quickly now
the thing is is I think one of the
biggest issues we faced is I when it
comes to the roles keep it simple I this
was one of the biggest issues for some
people a lot of times it just went a
little bit way too much I overly complex
but anyhow I'm going to run through
these right now so starting here the
first two entries from Helmer I think
are more like joke ish one so decrease
India good stuff all right thanks for
the submissions Danielle Flores ok so
again this is I in terms of this being
an effective design it doesn't really
look like I that you could just tell
when it comes to the flow of the leave
everything is just kinda shaky looks
like it was kind of done quickly even
though the forms kind of good just seems
like things need to be tidied up a
little bit thanks for that all right
this one is a good one I bubble see so
this is more of what I was looking for
in terms of simplicity as you know
mentioned in the kiss keep it simple and
just presentation so very good right
here thanks for that all right and so
this one unfortunately is one of the
ones that which is way too complex so I
too much is happening here for this to
be effective in the manner in which I
wanted at least I know for like a kind
of like a logo design way too much
happening here I it is a cool you know
for like a poster or something now
that's it's definitely effective I like
the idea of crowd and fish thanks for
the submission though
go back up here to reset to default all
right so this one is north camp and this
is great so you know we have I kind of
like the compass North symbol here but
also kind of like a tent very good this
is one of the best entries here all
right so recipe and lock all right so
this is great I love it I say this is
also a very good entry because we have a
lock here very obvious and then we have
the recipe platter right here very good
good stuff all right this one is city in
crayon so not too bad it looks like
these are mountains perhaps in the
background probably could have done
without those because it would still
probably look somewhat the same even
with the crowns so thanks for that
submission good stuff all right to
reasonable nouns the first attempt kitty
and sponge yeah that's not too bad I I'm
not exactly sure if we would know that
this is a sponge without you know having
read it right here so I probably work in
more of these things like the the spongy
sort of circles on the sides as well so
yeah I probably would like to see it a
little bit thicker stroke on this as
well just because if you were to scale
this down you would start to lose the
detail that's cool too as well right
here not bad good stuff all right
astrakhan cart so this one I kind of I
redundant in all of the asterisks here
even though you're probably trying to
emulate you know the sides of a shopping
cart or something like that but just a
little bit more simplistic would have
been ideal maybe just one asterisk
worked into kind of a shopping cart I
sort of silhouette if you will I but
thanks for that submission all right so
maracas and space so yeah I definitely
didn't obviously didn't take you to the
flat approach I but nonetheless this you
know for what it is this is a good
execution of that idea so cool stuff
good stuff
alright and moving on here dollar and
pig all right I know that the dollar
sign doesn't violate the rule for the
new words or whatever and said that's
fine I looking at this I actually like
the pig itself pretty good I this is in
and of itself yeah I like it a lot but I
think it seems like I the dollar was
kind of just died and afterthought
trying to slapped on in the background
I'm a nice to may have one coming out
right here that would be my ideal other
than that I do like the pig illustration
all right I let's see here so I'm not
sure what this is I one has more detail
the other was a ceramic detail ID to go
so unfortunately didn't specify what
your two words were now if I hit copy
image URL yeah it's not in the URL
either so unfortunately i can't really
khatik this even though this is a pretty
good illustration of a toilet I just not
sure what this is let me be a picture
frame like a frame / toilet or something
oh I can only guess you can let us know
though so the words are search and place
so this is pretty good you know a lot of
people typically associate the little
marker as with being associated with a
place or a map and then magnifying glass
of course worked in there pretty well to
make a single symbol this is the type of
stuff I was looking for good stuff
thanks for that all right and this was a
raven okay wait what I'll Ravens shop
okay so this is a too bad I kind of very
stylistic I an approach but so yeah I
like it for what it is not bad yeah we
got a bunch of I need to fix some stuff
with the forum code here so that doesn't
happen alright so MK design bag and plan
it alright so yeah for what this is not
bad i like the bag design arm and this
is pretty obvious as well right here so
that's a pretty decent execution
so I can't spend more time on these but
I'm kind of have a quite a bit to do and
there's ton of these to do alright so
charge and hotdogs so this is more of
like an illustration I almost kind of
like last challenge the t-shirt design
challenge based on glenties or Glenn
Jones t-shirt concepts but for what this
is very good like the colors and
everything and like the illustration
very very good alright so thermometer
and guitar so I yeah I would like to see
different colors with this in terms of
the concept of like how you've
integrated the thermometer and the neck
of the guitar and it also works well for
the frets of the guitar as well I just
think the the execution of the
illustration in the concept could have
been a little bit better just because
you know it I would like to see the
little bit maybe more detail and if not
detail maybe just instead of filling L
in with black maybe just maybe just have
a kind of like a strong stroke around it
or maybe just a little more detail to
tell that this is a guitar um good stuff
though thanks for the entry alright so
this one was bait banana and reindeer
alright so let me come out yeah if it's
not actually bad it makes me looks like
it's maybe even coming off of like a
branch or something so I pretty good
submission here yeah like that come back
down here alright so nitrogen in
business so when I first saw this I
thought a camera and just because the
size of a candor camera are usually
beveled like this this looks like you
know multiple lenses but I understand
that now this is supposed to be a what
you call a briefcase as mentioned here
and so I would say the one problem and
sometimes this is something that's hard
to avoid is you know you have an idea of
what this is supposed to be but then
other people see it and they'll see
something completely different initially
um so that's one thing you definitely
have to try to stay away from as much
possible trying to really solidify the
fact that this is a briefcase instead of
a camera as much as possible but thanks
for the entry alright so computer and
cherry yeah so yeah this this would be
what I would call too literal you know
because you just have a monitor here and
then just a cherry inside of it it
doesn't really combined into a single
unique symbol alright but thanks for the
submission anyhow now cherry computer
i'm not sure what what this concept
right here like where the computer
aspect is instead of maybe like a person
/ cherry thanks for that any oh alright
so our words were helium and facilities
alright so this one was confusing me so
helium is the balloon okay and then the
facilities is a pictogram sign of the
balloon okay so this is more like maybe
like a some sort of sign indicating that
this is a helium thus facilities I think
I facilities is kind of very difficult
it's one of it's more of like an
abstract sort of now than in order to
try to symbolize that is difficult so I
for what it is that is good though
thanks for this omission alright so this
one alright so yeah I have no clue what
this is I unless this right here
specifies what it is in which case I
can't read it so I in terms of what it
is I like the design it looks like it
was probably something like worm banana
I would assume you can verify that that
for me in the YouTube comments I but
yeah for what it is I do like it I like
a nice thick stroke asked character good
stuff good stuff thanks for that alright
so I haven't got another one I got a
direct direction-- toothbrush alright so
unfortunately we weren't supposed to put
in words so you may have missed that in
the rules I've so if you were to get rid
of these though that would be probably i
would still understand that these are
directional
kind of elements right there and then
the toothbrushes were real obvious I so
thanks for that though in other words
our carrot and egg alright so yeah we
can see that we have a carrot colors
here but in the shape of an egg so it is
combined into one so that's definitely
cool now for if we were to try to like
approach this from a logo design
standpoint of course these I the little
tiny strokes right here we'd get lost I
would like to see a little bit more
separate or quite a bit more separation
actually between these but no that's
okay thanks for this mission alright so
this one is clerk and dessert so the
clerk is you know the person in the
business attire and the desserts up here
so again this obviously wouldn't be so
suitable for a logo because it's just
too much happening so something more
like a poster or perhaps and so for what
it is I would say it's pretty relevant
and pretty decently designed so thanks
for that branch and mask alright so
let's see here yeah so I not bad so
because if you can see it as a whole we
have this part this negative space here
is for an eye so if you look at as a
whole it looks like the left side of a
mask that a person with wear over their
eyes and then we have branches good good
stuff thanks for taking the time to do
that and this one's rabbit rabbit soup
alright so good no no gradients that's
good yeah for what this is not bad I
probably would make would have made a
little bit more sense possibly just to
have this would be a different color
than the bowl but that's that's
nitpicking this is this is good though
for what it is nice and simple alright
so let's see here pencil in USB so yeah
this is really good a lot of the colors
I especially appear everything's very
consistent with how its applied maybe
with exception just to this is that a
slight gradient not a big deal though I
like it though good good submission
all right I let's see here climb and
spark all right so you know for what it
is very simple obviously as I you know
requested um so yeah not a yeah having
climb and spark kind of am one of those
more difficult ones but you know the
traditional spark / lightning rod right
there does work so thanks for that I
probably like to see a little bit
thicker stroke though a big deal alright
so my two words are eyeliner and leaf so
yeah this is pretty cool very stylized
nice smooth lines here everything kind
of flows together well good stuff nice
alright so let's see this one second all
right so the words are kidney and hat so
this is pretty good you know I like the
use of the shadows I and kind of how its
stylized right here you know not
everything is stroked the same which
doesn't have to be kind of gives a
unique feel to it I so yeah I like this
good stuff nothing really too bad to say
about it all right so all right let's
see here I sofa and drop so yep I mean
pretty much I moaning one of the most
obvious I concepts are ways to take this
so you have a sofa and dropping it with
a parachute cool stuff I wish you've
seen a little bit larger just so I could
see it in a little bit more detail but
for what it is I like it good stuff
alright so let's see here this time
ladybug and square alright so you have a
ladybug well one problem is is it's not
a square though it's a rectangle because
it's longer or let me see here yeah so
if this would be a rectangle technically
so if you just would have made this a
perfect square you're probably would
have been a little bit more relevant but
for what it is design wise good job
thanks
for that all right so let's see how my
view here hexagon in loaf pretty pretty
good here good execution of you know
because obviously this one is a simple
one yep a hexagon and you have a loaf of
bread make the loaf of bread hexagon and
there you go perfect I see how good good
stuff alright this one I liked it this
is definitely more of like a logo design
down here or a symbol I so we have crews
in shoe a shoe combined a ship comes up
with that combined with a shoe so we
have a shoe right here with the heel and
we also have di the little looks like
this is the front of the ship I don't
know the technical terminology of that
Hall or whatever and in the back and
very good probably one of the best
entries right here so thanks for that
submission all right there to temp two
words are phone and bite right so this
one I wish would be the bite right here
would have been maybe a little bit maybe
shown just maybe one or two more teeth
for to really stand out as an actual
bite mark but that's just a small gripe
for what it is pretty good thanks to
that winter and flower alright so let's
see here winter in flower so I would
assume the winter element comes in
through the color blue I so yeah I guess
that's pretty decent I would like to see
I maybe a flower combined with a
snowflake somehow but yeah what it is
pretty good though thanks for that
submission oops I gotta fix that part of
the site's not working there we go
here's the third and final page okay um
fire and death yep not bad definitely a
relevant approach to this yeah nothing
really to negative to say about this it
definitely works well for those two
words needle and summer I so this is a
very obvious take on it I kind of seems
like you know you did a
you know a son here and then we just
slapped on a needle in the background so
they're not really truly one in the same
in terms of their you know you combining
them into a symbol what would have been
a little bit better maybe it's bringing
this portion out in front maybe stabbing
the front right here and then coming out
the back and be a little bit more
effective but thanks for this mission
anyhow two words or bobcat and visitor
okay so this is very good vector work
right here definitely like the use of
this to symbolize fur this type these
type of thick strokes definitely works
very well for logos so very good entry
in that regard up here everything's
great I the visitor I the visitor aspect
I mean that's a tough one that's a tough
noun to even symbolize so I think you
did pretty good and trying to make it
look like you know some type of stranger
with the hat up here I think probably
just leaving this all this stuff out
this is well because I wasn't sure
exactly what this portion is down here
and get rid of the the the string that
attaches to the Hat and just have the
top portion would have been much better
but that's just a small gripe very good
entry though and design alright earth in
ink all right so I would like to see
this I we worked with a little bit more
here possibly just in in terms of I
actually know I actually this is
actually pretty good for what it is yeah
because I very simple which is what I
wanted you can tell this is Africa here
so good stuff thanks for that now this
one I wasn't sure how this would well so
i guess i guess you could say these are
inc la kind of like splatters or drops
and but the earth is kind of hard to
make out just i understand this is green
so that's supposed to be there but
that's still rural abstract in order to
to get those ideas across but thanks for
these emissions alright another one here
and this one was just idea person so
very obvious sort of attempt um
when it comes to showcasing it I when it
comes to gray and this white or yellow
rather I makes it a little bit hard to
see I probably would have I outline this
in black and a black a thick black
stroke kind of thick as this guy's arm
possibly on that way you could see a lot
better than just relying on the yellow
itself before it is good stuff thanks
for the submission all right my now
swear interview in hell so yeah this is
definitely this definitely works for you
know the route of like a poster or you
because it's very illustrative um but
for what it is I like this over here too
I like the colors I very good so that's
pretty much in terms of having this
interview is one of those difficult
things I don't understand how it's a
damn now but because it's not a physical
object but this is good though thanks to
that submission balloon in Spain alright
pretty obvious one thing older wish
you've done I when it comes to showcase
in it like on this big darker gray it
kind of clashes with this red eye you
could still see it and there's a decent
amount of con contrast on it but yeah
there's a lot of clashing going on but
other than that you know this is pretty
straightforward I attempt at taking
these two ideas and combining them so
not bad alright so I let's see here july
and spear alright so let's see here so i
think i assume the digital I aspect
comes in with the you know the fact that
the you know it's summer and um these
are this is vegetation coming out there
so not bad not bad I like this one the
most let's see here other other entries
right here this is battery plane I
really like this one I've definitely
good symmetry going on here and the
colors I like as well so very good you
can see the battery here but it's also
morphed into a plane good stuff
accordion in peak this is a real unique
concept even though I like I like this
design better than this but i might like
this concept better than this one just
because
I you have the accordion in and of
itself right here but there's also a
peek to work within it and it just works
real well as a monogram so good good
stuff alright so my name is a you're
gonna love your videos okay here we go a
helium and Satan so we just had these
this H letter mark with these coming off
the top or the sides rather so not bad I
cut is just adding them on to the side
that's not that's not bad let me see
here muscle and vitamin alright so this
is obviously a pill um let's even take
out some of the other one super real
quick rabbit in vase this is pretty good
this is better than the other two I
would say and then maple and stick I
think I like this one probably the most
just because you can see it's a single
shape and everything is connected
together but you could definitely see
the maple leaf and also the stick the
stick right here so thanks for this
emissions and that is it alright so
unfortunately I couldn't dedicate as
many as much time as they usually do to
add to each entry I but this is just a
fun sort of design challenge just to see
what having helped you guys approach
this yourself so I'd say overall you did
pretty good so yeah I make sure that you
I if you haven't yet make sure you
subscribe here on youtube and also check
out the design courses if you haven't
yet and the one-on-one training all
right so look out for a new challenge
number 30 maybe I'll try to do something
extra cool tomorrow alright so I'll see
you later goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
