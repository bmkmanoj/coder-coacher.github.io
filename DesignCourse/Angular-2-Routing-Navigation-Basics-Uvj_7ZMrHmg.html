cetera comm and today we got a real
exciting one you're going to figure out
basic routing and navigation within
angular 2 good stuff now unfortunately
at the time of recording this video the
angular client doesn't yet have a way to
generate routes automatically so we have
to do it manually now if you're watching
this video maybe a few weeks or months
down the road go ahead and check at the
github angular client page to see if
they've introduced that feature ok so
what we want to do first is switch over
here to our command prompt and you can
see I've already ran this command right
here inside of my project examples
folder so ng new routes project and the
reason I ran it before is simply because
I wanted to let this run through it does
take quite a while for it to download
and get everything ready to go so once
you have that ran and by the way I'm
using the angular client for that if
you're unfamiliar with what that is go
ahead and check out one of my previous
videos in this series about everything
that you need to get that working
so this basically generates a new
angular 2 project now we're going to CD
into that folder which is routes -
project alright and then we're going to
hit ng serve and so we'll give it a
little bit of time here
you more seconds see a bunch of green
stuff spit out and not red stuff all
right
and then we'll go over here and
localhost 4200 and it works ok so first
before we get into the actual router and
how that all works let's add a theme
from boots watch comm which is custom
themes for bootstrap so we have all
these different predefined themes for
bootstrap I'm going to use this one
darkly although you can use whichever
you want so what we're here I'm going to
click this down button click on
bootstrap in CSS and I'm going to copy
this and then we're going to go to our
code editor let me bring this up on the
other monitor open folder this is a
different project
and select folder all right so now what
we want to do is open up source and go
to index.html and paste right here that
link and then we'll specify link rel
equals style sheet and href equals that
URL there
alright then save it and then we want to
add a header real quick so I'm going to
go back to this page I'm going to click
on preview right click and view source
and right now based on my recording
software I can't just select something
here so I'm going to hit ctrl a and then
ctrl C to select all because really all
we want is the header and then I'll come
back here we're going to go to our app
app component HTML take that hit ctrl V
and now I have to get rid of a bunch of
this HTML because we only want the
header portion so I'm going to take from
body all the way up and remove that and
then we only want what's beneath this
point right here so we want to get rid
of container and everything down
ordinarily we wouldn't have to do this
because I you're not doing what I'm
doing with this recording stuff wouldn't
let me select it in the browser so there
we go let's save this real quickly and
switch over here to our routes project
and there we go
so we have this nice header let's go
ahead and make some quick adjustments to
it though so it'll work as we want it to
so really what's this name first the
name we'll rename this to our routes and
then also get rid of this nav bar fixed
top that can make things confusing when
we're dealing with the page content
later on in this lesson and then I want
to look at our first UL here we just
wants a few basic allies so I'm going to
get rid of this one we're going to keep
this Li help and everything beneath it
just
delete right there so we have the
opening ul and then two closing and then
right here I'm going to copy/paste this
one we'll call this about and then this
one will just say services now the href
I'm not going to worry about these just
yet we're not going to use them though
then I'm just going to get rid of this
ul right there all right so we'll go
ahead and save this and will revert back
to here and just an update there we go
about and services as you can see
nothing works correctly okay so what we
want to do now is create the components
for about and services now of course in
a regular project or a website you would
have many more but I'm just going to
show you two so you can get the hang of
it so let's go ahead over to our command
line I'm gonna hit ctrl C to get out of
there and then we're going to type in ng
generate component and we'll call this
one about and okay take just a couple
seconds and then ng generate component
services so we're creating two different
components here okay now let's go back
over to our code editor and now what we
want to do is create a new route module
so what we'll do is inside of this app
directory we'll go ahead and create a
new file and this will be named app dot
router TS okay
so inside of here we have to import a
member called module with providers from
angular core let me close this out real
quick and then also import routes comma
router module from angular
oops make sure you spell that right
router and then what we want to do is
import our app component about component
in services component so we'll put
import app component from app component
let's just copy this and make our life a
little bit easier paste it two more
times this is going to be the about
component that we created and this is
going to be the services component and
let's update this real quickly to about
and then this will be about and then
this one will be services forward slash
services component okay so basically if
you had a website that has maybe five
different links in your navigation which
is pretty typical you would want to
import all of those so now let's go
ahead and add our code here for export
constant router : routes equals and we
open this up in a bracket here but
extending : at the end and we're going
to define a path for three different
areas so for the first one we're going
to open up in the squiggly braces and
specify path : which is how they're all
they all begin and then we specify the
path now this is going to be just the
base path as if somebody we're going
right to the root or localhost 4200 and
then a comma and for this one we're not
going to create a home page for it
so we're just going to redirect it so
the way we do that is redirect - and
then we'll specify the page so we'll
just make it redirect to the about page
because we only have two right now
anyhow and then we put another comma
path match is full and then we put a
comma after that squiggly brace and then
we'll paste this and let's just get rid
of all this
this path here is simply going to be
about and then we specify the component
that is attached to and that will be
about component let's copy this and
we'll do it one more time for services
and this one is the services component
get rid of that final comma there and
that's all it takes
so now let's one final code is going to
be export Const routes and module with
providers equals router module dot for
route and then we pass a router here and
end it with the semicolon so let's save
that and now what we want to do is
import it into our app module TS so we
come here
and we need to import our routes also
put it here in the middle and this is
the file that we just created from
forward slash apt router and then we
have to add it into our imports so we
put a comma here and then we simply
specify routes now technically we could
have taken the code here defined right
here and added it into the for route of
this section right here but basically it
does make more sense to keep things
separate in a separate file for purposes
of organization ok so now let's go ahead
and save this also save your router file
if you haven't yet save that and let's
go back to our command line and hit ng
serve now everything should work at this
point but the actual pages aren't going
to load you'll see an error and I'll
show you just why in a second here so
let's come up here well refresh this hey
control shift I to get our developer
tools up and we can see we have an issue
here so we cannot find the primary
let to load the about component so we
have to add that real quickly
so let's come back here and we want to
add what's called a router outlet into
our app component HTML we're going to
add it just right here but first I'm
going to wrap it in a div class equals
container which is a class specific to
bootstrap and then in here we're going
to specify router - outlet and and close
the tag there alright and then if we go
back here we click on about OOP
one second we'll click on services just
to see yep and that's because I forgot
that we have to go back to our app -
component HTML and the links do not work
with a href here in angular 2 instead we
have to specify a router link so router
link equals and this one will be about
will copy that paste that here and this
won't be services save it let's go back
now we click on services and everything
works and there are no errors over here
also notice if we just go to localhost
4200 hit enter we'll see it's
redirecting us to about as we specified
and that is it so that's the very basics
of working with routers and navigations
in angular 2 so look out for more videos
coming up and very shortly we're going
to tie everything that we've learned so
far together in this series and build an
actual full project in angular 2 from
design to coding and from HTML and CSS
and all that fun stuff so look out for
that I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
