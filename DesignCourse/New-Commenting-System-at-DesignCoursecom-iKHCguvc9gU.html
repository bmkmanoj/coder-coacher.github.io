course calm today we're gonna take a
break from the barter for calm make a
tutorial we're going to pick up with
that tomorrow but I just basically
wanted to dedicate a video today to the
new commenting system on design course
calm that I just made from scratch so I
spent the last few days kind of coding
this up and designing it and something
I've been wanting to do for a few months
so now on each video that I post these
daily videos on doing every day of 2014
you now can comment on those video pages
on design course calm and I really
prefer people to use that commenting
system over YouTube because it allows
you to post pictures so for example if
you're following along on a project and
you know you get stuck on something or
you came up with something and you just
you just want to share your results or
whatever you can do that and people can
rate up and down your comments and all
that so let me show you real quick what
this looks like ok so now if you visit
any one of these videos you have the
option of commenting on them at the
bottom here and you have to be logged in
I currently am logged in otherwise it
will tell you to log in or create an
account and one of the first things you
want to do this will be kind of like a
default avatar gray type of image and if
you want to change that you can just
hover over click that and update the
avatar image here it's gif PNG or jpg
that it accepts has to be under seven
hundred kilobytes alright and so the
same thing with I any image that you
attach here so say for example you
follow along on one of the projects and
you want to post I you know whatever you
came up with you know you can attach the
image and put a comment and it requires
three characters basically so what do
you guys think and then post and here it
is and then people have the option of
upping or downing your comment based on
whatever you post or what you said and
of course edit very simple if you want
to delete the comment you can and but
you have to
it you can only edit the changes within
20 minutes of posting them so keep that
in mind so basically I yeah that's it so
I'm going to delete this and so yeah so
I I would kind of like you guys to use
this commenting system more so than the
YouTube that way I can interact with you
guys a little bit more and you can post
images and such which is something you
can't do with YouTube alright alright so
yeah go ahead and do me a favor go ahead
and comment on it and let me know what
you think if there's any type of issues
or bugs because I haven't really tested
it out quite a bit but yeah I it so
tomorrow we'll be back with a new
tutorial for the make it store for
barter for calm alright so if you
haven't yet check out these on course
calm and subscribe here on YouTube all
right goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
