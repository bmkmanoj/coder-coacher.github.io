course calm and yeah it's been quite a
while so I've been kind of on a hiatus
I've still been doing courses for
digital tutors calm and that's been
great but yeah it's been a while since
I've done anything for this channel and
my previous video was the one where I
asked you guys about you know it was a
poll what do you guys want to see more
from design course comm and so it seems
as though the winner is web design and
front-end tutorials so I'm definitely
going to be focusing on that as well as
identity stuff in some app stuff as well
so one of the big things I'm gonna be
changing about how I teach and how I
approach this channel and you guys I is
gonna be my teaching style and just how
I present myself on camera and on audio
and basically that change is going to be
I'm just gonna be more myself there's so
many of us who do these tutorials and
these courses and we teach people and we
all are quite boring
it seems so scripted everything that we
do and because of our large part it is
so I want to change that I want to just
be myself being myself includes swearing
I mean I swear a lot even around my
children my children a three and
five-year-old daughters they swear I
it's just who I am you know if I got if
there's a place that's appropriate to
say fucking shit I'm just gonna say it
all right a lot of people and
professionals will say no you got to
keep the profession - fuck that if I
don't want to do this if I don't feel
right doing this I know I don't want to
do it then essentially I think that's
kind of what happened for a while so I
took a step back
I waited now I'm ready to rock and roll
with some new content all right so now
with that said I did just release a logo
design mastering the wordmark course and
I'm putting it out on udemy first and
then I'm going to release it on my own
site as well so if you guys want to
check that out I'm also uploading that
promo video today so you can check out
the channel and see that and I'm also
gonna link it in the description I'm
offering a huge discount so just check
that out and also just I be on the
lookout for more tutorials and probably
won't be doing anything
challenges either I'm going to be
focusing strictly on this historial
stuff alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
