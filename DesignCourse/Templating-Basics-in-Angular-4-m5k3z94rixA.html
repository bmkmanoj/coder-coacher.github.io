HTML templates and templates are defined
within the component decorator
you're also able to find inline HTML
templates as well as external templates
within HTML files you're also able to
display data that's defined within the
component through what's called
interpolation as well as use various
conditionals within the template which
we're all going to look at very shortly
in this clip now first we're carrying on
from the previous lesson that's a part
of this free angular 4 course and so
make sure if you don't currently have it
already running run ng serve on the
project folder and then also visit in
the browser localhost 4200 once this
command has run all right great
so going back here I have the app
component ts file from the previous
lesson and this is what is generated by
default when you generate a project with
the angular CLI and we can see within
the component decorator right here we
have template URL all right so based on
generating a project with this CLI or
command line interface by default it
uses the template URL metadata property
to define an external template by
default so as a general rule of thumb
you use template URL and you define all
of your HTML within that external
template file when there's a
considerable amount of HTML associated
with that given component otherwise if
you use inline HTML which we'll get to
shortly within the comodo component
itself it will become quite unorganized
and hard to navigate through that file
all right so what if your component only
does have a few lines of HTML well in
this case then it makes sense to define
inline HTML through the component
decorator okay so the way we do this
will change template URL simply do
template and then we'll put in a single
line of HTML right here so we'll just
put in h1
hey guys and h1 so we'll save and there
you go from now on I will have this
split-screen set up just so we can see
at a moment's notice when we save the
file and the changes that reflecting the
view okay so what if you wanted to
define multiple lines of HTML well let's
go ahead and hit enter here to give
yourself some space and you can see
immediately we have red squiggly lines
and this is because when you want to
define multi-line HTML or even CSS in
the future which we'll get to a little
bit later we need to change these single
quotes to what are called back ticks and
simply delete this and it's the tilde
key and you see the type of character
that that looks like and change both of
them and then they go away and the work
now so now let's go ahead and just put
it in a simple paragraph tag how are you
doing and save it and there you go very
very very simple stuff so in terms of
defining templates that's all there is
to it you just have to determine whether
or not you want to place your HTML files
in an external template through the
template URL property or simply do
inline like we have here ok so let's
move on to the next logical step how do
we define and display dynamic data in
the template well that's called
interpolation and it's just a fancy word
for displaying data in the template and
this data is usually defined within a
component class down here all right so
when you use the angular CLI to generate
an angular project it displays a title
property which we can see right here and
it displays it through interpolation in
the app component HTML so it looks like
this right here this is notice
interpolation so it works by wrapping
double curly brackets around the
template expression now the template
expression in this case is a component
property that just says title so this
works very simply when you just have a
basic property that's defined in
your component here but what about if we
wanted to display an object so what we
would do let's create our own object
right here we'll get rid of this title
here and we'll just named it my object
equals and we define the squiggly
brackets there for an object type so and
we're going to let's put a gender male
age 33 and location USA save it and then
we'll come up here inside of our
paragraph tags we can't just put my
object because if we save it you'll see
it just shows object object right here
so what we want to do if we wanted to
display a specific object property such
as location we just put dot location and
save USA now what do you have an array
or an array of objects
how would you display those in the
template well that's what the ng4
directive comes in handy so here's how
you display a basic array let's go ahead
and create an array right here my AR are
equals
we'll say him hers yours alright just
some random bits of data there and let's
create an unordered list so ul and then
a list item inside of it Li and this is
what we want to repeat so Li we put
after it ng for equals and the
expression from inside would be let AR
are in this King this right here this
name can equal anything you want it to
be of and then my AR AR which is in
reference to this property down here and
then we use interpolation AR are inside
of it
lay the data so we'll save it and we
could see him hers and yours so this
process is exactly the same if we were
trying to iterate through an array of
objects as well so sometimes you only
want to display a given template if an
expression matches some condition so in
these cases you would use the ng-if
directive so using the example that we
have right here let's go ahead and
change this ng 4 to ng if and we'll
simply leave the name of our object here
or our array rather so we'll go ahead
and change this interpolation here to
yeah I exist and save it so because my
AR R is defined already and it's true
then it will display this list item
right here so we could also use the not
exclamation point and in this case it
won't show because it does exist and you
can additionally use equal equal and let
me go ahead and change this so if the
equals for instance we'll say something
here of course it won't show because it
is an array and we'll change that real
quick to nothing it will still not show
it however we change it here it shows
because it equals something and we can
also use does not equal as well and
finally as the last example we can also
use else so let's go ahead and change
this real quickly so if my AR AR we put
a semicolon else and then we define a
local variable other t and PL and this
could be named whatever you want it to
be named all right so now underneath
this we can use ng template
and then we bind it to other TM PL which
is the name of our local template
property or variable and I do and will
just close this off
so my aar are currently exist because is
defined down here so if we save this
it's going to show this current element
right here now if we make this false and
save it you can see it now shows what is
inside of ng template which is no I do
and we can also use then so after our
semicolon we can put then and create a
template or local variable for a truth
template so we can say for instance this
will be T NPL one else TMP l2 let's also
change this to a div
and we don't want to close that right
here and anything inside of the HTML
target that you're using the element
that you're using for a thin statement
will not get shown at all so there's no
need to put anything inside as a value
and now we can simply take this copy it
paste it this will be template 1 this
will be template 2 and this is for a
truth and this would be if it doesn't
exist so a right now it's set to false
so it's going to say false and show the
false template let's go ahead and save
and there you go
if this were true or equals some other
value it would show truth all right so
this concludes the basics of templating
and angular 4 and with the knowledge
that we just outlined you will be able
to handle most tasks that are associated
with your templates in angular
alright in the next lesson as a part of
this free angular 4 course we're going
to learn about property binding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
