and that chat is black so I decided to
set up a flash at channel 4 corset row
and flag is basically a free and
powerful chat service so why am I doing
this well basically three different
purposes first you can come there you
can hang out you can talk about anything
whether it's development design related
or not with other seasoned and or
aspiring developers also you can pitch
ideas in terms of content that you want
to see going forward for our tutorials
or courses and I'll always be there and
you can suggest these ideas to me and
then also see to get help so if you get
stuck with something perhaps you
followed a tutorial or a course that we
produced and you used google and stack
overflow to try to remedy the issue well
you could also come here and try to get
help and while it's not guaranteed we'll
do our best to help you through the
problems alright so there's a link right
here and the first line of the
description here on YouTube and you
simply put in your email it will auto
reply with an invite and then you create
your account real quick and there you'll
go you'll be in the channel with me and
this is something that I'm going to be
idling in twenty-four seven both on the
desktop in my phone and it's just going
to be a way that you guys can get in
contact with me and also each other
alright so join up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
