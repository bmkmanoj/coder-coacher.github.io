fly so angular allows you to add remove
or change CSS classes based on component
logic or things that are just happening
in your app whether they be the event
user event-driven or not so to change
CSS classes into template let's go ahead
and we're going to use basically
property binding if you recall that
means simply wrapping a given attribute
in brackets so class and then we're
going to set it to a template expression
in this case it will be a property so
title and we'll make this class so now
in our component class down here we have
to define it so title class equals and
we'll make it the name of a CSS class
that we will define in the Styles
property above so we'll make this class
name read title and we'll defined it
right here and we'll simply make it read
title color red so let's save that we'll
go back and there we go
so you can also designate the CSS class
name right in the class binding within a
template so if we go back we'll see if
we add a period and we'll make it the
name of our class red title and we'll
leave that title class and simply save
it we'll see that it still remains the
same so the title class property in the
Kapono code we can either bind it to
just some type of property like this or
we can make it true which will give us
the same
salt or we can make it false if we make
it false for instance we'll see that it
is no longer red all right now what
happens for instance if we want to
change multiple CSS classes as because
we can see right here this only allows
us to specify one well in that case we
can use the ng class directive so let's
change this here to simply ng class and
we'll name this rename this to title
classes for plural and down here in our
component code we'll create an object
called title classes equals and now we
could specify the name of our classes in
CSS we'll make this true and we'll
create another one called large title
we'll make this true as well and we
create that class right here large title
and we'll make it font size something
large like 4e m and now we'll save and
we can see it is applied both of those
classes and if we were to change one of
them to false it would remove it so
that's how you can use class binding to
add remove or change either single CSS
classes or multiple CSS classes by
binding the template expression to an
object so in the next lesson let's take
a look at style binding which is very
similar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
