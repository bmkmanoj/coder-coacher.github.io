on your smartphone or your tablet in
order to launch any given app and so if

videos that I've put out the way you can
give back and without having to pay
anything it's just to check out the link
that's in the description here on
YouTube and that will take you to the
course page at udemy ude my.com and

following there all right so I'm gonna

course right now all right thanks a lot
hello I'm Gary Simon and I've been a
graphic and web designer for the past 10
years and in this course I'm going to
show you exactly how to design iOS and
Android app launchers so app launchers
are the little graphics that you press
on your smartphone or your tablets in
order to launch any given app before I
continue though check out the two full
projects that you're going to learn how
to design in this course
pretty awesome well I'm not going to be
showing you how to do any of that
animation which I may do in the future
course I am going to show you exactly
how to design both of those projects
using Adobe Illustrator in Adobe
Photoshop I'm also going to show you how
to make sure you adhere to the latest
requirements put forth by iOS and
Android for your app launchers and I'm
also going to show you in Adobe
Photoshop how to take your app launchers
and impose them on 3d smartphones which
is great for showing clients who are
displaying on your portfolio so by the
end of this course you're going to have
a very effective understanding of how to
design good app launchers for iOS and
Android using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe
Illustrator so let's get started by
moving on to our first project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
