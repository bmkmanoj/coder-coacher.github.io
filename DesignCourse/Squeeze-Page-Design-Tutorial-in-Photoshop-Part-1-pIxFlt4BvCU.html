today is January 7th we've got our first
week out of the way with seven videos
and we're going to take a look at
designing a squeeze page today so a
squeeze page is basically a specific
type of landing page for a website so a
goal of a squeeze page is to basically
solicit a single action from the user so
this could be putting in an email
address this could be clicking a button
to download something or access
something so you'll see I what we're
going to be doing is basically taking
the paperclip letter mark logo that we
created from yesterday and creating a
fictitious squeeze page from that
example for that company so we're gonna
use Adobe Photoshop CC and you will need
access to the project files to do this
and so of course they are available for
free in the link below and also check
out design course comm all right so
let's get started all right let's go to
file open and we'll open up grid PSD
from the project files which you can
download I in the link below the video
and let's just zoom up here I'm at 66.7%
that's what fits my current window so
I'm just gonna leave it there for now go
ahead and turn on grid and this
basically is a twelve column grid and
grids are important to use when you're
designing a mock-up for anything that's
going to be later implemented into HTML
and CSS and while you know we're not
going to be getting into HTML CSS and
I've for this video it's still important
to understand you know what these are
what they're all about and basically
when it comes time to do the HTML and
CSS when you're designing your elements
and your coding out the HTML for those
elements you want to basically abide by
these grids in terms of your spacing so
if it's a little bit confusing you never
asked around with it before you'll kind
of see how it works
here very shortly so basically I what I
want to do
is I'm gonna hide this real quick I'm
going to open up the logo alright and
this is this is the logo we created the
letter mark from the previous lesson
from yesterday so you can use whatever
logu you want but probably be worth it
just to stick with this so just copy
that
4 select all and then ctrl C and then
paste it in here with patrol v and
basically when it comes to a squeeze
page you don't want a navigation you
know you really want to keep everything
as minimal and simplistic as possible
you don't want any I beat any areas in
which the visitor could potentially
leave or any of the links so we're not
gonna worry about a navigation we're
just gonna have the logo and we're
actually going to have the logo in vert
into white and we're gonna use a darker
background color so I'm gonna do that
real quick so I'm gonna take the
rectangle tool and I'm gonna rename this
to logo and I'm just gonna select
beneath that layer and I'm just gonna
drag out and if it does this to you just
hold the Alt key
alright I'm gonna drag out to will see
right around here all right I'm gonna
close that and I'm gonna double click
over here to bring up a foreground color
I'm gonna choose a blue something that's
pretty dark maybe it's around here and
then just hit OK
so now I'm going to select our logo
layer I'm going to double click on it in
the right-hand side to bring up bring up
the layer styles and we're going to
select color overlay and then just
choose white okay and okay and I want
this to be a little bit smaller so I'm
going to hit ctrl T shift and alt just
remember we're not even working out in a
hundred percent view this is 100% it's
kind of hard to envision everything
alright so if we bring up our grid and
we put this to the top I
I'm gonna lock that oh no it's telling
me my my mouth of a little battery power
oh well hope it doesn't go out all right
so I 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 we just want to
sender this in the middle basically
right around here I and then also I want
to open up the other project file called
buildings no reason I got this I it's
just a random photograph it kind of has
a lot going on and you'll see what we're
gonna do with this so we're gonna take
rectangle 1 and we're gonna hit ctrl
shift and for a new layer I call this
blurry BG and then we're gonna right
click and we're gonna create clipping
mask you could have done that by the way
with the checkbox on that dialog box
that came up now we're gonna hit ctrl V
to paste in and then hit ctrl T and with
shift + alt selected we're gonna scale
up real large doesn't really matter how
large just so it kind of just fills up
the whole area and then I want to go to
filter blur and then Gaussian blur and I
think around 27.8 works well and then I
want to go ahead and play with the layer
blend modes so I'm going to just use the
down arrow key just to play around with
these I think I like that I mean it's
real minimal you can't really see
exactly what it is at all but it just
gives you some texture that's kind of a
nice image I are a nice feel rather so
now what I want to do is take the type
tool and this is where our heading is
going to go so let's bring up our grid
and I'm just going to select between a
year left-click and drag out right there
to the end of the 12th and then I'm
gonna choose
Center justify and then I'm going to
type in try the hottest file manager
free for one year all right and then I'm
going to significantly increase the size
and try 30 Oh a lot more than that I'm
gonna hide the grid real quick
I'll try sixteen no that's too big
don't try like fifty all right that
looks good
change it to white all right so you know
this is our headline this is one of the
most important parts of the squeeze page
we have to give them you know the users
and the incentive to want to eventually
enter their email address which will go
right here all right so I I think that
looks pretty good
so now let's go ahead and take the
rounded rectangle tool and we will bring
up our grid once again now I basically
want yeah I want to have two columns on
each side so in between will be our text
box so on a third column we have and
hold alt there and okay there we go so
we want to span basically six columns
and then I'm going to duplicate this so
this layer that we just created calls
text right click and duplicate layer I
try the shortcut but it's currently tied
to my screencasting application I so now
we have that we want the end of it to go
right here and then we're going to take
the direct selection tool in it right
now kick off both of those basically
just want to take all of those points
right there at the end hold ctrl and
then deselect that one that it selected
all right and then we want to put it
right here so it's only going the
buttons only going to span about two
columns all right so let's hide the grid
okay now the I will call this button
and we'll give it a color here use
something like between a yellow and a
green and basically for us and green and
it it sticks out we're a while and I'll
just type in let's do this
I always try to avoid using typical you
know submit or whatever blah blah blah
this type of you actually want to use
unique button texts and I think that
might be a little bit too bright for
that green so I'm gonna go back or
something like that
a little bit better alright and then
over here we're gonna have like a
placeholder text will put enter your
email all right and it's just take the
move tool it apply and then we'll change
that color here to like a grey and then
just adjust it with your air keys
alright I so far so good
there's one little thing I wanted to do
well first let me take the rectangle one
hit ctrl T I'm just gonna push this up
to right around there alright I we're
gonna go back to the logo PSD and just
copy the actual paper clip and then
we're gonna control V to paste that in
this time I'm gonna zoom up to 100% I
I'm gonna drag this up top alright and
so I want to go to image adjustments
brightness contrast and basically want
to get a Fe that's pretty good kind of
like a gray color so now what I want to
do is go over to
yeah the layer styles and first before I
do that I got control-t and I'm just
going to rotate this around actually
like that there we go yeah we're gonna
put it right there and I'm just gonna
end it right there or cut that off
rather all right so now I'm going to go
to double click to get our layer styles
up and I actually want to make this
thing look like a kind of like a 3d ish
type realistic paper clip so this is
where I have to play around a little bit
with bevel and emboss yeah yeah we want
to increase the depth quite a bit all
right and you could do a few other
things in the shadow
depending on the angle it's going from
all right it doesn't have to be perfect
I let me just op just to get rid of that
entirely I was playing around with this
a little bit before and I did get a
little bit more elaborate but I think
that's fine for now then once you're
done yet okay right click we'll go ahead
to rasterize layer style and then we'll
delete select that bottom portion right
there and go to image adjustments
brightness and contrast
right around there whatever you think
looks best yeah okay now this is an
element that I may or may not keep I'm
not sure I there like right around in
the middle this still needs to come up
just a little bit I'd say around here
all right so I I'm gonna conclude this
video for today right here because I
think this is a good stopping point and
then tomorrow we're going to continue on
with this squeeze page design and we're
going to design a couple things down
here to really just fill it out a couple
testimonials and also like three
different feature sets that would be
associated with this service all right
so look for that video I and as always I
took out design course comm if you
haven't yet already and I will see you
tomorrow
all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
