calm today we're actually going to do a
tutorial for once and not one of the you
know the design challenge videos I've
been doing for a while so yeah it's been
a few months since I've done an actual
tutorial and this one is going to be
focused on creating isometric graphics
in relation to photo manipulation so
we're going to take a series of existing
photos which are a hundred percent free
I'll show you how to find your own free
photos using Google images and we're
going to cut them out and composite them
into an isometric perspective now if you
don't know what isometric SAR is
basically a form of 3d perspective
that's not a true 3d perspective but it
shows all the angles parallel with each
other so it gives you an interesting
sort of perspective essentially alright
so we're going to use Adobe Photoshop
for this
everything's free this is my about I
think a thirty minute tutorial and the
end result is pretty cool you could
check it out right here alright so make
sure you subscribe here click on the
subscribe annotation here in YouTube and
check out design course comm alright
let's get started alright so let's go
ahead and get started here in Adobe
Photoshop I'm going to go to file new
and I'm just going to use a width and
height that fits well within my current
resolution which is 1280 by 720 usually
I work in a 1900 by 1200 resolution but
just for these videos and need to be
smaller so you can see everything so I'm
just going to choose 860 by 600 now
ideally when you're working with the
type of project that we're going to be
covering you want to use a much larger
resolution that way if you ever want to
get your design printed you'll be able
to do so so I'm going to hit OK and ctrl
one to get to 100% all right so I'm
going to initially just change the
background from white to a light gray so
ii ii ii ii ii ii for the color code
alright and then just fill it in with
the bucket tool okay so real quickly i
just wanted to show you something
and that is here iso images
google comm whenever you're working with
like a photo manipulation project and
you don't have photos already right you
can use images Google to find images
that you can freely use so let's say say
for example we're looking for some
mountains so we'll type in mountains and
under search tools we have usage rights
you want to you want to choose the one
that says labeled for reuse with
modification okay so now all these
images you can freely use in your
projects alright so you can see there's
a ton you can search for practically
anything is usually my first go-to
source there are other ones of course
aside from images of Google but this is
the one that I've used pretty much for
all the ads assets we're going to be
using in this project so the first eye
image that we're going to use is right
here now I'm linking all of these in the
description here on YouTube so you can
use the same files okay so looking at
this IRA creating an isometric photo
manipulation and this is a good angle
because we're looking you can tell the
camera because it's position pretty high
up looking down and that's going to work
for our perspective so we're going to
right click and copy image here in
Chrome I believe Firefox you can do the
same thing otherwise if not you can just
drag the image to your desktop and open
it in Photoshop that way all right so
let's go here in Photoshop I'm going to
hit ctrl n to create a new document
obviously presets clipboard which is
what we have copied and that is the
resolution of the mountain graphic okay
so I'm going to leave that here for now
now when we're talking about isometrics
basically I you're working with 30
degree angle lines this way in this way
now I'm also going to link in the
description in the YouTube here a
pattern for Photoshop and it's an
isometric pattern that you can use so
just to show you I'm going to take the
rectangle tool come up to the very edge
just beyond hold alt and drag out my
left clicking a rectangle and I'm going
to double click it it's going to bring
up the layer styles when I click on
pattern overlay in the pattern preset
I'm going to choose
this right here which is what I'm going
to link and you can I go ahead and open
that up as well in Photoshop if you
don't know how to do that go ahead and
just Google you know how to use patterns
or whatever and get them working so I'm
going to take down the opacity quite a
bit roughly right around here 11% and
hit okay all right so if i zoom up these
are basically a 30 degree angled lines I
think they are at least let me check and
make sure so if we take this line tool
actually this is twenty seven point two
I think because this is based on a pixel
I pixel art isometric yeah this is the
2:1 ratio where there's 2i pixels and
then up one that's fine we can still use
this eye and it will still look like an
isometric photomanipulation sort of
thing so I what we'll do is create with
the line tool I you basically a square
that goes and adheres to these lines so
I let me zoom out again make sure I'm
going to make sure we get this big
enough so I don't you don't have to be
exactly 100% perfect on this eye so I'm
just going to left click on one of these
lines I will say a size that is roughly
I think right here would be pretty good
alright and then we'll come back down
and we want to stay on the same line
obviously and right here and we can't
see the other one because I think the
color is currently white so that's kind
of the issue actually let me go ahead
and change that real quick so if you
take the direct selection tool we can
change the fill here to black now we can
see them do the other one black okay
and then what we could do is I'll take
both of these and just hit a ctrl shift
D or you can right click and hit
duplicate layer and then hit ctrl T
right click and flip horizontal so move
tool move this over so that these
connect all right so that's going to be
the angle that we're looking down on
this isometric graphics so now we have
all four of these what we can do is just
hit ctrl E and that will merge them onto
a single path there okay so now that we
have this guide of sorts to use let's go
back here and we're going to use the pen
tool in path mode so take the pen tool
and make sure path is selected and kind
of just outline this very roughly just
come around here coming around here
doing it very quickly as you can see and
once you connect it back to the original
Anchor Point right click make selection
and hit OK make sure anti-alias is
current on and ctrl C to copy okay so
now let's paste that on top so you can
see it's a fairly larger hit ctrl T and
we're going to scale this down alright
so we want it to overlap and we could
take the opacity just to see you know
where we want this thing to kind of sit
I think right around here would be
pretty good yeah right there so once you
get situated right around there go ahead
and take the move tool hit apply all
right so now what we want to do is we're
going to take this shape too which is
the black lines right here control left
click right here and what that will do
is create an outline of the shape that
we created now if we switch back to
layer 1 with the mountains and we hit
delete you can see it's going to delete
one second well that's my fault
the issue was was that when I hit
control left click it's only going to
select the individual lines right there
so let me zoom out real quick edit step
forward what I'm just going to do is
right click and hit rasterize layer' and
it showed up off screen it's on that
menu when you right-click it though and
now we can with the magic wand tool make
sure anti-alias is turned on and
contiguous is turned on as well so we
select everything on the outside okay so
if we go back to layer 1 and we hit
delete now we can delete everything
there now the issue with that is though
it's going to cut off part of this
mountain that I kind of wanted to show
beyond this line right here so if I back
up by hitting ctrl alt + Z and I zoom up
here we can see this outline of this
mountain right here so what we can do is
take the lasso tool make sure
anti-aliasing is turned on we're going
to hold alt and that will subtract from
the selection outside right around there
I think now we can go ahead switch to
layer 1 and hit delete and that's going
to leave that edge there so we can go
back 100 percent now and hit control 1
and this is what we have going so far so
I can get rid of the pattern overlay
right here okay so this is I looking
pretty good of course we're going to
make some color Corrections to it though
I'll go ahead and do that now so with
layer 1 selected we're going to go to
window adjustments to bring up the
adjustment layers and what we want to do
is I'm going to stick that right there
on this bar and what we're going to do
is just die adjust a couple things I
think brightness and contrast and make
sure you click this button to make sure
it only affects this layer and we turn
up the brightness a little bit and maybe
the contrast and we may come back to
this adjustment layer based on when we
add the other graphics here
that's pretty good so now let's go ahead
and move on to the second resource that
we have and that's going to be adding I
kind of like a rocky layer underneath it
so what we'll do is come here let me get
my notepad out because I have all of my
references there it's already up here
and this is another one I found in
Google Images it just kind of has it in
it like a rocky face right here that
we're going to use so I'm going to right
click copy image come down here and
before I yeah I'm going to just go to
ctrl n paste that in real quick and come
back here and what I want to do is turn
this back on and we're just going to use
the Move tool and drag it down it
depends on how thick you want it to be I
think mine right around there would be
pretty good alright so what we want to
do is make this so that we can take our
line tool and I think what I'll do is to
change it from shape mode to pixels and
I'm going to connect it straight up here
by holding shift and left clicking like
that and another one in the middle
actually that wasn't quite in the middle
there we go right there and then I'm
going to do another one turning to
aliasing on that will connect those
together like that so now if we select
this I also want to get rid of I this
portion right here so I'm just taking a
lasso tool and deleting it so now I can
just select not sure if these got oh I
think I deleted that by accident this
portion right here
take that last Atul alt and right there
to deselect now if I hit delete
hopefully I can just elect just this
portion okay good all right so now we'll
come back over here and we'll use I the
pen tool here make sure it's a shape
mode again and I'm just going to take a
real quick chunk of this whole rock face
coming up up around I don't want the sky
or anything just like that so right
click make selection hit OK and ctrl C
to copy now with this selected still I'm
going to control one and I'm going to go
to edit paste special paste into alright
so now we have to manipulate this a
little bit ctrl T and we'll scales down
holy the Nault right-click will
choose skew want to skew it quite a bit
and we want it to get on basically the
same angle so if we see the bottom of
this we want this to match as well and
you can move it based on you know what
you want it to look like you know if you
get a certain area that's the sediment
looks correct well then good we can also
scale it down even more be right around
there is good so I'm going to hit OK
okay so now we can hide this and we can
see what this looks like so far
I like source of course going to be
coming from this way because it looks
like on the mountain that's where the
light source is coming from the shadows
back here lights over here so this is
going to be a little bit darker but
first what I want to do is go ahead and
do the other one over here as well so to
do that I'm going to take this shape too
I'm going to hit a ctrl T right click
and flip horizontal so I can move till
it apply that way we have this over here
and we can just quickly select that
portion now we'll go ahead and edit and
paste special and paste into so we'll
have to do the same thing over here but
we want to make this so they don't look
the same obviously so
we'll make some adjustments so right
click after hitting ctrl T and we'll
choose skew right click and scale it you
know you'll have to go back and forth a
few times between skew and such alright
right around there looks good okay
so let me hide that black area right
there and so let's go switch over here
so if I just ctrl left click it will
select us on that layer and we'll bring
out the adjustments here and we'll
choose brightness and contrast click
this down button right there to make
sure it only applies on it later and
take the brightness down quite a bit you
just right around there will be pretty
good ok I could also tamper around with
this one as well I strike hue/saturation
make sure it only affects that layer
just take the saturation down there's a
little bit too much when compared with
up here we'll do the same thing on this
one as well so we'll go ahead and add a
hue and saturation bring that down a bit
like right around there like negative 48
all right so far so good we're making
progress here let's go ahead and move on
to the next asset and this is going to
be a hot air balloon so I'm going to
right click and copy this remember these
are all in the description control n hit
enter ctrl V to paste so I thought it'd
be cool just to add like some sort of
floating objects something colorful to
break up the terrain and we'll go ahead
and cut this out with the pen tool so
I'm just going to go up around up and
around again and you don't have to be
absolutely perfect just try to stay
inside very slightly in the balloon
otherwise we'll get the outside and it
may
not look well right click make selection
once you're done ctrl C to copy and
we'll paste ctrl t + shift + alt and
scale that thing down I think maybe
we'll put it right here roughly right
around that size hit OK alright so we
need to make some adjustments with this
one as well so take the adjustment layer
brightness and contrast I'll bring up
the bright the brightness a little bit
maybe take down the contrast and I'm
going to create another layer ctrl shift
+ n to create a new layer and it's also
going to be a clipping mask and I'm
going to use the brush tool and I'm
going to zoom up because right now
looking at this there's no definitive
light source there's no light direction
from it so we're going to fix that I'm
going to take down right now you can't
see the size that I'm adjusting but I'm
using roughly 23 for the size of a
feathered brush a hardness of 0 and I'm
going to take this and make this white
and just go like this and maybe not that
much maybe like that and then I'm going
to change the layer blend mode clicking
over here and using my mouse my keyboard
down arrow key to sort through these
thick overlay might be a good option I'm
going to take that and duplicate it
again when you ever whenever you
duplicate a layer mask and there's
another layer mask on top of it it just
screws this one up and makes it a la
layer message right click and create
layer mask again
alright so now it looks like there's I
more of a light source so if I hit these
two layers you can see it's real dark
now it's brighter so that's just a quick
adjustment you can make alright so now
that we have that going let's go ahead
and also take a look at another image so
these are birds here that we can kind of
just
use the clone stamp tool to put in so if
I get a ctrl n enter paste we're going
to use what's called the magic
background
I never the magic eraser tool if you
just click once it's going to erase all
the background so then we could take
everything like this patrol see to copy
and then ctrl V to paste now we have
like these birds I'm gonna hit ctrl T
shift and all left click and scale down
so now we have all these birds right
here I I'm just going to make it roughly
around that size and select move tool
hit apply now this obviously doesn't
look you know anything like what we
would want so what we're going to do is
just move this off we're going to use
what's called a clone stamp tool and we
want a hardness of 100% and the size
we're going to come down a little bit I
would say 24 and then it's going to alt
left click right around there and we can
start just scattering birds around by
left-clicking so maybe we'll have a
couple over here and you could you can
hold down the left click as well just to
add more if you wish I'll left click
over here yeah you don't want to overdo
it too much maybe like that just
something like that now I can take these
and delete these over here
okay so we're making progress I another
thing we could do real quickly I is add
just for the hell of it let me know why
you do this by the Washington Monument I
want to show you guys just enough
different photo manipulation techniques
I I'm not sure why we would add it here
but I'm going to because I can so we're
going to paste that in here we're going
to cut this thing out so have to
determine you know how much of this do
you want to cut out around I think just
this portion here otherwise the grass
may not blend very well in with the
existing photo or the landscape that we
have
so I'm going to use the pen tool again
come up you want to go just inside start
right there we don't include these
shadow as well we're going to create our
own shadow for that and I'm just coming
around this circular area like that
right click make selection hit OK ctrl-c
and ctrl-v to paste now it's kind of
leaning over so off to fix that hit ctrl
T shift and alt and scale is down you're
right around there what's corrected so
it's I'm going to hold alt my scroll
wheel to zoom up and so that's a little
bit standing ups more straight maybe
make it a little bit taller and right
around there
select move saw move to one to apply ok
so now we need to make some adjustments
to this specifically I what we'll do is
right now the light source from this is
coming from this way you can see it's
darker over here so what we can do is
hit ctrl T right click flip horizontal
so now the light source is coming from
this way what we also want to do is I
think we were going to darken a little
bit so we'll use the adjustment layers I
will take a brightness and contrast yeah
like that that's a little bit better we
could see it as well a little bit better
as well now let's go ahead and add our
own shadow that's casting off from this
so what we'll do is use a pen tool in
shape of mode this time and we'll start
just underneath that set layer 7 is this
monument thing right here and so I'll
click right around here and we have to
look at oops one second we have to look
at this angle of this shadow and try to
mimic as much as possible so we'll come
back here maybe right here and here
now if you didn't place this correctly
you can use the direct selection tool
right here maybe just like that make it
black and take the opacity down like
around 39% and we want to move this
actually on top there we go so control
one now it looks like there's a shadow
coming off this way now we could do the
same thing coming off just down here as
well to make it even a little bit more
of a give them more of a 3d effect so
we'll take the pen tool we'll start it
just around where this ends right around
here I would say oops let me connect
these two up so it creates a new layer
there we go and we'll just come off like
this or something and right down there
take the opacity down okay all right so
a couple other things I wanted to do we
can see right here where this water kind
of meets the end but then there's just
rocky stuff here I mean that's fine but
I like to show you how you can make this
kind of make this part portion water as
well so if we go ahead and take our
layers I first you have to be pretty
much satisfied with everything you have
before you continue on to this next
portion because I'm going to take
everything and just merge them down all
the layers or at least just this one and
the two side sentiment layers so if I
take these you find this one in this one
alright so if I take these and hit ctrl
e that will merge those and then we'll
take this as well
and ctrl e and merge those so now
they're all on their own layer if i zoom
up I could take the let's see here the
clone stamp tool and we're going to make
a size more like let's see 15 still too
big try 9 9 will work I and we'll also
make sure the hardness is a hundred
percent
so what we're going to do with this
layer selected is alt left click right
around there and then click right there
do it again I'll left click over here
and I'm just coming down all left
clicking so that I get all the way near
the bottom we want to turn this little
icon on here because watch if we don't
have that on it'll come out upside of it
but if we turn it on you'll see it won't
so that's kind of like a nifty little
trick there I'm not sure what that thing
is there you don't want to look like
it's repeating too much then we're going
to add a new shape layer on top of it
starting right around here to here and
we'll kind of just follow this edge
we're going to make this a real dark
well let's go ahead and get this blue
right here and make it darker and then
we'll select move tool change the layer
blend mode just click on this twice use
your down arrow on your keyboard just so
it's a little bit darker like that just
to separate that view okay let's also
add a shadow casting off of this whole
portion right here so let's go ahead and
create a new layer drill shift and hit
enter just at the bottom we'll go ahead
and take the pen tool with shape
selected and start right here at the
bottom and we'll come up maybe right
around here out here out here and here
we'll go ahead double click this just
make it black
take the opacity down a lot we're going
to right-click and rasterize the layer
we're going to take the eraser tool
hardness of 0 and 170 pixels will work
pretty well and just blur off or get rid
of the edge there and I may get rid of
that edge as well all right roughly just
like that now to give us a simulation
more of I I would say like a light
source over here we can go ahead and
create a new layer near the bottom and
we'll take the gradient tool and we
could do a few things so we have make
sure you have this one selected here
which is foreground color to transparent
and make it a little bit brighter over
here and you can exaggerate like even
more if you take this a rectangle one
and change the color maybe just a tad
bit darker right there and if you want
to give it some warmth like a like a Sun
let's go ahead and create a new layer on
top of that take the gradient tool color
picker maybe somewhere right around here
and that gives a little bit of well let
me do that maybe a little bit more now
just a little bit more like that so you
have a little bit of yellow in there and
then if we take everything here so we
can see all these layers what we could
do um let me see here let's turn off
that control II yet we've merged
everything down now before you do that
if you want to back up you could take
everything hit ctrl G to group them and
then duplicate them right click hit
duplicate layer or use a shortcut like I
am and then hit ctrl E and then you can
hide this one that way if you ever need
to go back and like edit something
specific you can do so
and then we'll take an adjustment later
with the photo filter and just click
down so it only affects this layer right
here and you can experiment with I maybe
just adding some lightness to it so you
have a lot of different warming filters
that you can experiment with this is too
much you may want to take it down just a
bit but you can see if you hide the
adjustment layer what happens I
personally think maybe might be better
without it
or if you're going to use it maybe only
10% all right and that is it we are at
30 minutes so yeah I didn't take too
long but as you can see you can really
just play around with these things I and
make some cool sort of photo
manipulations in the isometric
style oh and real quickly just so I
could show you because I I forgot this
part we zoom up here if you wanted to
add like more mountains that kind of
just stick out you could do that with
the clone stamp tool make sure your
hardness is 100% I've maybe I'll just
take right here for example if I take
this Ridge alt left click and then start
up here and just come down we've now
just created our own little mountainous
area and it looks completely realistic I
so yeah you could do that as well to
really deform different parts of the
landscape alright so that is it I
hopefully you learned a lot make sure
you check out design course calm I also
subscribe here on YouTube and also check
out the Facebook page and give us a like
there all right I'll see you later
good bye
