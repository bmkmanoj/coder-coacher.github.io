here and welcome to day three video
three of 2014 and today we're going to
use Adobe Illustrator to make a logo pop
so if you've never heard of this before
then you probably haven't had too many
clients I've had a lot of design clients
and a certain small percentage will say
something along the lines that it just
needs to pop more so we're gonna go
ahead and do that and adobe illustrator
CC and you'll find that it's just very
simple i there's a series of strokes and
offset paths so let's go ahead and get
into it but first as always with the
design course calm if you haven't
already put in your email and also if
you want the project files the link is
in the description
alright I'll see you then let's go to
file new and I'm gonna leave the width
and height at 800 by 600 you can use
whatever fills your screen you may have
to play around with that I and we'll
just go ahead and hit OK and we're at 96
hitting control 1 will give you the
hundred-percent view automatically
alright so I'm just going to go ahead
we're gonna use the type tool and I'm
going to left click once and I'm going
to just put design course now you can
use whatever letters you want it will
work just the same so I'm going to scale
this up holding shift and then I'm going
to go to the character I'm going to use
a free fonts called rasp Atene I'll link
that in the description and I'm gonna
used any bold okay so now what we want
to do is go ahead to effect and warp and
then arch so that gives us the warp
options and basically I'm gonna leave it
right around here we've got 20 percent
for the bend and then a horizontal as
you can see if you adjust this it
changes the perspective just a little
bit so I'm going to leave this from
around negative 26 and vertical at 0 hit
OK and now what I want to do is go ahead
and hit ctrl shift o and that basically
just converts it to outlines and then
what I want to do is go ahead and go to
object expand appearance so what that
does is we no longer can edit that warp
so it just basically converts it to
outlines error all right so all right
now what I want to do is take this and
hit ctrl C and then ctrl F and we'll go
here to our layers and drop this down
and the top one we want to make this
this color right over there just an
orange it doesn't have to be specific
and then we have the bottom one which
will select beneath it I'm going to hit
ctrl H to get rid of the outlines now
what I'm gonna do is go to object path
and then offset path now that brings up
the offset path dialog if you hit
preview you can kind of see what it
gives us off the bat I think this is
fine I as it is so I'm just going to hit
OK and then what I want to do is take
this top portion we're going to ctrl C
and then ctrl F and so now we have two
copies of that now what we want to do is
switch to the pen tool and we're going
to try to get an arc that goes right
through the center so I'm gonna click
right here I'm going to hit ctrl H to
bring back our view of the points and
we're just going to left-click and drag
out to right around there
and then I'm just going to go up to the
top and end it back to where we began so
then I'm going to take our move tool I'm
going to select and hold shift and
select both of these and just move them
down real quick and then I'm going to
take this top we're gonna get a object
path divide objects below alright so
what that does is to take that that top
path that we created and it basically
intersected this type so what we want to
do now is take the direct selection tool
and then only get the bottom portion and
hit delete twice and so we're going to
do this with the rest of the letters you
want to make sure you don't get the top
portion
and finally right there alright so now
what we wanted to do is take the move
tool we're going to move it right back
up and try to Center that right on top
just like that so now what we want to do
is make this a lighter color so we can I
go over here to gradient and we'll try
something like this see how that works
okay and what I also want to do is
basically add an outline basically this
same color right here I want to add as
an outline across all of here so
basically what we want to do is hit
control 1 again we'll take this layer
take control H to get rid of the views
and now I'm going to go to add a stroke
and we'll try 2 pixels and you can see
it automatically adds a black stroke so
we'll select a stroke over here and
we'll make it the same color as that eye
the text beneath it so then what we want
to do is go to stroke and then for where
it says align stroke we want it to be
inside all right so now what I want to
do I actually I think I might want to
make this lighter maybe we'll try a
white oops I didn't mean that portion I
met the foreground and that sticks out
pretty well or we can also experiment
and try maybe a yellow I think that
looks pretty good right there so you
know there may be some issues if we zoom
up and just take a look at this real
quick like this stroke right here cut
into the actual yellow portion which
doesn't look correct so what I would
just normally do is take the pen tool
and zoom up a little bit closer I just
take the pen tool and just kind of
outline this now if you haven't really
used a pen tool I it can be a little bit
tricky at first but ultimately it's
something that you should definitely
learn I and depending on when you're
watching this you may be able to search
my channel to find a pen tool tutorial
that is up to date I already do have one
but it's quite old
although really nothing's much has
changed about it so just the software
but what I would do real quickly let me
just finish outlining this let me go to
transparency I'm just going to turn this
down so I can see underneath it and I
would just basically follow the lines
and keep on going until I end up right
around there and then end it right there
so then I turn to pass it up again and I
could hide this and then I could do what
I need to do to get rid of the one
beneath it so if we go there and we just
select this color that takes care of it
we could bring this back and control one
and there we go
so there's probably some other areas but
I'm not going to really get into that
kind of a defeat the purpose of the
course or the video so yeah there you go
this actually looks kind of a lot like
the Reese's logo but anyhow I obviously
you don't want to be using this or
overusing it too much but it certainly
does have its use and into relevance
where it makes sense certainly so I
until next time go ahead and visit
design course comm if you haven't
already and subscribe I to the
newsletter section at the top I and I
will see you tomorrow alright thanks
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
