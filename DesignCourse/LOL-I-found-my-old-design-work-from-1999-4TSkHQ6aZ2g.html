hey everyone Gary Simon of course etro
and today I got a good one for you back
in 2010 I had this external hard drive
that had about a decade worth of work
that I had saved client projects my own
projects in terms of web design and
stuff and it stopped working I could not
get anything off it I thought it was a
lost cause I grew it in a closet and I
decided to save it for some reason but
just recently I was looking for an old
Bitcoin wallet address so I was going
through hard drives trying to find it I
bought one Bitcoin back when there was
250 bucks and of course now it's worth
7,000 haven't found it maybe I'll find
it someday anyhow I plugged in that old
hard drive which was again an external
hard drive and it worked and so I spent
a few hours going through these old
projects I had forgotten about and this
work that dates back really for I think
back to like 1998 1999 when I was just
like a sophomore in high school so a
long time ago so I thought it would be
really entertaining and also interesting
to see what design was like back in
those days so I'm gonna switch to my
desktop and this is one of my portfolios
here I in reality like what is the
actual size of this let me hit reset
here yeah this small because the monitor
resolutions back in the day were you
know very very small or large in a sense
so I just have to kind of increase this
by about 300% so this right here by the
way these little you see these like
little white marks like everywhere you
don't see it right here but this is
occurring because back then when you
built a a layout you used HTML tables
and you also used like fireworks to
spice up your design I'll talk about
that in a little bit but it's not
supposed to look like that anyhow before
I click on these little thumbnails which
is my work back then I just look at this
stuff right here for here's experience
professional design HTML shockwave which
is flash back then my C cool piece of
JavaScript currently looking for a
design job obviously
this is like from 2001 or 2002 so I'm
gonna click on this first one here just
to see what this is and another
portfolio here I think these little
circles are supposed to represent like
you hover over them it'll show you work
or something I don't know it's it's not
the worst thing you've ever seen your
life but this here is pretty bad another
portfolio this says picture purple right
here and then has these weird thumbnails
of myself like who would want to click
on that and was to see that look weird
like staring you in the face
just these random design elements are
just odd they're kind of funny um let's
go to another one here another portfolio
by the way back then I didn't have much
client work so the way I got practiced
was just apparently to build a portfolio
every month I don't know um yeah skills
HTML dhtml just dynamic HTML but you
haven't heard of that this says Java
right here no I didn't have any Java
experience I probably meant JavaScript
my sequel of PHP Visual Basic 3 4 in
version 6 5 &amp;amp; 6 so back then there's
Microsoft Visual Basic where you could
program actual software executables
desktop apps but I wasn't creating
anything that was usable in fact it was
the opposite I was making people's lives
a living hell because I created a who l
punters where you would boot people off
it basically it would mass I am them and
instant message them and it would freeze
their computer we all thought that was
hilarious apparently there were other
things like chatroom scrollers and stuff
we make but still a valuable experience
in learning how to code experience six
years of computer experience for seven
hours a day every day
what was that bacon this one's pretty
old too this is a party from 2000 or
1999 again experience five years of
computer experience for seven hours a
day every day I think I thought that was
impressive because back then I was in
high school and you know you're a high
school for a bulk of your day and you
know I was just proving I was a nerd
because I'm still able to spend I guess
I don't know seven hours a day on the
damn computer here's a clan website I
used to be huge into quake 2 i
multiplayer so this was a clan site some
effing text here
blah blah blah we're gonna be design
elements everywhere it's kind of
interesting what is that like a cobweb
right here I'm not sure um continue on
oh god this is real real bad look at
this logo with the the inner glow and
bevels see we all do it unfortunately
even I think back then it was a little
bit more acceptable coming off here
let's see here's yet another portfolio I
think me and my friend we combined our
last names because we're gonna work
together Oh
back then also there was like a trend
where you would just vertically send her
like this bar right here along with your
navigation and we thought that was cool
I guess um look at this thing oh my god
okay somebody it's like puke color logo
or something Windows 2000 is out oh man
I mean we put the company aim up here I
guess I guess I was just practice work
or something this one is actually not
that bad it's another portfolio but its
unique the colors you know they they
match up well I think I outdid myself
here this says down here if the links do
not work then you must update your
browser to for point out like Internet
Explorer good old ie um what is this oh
god this one's atrocious my name is Gary
Simon I'm 16 years old and I live in
Warren Ohio on average I spent seven
hours a frickin day on the computer
tried to better my skills and knowledge
my main interests with the computers is
web development and making professional
sites for companies and then look at
this navigation looks like a I created
multiple copies and just like trying to
make it really difficult for people to
read oh man this is this has boobs on it
so I'm not going to click that I think
this is based on the current layout but
it's actually a little bit of a
structure here it's not too bad
here's another one this is another
portfolio this features some of the work
that you just saw let me increase this
look at this this is I got paid for this
mass transit in interactive its you can
barely even read the type you know I
didn't understand what do you call
contrast and all that back then I look
at this like it used to be real big
practice to have splash pages so you'd
have to click on the logo in order to
enter I thought I was being cool here I
just looks like garbage obviously look
at this one this is another portfolio
and I have like a baby I have a baby on
it's like what the hell stuff like piano
or something anyhow oh yeah and this was
this was another type of like a splash
page to a portfolio back then it was
really cool like to create these little
tiny interface elements I guess I don't
know it looks like somebody burned it I
thought that was cool here's another one
this is like 2005 so I kind of upgraded
my photoshop skills you know there's a
lot of you know I think little photo
editing here I worked in into the
interface back then and I was kind of
doing adult design so there's some like
you know xxx key I'm glad I got out of
that and then here's another one I was
my alias was dreaming by the way and
this is my little logo right here yeah
so you remember when I mentioned like
the way we used to structure layouts
well let me show you something this
right here there's a layout that I had
brought into fireworks so the way it
worked is you would design your website
mock-up in Photoshop exactly as its
supposed to appear in the browser not
you know not much it's a changes that
obviously we're not using Photoshop much
for that anymore but the still the
concept still applies but where it
differs is you would take this I this
dismiss mock-up and you would import it
into like adobe fire I forget if it was
Dobby who owned that at that time maybe
they did fireworks and you would use a
slice tool where you create slices based
on where you how you think the layout
should be structured
then you would export it as HTML and it
would automatically slice up that
mock-up image into multiple images and
replace those images into your HTML
table structure so you'd use tables back
then not divs or anything like that so I
thought that was just kind of
interesting how that's significantly
changed I also have some flash because
flash was huge back then so I have four
different flash pieces to show you this
first one is a portfolio I this is in
flash I have like little sounds and not
sure if you could hear that so it took
like ten seconds to get to this to the
point of actually being able to use the
app these kind of animations are
actually pretty cool here you click on
home you click on portfolio we have this
kind of sort of interesting
deconstruction effect which you can you
can emulate you know today like with
angular but yeah this is all flash stuff
I also the intro animations for flash
were huge back then here's one that I
did for a company called stop that
hacker not sure if you can hear that in
the background oh my I must have thought
this was matrix like or something with
these monitors I let you click it look
how ugly this content area is and then
you you you try to scroll through it you
just hover it and it just goes at warp
speed it's like the worst usability ever
um what else
here's a portfolio from 2005 okay Gary
Simon web developer portfolio it's like
going through at warp speed like logo
designs I think I had a thing for
monitors obviously because here's
another monitor showing my skills in
here like PHP Maya 3d illustrator Wow
watch is he click on this it kind of
like just glows and vaporizes into the
air flash was fun back then I have to
admit what else i here's another
animation that i did in 2005 this is for
a friend's club that they opened up in
columbus ohio
someone's actually not that bad
design-wise this is one of the things
that people had to suffer through an
intro we got a skank over here we got a
drinks we got our lounge with friends
picture yeah alright so that was a fun
trip down memory lane I could have shown
you some of the like the the work from
like 2010 just to show you how I
progressed but I decided just to show
you the absolute worst just show you
know if you're new to the UI design you
know even if you have raw artistic
talent it takes a while to develop that
I for design obviously so the best
advice I can give anybody walking away
from this is yeah it just takes time and
experience repetition is what's gonna
help you build an eye for design clearly
yeah I had a lot of pitfalls any I'll
make sure you check out corset row comm
and subscribe here on YouTube I'm
basically going full-time I'm gonna make
a video about that pretty soon on the
channel and also my site which is
exciting so I'm gonna have no other
commitments no other networks to produce
courses for so I'm excited about that
all right I'll talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
