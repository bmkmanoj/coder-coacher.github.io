course calm and this is the design
challenge number 20 design what you're
best at and it all has to be based on an
animal theme so let me describe this is
definitely very different compared to
the other previous 19 design challenges
so for something unique I want you to
design whatever you're best at so if
you're great at designing logos the
design a logo if you create a design
icons then design an icon so it could be
anything it could be a logo icon banner
photo manipulation or positing 3d etc
but it has to be based on the theme of
animals and the way reason I'm doing
this is just to ensure that all the
entries have at least one thing in
common so it could be a specific animal
depiction or a depiction of a part of an
animal or just something that says
animal ok so the requirements are it
must relate to the idea of an animal in
some unique way of course document size
must be at least 500 x 500 pixels and if
you're designing something like a logo
or an icon make sure that it's scaled
down at least 2 250 by 250
proportionally it's always terrible
looking at an icon or a logo that's the
same size of the document you wanted to
have room to breathe ok well you want
white space and then the submission
deadline of course is Monday March 16th
12 p.m. eastern standard time and as one
week from today alright so I hopefully
we get some good entries you know I if
you're great at designing something just
design that and try to make it relate to
the idea of animals and i'll go ahead
and review them in one week all right so
subscribe here on youtube by clicking
the subscribe annotation and button and
check out design course com alright I'll
see you later good bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
