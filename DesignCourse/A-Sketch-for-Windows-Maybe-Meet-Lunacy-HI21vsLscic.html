hey everyone Gary Simon of course such
Roe and today I just had a real quick
video just to do a preview of this app
that I found called lunacy which is
touting itself as being a sketch for
Windows now if we're looking at this
landing page by the way which is that
icons 8 comma 4 slash lunacy we can see
that it's free for Windows from which
you can also download at their site or
get it from the Windows Store so before
I hop into the app and actually check it
out I'm looking at this this landing
page here we could see that here's the
features that it's touting you know you
can open a save sketch file so the
purpose of this being is to allow
designers who are working on teams maybe
that have Mac or whatever I are able to
work on the same projects with sketch
files now mind you if you do have Adobe
XD and you're a Windows user or
experience design then you can also at
this point
open up sketch files and experience
design at this point is more feature
packed than lunacy so you might want to
use that instead of lunacy however going
on here so you can organize pages
artboards you can draw join align
objects use a basic type tool export PNG
and SVG and then also you can access CSS
and XAML code by selecting there's
different layers that you've created and
it's not perfect code but that is
something that I do I do believe Adobe
XD doesn't offer so that's one
interesting thing now it is under active
development and even they've created
this call to action button to send us
your broke your sketch files that don't
open up correctly in the app so right
here coming in a next release this is
gonna let you know at the time we're
recording this video it does not have
gradients it does not have shadows and
effects it doesn't have a lot of stuff
but if you're watching this at some
point in the future they may have
already updated this new release and
this stuff very necessary stuff for a
lot of projects will be or hopefully
will be integrated so I down here also
there's a comment section in which the
app developers have been pretty
responsive alright so
one thing that was real talent world
telling to me is if I do a search for a
proto for prototyping hey is there
prototyping no and at the moment there
are no such plans to be honest so this
really isn't a I would say a legitimate
contender for being an actual
replacement for sketch for windows
because sketch now does have prototyping
and if they don't have plans to include
it then really it's just a tool that
will allow people to work with Adobe or
not Adobe but sketch files in a Windows
environment but only be able to work in
the aesthetics of the project not
necessarily the prototyping or anything
like that okay so go ahead and download
it if you want and you're on Windows and
check it out so this is what it looks
like let me go to new here okay so very
similar layout also even to Adobe XD in
terms of Athiya the very simple tool the
bar over here to create a new document
you know you could choose from web iOS
Android variable devices I'm just gonna
choose iPhone X here and we have a basic
artboard very similar to XD as that's
where I've come from I haven't actually
used sketch so that's kind of my
baseline comparison and yeah when I
first tried this I was looking for that
prototype button but it doesn't exist
and it may not exist for support for
quite some time but I'm just clicking on
this we still we have a the the
properties over here when you ever you
select an element or the canvas right
here this is what the color picker looks
like pretty much universally and you can
see that there is no support for
gradients hopefully that's coming soon
we have our swatches down here hex code
RGB alpha we can control this stuff and
have access to all of our colors so
let's create an actual I'm not going to
create a full project but I'm just kind
of doing this to give a quick
demonstration get like a hero section up
here when you actually sucked something
that's not the canvas you do have an
additional section where you can choose
an image to place inside in case you
don't want a solid color so I'm just
gonna choose something
I don't know right there looks pretty
good you can add it here as a custom
color alright so looking up here we have
normal we also have blend modes which is
what that's some reference to so that's
pretty handy coming out here let's try
the type tool so I'm just gonna left
click and drag out a text area
it does remember your previous font
selection that was mine that montserrat
font I've been using lately I use a
white color here now if you try to
Center it and then change the size yeah
it gets rid of your your justification
we're just going to Center it there
there we go alright and let's do a
call-to-action button just to see how
the shape tools work if we move it
around we can see we do have alignment
tools and helpers like that which is
obviously a necessity all right how
about duplication control D there we go
that'll work let's put this in here now
if you try to scale certain things and
hold alt for instance it doesn't work
and none of that stuff works yet I'm
just I assume it will so I'm just gonna
scale this in and I mean I assume it
will in a nearby future because this is
all basic stuff that you kind of really
need so so change this to maybe 18 and
there you go I very very very very very
simple one of the cool things here is we
can click on the code section we could
see we can get access to all the
properties and that's why I mentioned
earlier it's not perfect I mean it
includes a ton of unnecessary stuff for
a lot of reasons but but really has all
the basic stuff there that you would
want we also have this section down here
right here we can export certain aspects
of it also if we come up to the menu we
can export all images
and up here across here at this artboard
we have or not not artboard but the tool
bar we can we have rollers that we have
we have access to a grid alignment over
here for horizontal and vertical we also
have to come up here just select on a
few things we also have up here the
ability to group your layers by the way
here's the layers you can group layer so
if we wanted this type layer here log
with the container control G will get
you into a group all right I
you can ungroup we can also have a mask
here let's see about actually moving
things around
alright so spacebar will allow you to
Japan
zooming you hold your control key and
then shift will allow you to move it
around on a horizontal axis so this
right here will just get you to 100% for
you alright so that's pretty much it at
this point so you know obviously going
back to the page here you know there's a
lot of stuff that is coming but it also
this seems like if you want prototyping
you're probably not going to get that
for at least quite a while based on
their comments so look around in the
comments ask your own eye on this page
they seem pretty responsive once again
for instance when's the next update I
there was one they did mention okay next
week usually we release once in two
weeks after each sprint so again they're
updating it quickly and it looks like
there's a lot of options so you know
again if you do have Adobe XD and you
pay for that at this point at least it
makes more sense probably to use Adobe
XD as it supports a lot of this stuff
down here already but if you're watching
this liking you know maybe a month or
two down the road after this video has
been released here on the channel yeah
check it out and it might be
more featured alright guys I'll see you
real soon i angular 6 is coming out I
don't know in the next day or two or
three hopefully so you can expect new
content in that regard see you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
