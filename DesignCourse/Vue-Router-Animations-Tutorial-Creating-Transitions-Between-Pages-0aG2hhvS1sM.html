and lately I've been focusing a lot on
view Jas in today is no exception we're
gonna take a look at what are called
page transition animations and all of
the major JavaScript front-end
frameworks have these in this ability to
kind of create these nice animations as
you like as the user clicks between
different routes I on the app and so let
me just show you real quickly what we're
gonna do today and I here it is
obviously very simple and so we can
notice notice that the URL here we're at
the base URL that the home page and then
if I click about the URL changes is to
completely to about but we cannot notice
that the the transition is seamless
between these pages and you could do a
lot of different types of animations and
I will show you just a few different
things you can do and really the
possibilities are endless all right so
just sigh to get this out of the way
make sure you subscribe here if you
haven't yet and check out corset row
calm alright so let's go ahead and get
started I'm going to hop into my console
real quickly
oh but real quick before we begin make
sure you check out my site course cetera
comm where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it now also it
probably wouldn't hurt to subscribe here
on youtube and be sure to make sure the
notifications are turned on alright
let's get back to it alright so the very
first command that we're gonna run here
is a view command so make sure that you
have the view CLI installed if you don't
know whether or not you have that just
view - V notice I have 3.0 and that
gives us access to the view create
command if you have an earlier version
you'd have to use view in it still the
same thing everything's gonna work in
the previous versions but if you want to
follow along just go ahead and upgrade
to the 3.0 version alright so view
create and I'm just going to call this
view router
- anims like for animations alright so
when we do this it's going to prompt us
please pick a preset so we're gonna
choose manually select features
the only one not going to choose with
the keyboard down arrow key in the space
is the view router that's the only thing
I really care about if you want
pre-processing and all this other stuff
you can go ahead and do that hit enter
and we're just gonna choose I if you
want to in dedicated config files it's
fine it's not really a big deal for this
project and then I don't want to save
this as a preset and now it's going to
install so and once it as this installs
just real quickly I I'm using Visual
Studio code as my code editor it's from
Microsoft it's free and once this is
done I'm going to run a command called
code and then a period and that will
launch it for us alright there we go so
let's go ahead and CD into it and then
I'm going to run code period here and
then also yarn serve so you're going to
need yarn by the way that command up
there wouldn't have worked if you don't
have your own installed so you make sure
they have that installed it's 3.0 uses
that and now let's go back to our code
editor alright cool
okay so right off the bat we need to do
a little bit of cleanup work here so the
very first thing gonna go to source
components here in hello world and I'm
gonna gut everything that's inside of
the div class hello and make this bigger
with my ctrl + key here alright so again
that's all we're gonna do here just for
now and I'm going to save that then
we're going to go to our views folder
and this is all stuff that the CLI
generates of course we're going to go to
the about view and I'm just going to add
in a lorem ipsum so lorem or yeah there
we go
i yeah won't want to encase that in
paragraph so real quickly I should have
done that first I just installed that
lorem little plugin go ahead and Google
that if you want to as well again I'm
just going to copy this so this is an
about page one thing we want to do as
well is add an additional class
called page and you'll see how that
works in in terms of importance we're
going to create a CSS rule set for that
specifically down the road and then
we're gonna go to home and basically the
same thing we have going on so we're
just gonna put a page here for the class
and get rid of both of these and let me
just make my life a little bit easier
just copy both of those paste this in
alright and so I'm just gonna put for
this one alright well I this is lovely
okay that's what I used before and then
save it alright so now we're gonna go
back here to our source app view which
is where we're pretty much gonna spend
the rest of our time for the most part
alright so I want to focus on just
styling this a little bit better if I
get out let's see here this is what
everything looks like currently so let's
fix this up all right so all right
delete all that within a style and then
we're going to import I in animation
library a third-party animation library
you don't have to use this but I'm going
to show you how to use it in case you
don't want to have to write your own CSS
animations for your page transitions
alright so next I let's see we're just
going to reference just a few generic
roll sets to get everything looking
decent so let me just paste this in just
a couple things here we have the body
we're giving it a gray background color
here font family we're getting away from
that ugly serif font that's default and
then the body I have a height and we're
gonna have some padding on here as well
that's why I put the calc there to get
rid of to accommodate for that and then
also our main div app ID which is right
here this is in reference to this line
I'm just going this is what really gives
it the container the white container
that we have with is 50% padding border
radius margin nothing very specific to
you know what what this tour tour is
about I just want to make it look good
and then also what's really important is
specifically for this the page
transition animations to work well I
found that addy
and this is where you know I'm
referencing that page class that we
added I I added position fixed and with
inherit I'm gonna show you the effects
of when we remove this once we apply the
animations but go ahead and just save
this as is for now okay so now we're
going to get down to actually defining
the router animation so what we want to
do notice we have a router view right
here this is essentially where our views
are placed and of course we have two of
them which is home and about and we want
to wrap it with a transition element so
transition and this is specific of
course to view name now we can give this
a specific name that we can then
reference later on so it could be
anything
router Anam for animation and then if we
want to use this third-party animation
I've library we can go ahead and add the
following so interactive class animated
and we'll say fade in down okay so where
did I get that information from let me
come up here real quick so animate CSS
right here all right so this is animated
CSS that's what we're importing and if
you want to see what it looks like to
flash or whatever these are the names of
the actual classes that we can add so
like if we want like a fade in entrances
we can like fade in and down so if you
want something like that that's where we
we first have to add animated and that's
specific to that that's animation
library and then the name of the actual
animation there so we can also add it we
also have to add another one leave
active class and this defines the
animation for when the element that's
wrapped inside of this transition
element here leaves the Dom so like when
you click from a different page what
happens to the content that's leaving
alright so same thing animated and then
we say fade out down let me see if
that's actually what I used before
yep alright and then we're done with
that and now let's close that up and
then save so let's go ahead and see what
this actually looks like in the browser
all right so I'm refreshing I want to
make sure any the CSS changes actually
take place there we go
notice it's going back from about now
let me show you what happens to this
when we don't have that page class
defined so I'm just gonna get rid of
that go back and refresh it's really
jerky so adding position fixed or even
absolute will help fix that issue all
right so let's go ahead and bring that
back okay so what if we're just real
quickly
what's experiment just to show you how
easy it is to use something like animate
that CSS I mean you can experiment with
a lot of different things let's just do
something ridiculous like I flip in X&amp;amp;Y
I'm not sure if that's gonna look good
but we'll try it anyhow just for the
hell of it so and then flip in wait
probably use flip out but nonetheless
yeah that's kind of ridiculous you can
also put a delay so that the 1 finishes
first before the other one comes in
alright so let's go ahead real quickly
and talk about next what if you wanted
to define your own animation or you
doesn't want to use this big bulky I'm
animation CSS file alright it's very
simple we can get rid of our interactive
class and leave active class alright so
now it's going to simply rely on any CSS
rule sets that we create with the name
as a prefix for the names of those
classes alright so let me go ahead real
quick and
come down here alright so the name again
is router annum so we're gonna use that
as to be getting big beginning of a CSS
class rule set so paste that and then
we're going to say - enter - active all
right so now we can use either the CSS
transition property to define an
animation or an actual keyframe
animation so if we go to animation we'll
say the name of the am animation is
going to be coming and then for one
second is the duration we'll also say
they'll have an animation delay of 0.5
seconds and we'll send it to a pasady 0
and of course I didn't just know read a
legates to specify these values I did it
through experimenting I and so it's all
about experimenting really so it's also
put router Anam leave active and these
different states here by the way there
are other states that you can use that
give you a lot of fine control so I
would suggest researching those and
that's a specific to view j/s animation
and so what's put in animation one name
this one going and for one second
so now let's define the actual keyframes
alright so we'll put in at keyframes
going and we'll just say from and
transform we'll say translate X 0 so
this is going so this is based on the
current route that's you know the
current page that's in view so we're
just gonna add we're just going to start
from where it's at which is 0 then 2
will say translate X and we'll just say
negative 50 pixels you could put
percentages or whatever you want here if
you want and then opacity 0 because we
want to leave or fade out all right so
next let's just copy this we're gonna do
one for the coming animation
so this is the wine that's coming in so
let's start it off at negative 50 pixels
and the opacity will be 0 and then 2
will be 0 pixels and then 2 pasady 1
very simple simple stuff here all right
so let's go ahead and save that and with
any luck it will work as we want it to
so we'll click on about there we go now
the animation there I added a delay to
this because otherwise I'll just look at
this a few more times you can see
there's no there's not much overlap now
if I remove that delay save it it kind
of is a little bit confusing so that's
why I added that delay now of course you
can die I'm gonna have that back you
could you could add multi-step
animations with percentages like 0% 25%
you know - from I - really add even more
complex animations but at the same time
you do not want to overdo that because
it's going to kill the user experience
and nobody wants to watch a ton of
animation when they're trying to access
different pages but for something subtle
I think it's definitely an approach that
you could take to really enhance the
user experience of the website alright
guys I hopefully you enjoyed that I and
if you did make sure you subscribe here
I'm gonna be using actually the same
technique on an upcoming course Etro pro
course where we use view Jay asked to
create a sort of like a personal site
slash portfolio alright talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
