calm today is January 22nd with a 20
second video of the year and today we're
going to do our third blender tutorial
and we're going to build a 3d push
button and so blender of course is a
free graphics application the download
link is available in the description of
this video and it like I said it's
hundred percent free and it's only like
50 or 60 Meg's and it's very powerful so
if you've never used 3d before this is
going to be for a beginner so it'll be
perfect for you so let's go ahead and
get started
okay so if you're new to blender I'm
gonna give you a real quick rundown on
about how you use the interface so to
select objects you don't left-click you
right-click so that's how you do that it
hold shift to select multiple objects
just like any other application to move
around in the viewport you just use your
middle mouse button to zoom up you use
your scroll wheel and to pan use shift
and left-click alright pretty simple I
to delete something you just hit the
Delete key and then enter so I'm gonna
go to file new just to reset everything
so we're looking at the same thing okay
so now we want to delete this cube and
we want to add a floor right now it's
empty so shift a mesh and plane hole to
scale it we basically want to make this
larger you hit the S key on your
keyboard and you can move your mouse
around or you can enter a number value
which will multiply based on whatever
the current size is so if we s 10
multiplies the size by 10 all right so
now what I want to do is add our actual
cylinder which will serve as the base of
our push button I I'm gonna zoom up here
so right away if we push this up you can
see it's actually larger I was going in
the middle of the floor so we want to
scale this down quite a bit on the
z-axis and so over here we can see this
icon it shows us the Z Y and X based on
where we're at in the scene so we know
we want to just bake this basically
scale this down a lot this way so if we
hit s and we move it around we see it
will scale on all three axes so
basically we want to constrain that to Z
just like that and we want to be pretty
flat so then we'll just drop it down
okay so now what we want to do is go
into edit mode so edit mode you can
click on this menu down here and then
click edit mode or you could switch back
before back and forth between edit and
object with your tab just like that
alright so real quickly you have three
different I basically select modes in
the first one here is just a vertex
where you can select individual
vertexes bike right-clicking edge mode
allows you to select the edges and then
face mode allows you to select all the
faces we want edge mode because what
we're going to do is take all of this
all these edges around here and don't
worry this shortcut to do in one click
and then we're going to extrude it a
little bit so to select all of the edges
on the same path we hit we hold alt and
then right-click once we do that we want
to hit E which is a shortcut for extrude
now if we do that we can see that I
right now we're just moving it up but we
we don't want to move it from its actual
position we just want to scale it so
we're going to hit s now we don't see
anything happening because it's scaling
it on the z-axis so what we want to do
is exclude Z and only have X and y be
the accesses that are scaled so Shift +
Z is what you want to do that and we're
gonna scale a name maybe just right
around there all right once you have it
where you want it you just left-click
we're going to extrude again E and right
now it is on the z axis so we don't have
to hit any other buttons and we're just
going to just above the plane all right
okay so so far so good
I what we want to do now is add in some
edge loops here and the reason being I
will show you real quick what this looks
like if you don't if you just take this
and leave it as it is I hit a to
deselect everything and then a will
select everything again you come over
here and we find smooth and then we will
switch back into object mode and we'll
pull this out here and we want to click
on add modify over here subdivision
surface and we can take these
subdivisions to 2 and as you can see it
looks nothing like what we had before so
to fix that go back here in an edit mode
a hitting tab we have to add in some
edge loops and so the way you do that
hit ctrl R and you'll see this purple
outline and depending on where you're at
it will place it in you know different
areas so you want to select on just like
right over here or hover over it rather
and then with your mouse wheel you can
you can scroll up to add these different
edges once you have like about four just
hit a your left mouse button and once
you do that you're not done yet because
then you have the option of where you
want to place these so I'm gonna leave
it just kind of in the middle where it
was and then just left click now they're
set now if we want this edge to be real
smooth we have to drag up another edge
loop real close to this line right here
so ctrl R just click once and end it
right there
so now we have a nice solid edge and we
could do the same thing up here at the
top so ctrl R and about four of them and
then left click once and then again and
then ctrl R will go right here and then
drag it real close and then ctrl R over
here drag it real close and then for our
base down here we'll hit ctrl R oops
sorry about that I'm going to edit undo
that we want to go into if you want to
see things a little bit more clear
clearly we can select the wireframe so
ctrl R will add four and then click
again and then let me go back into solid
mode now we can see now it changed it
the appearance and I'm also going to hit
five on the number pad just to get into
to a different view mode ortho graphics
so that I instead of perspective and I
hit ctrl R
actually you know what let me go in the
wireframe real quick there control our
click once and move that up to the top
we'll go back to solid alright and that
looks pretty good
okay so now if we switch out we'll go
hit tab and let me zoom out here see
we're at now let's set up a camera view
and we'll get our material making this
look Chrome so to get in the camera view
hit the zero on your number pad and real
quickly I do this every time I go to
view properties and lock camera to view
and then view properties alright so if
we zoom up maybe it's right around here
all right and then go ahead I want to
click on this this world icon and I want
to select cycles render up here and then
for the color I'm gonna make this white
that's basically the the background
it'll affect everything in view here and
then I want to come over here to the
render section and for device I'm going
to use GPU compute and if you don't have
the option set you you have to make some
adjustments in your user preferences I
believe I'll link to that i if that's
the issue and you know you don't have
this option I to basically switching
from CPU to GPU it's a lot faster for
the render time by like hundreds of
percentage so like come down here and
for sampling I right now if we leave if
we got this at ten and we just go up
here and hit render we see it's kind of
just grainy looking I so hit escape the
higher you have your sample for your
preview or your render set the better
it's going to look so if I change this
to a hundred and also real quick one
thing I want to do down here I'm gonna
change down here performance I'm going
to change this X&amp;amp;Y of the tiles
to 256 which works well for GPU compute
compute now if I hit render it takes a
little bit longer but it definitely does
look better all right so now I I'm also
going to change preview to a hundred as
well now I'll here's what preview is if
we hit zero to get out of camera mode
and we change this from solid to
rendered no matter where we're at in the
scene it's going to render it and this
is handy for several different reasons I
you can quickly experiment with
different materials which is what we're
gonna do now so the only one thing is if
you select something you you're not
going to be able to see I whatever is
selected so if we switch this to solid
right click we see that you know this is
selected our cylinder and we go over
here to the material section hit new now
we can switch back to rendered and
basically we have just a when you hit
new by default its diffuse well we want
this to look like Chrome so the way we
could do that is change a fuse to let me
find it right here this bottom one and
now it's starting to look a little bit
more like a chrome but not quite and we
can change some values here and I'm
going to change the roughness here to
zero point zero four six we can see that
made a slight change and for the high
dumb big I try to pronounce that I'm
gonna sound like an idiot for that value
I'm putting zero point three zero eight
I'm alright so so far so good
I these issues right here that show up
when you have like a single vertex in
the middle so I'm gonna see if I can fix
that real quick
and I've paused it what I decided I'm
going to do is actually just get rid of
the bottom plane in here so to do that
switch here to first two solid then
we'll go back to
edit mode hit tab first real quick I'm
gonna leave my camera view there I'm
gonna hit zero to get out of there on
the numpad and we'll go here to plane
and let's select this one right here and
that's hit delete face come back here
will change the rendered alright okay so
now what I want to do is create the top
portion which would be like this glassy
surface thing up here
alright so to do that we're going to go
back to solid mode and I'm going to hit
shift a to add a cylinder now I'm going
to hit seven on the number pad and that
gets us to the top view and we're gonna
hit s for scale just to scale this down
s again just to scale up just so it's
barely inside our metal ring portion so
let me move around here yeah it looks
like it is okay and then I'm gonna hit
one to get into the front view obviously
this thing is real big so hit s for
scale and then Z all right around there
I pull it up okay so now this is all
about the material if we were to switch
to rendered this is what it looks like
so I what I want to do is give this a
new material hit new and for this we're
going to make this kind of cool-looking
so we want to add a mix shader' so a mix
shader' allows you to add two different
shaders and then this value right here
allows you to select basically which one
will show up more so for the first one
we're going to hit emission and then the
second one we're going to select
glass all right and for the color
we're gonna make it green here and a
green here as well and then for this
value right here i'm gonna type in point
seven four two alright and then you have
options down here which can you know if
you play around with it and you like it
then I'm just gonna leave it at zero
that work well for me and I want to take
the floor so if you just right-click on
the floor
yeah let's see if here up here it's kind
of like the layers panel it'll show you
that plane is selected so hit new we'll
leave it at diffuse change color here
that's something I'd say right around
there all right and now what I want to
do is get out here zoom out a little bit
and I want to add go back to solid mode
a an emission plane so if we just left
click up here yeah right around there
add mesh plane r45 R means rotate and
that means on 45 degrees so I may want
to back that up a little bit and then I
want to give this a new material an
emission and the strength will leave at
10 so now let's go back into our
rendered mode hit zero on your number
pad and you can hit render and that adds
a little bit more of detail or light
rather ok zoom out and when it comes to
the lighting you can really play around
quite a bit so I hit 0 those your key to
get out of that view I our camera as we
could see is right here
good rendered zoom out maybe a little
bit well let me take this out real quick
so now if I go in here and that shoes
rendered we won't have that in view and
now the that plane is still selected
which is the emission you can play
around with your brightness quite a bit
and you can see it really it takes it up
big time from 10 from 10 to I whatever
that number is almost 8000 so if you hit
30 we could see how much that affects
the lighting or maybe 50 and so you can
see it begins to actually affect the the
floor down here and I kind of like that
I think that will work well
and you see if there's anything else
that I would want to do at this point
I'm going to select the green so I'll
just right-click and select it
and I this green button portion up here
and you know right-click that again to
make sure this shows up I want to go
back over here to the modifier
subdivision surface and I'm going to
increase that render to three and once
again looks like a piece of jell-o we
have the same issue that happened before
so if we go back into a solid mode and
we click on edit or hit tab all we have
to do is hit ctrl R and I'd like for
around there click again ctrl R just in
this tiny portion right there alright
now we'll go back hit tab go back to
rendered now we can see it looks a bit
better so I we can really play around
with the angles just by holding that
middle mouse button alright I think I
like that angle all right so now we have
the basically the modeling portion done
now I'm going to show you real quickly
how easy it is to animate as if this
thing is being pushed all right so what
we want to do I'm going to go back here
to solid and down here at the very
bottom we have basically a timeline and
we can add keyframes just like we did in
After Effects and even flash it works
much in the same way so to set a
keyframe all we do is hit I first make
sure we have this a green object
selected you hit I and then you specify
location so now there is a keyframe
right there
if we move forward say round 20 and we
move this down on the z-axis maybe right
there right around there then hit I
again and select location so now this
animates as if it is being pushed all
right very simple so now you're ready to
basically render this so of course if we
just hit render right now it's only
going to render just a still image so if
I hit escape we can real quickly see
that we have here in dimensions all
these options right here I'll select
that one and so that's gonna take the
resolution down a little bit we have the
frame right here now when it renders
this it'll render based on the current
render not one hundred is still pretty
low I I would actually I'm gonna adjust
mine to five hundred for the render and
if I click on animation it is now going
to go through all of these frames and
it's going to take it a while so what
I'm gonna do is pause this so you know
obviously we part we have like 20
different frames here to work with so
it's gonna take a little time so I'm
gonna pause this and then I'm pause it
when we have the actual animation played
so I will do that okay so I I should
have put a end frame over here house
shows best about 20 but I that's
not--that's no big deal so it got to I'm
at frame 21 now if I just hit escape and
hit play I'm gonna show this over here
what this looks like and of course this
is looping
but yeah that looks pretty cool very
simple animation obviously but it takes
quite a while to render this at a decent
setting I think yeah the sampling we had
at 500 but anyhow I let me see here real
quick and remove this off so if you
wanted to actually save this as a video
file you could have done it we could
have done here in blender I by coming
over here and change in the output here
to one of these available formats but
you can also let me come over here and
just show you real quick the video that
we saw that was just playing was
actually an image sequence of these
files and there was also an avi in here
but that does like it never works so I
just deleted it and so if you have Adobe
After Effects and you can use our other
applications as well I'm gonna open that
up real quick I just want to show you
guys a real quick tip let me scale this
window down move that into place here
and I've we go to composition new
composition 960 by 720 is the dimensions
of those images I'm going to hit okay
and if I go to file import file we go to
the temp directory which is where it was
set by default and just select one of
these and it automatically knows it's a
sequence hit import drag this over here
let me to scale out and now if we hit
play if I can find play or rather hit
zero on a number cat on the number piate
where you see that it goes through our
animation and you want it to loop that's
fine although you can do that
automatically and then you could take
this I'm just going to do this real
quick
maybe right around there and then when
you're ready to basically present it to
go to composition add to Adobe Media
render key or just add to render queue
and then you have your options there
once that shows up you have to save the
project first to export it in any format
that you want alright so that is the
tutorial I enjoyed this I'm producing
basically a tutorial every day of 2014
so to get an email notification of that
just subscribe to the channel here you
can also like me on the different or
like design course comm rather on the
different social networks such as
Facebook Twitter and Google alright so I
will see you tomorrow good bye
