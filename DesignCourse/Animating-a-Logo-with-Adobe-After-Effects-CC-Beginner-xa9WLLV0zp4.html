Simon of design course comm and today is
January 13th with a 13th video of the
year and today we're going to focus on
something new which is going to be Adobe
After Effects and we're going to use it
to create a logo animation now logo
animations are relevant for several
different purposes you can use them at
the beginning of videos if you ever do
any type of video series much like I do
I created the custom design course com
logo animation and After Effects so
After Effects is very powerful if you've
never used it this tutorial will be
perfect for you to get your feet wet in
After Effects so as always check out the
project files they are available for
free in the description below the video
and also check out these on course comm
right now there's no courses paid
courses up yet but enter your email and
you will be notified all right here is a
preview of the logo animation we're
going to create
okay so let's first open up Adobe
Illustrator and download the project
files in the link below to get our logo
design that we're going to work with now
this was a loading time we created
basically I was on January 3rd it was
the third video and I'm going to link
that here for you to check out if you
want to first design this logo otherwise
it's not necessary
it's in the project files already here
for you today
so basically this logo design is I in
three different groups so say for
example you want a logo or you created a
logo and the client or for yourself you
want to create an animation maybe an
intro to your videos much like I have
here on design course comm so basically
one way we can do that we could just
kind of take apart the logo and then
recreate it I three animation and Adobe
After Effects so what we would do is
first take this highlight portion I'm
just going to move it up here and then
I'm going to take
actual type will move that down here and
so now everything's kind of separated
out and we can use Adobe After Effects
to basically bring this all together so
what I want to do is separate each one
of these into its own file so I'm going
to go to file new the size really
doesn't matter it can be something large
and then I'm going to take the top
portion up here ctrl C and then paste it
ctrl V and you know what I'm going to
back up real quick I want these these to
be large so if I take them all a little
bit closer together and bring up the
scale just a little bit more all right
so now I'm going to copy that paste that
in here and then go to a file and then
export it and I'm going to save this as
highlight and we'll choose PSD and then
export this I options portion will come
up here we can just leave that for now
oops and we want to do the same thing
with this so we'll take that copy it
delete this paste it file export will
call this stroke hit okay and then
finally take the type paste it export
and call it type alright so now we have
our three layers to work with that we're
going to import into After Effects so
this is the After Effects interface it's
probably very confusing if you never
used it before but don't worry it all
takes just a little bit of practice here
and you'll get familiarized pretty
quickly so for this animation we're not
going to do something like really insane
but we're going to do something that's
simple what looks good so basically the
first thing we want to do if you if you
go to file new new project you're
presented with the same screen go to
composition new composition now this is
the confident composition settings
dialog and we can give it a name I will
just call this logo animation and 1280
by 720 is what I want to use you have
different presets I'm just going to
leave it on the default one right here
and then we have a framerate and I'm
going to leave it at that and then we
have the duration so right here this is
the seconds and then this is minutes and
this is hours so I'm just going to leave
it out for about 15 seconds even though
we're not going to quite use that much
time scan only going to be about five or
six seconds all right so the background
color we can specify that here as well
and I'm just going to leave it at that
it doesn't really matter for now all
right so if I want to scale this down I
I can specify fit just to fit in this
current window usually my default
resolution is 1900 by 1200 but for this
these tutorials I have it scaled down to
1280 by 720 so you know use whatever
fits your screen so now what we want to
do is import those files that we created
so you just right click over here import
file and I'm going to go to mine
wherever you saved yours hold ctrl and
just select those three and then hit
import okay so I now what we want to do
is take all three of these and drag them
over here alright so now we see that it
added I our three layers right here in
the actual timeline area so they're kind
of in the wrong order so the first thing
we want is a stroke we can drag this to
the bottom the highlight needs to go at
the top and we can see that it's not
really lined up so we can use our up
arrow key with it selected to get that
into the correct position and that looks
pretty good if I go to 100% we'll see
what this looks like
alright that looks to be lined up pretty
evenly okay
so I now what we want to do is my idea
is to first have the stroke come into
play so the way I can animate the stroke
well there's the tons of ways but if we
go over here we go to effects and
presets will see this screen right here
so
so basically we have all these options
and these are all basically effects that
we can drag on to any of these layers
and animate them through keyframes over
here in the timeline so I want it to
kind of it's called a linear wipe so it
basically will take this and just reveal
it from left to right so in the search
area we can find that by going in what
we want so linear I the first thing that
comes up is the animation presets these
basically are presets that are already
keyframes to give you certain animations
so you don't have to do that work but I
think it's important to do that yourself
when you're learning so we're going to
come down here where it says transition
and take linear wipe and drag it on to
stroke so now it switches our tab from
here from project where it just
basically lists all our assets to the
effects so the effects tab basically
that's at all the effects that you've
currently applied to the selected object
layer so we can see right here there's
nothing on these two but we have linear
wipe here so over here we have these
little icon which means to keyframe it
so what that means is if we apply a
keyframe or click on this for example
right here and we hit you on our
keyboard
we'll see this little keyframe icon and
if we move this over and as you can see
we have 0 1 2 3 4 seconds I and maybe
just put it right around here maybe 1
second and click over here this will add
a new keyframe we want it to go from
basically we want it to end up here and
then we'll take the transition complete
and add it to it 100 okay so now if we
want to go through the animation and
actually play it we hit the 0 on our
number pad all right so first it will
render it and then it will show you
exactly what it looks like so if we take
this
here we pull this basically this is the
length of the movie that's what that
looks like not very impressive now I
want it to go from left to right not
right to left so we can change the angle
to negative 90 so now it's going to go
from left to right now also I kind of
want there to be a feather or a fade I
don't want it to be such a hard line
right there so we can increase this and
now that gives us a nice fade all right
so so far so good I'm going to drag this
keyframe so it'll be a little bit
quicker and then I'm going to take these
two and hit ctrl C to copy now I'm going
to take the type that will be the next
thing that will come in right around
here and by the way this right here can
allow you to zoom so you can see a
little bit more what you're doing
alright so we want to do the same thing
so what we can do now that we have those
two keyframes copied we can paste those
so ctrl V and we'll paste now it didn't
copy the angle or the feather so we'll
adjust those real quick now let's go
back here and see what our feather was
138 so we'll keep that consistent and
just apply 138 there all right so that's
what that looks like and now we're going
to do that one more time
right around there alright so we'll go
ahead and control V once again and we'll
make those adjustments 38 over here in
negative 90 right here okay so we can
see it coming into play there if I go to
100%
we'll see it a little bit more clearly
and we'll hit zero and that is what it
looks like so it's not too impressive
right now so we have a little bit more
work to do so I'm going to go back to
fit here and I want to create kind of
like a radial feather out here so I'm
going to create a couple of layers here
so we're going to go to layer new
solid so basically I want the first
solid here the color to be kind of like
a gray right around there will work AAA
and we want to drag it beneath we want
it to be the first layer and now we want
to create a new one so we'll go to layer
new solid and this time we're going to
make it white we'll hit OK drag that
beneath alright so now what we want to
do is create a clipping mask so we'll
take come up here and select the ellipse
tool and then we'll hold shift and ctrl
and scale up and then we want to feather
this so we'll come down here and we see
mask feather alright so that just kind
of creates a nice background for it
alright so now what I want to do is take
these three layers and I want to
basically group them or pre-compose so
if you're familiar with Photoshop this
is much in the same way as taking three
layers and then just grouping them
together so what we do is go to layer
and then select at the bottom I know
it's off screen you can't see it but at
the very bottom and says pre-compose and
the precomposed dialog will come up and
you can give it a custom name we can
just give it a name of logo and then hit
OK so what happens is it names this new
pre composition or like a layer group I
it takes everything and sticks it on one
single layer and we can also give this
animation as a whole
alright so if we double click on it it
brings up a new tab and this is where
all of our individual layers went
alright so what I want to do is make
this entire pre composition kind of just
scale in and up real fast and then down
a little bit so we can do this through
some keyframes on the position or scale
rather so what we'll do is
come over here to drop this down and we
see our scale right here we can also
access that through hitting s on the
keyboard so what we want to do is come
up here
I'd say mobile to start the very
beginning and click that for a keyframe
and we'll make it zero so now it's
non-existent basically what we won't
ever see it all right so we just move
forward rule just a little bit because
we want this to come in fast and we'll
type in something like 110 percent maybe
120 and then we'll make it taper off
slowly
we'll try maybe on 100% and we'll drag
this up to here to five seconds all
right so let's go ahead and see what
that looks like hit zero on your number
pad for it's just going to reload it and
that's what this looks like and it will
just keep on looping until we click
somewhere and stop it so we could drag
this out just a little bit more just to
see how that looks then you can also
adjust how this comes up right now it's
a linear in terms of the animation so if
we select these two keyframes right
click go to keyframe assistant we can do
easy easy easy in-and-out easy you know
easy ease in or out so if we wanted it
to ease in you can see it changes the
direction or the icons of these to
illustrate that it's going to ease in or
out okay so I think that animation looks
a little bit better okay and then what I
want to do is you know we can apply a
lot more to this if we want so we can
come over here to the effects in preset
and you know really you have the option
of there's so many different things in
each one of these it's kind of like the
effects filter on Adobe Photoshop so we
can go to distort
and we can go to play around maybe with
spear eyes so if we take that place it
on here by default the radius is zero so
it doesn't affect the appearance but if
we go like this you can kind of see how
it affects that so if we leave it real
high I have it on 738 and then give it a
keyframe right here and if we hit you we
can see that keyframe in our timeline
and then real quickly drop that down
we'll go back down to zero we'll see
what that kind of does to the animation
so hit zero on your number pad and if
you want that to go a bit faster we can
just move those in closer and also
another thing over here
if you hit f4 it kind of changes the
view of the options basically for each
object so we want to make sure we have
the this view right here this view we
can basically change the blend mode of
the object so it's just like Photoshop
in that way so let's go over here and
then this is motion blur so if we enable
this and then enable it up here as well
then as you see that I did that it will
automatically blur whatever object it is
based on this speed at which it's moving
so if we hit zero and let it run through
you'll see that it kind of gives it a a
nice blur effect there all right and
consequently when you do do that it
takes just at a bit longer to render it
out all right so with that done we can
add another one just I'm just trying to
you know obviously you don't want to
overdo the animation or add too many
things to it but it's it's worth it's a
good practice basically if you're new so
I'm going to add another effect here and
we'll go to color correction and then
we'll go to hue and saturation
all right so we'll drag this onto there
and this comes up so we can see we have
all of our different effects listed here
already so this one has a single
keyframe that we can adjust and then any
of these adjustments that are made they
will be animated so if I just wanted to
change the color real quickly I'm going
to put a keyframe right around here
because nothing has been adjusted so if
I click that and if we hit u we can see
that and right around here we'll make
some adjustments so we have the hue we
could change it from any color I want it
to be kind of like a I want to stay kind
of close to it it'd be kind of like red
and then you could also play with the
saturation and the lightness if you
wanted to so I'm just basically just
tinkering around with those to see how
that'll look we don't want that to
happen I don't think so let me go over
here to our keyframe
all right and I was just taking around
to see all right and now let's go ahead
and hit zero to see what this looks like
all right so here's the actual
all right that looks okay I it's kind of
really quick Oh what happened was I
adjusted that right there
oops so if I take this will delete that
to sit delete the Delete key yeah that's
what that's what ultimately I was trying
to go for so it's just negative negative
15 right here there's kind of going
through all those color modes all right
so that that looks better in my opinion
all right so just a couple more things I
wanted to do we can duplicate this
entire pre composition so ctrl D and I
want to select the one beneath it and
we're going to hit f4 to go to the blend
mode and we'll change it to luminosity
so if I use my arrow key the down arrow
key to get this into view we'll see what
happens
now I also want to add real quickly yeah
brightness and contrast so if I add that
right here and and I want to come over
here take the brightness and just drop
that down and the contrast all the way
down as well all right so then what I
want to do is take the opacity hit T and
that gives us up acity and drop that
down quite a bit as well around 16% all
right so now we can see it kind of
follows it but I don't want it to follow
so what we have to do is change the
position and keyframe it so to get
position we'll hit P and we basically
want them to fall in line with each
other
initially and then out here extend it
prior to where it is now and then bring
it back down closer so we go ahead so I
can view more of these layers
all right so what we'll do is go out
here to position at the very end where
this stops so let's bring up at you this
is the keyframe where it stops moving
and so that's where I want to put the
keyframe here and we want them to match
so I'm going to just hit the up arrow
and right around there looks good and
then right when it gets to its largest
point I want to put I want to drag this
down a little bit so with it selected
I'll hold the down arrow right around
here and then we'll bring it back up to
where it was so if we double click on a
keyframe it'll give us the properties of
it so I x and y so the Y is 362 that's
what we want to remember and then we'll
come out here x and y 362 and now
created that new keyframe all right so
now let's go ahead and view it that
looks like by hitting 0 all right all
right there it goes and I want it to
blur as well so I mean it's not a
necessary thing to add but we'll just go
ahead and add it anyhow so what we'll do
is come over here
we'll just take just type in blur and
this gives us a ton of blower's but I
know what type I want set to be Gaussian
blur and we'll drag it on to this bottom
one and basically I want it to be most
blurry right here but you know obviously
the further away it is that's how an
actual shadow would work so I'm going to
click right around here and I'm going to
change the blurriness right here amount
something pretty high
I think 31 would look good and
and I'm going to hit you over here so we
can get our I don't think I set a
keyframe so there so we hit you now the
Gaussian blur will show up and then
we're going to come over here and just
put zero and then we'll come back here
and hit zero as well sorry I had to
pause there my toddler downstairs was
like throwing a fit hopefully that
didn't come through all right so now
let's go ahead and hit zero on the
number pad to see how this works so
obviously because we have more layers
and their motion blurred and we'll go a
little bit slower so it's loading
loading loading loading and now we'll
get to see the actual speed all right so
that looks good now what I want to do
for one final thing is just go ahead and
add some music so I'll go ahead and stop
this and I'm going to bring up the page
that has a free sound and that page is
linked in the description of this video
it's right here I and this is what it
sounds like we go back here okay so this
will line up pretty well with our
animation so in order to download this
you have to register on their site it's
free of course I know it's a pain to
register but I just register go ahead
and then download this file and it's
again it's linked here in the
description and so once you have that
downloaded we're going to go ahead and
import that into the project files here
so you just right click and import it
and I just pause it and import I wasn't
sure where I had that so basically once
it's imported it would be right here and
then you just drag it on to the scene
and we go ahead and hit 0 to see what
this sounds like it's going to first
load this here into the memory and we
should hear it now
it may not be the the best sound for
this but hey it's free and it kind of
works and then goes with it well and
then one last thing if you wanted to
kind of add like a tagline or something
you could do that pretty easy so what
we'll do is just go over here to this I
the logo pre composition take the type
tool and we'll just click once learn
design now and we'll hold shift and
scale that in maybe right around there
and we don't want this to show up
immediately so we'll make it show right
around there and we'll give it a pasady
so we'll have a fade in so we'll hit T
click for a keyframe change this to 0
and then maybe right around here type in
100% and go back out here and we'll run
through this again and see what that
looks like when it actually fades in all
right pretty cool so hopefully you're
able to learn quite a bit if you are new
to After Effects thinks it's a huge
asset to know this as a designer just
for being able to create simple
animations like this that also looked
good ok so as always check out design
course comm I in the future I may have a
paid course for After Effects I don't
yet at the time of recording this video
so just check out these on course calm
right now
and check out if you go there I and you
see an email area to put at the top put
in your email and you will get
notifications of when I do relate
release different courses so as always
check out the social profiles in the
description of this video like us on
Facebook Twitter Google+ if you can it
always helps out and I will see you
tomorrow
all right good bye
