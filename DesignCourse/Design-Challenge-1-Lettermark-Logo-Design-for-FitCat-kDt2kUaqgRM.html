today I'm announcing the first of the
design course calm design challenges so
basically this is something I might
start doing weekly or bi-weekly I'm not
sure yet but it's going to be in the new
forms that it created which I announced
from yesterday so if you head on over to
design course com / forums you'll see
that new form that I put up for the
design challenge so this first challenge
is going to be for a fictional company
these are always going to be for
fictional companies i would assume and
the company name is fit cat and it's
basically a nutritional company right
now not a nutritional company i didn't
go that route it's actually a kind of a
cat toy company aimed at trying to get
fat cats fit you know whatever i have no
clue why i came up with this but anyhow
the goal is to create a letter mark
based logo for fit cat alright so if
you're unsure of what a letter mark logo
is basically if you head on over the
thread I've link to a tutorial where I
did a letter mark logo design before so
you have basically seven days until you
can submit the design and you submit it
right into thread so you just have to
register real quick on it forms and
basically I will choose a winner but I
will also provide feedback on each of
the submissions so this way we can kind
of help each other and just basically
become better designers that's the whole
purpose for the series so real quick
i'll switch to the video and show you
all right so let me back up real quick
here go to form home so I've added a new
forum design challenges right here and I
posted this first challenge a few hours
ago and I basically the fictional
companies fit cat gives you information
about the company and then that's the
actual challenge so you have to a March
31st do this and we already got one
tutorial not one tutorial but once the
mission already and I'll be responding
to each one of these so ya head on over
