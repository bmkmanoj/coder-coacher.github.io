hello Gary Simon here design course comm
today we're going to experiment with SVG
animations and this time we're going to
use Adobe Edge animate and if you have a
Creative Cloud subscription you can
install the Creative Cloud desktop app
and you can install edge animate as a
result just load that up and just click
install and install it real quick I and
so yeah what we're going to do is get
started in Adobe Illustrator and we're
going to use the design course comm DC
letter mark and we're going to make some
adjustments and then import it into edge
animate and then create some mouse over
and Mouse out events to make it animate
in between itself based on that cursor
movement alright so basically if you
need access to the project files and you
do if you want to follow along they're
available for free design course comm
and find the link at YouTube in the
description all right so let's go ahead
and get started alright so I go ahead
and download the project files and there
if you go to youtube you'll find the
link directly from design course comm
where you can download this file just
requires a very quick free and
registration and once you have that open
you'll see here in Adobe Illustrator we
have the design course con letter mark
logo so if you just select it ctrl C
we're going to go to file new and we're
going to make the width and height 500
by 500 points and hit OK and then just
paste that in the center there and I'm
going to scale down just holding shift
and alt right around there alright so
basically when it comes to the animation
here we want to only work with two
layers this one and then one where we're
going to duplicate this except we're
going to get rid of the fill the blue
fill here and instead at a stroke and
then when it comes to adobe edge animate
we'll go ahead and transition between
those two based on a hover on and hover
out effect or Mouse out and mouse on so
for this first one we're already done
all we have to do is just save this so
ctrl s command s on Mac and will switch
to SVG and I've already done this
previously so I'm just going to name
mine pretty full you can name yours
whatever you want I'm going to override
it and then make sure SVG profiles
is SVG 1.1 and then pretty much
everything else here can remain the same
all right and then what we'll do is just
take this and if we switch to our fill
right here click on this and the
swatches panel if you don't have it open
just go to window and swatches this
little red slash will get rid of the
fill and then we want to switch to the
stroke and give it this color which is
the same color as the fill so we're
going to give it a stroke of two pixels
and leave it right around there and then
also click on stroke and we're going to
make this line stroke to the inside all
right
so now what I want to do is go ahead and
go to file save as and this is going to
be pre outline yes and okay and that's
all that we have to do in Adobe
Illustrator for this very simple
tutorial so let's go to Adobe Edge
animate and if you don't have this but
you do have a Creative Cloud
subscription you can download that by
going to the Adobe Creative Cloud
manager application and what we're going
to do is hit create new we're going to
make our width 500 height 500 and this
will match exactly the specs of our SVG
files so basically let me try to drag
this down and reorder things so we can
see this whole area alright so what we
want to do is go to file and then import
take both of those hit open and you'll
see they're both placed on over here and
our elements which is basically
equivalent of layers and Photoshop and
then also a timeline down here which
looks pretty similar to Adobe After
Effects if you've ever used that alright
so by default it's just importing both
of them if we hit play and real quickly
if you want to preview this HD
I'll document in the browser it is
control or command and Mac shouldn't
 or in enter so control enter let me
bring this up it loaded this up on
another screen let me put this into
place real quickly just for future
reference and this is our our two SVG
files overlapped on an HTML document and
so nothing happens at all so what we
want to do is click on stage and you'll
notice our properties change so your
properties change based on you know
whatever it is that you're clicking on
over here or over here so the stage we
have an option called autoplay we don't
want it to autoplay so we want this off
alright so now what we want to do is we
want to click on pre full and we want to
add an event here alright that reveals I
just move that over because I wanted to
be able to see this so if we click on
this we can add some type of an event
based on if you wanted to click you want
something to happen double click mouse
over I touch start this is like a for
mobile and yeah a bunch of really cool
stuff so we're going to focus on mouse
over all right so it says insert code to
be run when the mouse hovers over the
object well by default if you remember
we will hope you remember you would have
a really bad memory I we made sure the
autoplay wasn't on so by default it's
stopping the timeline it's not going to
run anything so what we want to happen
is play the current timeline when we
have this mouse over all right so pretty
simple I let me go ahead and close that
out all right
so nothing we've add we have added
nothing basically to this timeline so
even if we hover over it nothing will
happen so that's up to us to go ahead
and add some sort of animation so by
default we want the pre full to be at a
zero opacity
so that we only see this alright so
let's go ahead if we click on this we
can add a pin which is kind of like a
keyframe so if we move this over to
around one second we can make this come
back in to 100% opacity all right very
simple so let's go ahead and get control
enter oops let me refresh that and just
show you that it does stop nothing's
happening because we haven't mouse
entered over that area we can even come
over here and rest the HTML document but
if we enter that 500 by 500 pixel canvas
you'll see now it actually goes over
there all right so we're also see some
weird things happening because it's
going through the animation and
basically replaying it so what I want to
do is over here if we click on this
little insert trigger you'll see it adds
a little trigger based on where we're
currently at and all we have to do is
hit enter and just hit stop stop at yeah
so you want to choose stop at and then
1000 frames is where we're at at one
second alright so we'll go ahead and
close that and now we want to add an
event for mousing out all right so the
way you do that is we'll go ahead and
with prefold still selected click the
here and then click on plus and then
Mouse out and then what we'll do is
click on play from 1001 because if you
leave it at 1000 1000 if you remember we
have a stop so it won't play so 1001 it
will play everything after that all
right so I'm going to close that
and now what I want to do is go ahead
and also before I kind of forgot I
wanted to do something I want to take
pre outline and come over here and make
that zero opacity all right so it's kind
of transitioning between both of them
all right so what we can do now if we
take both of those holding shift and
selecting on these lines hit control-c
and then with our time line right at one
second we can go to edit paste special
paste inverted all right so what that
does is take whatever the animation that
we have selected and it will reverse it
pretty simple all right so let's go
ahead and hit control enter to preview
this in the browser all right so notice
it's stopped there even though we have
more animation if I come off of it it'll
go back out pretty cool all right so let
me go ahead and come back here and we
can even add more things to this more
animations for example if we wanted to
say after this was done for some reason
we wanted to make this pre outline
basically maybe to scale in or rotate
for some reason obviously in a real
world scenario that doesn't make sense
but this is just for learning a couple
new things here so what we could do is I
if we click on Trant by the transform
tool right here
you'll notice that we can basically come
over here
scale this down or rotate it so if we
real click quickly just move this a
little bit like in we'll see that it
adds a scale X&amp;amp;Y
so it has by default let me bring this
up so we can see a little bit closer
from 100% to 98 I so what we can do if
we being that bring that back to 100%
you'll see that now it has the keyframes
but there's nothing really happening
because they're both at 100% so what we
can do is move over here maybe just to
around a half second and now if we take
this and scale it down after it does
this animation from 1 to 2 the inverted
animation will also come down and come
back and in order to make it come back
real quick from that scale control-c
taking those to edit paste special and
paste inverted all right so let's go
ahead and control enter hover over it
hover off of it very simple so as you
can see I you could probably do a bunch
of different interesting things with
this this could be used for a variety of
purposes potentially for I I guess you
could say a banners display banners I
you could also do it for page elements
you can even add these triggers you know
right now we're just using hover on and
hover out I you could specify I believe
page scroll so when it becomes visible
in the viewport you can make an
animation play with your SVG files and I
remember seeing also several more let me
just come down here swipe left swipe
swipe right I even remember seeing one
I'm not sure where I saw that at I for
changing the orientation for example of
a phone from portrait to landscape I but
yeah a lot of stuff can be done and this
is just a very quick tutorial I just
installed edge animate myself so I
definitely plan on game
being more in depth and doing more
real-world sort of tutorials with this
that are applicable to actual you know
practical usage it uses that usages
sorry alright so yeah that is it if you
wanted to save this obviously you can
just save as I don't know why that issue
keeps coming up this error every time I
try to say anyhow you can save it as an
HTML file and then upload it to a server
and check it out on your phone I
another option real quick I let me see
here if I click on stage this can also
work with responsive scaling so if you
if you basically I enabled that I if you
had it in like a sub sort of div
container that was responsive in and of
itself it would it would scale down
appropriately if we try to view this in
the browser when there when there's no
container inside of it it becomes like
this massive document so not really
practical but yeah if you're going to
actually use it in AI in an environment
where you have a web page or whatever
you have it's inside of a container I'm
having it responsive scale would be a
no-brainer basically so yeah I'm that is
it so I go ahead and check out tonight
course comm if you haven't yet and
subscribe here on YouTube alright see
you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
