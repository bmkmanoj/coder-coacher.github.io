comm today is February 10th and we're
going to continue on in Photoshop
finishing up the design for the game or
user interface so as always check out
design course comm subscribe here on
youtube if you haven't yet alright let's
get started alright so I let me go ahead
and just get a little bit more in depth
with this and maybe a little bit more
detail so I one thing I want to do is go
ahead and take this these two layers
right here and I'm going to flatten them
so ctrl e will do that alright and then
I'm going to duplicate them ctrl shift D
and I'm going to move I'm gonna stick
this at the bottom here or beneath it
and just kind of move it to the left a
little bit and then I could take this
one as well and with the rectangular
marquee tool just kind of select this
right portion of it take the move tool
and then move that out as well
wholly shift alright you know what
that's not even like this one's out a
little bit further so that doesn't look
correct
so what I'll just do you know what I'll
just take this whole thing and just
right around there delete it and then
duplicate it ctrl shift D edit transform
flip horizontal just kind of use shift
and that way we know we're even using
the arrow keys to get it aligned and
then what I want to do I yeah we'll take
both of those by the way and merge down
ctrl e alright so now they're on their
own layer I I want to take the brush
tool and
think eighty-five will probably work
well and then just hold shift and just
go down vertically right-click make sure
that is a clipping mask wait what am i
doing I put I didn't put it on so later
sorry about that
control-shift-n for a new layer make
that a clipping mask and then try it
again and I think that's a little bit
too much or so I can just like come
around here hold shift and that way it's
straight and vertical same thing down
there
alright so it kind of gives us you know
a little bit more of a feeling that that
thing is 3d all right so now what I want
to do is kind of create some like flares
or something I don't know how to really
to describe it otherwise so what we'll
do is all right we'll create a new layer
control-shift-n and what does that metal
okay so we want this to be yeah right
here in the middle between this and this
so well it's call this flare and we'll
take the paintbrush tool and make the
size mean right around right around here
I think 260 would work and we'll make
our foreground white and just click once
control T alt and scale that thing down
roughly right around there and if you
want maybe a little bit longer holding
alt all right just like a move till it
apply and we'll just delete this portion
and you can get this kind of centered
vertically and then I'm going to
duplicate that ctrl T hold alt and also
scaled out a little bit long more so in
that direction and delete that portion
so now we have like this thing and we
could probably take down the opacity a
little bit now we have like this thin
thing in the middle you could play
around with it and it doesn't have to be
specific to what I'm doing
let's create yeah we can merge those so
truly create a new layer will call this
glow take our paint brush tool and this
time we're gonna use like a blue right
around here try to get that centered
there and delete this inner portion I
think we probably put that beneath yeah
that'll work
also real quickly I'm going to get a new
layer just above the background layer
and hit okay we're going to go to okay
first I'm gonna take the foreground make
it a get darker sort of blue and then go
to filter render clouds alright so we
could probably take the opacity down a
little bit or quite a bit actually and
that way it just kind of like a texture
to work with back there and let's see
here take this glow here yeah
maybe take the opacity and you know you
can always just create new layers and
just experiment with different colors so
I want this to be a little bit more of a
lighter blue color maybe take the size
down on this one a little bit more so
it's brighter in the center click right
there get rid of that and that just kind
of creates a cool little effect here I
mean I don't know why there would be
light spewing out lots of this thing but
because we can we will right it makes it
look cool so now what we're gonna do
we're gonna leave this on its own layer
layer fourth we'll just call this glow
too well you know whatever that's that
middle one yeah these can all I think be
on their own separate layer and the
reason I'm keeping them I'm paying
attention to the layers here is because
when we go to export these images for
use within After Effects
then you know the more layers we have
the more things that are separated out
the more it allow you to basically
create a really cool animation that's a
kind of intricate the more things are
all stuck on one layer and limits your
ability to you know play around and make
it look cool so this is on some layer
that that what else is you know these
things they can probably going to shoot
out from the side when it's kind of
constructing itself these things and
this thing yeah all right so now what I
want to do is I'm gonna take yeah those
three layers group them up and duplicate
it ctrl shift D go to edit transform
flip horizontal move it over you know
yeah basically the same thing and I let
me think you know also another thing I
wanted to note is you could probably do
some real cool stuff like if your
intention wasn't to animate this stuff
and you just kind of wanted to show a
cool picture or something you can always
play around with like let me see like
this glow right here with the layer of
blend modes and you can really create
some just cool effects just by using
your down arrow key and just kind of
playing with them but the problem is is
when you have blend modes and then you
try to save it it usually doesn't save
the blend mode so it just goes to normal
that's what I'm doing that it still
looks cool all right so let's see here
what else do I want to do I let's work
with this inner portion right here so I
let us go just above this cloud layer
and creating it well yeah create a new
layer and select the rectangle tool
color right now doesn't matter and we're
just going to go just outside of the
viewable portion of this inner screen
area and I want it to be black all right
cool um what else do I want to do ah
let's see here we can create
let's call this green by the way create
a new layer Petrille shift and make it a
clipping mask so anything goes in here
is only displayed in there um let's see
here well not yet
let's I double click on this portion to
screen and maybe do it a gradient
overlay and we'll take the gradient
editor and we'll make this one black and
this one maybe just barely blue and you
could play around with these color
picker things and really create
interesting sorts of designs let's see
here you're right on their head ok and
then what else I we can do an inner
shadow no inner glow take the blend mode
to normal and just so we could see it
you could take that size up quite a bit
maybe change that to black for the color
and you could change the choke too so
that you know it goes from a fade to
like a hard sort of glow and yeah maybe
right around there is fine all right
it's hit okay looking cool so far all
right so let's go ahead and put some
text in here I'm gonna go up to the top
create a new layer and with the type
tool left click and drag right around
here and then make sure this is centered
and we'll type in you know whatever you
want to type in I'm just going to put
troll level expert 100 K I don't even
know what that means but whatever
alright so I let me we want to make sure
this is
centered vertically here and let me take
the yeah make sure anti-hazing is smooth
let's take the size up quite a bit not
that much the color right around there I
the font you know you can use whatever
you want use like a digital type of font
if you wanted to go and find one of
those maybe at like I say like da font
calm I'm gonna use something called
trade gothic this is a font that I paid
for but I you don't have to use it
obviously I kind of just like it so let
me scale that down right around there
and if you want to you can double click
on the right side of that layer and go
to outer glow and ya make it like a blue
if you want and you can see how this
affects sort of you know how it glows a
little bit kind of creates a cool type
of image get it okay and let's see what
else do I want to do I could I you can
create some a ton of horizontal lines in
here kind of to give it like a t.v
effect so we can do that real quick come
back down here to the screen and we
never put anything in that layer right
here so we'll just use that and take the
line tool the color right now doesn't
matter just hold shift and just go out
to that distance ctrl H it gets rid of
it and I think we have to go back here
change that again and now what we want
to do is just I take that shape layer
duplicate it use your up arrow and twice
so just hit up twice that puts it up two
pixels
take those two hit ctrl e and let's zoom
up here 200% and just keep on doing that
then real quickly you'll get to the
point where yeah that's a hundred
percent yeah you know what I screwed up
initially so I'm going to go back there
we go they weren't even there so I'm
just duplicating these things trying to
make sure they remain even like that
ctrl e duplicate duplicate just like
both of them ctrl e duplicate one more
time that's all we're gonna need and
duplicate our merge rather and alright
so now what we can do is just go to let
me zoom out a little bit actually now
I'll leave it right here now what we can
do is I you know kind of experiment with
the opacity and that looks cool I think
right there that's only about 12%
opacity so zoom out here just kind of
see everything alright okay so just
trying to think if there's anything else
I could possibly screw around with yeah
there is okay so we're gonna I'm gonna
call this clouds or cloud or whatever
ctrl shift and a new layer we're going
to take the paintbrush tool maybe go up
around 4 and yeah around 400 pixels no I
want to go bigger alright so let's try
like 600
and not quite 600 struck 500 right
around there
and yeah right around there and so you
know the idea behind this now is you
know we created kind of like a final
static you know obviously nothing
animates yet view of what we want this
thing to look like after it comes in and
it animates and after-effects so it's
gonna be real cool I hope at least
alright so I think we're gonna end there
and then tomorrow we're gonna go ahead
and start getting this thing ready we're
gonna export these images and start
animating it in after-effects alright so
