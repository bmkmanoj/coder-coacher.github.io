welcome to the seventh lesson that's a
part of the hundred percent free
ethereum spar contract development for
beginners course boy that's a mouthful
so in this lesson we're going to talk
about inheritance which up to this point
we've only been working with one smart
contract really and usually it more
robust decentralized apps you have
multiple smart contracts that are
derived or inherited from each other so
this allows you to avoid redundancy and
reusing code so looking at our I course
set row or courses contract that we've
been working on we're going to create a
new base contract up at the top and
we're gonna call this contract owned and
inside of here we're going to put in
address owner function owned and this is
our constructor which gets ran once when
the smart contract is created owner
equals message sender and you'll if
you've been following along throughout
this course all this looks pretty
familiar to you
modifier is only owner so we can add a
modifier in this base contract and we'll
require that the message sender is equal
to the owner all right and if it's if it
is then we'll run the function body from
which this modifier has been placed so
that's what our base contract looks like
so how do we make courses inherit from
owned well is owned very very simple so
the way we're going to test to see if
this works well simply add is own the
modifier to set instructor in other
words only the smart contract creator
the owner of this smart contract will be
able to add new instructors and nobody
else so what we'll do now is by the way
make sure your web 3 provider is select
an environment and the test RPC is
running in your console and we'll hit
create
oh we have an issue let me make sure up
only owner sorry about that is owned I'm
mixing up my variable names here so now
what we want to do is just to give this
a test we'll try a different account
just to make sure errors so we'll copy
the address put it in quotes here put it
in 43 for the Aged name whoever name
whatever
last name there we go set instructor and
we could see that it fails because this
did not work so we can see that this is
now derived and that is basically in a
very basic sense like I mentioned how
the inheritance works with smart
contracts alright so there's other
things you can do like pass arguments
but we're not really gonna focus on this
is just a beginner course all right so
now throughout the rest of this lesson
we're not gonna really focus on
inheritance but we're gonna focus on
just a few other things I do to get us
to the point where we can deploy this
contract in the next lesson so a couple
changes I want to make before we get to
that point in this smart contract is
we're going to change every instance of
type string for the first name and last
name two bytes 16 and the reason is
because strings when it comes to I
updating and deploying string types it's
actually pretty costly on the etherium
network so if we can you always get away
was defining them as bytes so byte 16 s
basically 16 characters for the first
name and last name we're gonna change
this string type here here and here so
just about 5 places so far and I also do
want to add any event so in our previous
contract we had an event for when a new
instructor is added or updated so it's
add an event right here and that is
going to be event
instructor info inside of here we're
going to have a bytes 16 of fname bytes
16 of L name and a UI and T unsigned
integer of age and I don't know why I
always do that that should not be
semicolon should be commas all right
great
so now let's add that at the end of set
instructor we'll call the event and
we'll do that by instructor info the
event name you pass in F name L name and
age alright great so this right here
this contract is all done and we're not
going to modify any further in this
course so at this point what we want to
do is install an NPM package called Lite
server so this light server will instead
of us just accessing the project
directly on a hard drive at index dot
HTML where it's going to set it up in a
server environment in this way when we
use Mayta mask and I'll show you how to
install that momentarily the web 3
instance will be able to be injected
into the Dom otherwise if you're just
running the file on your hard drive
we made a mask will not work so that's
why this steps necessary so we're going
to come over to our console and we're
going to run npm install make sure
you're in the project folder light -
server and then save dev i'm not going
to do that i already installed it so let
that run through and once it's done you
think and then go back to your code
editor and make sure under dev
dependencies here in the package shot
JSON file you have light server once you
do we can come back to our console and
type in NPM run dev so this will launch
a browser and there we go awesome so
next we want to make sure that we have
made a mask installed and so main a mask
is basically a Chrome extension that
brings aetherium to your browser provide
you with
wallet and the ability to connect to
different test networks as well as the
main aetherium blockchain so the way you
use it by the way like I mentioned it's
a Chrome extension so just go to google
and type in I made a mask Chrome
extension click Add to Chrome you can
when you click it it's act accessible in
your toolbar after its installed right
here so you click I agree the first time
you run it create a new vault hit OK
it's going to have these this vault
created and these twelve words can
restore your account do that and then
once you're there at this test net in
this section you'll have a screen
similar to this eye that's shown right
here so if your says 0 ETH you can just
click buy and then go to the Rossmann
test neck and say request one ether from
faucet this doesn't actually cost you
any money because again we're on the
test network so click this and you'll
have the ether show up momentarily in
your account up here alright so now
we're gonna go back to our remix IDE and
we're gonna change this to from web 3
provider to injected web 3 all right so
now this address is basically this
address up here alright so at this point
now we can go ahead and create this and
this time we see this little window show
up and this didn't happen before with
the JavaScript EVM or the
sorry the test RPC and this is because
this test network more accurate
accurately depicts what happens when
you're interacting with a smart contract
like on the live blockchain so we're
going to hit submit and this will
actually take a little bit of time for
it to run through and while we're
waiting for that we're going to compile
details copy the interface ABI and this
is something we've done quite a bit
throughout this course if you've been
following and we're gonna go to our
index.html come down here under web 3 e
th contraire
save that we'll go back to the remix IDE
and we'll see it has now been added you
can see this is reflected above here as
well so it's no longer pending we can
copy this section right here for the
address and go back and paste that right
there so now we can hit save and at this
point I'm going to conclude this video
and in the next lesson we're going to
wrap everything up by making some
adjustments to our web 3ui project and
then interacting with it add the test
