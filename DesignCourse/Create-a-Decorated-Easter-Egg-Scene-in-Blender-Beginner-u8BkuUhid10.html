today's Easter so I thought I would do a
relevant project in blender and show you
how to create and design a label around
a realistic egg alright so if you've
never used blender before this would be
a good tutorial for you blender of
course is a three free 3d application
you can download at blender org and it's
only about 50 Meg's so it's very quick
and I'll try to make this as easy as
possible for you to follow it's just an
egg shape so it's not that advanced so
yeah check out these nine course comm if
you haven't yet and subscribe here at
YouTube okay so if you've never used
blender before basically the way you
select objects is by default is to
right-click them and to move around in
the viewport you can use your middle bow
mouse button or third mouse button and
to zoom up you just use your scroll
wheel and to pan you hold shift in that
same middle and third or third mouse
button very easy so it'll take a little
while to get used to just you know
learning how to move around just a
matter of messy muscle memory and
repetition so I'm gonna file a new
reload the startup file so we're looking
at the same thing and so obviously the
first question you have to ask yourself
you know what is the basic shape that
we're starting with and that is not a
cube so hit delete and then enter so
this little thing here it looks like I
come across air it's called the origin
point and basically wherever that is and
you can left-click to specify where it
goes
that's where that object that you're
about to add will be placed so we're
gonna leave it right there and not click
anything so shift a will bring up this
menu so shift a we're gonna add mesh and
a UV sphere okay
and off the back I'm going to leave it
at 32 segments
ring 16 size 1 and what I want to do now
is if we hit 5 on the number pad on your
keyboard you'll see right here by
default we're currently into perspective
mode that means you know this is based
on a realistic 3d perspective view if we
hit 5 we'll see things kind of change a
little bit and it's changed to the
orthographic mode and that makes dealing
with eye model
in general very easy so hit five you can
toggle between those two options so we
want to go to the stick with the ortho
mode and I'm also going to hit 1 on the
number pad and that will get us to the
front view alright so I'm going to zoom
up here with the scroll wheel and right
now we're in object mode you have also
edit mode usually you're switching a lot
between both of these modes and object
mode allows allows you to do things like
scale and object rotate it move it
around but edit mode gives you a further
amount of control and you can switch
between those two by the way by hitting
tab and so now what we want to do
obviously an egg is not a perfect sphere
so we want to hit we want to scale it
but only on the z axis so if you hit S
on your keyboard that allows you to
scale something but it's proportional by
default but you can specify either X Y
or Z X we can make it this way Y is what
you can't really tell from this angle I
hit undo ctrl Z but to go S we want to
do a on Z so s and z and right around
there looks pretty accurate and so now
when it comes to an actual egg shape
usually on the bottom it's a little bit
thicker than it is on the top so
basically what we want to do is just
select this initial ring here so I want
to turn on this this button so what this
does is let's say for example we I I'm
gonna hit a to deselect all and that by
the way will allow you to toggle between
selecting all or none I'm gonna hit B
now B is kind of like if you've ever
used Photoshop it's kind of like the eye
I guess you could say the lasso tool and
then if you just left-click and drag out
and let you select but if we turn and we
look around in this view we'll see it
only selected the visible vertices so
hit one again to get the front view hit
a if you turn this on hit B again now
let's just select everything so it's
kind of important
all right so what we want to do is only
select this upper edge I guess you could
call it so what you would do is right
click and hit alt like that and selected
all the top ones and so if we hit one
and now we also turn this on
proportional editing we want connected
and we hit s for scale we can see this
circle around it you can control the
idea the diameter with your scroll wheel
on your mouse so if you turn this up
roughly quite high you'll see that it
gives us the desired shape at the top
all right
I'm very simple and that concludes the
modeling portion so I yeah very simple
so now what we need to do is I'm going
to go back to tab to object mode I'm
just going to drag this up here now but
as default we want to turn on smooth the
smooth shading because right now we can
see all these individual faces based on
the lighting so the way you do that it's
over here we have shading we have smooth
fat right now it's on flat hit smooth
now the damn thing looks smooth awesome
so now let me I I'm gonna drag this out
we could click over here we can add a
subdivision surface on the modifier so
add modifier subdivision surface I'm
gonna make mine just three for the view
and the render the view is this so the
view would be if we selected I right now
are on solid by default we go to
rendered it'll show us what everything
looks like when it's rendered by default
I'm pretty ugly right now but that's
expected so now I if we go back into
edit mode hitting tab now we have to do
a UV I we have to unwrap it so basically
when it comes to unwrapping there's a
lot of different there's a lot of
experimenting basically so let me just
show you what I mean if you left-click
and drag left will split these two
windows and by default it's whatever
this is over here so over here we can
change
the mode or what what's displaying over
here so we have all these options I if
we change this to the uv/image editor
change to this grid square looking
things so I want to go to image and new
image because it by default this is
based on 1024 by 1024 we want to make
our width 2 0 4 8 by 2 0 4 8 and that's
basically doubling it and go ahead and
hit OK and in case you use your scroll
wheel to zoom out to get everything in
view and we're gonna go ahead over here
hit a and then a again to select
everything oh I should have done that
initially when everything was selected
well that's no big deal always do is go
to image new image to 0 4 4 8 2 4 4 8
hit OK
all right real quick I had to pause I
had to mess with something you and if we
get you and reset and then go to you and
unwrap or you smart UV project will see
all the different ways that it basically
unwraps this UV over here and you'll see
that you know it would be difficult if
we took this into Photoshop and tried to
wrap like a label or a decoration around
it because they're all separated so
usually sometimes it's a matter of just
experimenting with how this unwraps
based on these different options I will
try a Q projection that's not going to
work
cylinder projection seems to be the one
that worked best for me but we still
have to make some adjustments here
because basically all these this square
portion in the center is almost
everything except for the top the very
top portion are these tiny little things
down here and also the bottom down here
so if we hit a to select all and we
scale this down right around here and
then we also hit s and then scale on the
x axis
S&amp;amp;X right around there we should get
something that's pretty accurate now we
have these things hanging off the side
over here so what we can do is hit a and
hit B and just select those top portions
and hit G and then let's move this to
the top come down here hit a B hit G to
move and we'll move these at the bottom
so now if we ate and then a we'll see we
have everything here basically ready to
go all right so it doesn't really poor
basically when we take this into
Photoshop we'll just fill in a flat
background color and that way these will
be the same color as whatever the
background is so this is where I inside
here is where the labels going to go
alright so what we want to do now is
export this uv8 layout so UV export UV
layout and I'm gonna choose I just a
folder here I'm going to create a new
one called project create new directory
and my hard drive is going to be a
little bit slow alright and I'm gonna
call this I what's call UV layout this
is gonna be a PNG we'll come down here
make sure you turn on all UVs and the
fill opacity basically means the opacity
of the UV layout we're just gonna put it
on one layer and to 0 for 8 of course by
Tuesday or 4 right so export that and
now we're going to step into photoshop
go to file we'll open it up alright I've
selected it here and obviously this is a
pretty big document to only have 50% if
you hold I alt and use your scroll wheel
we can zoom out a little bit so we can
get it on screen
and let's go ahead and select just like
a eggshell color when an egg isn't 100%
white usually has like a tenth of yellow
to it so I'm using f4 f4 EE for the
color code hit OK control-shift-n for a
new layer hit OK and we'll drag it down
here or just call this back around real
quick
and fill that in okay so now I these you
v's basically represent almost the
entire with exception up here and down
here the entire egg so we don't want in
the egg to have the label wrapped from
here down to here we want to start off
in the middle and give it some I guess
you could say white space down here and
up here so what I'm gonna do is take the
rectangle tool I'm gonna use like a blue
color you can use any color you want
obviously for this okay and I'm going to
start just roughly maybe right around
here we don't have to be like on the
actual edges or anything of those UVs we
just have to make sure we draw outside
the right and the left as you can see
it's just started just outside here that
way you don't have any clipping or
anything like that so I'll just make it
right around there and if you get a
stroke that shows up over here just hit
zero all right so now what I want to do
is just create some designs basically
you can do whatever you want there's no
right or wrong with this and I'm just
going to hold just take the pen tool hit
shift left click shift left click up
there and then I'm going to duplicate
that I you can right click duplicate
layer right there I've set up a hockey
ctrl shift and E and just move it over
holding shift a little bit take those
two layers holding shift hit ctrl e to
group them or merge them rather
duplicate those and keep doing the same
thing throughout all these so real
quickly just move this over
take both layers holding shift ctrl e
ctrl shift the D which I've set up for
duplicate layer move this over holding
shift and let's see how far we have to
go ctrl shift D
and we'll come our leave this one right
around there and if you take your direct
selection tool left-click and drag to
select it you can delete any unneeded
portions let me zoom them up here just
hit the delete keys by selecting those
all right and I'm going to move this
over a little bit and then zoom out and
basically this is going to wrap so this
portion is going to end up touching this
portion and there's going to be a little
bit of a gap here so what we can do is
just select all those I'm going to go
into ctrl e to merge them I'm going to
move this over here my arrow key and
then ctrl T and then shift and to move
that over there to the right all right
looks pretty good
alright so now what I want to do is
bring that that UV portion I want to
underneath that layer we'll just call
this blue stuff and then I underneath I
yeah we might as well merge those as
well too so ctrl E and then underneath
this blue stuff layer we'll go ahead and
create a new layer and I'm just going to
come out right around here holding alt
and left clicking and dragging no I'd
say right around there and I'm going to
double click on the foreground color and
make it pure white hit OK ctrl H to get
rid of the view oh and also mine is
adding a stroke so I'm just going to
change that to zero and I'm going to
take blue stuff control shift these to
duplicate it edit transform and then
flip vertical and we're going to move it
down and I want to see the bottom of
that white portion that we created yeah
that's right there holding shift and
left clicking and moving it down all
right so we could take those three
layers and kind of Center them up based
on how much space is on top of this
portion and beneath this trying to make
them even basically
all right so we cannot experiment you
know and that this rectangle is call
this white VG and you can have to leave
a hundred percent white if you want or
you can add some type of design inside
of it if you want so I could duplicate
this over here or duplicate double click
the right side of the layer we can bring
out the layer styles we have all these
options that we can apply to it you can
give it a gradient you can give it color
overlay you can give it a pattern
overlay and I happen to have some random
pattern over here that I thought worked
well and I'm just gonna scale this up
and this pattern by default I'd not
think comes with Photoshop so you
probably don't have it I I forget which
ones do come with Photoshop but don't
worry if you don't have this exact
pattern you can leave it white or you
can add a grading if we want ingredients
are cool yeah you can control how the
gradient appears you can have different
colors make this one white for example
make this one I don't know
blue you do a bunch of stuff so do
whatever you want to do I'm not going to
really it's not a big deal if you can't
I get this one over here so I'm going to
make a adjustment real quick color
overlay as well and make this like a
blue and then change the mode and then
come over here parently I'm just going
to mess with this a little bit
yeah I think screen works well all right
so now I I'm just gonna get the design
course DC logo letter mark out and so
I'm gonna open that up I'll include this
in a project files if you want to
include that so just ctrl a ctrl C to
copy it and then come up at the top
layer ctrl V to paste it in ctrl T shift
and alt alright put it right around
there hit apply and I'm going to give it
a color overlay to match that specific
color of blue ok and then ok and then
I'm gonna duplicate it and just to
create some variation I'm going to go
ahead and change this so that doesn't
have a color overlay I and change the
layer blend mode by using my down arrow
key to where it doesn't show up it
becomes invisible essentially and double
click on the effects and I'm gonna make
this a stroke but also get rid of color
overlay and over here deselect clip this
one right here and then just select that
one actually I may have to adjust this
oh the effects weren't showing up that's
why it's mu P
let me go back here and um to come down
right there okay go back to stroke and
then get this color and I think that
look that looks pretty good right there
then I'm going to take those two and
then just duplicate those and I want an
even amount of space between each one of
these and then I'll take each one ctrl T
apply right around there alright so that
is the actual design that we're going to
use alright so let me go ahead and save
this I'm gonna just go ahead and hit
ctrl shift alt nest just for safer web
we can make it a jpg quality you can
leave hi and save that as diffuse and
we'll come back to blender and we're
gonna change from blender render to
cycles render and so that's something
that is kind of important I exclusively
use cycles render started using it when
there was only cycles render and it just
seems I as everyone prefers that so what
I want to do now is we're gonna change
this here to what's called the node
editor and and to get that rid of that
part and I so if we go over here and
click on the material section we hit new
you'll see these two things showed up
and that basically represents or
reflects whatever is selected over here
so what we want to do is change this
diffuse to what's called a mixed shader
the mix allows you to add two different
shaders so I when it comes to the like
an easter egg you have two different
types of textures I guess you could call
them I if you're using like a plastic
wrap around on the egg that's usually
glossy and then up here and then beneath
that the egg itself is kind of like a
diffuse so what we'll do is make this
top one a diffuse right down there and
then this one right here will be glossy
alright so the way you move around here
of course everything still applies from
here shift in that right mount or middle
mouse button and if we want to see what
things look like we can switch back to
rendered and let's brighten the world up
here so do we take this color and make
it white now things are starting look
better I'm also going to switch over
here change the GPU compute it makes the
rendering a lot faster
and if you don't have this option you
just get a file and use your preferences
and you go to system and if you have a
GPU and I have two geforce cards you can
specify CUDA and then you have the
option over here for GPU compute alright
and then also another quick adjustment
I'm going to change samples ten is very
crappy or very low rather but it's very
fast so you see all these little grainy
areas higher this number for render and
preview preview is what we're doing
right now we're not actually rendering
so we have two different settings so the
render you can make that high like a
thousand preview maybe like a hundred so
you know once I change that you can see
got rid of all that graininess okay so
now what I want to do we have to attach
our actual image so if you hit shift a
over here texture and image texture you
get this little thing and what we could
do is left-click and drag this to the
color portion of the diffuse now it
shows up this pink color because there's
no image yet so if I open it select my
project diffuse we can now see we have
our egg except it looks washed out
that's because this mix shader' has
what's called an fac value and by
default it's at 0.5 so that means it's
displaying 50% diffuse which is only 250
percent of this or a label and then 50%
this glossy down here what we can do is
just take this hit shift d to duplicate
it move it down and attach this so now
it's showing up a lot better alright so
another thing i'm going to show you is
how to create basically what's called a
specular map now a specular map allows
you to control which portions of the UV
that's unwrapped and what we created
inside photoshop are shiny so this top
portion up here when it comes to an egg
it's not generally shiny i this wrapper
right here if you're using a plastic
wrap is shiny so the way you control
that you can go into Photoshop
and you can make sure you could save
this if you want to say this as like an
a a PSD file let's call its diffuse now
we have a backup then file save ass and
we'll call a spec specular map what we
can do now is the specular map is based
on black and white values so all we have
to do is create a rectangle left-click
drag note alt just the height and the
full portion of that label get rid of
that stroke again and I'm gonna make it
white so the white is going to be the
most shiny portion of the glassy portion
that gets shown and everything else hit
control shift and for a new layer just
beneath that layer we can make it black
and we can go ahead and delete all the
other layers we don't need them and
that's all we need so let's go ahead and
save that ctrl shift all and asks a
safer web or just go to file save for
web save that and we'll call this spec
all right now we'll go back to blender
and we're gonna hit shift a texture
image texture open and where is that a
spec dot jpg and now we attach it to the
FAC value of the mix shader' now you
can't tell it too much of a difference
although you can see it's not shiny
anymore but to really show you what this
looks like we'll go ahead and make a
quick adjustment so we're gonna add
what's called an emission plane so I'm
just going to move this over here to the
right temporarily switch over here to
solid and I'm gonna find where of our
cameras that just kind of click around
there for our origin point shift a plane
our X 45 that rotates it 45 you know
what I did something stupid I was still
in edit mode when I added that so
as a part of this that's why it looks
like a circle because of that
subdivision surface something hit delete
hit tab now shift a mesh in plain rx 45
all right and come around move it
s2 just to make it two times as large
and move it out and up here a little bit
come over to materials hit new and
select emission wherever that is there
we are
you mission let's make the strength 10
all right so now if we switch back to
rendered we can see more of this being
glossy but this top portion not all
right so what we want to do now is I
will drag this back out and you can
control how glossy this is right click
on the egg by changing the roughness of
this glossy portion so you could see if
we make it all the way to zero it shows
like basically a view of that plane I'm
just going to make mine slightly you
know around 0.1 I think will work okay
just like that alright so we're done
with this portion I'm going to right
click and join area and make sure this
joins over there and I want to add a
plane now so I'm gonna switch back to
solid click around here for the plane
shift a mesh plane s and 50s we're gonna
make it real large like right click the
egg actually we're stay with the I the
plane just move it down and if you get
real close here we can see we don't want
it to be beneath that actual egg
there alright so now it's sitting right
on there and if we go back to render
we'll see now we have some nice
realistic shadows coming off there and
if we want to rotate this so right-click
on it now when you're rendered mode it
doesn't really show you what you clicked
on but we know we clicked on it because
it shows us you know our materials over
here are is D and then now we can just
rotate this on the z-axis and I'm going
to right click on the plane give it an
aterial make it white by default its
diffuse dress right there
sorry I had to pause for a second so now
what I want to do is go ahead and
duplicate these so let's switch back to
solid right click on the egg and hit
shift D and hit X for it to be moved and
we can move around and make it right
there and then I'm gonna also hit R and
we're gonna hit Y move it on its side
then R and Z move it over here maybe
alright we don't want them to collide
into each other I move it out now if we
go back to rendered we'll see that we
have an egg over there and we'll do one
more actually you're not kind of want
that to be a little bit closer so let me
zoom this out we get more in view okay
and then finally we'll do another one
shift D and then X and R and Z will see
maybe the butt end of it and I want to
push this back as well and move it over
here
alright let's see what that looks like
gonna rendered hi these need to push
down so all I have to do is just go back
to solid shift and right click both of
them and we can move them down right
around there it rendered now I'm going
to right click just that one hit our Z
right around there is good yeah I think
that's is good right there
and I I do want to be able to see more
at the top because this kind of just
blends into the back so if you
right-click on the plane and maybe come
back down to where it was before that
way we'll be able to see more of the
white outline and if we go up like this
we can get rid of the part where you can
see the outside of this plane I what I
want to do real quickly we can set this
up in a camera view so if we hit zero on
the number pad that'll show us wherever
the camera currently is if I hit the
letter n as a nose on the keyboard we
could bring up the properties and turn
on lock camera to view hit and again and
we could set up our camera based on
whatever the final scene is that we want
to see so I think maybe right around
here is OK and we'll go here to the
rendered tab I'm gonna make the
resolution 1280 just by 720 that's the
size of my videos that I record make
this 100% so it actually goes 100
percent of that and yeah we have
rendered on thousand now I'm gonna go
ahead and just render this thing so you
come up here and click on render well
you know who wait one second performance
I want to change the tiles from 64 to
256 by 256 and you could do that if you
do have GPU processing so now I will hit
rendered and now it's gonna take a while
so I'm gonna go ahead and pause this
until it's done alright and that is it
so I I'm going to go ahead if you want
to save this yeah f3 and I'm just going
to call this final render and save image
come down here you can specify I are
your values and that
is it alright pretty cool if this is
your first blender tutorial hopefully
you didn't find it too difficult I I've
always found a helpful when instructors
will actually do a full tutorial that
includes you know the rendering and the
lighting and the actual you know
providing an actual world world project
instead of just covering specific
features anyhow yeah I so yeah I'm doing
a video store every day of 2014 and so
today is April 20th and I don't know how
many days there's been yeah it's
probably like a hundred fifteen or
something like that so yeah subscribe to
the channel check out more videos and
check out design course comm as well
alright happy Easter and I'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
