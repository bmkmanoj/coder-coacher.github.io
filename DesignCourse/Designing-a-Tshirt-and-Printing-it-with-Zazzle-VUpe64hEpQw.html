calm today I'm going to be designing a
t-shirt and it's going to be basically
what I where I whenever arrives like in
a week or whatever for the beginning of
each of these videos so up until today
or in a week from now I've always
where'd this jacket but now that it's
springtime it's warming up I kind of
want to get into a t-shirt instead so
I'm going to take a different approach
to this circle a it's going to actually
it kind of makes more sense to switch to
the design course letter mark so that's
one gonna be doing today in Adobe
Illustrator and I'm also going to use a
site for printing t-shirts and other
stuff at zazzle com and so we'll go
ahead and play around with that as well
alright so there's no project files
really oh wait yeah yeah there is
because if you want to follow along i'm
not sure why you would want to use this
logo to print your own design course
sure you probably don't you don't care
but i will make that available the
design course letter mark logo so you
can get that at design course calm and
yeah check out design course calm if you
haven't yet and subscribe here at
YouTube alright get started alright so i
have adobe illustrator open up here
along with the design course calm letter
mark logo and basically instead of just
using the logo itself putting it on the
shirt you know i decided to take maybe
just a step further and just to do
something interesting with it so i'm
going to include this as the project
files they can download design course
calm if you want to follow along so i'm
going to go ahead to file new and i
already have it set here my width and
height 17.9 inches by 19 inches so make
sure your units is set to inches and you
just specify that information that's
kind of a standard t-shirt size for some
of the print or t-shirt printing places
so I also make sure CMYK here
we'll hit okay and what I'm going to do
is come over here copy that control C
close that out and then we'll paste it
in alright so I want to make the
background black so I'm just going to
take the rectangle tool and we're not
going to include the black background
obviously when we save this but just to
give us an idea of what it might look
like on the shirt so I'm just going to
drag that down there and make it black
and then also lock the layer so we can't
select it anymore and select a move tool
take this and we'll make this white so
to keep things simple I'm just going to
make everything on this shirt white so
it'll be a black shirt and everything
else going to be white alright so what I
want to do is kind of scale this up to
hold you shift and I'm just going to
come down just for now and leave it
right here in your lip near the middle
and I kind of want to make it look as
though there's like a selection around
it kind of just like this or in
Photoshop or whatever you kind of have
like the marching ants I guess you call
them so what we could do is take the
rectangle tool and try to create a
square around it if you hold shift and
won't work because the logo itself isn't
a square proportionally so we'll just
drag and try to eyeball it right around
there will drag it beneath that logo
layer in here and the swatches will hit
none and then I'm going to click on
gradient and then we'll select this
stroke over here and make that white all
right so let's take this stroke weight
up quite a bit so right around there are
14 points and then click on stroke and
click on dashed line and I have the dash
already set as 60 points the gap 60
points so that kind of defines the width
of the actual dash and then the gap
between them alright very simple and
then another thing I want to do is kind
of create a cursor I icon so
I'm just going to take the pen tool and
first I want to click on this just so we
have that the solid foreground no stroke
there and then I'm going to just click
anywhere around here and then click yeah
straight down just hold shift and left
click and then up right around here and
connect them all right and then I want
to take the rectangle tool and just drag
down roughly around there and I'm going
to rotate that with the move tool and
try to get it situated so it looks
pretty correct in terms of this with and
that all right and then I'm going to
take both of those left click hold shift
both of those go to window Pathfinder
and then select this to merge and unite
those shapes into one single shape
alright so then what we can do is get
this into position I don't want it to be
that large may be right around there and
then one final thing I'm going to take
the rectangle tool and right around here
left click and drag and I want to move
this down with my arrow key to the down
arrow key on my keyboard so that there's
no line in between those take that ctrl
c ctrl f to duplicate it hold shift and
rotate it to 90 degrees vertically move
this into place doing the same thing
using my left arrow key
and yeah right around there and then
also come up here take this one and move
that into place now let me zoom out here
this one needs to come in one more
actually one more space
alright and so that is it so it kind of
makes it look like we're pulling this
off a section or something of the canvas
or something and that would be basically
the T search the app t-shirt design so
once you have this all done you know if
you ever have outlines or strokes or if
you have text or anything like that
before you go to import it I or upload
it to or give it to anybody who's going
to be printing whether it be you know a
magazine or poster or t-shirt you have
to make sure everything is converted to
outlines so what that means is if we
select this you know we still have the
option of editing the stroke so that's
not converted to an outline so what you
would do is take that what I like to do
is to select everything just to be safe
and go to edit now get an object path
and outline stroke and it's also good to
take everything as well object expand
now we make sure everything is now an
outline so you can't really edit the
stroke anymore because it's been
converted to outlines all right okay so
now what we want to do is take this and
just scale it up a little bit
just position it so we're getting as
much space as possible that we can use
from this area and I don't know I think
I'm still might want to drag that down
make it a little bit smaller we don't
want it to be you want to be like
overshadowing or the size of the actual
logo because that's the most important
point right around there is good all
right and then finally the we'll go back
to the layers and hide the background
because we don't want the black the
black there but we still have all the
white all right so now you want to do is
just save that so just hit ctrl s to
save and we'll call this t-shirt front
and I haven't used my hard drive in a
while so it always likes for a little
bit there it goes save that hit okay and
if you wanted to do it back you could do
a back as well I'm not going to really
bother with it I so now what we want to
do is you know this is depends on who
everyone you want to use for your
t-shirt printing service so I if I come
out over here is zazzle com I I've used
them before now they can be really
pricey if you're only printing one shirt
or you know a small quantity of shirts
in the past I've I've ordered shirts
from a local place they printed it up
and I think I did like three hundred or
so and it was first for a black t-shirt
with one color is like four dollars or
something but this is going to end up
being like 30 plus doll or so I
basically always to do is go to create
on this website men's apparel I'm going
to choose as you can see it has all the
prices a basic white t-shirt 1895 and
obviously you know you can add your own
designs on it a black t-shirt it's like
almost ten dollars more practically so
I'm just going to choose this one right
here and close out of that
make the t-shirt black all right and
then go ahead to add image upload new
image and click OK to upload and it
should place it on to the t-shirt and
what's kind of cool about their system
is they automatically kind of warp the
image to make it look as though it's you
know literally a part of this guy's
t-shirt that was a picture was taken out
of them so kind of cool I so as you can
see you know this size we've maximized
you know what we were able to do
although a party could learn a bit more
in height but that's no problem so yeah
basically what we do at this point you
know to give you a bunch of different
options I is just go ahead and add to
cart and that would be it this maybe I'm
not sure if this is going to be the
shirt that I actually order i may add
the design course calm down there but
anyhow yeah you get the point so if you
ever need to order or get a t-shirt
printed real quickly well just use Adobe
Illustrator or any other I vector
graphics application and you can go to a
site like zazzlecom you'll you'll spend
a bit you know plus the shipping is
going to be a little bit pricey but I
yeah I very simple to do just got to
make sure you have your file uploaded
correctly and yeah you could also use
Photoshop just to let you know I know
when it comes to photoshop and print you
generally want to stay away from print
but I mean you still can do it you just
have to make sure for example if we go
into Photoshop and you go to file new
and what was that sighs I think it was I
you know what I don't even know what I
can't remember what the size was I'm
just going to say 13 inches 17.9 it was
something like that you just got to make
sure your resolution is high like this
is 72 is for a website or for web
display
you want this to be at least 300 and
color mode CMYK hit OK and there you go
pretty much everything still applies and
you'll be able to do that in Photoshop
so just a pointer alright so I probably
when I order this up it'll be ready
maybe it might be here in a week or so
and then I'll start wearing that instead
of the jacket as it's getting hotter
outside alright so i will see you
tomorrow with a new tutorial if you
haven't yet check out design course calm
