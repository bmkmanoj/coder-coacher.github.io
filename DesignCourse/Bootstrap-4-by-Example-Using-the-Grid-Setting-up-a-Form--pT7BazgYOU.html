framework the grid is usually the most
used element so in this section we're
going to discover how to use the grid by
working on a specific section within the
course project so understanding the
bootstrap for grid it's all easy
once you get the basic concepts all
right so let's first take a look at the
course projects mock-up in the specific
area the layout that we're going to be
working on next in structure with the
bootstrap grid so right here is going to
be the section that's just underneath
the hero as we can see right here which
is where we're currently at in the
project and as we could see I in the
teal container we have three different
blips that describe features about this
fictional game so our task is to use the
grid to present this in a browser so
bootstraps grid is based on a default
twelve columns so let's go take a look
at what this would look like I with
these twelve columns enabled over this
layout all right so basically first we
have an icon now this element right here
here and here it's small enough to
occupy a single column at least on a
large desktop view and so then we have
an Associated description that goes on
basically to the right of each column
and so we can see we have one column
here and then three here in this block
so we have 12 total columns to work with
which is how I bootstrap in most other
responsive front of frameworks are used
and we need to try to make our columns
all equal up to 12 so we have three we
have four total columns that make up
each one so three times four you know go
back to elementary school that is 12 so
that's what we want all right so let's
go back with this in mind to our code
editor oh but real quick before we begin
make sure you check out my site course
cetera com where you're going to find a
bunch of courses on modern design and
development a lot are free and others
you can access for the cost
I mean like expect each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on all right let's get back to it and
enter index.html we're going to come
outside of the very last div so all this
stuff is contained within our hero div
now we're going to come outside of it
just above be three script tags here
alright so let's start off with a div
class and then hit control B by the way
here in Visual Studio code get rid of
that sidebar I an equals and we're going
to create a custom class that we're
going to reference here called feature
wrapper and we're going to give it
another class of BG primary and this is
specific to bootstrap and it's just
basically saying the background of this
element should be our primary color that
we defined alright so then we're going
to have a padding of tops of PT of 5
padding of bottom so PB - 5 and then a
margin top of 5 and then also a margin
top just on large screen sizes of 0 all
right then inside of there we're going
to do a div class of container this
gives us our fixed center container and
then give class of row so when you're
doing and you're working with the grid
you always need to first establish a row
class and then inside of it this is
where your individual columns go based
on the 12 grade column system ok so the
next thing that we want to do is first
define the section over here so for
bring this back up you'll see we have
one column right here so let's define
that so the way we do that is do class
equals call - 1 and then inside of there
that's where our icons go and so we're
using font awesome so we're going to put
I class equals FA for font awesome FA -
game pad that's the name of the specific
icon we want to
and then we're going to make it large
larger than default so FA - 2 X okay
let's also add another div class for the
next section which is the description so
this is going to be difficult call - 3
and then inside of here we're going to
put in I'm just going to paste this
off-screen copy it off-screen rather and
paste it in here alright so let's save
this and make sure you have the gulp
command running in your console so we
can look at it in the browser alright so
here we are now the issue here is this
text is white so let's go ahead and fix
that real quickly if we're looking at
this a little bit further control B
we'll go back to our style that sass
file and simply going to reference our
feature wrapper and we're going to put
color zero zero zero zero four black all
right now let's go back real quickly to
our browser okay so this right here
looks exactly as we want it almost so we
haven't centered this yet
let me just we'll go back real quick you
don't have to do this by the way we're
going to I'm just going to copy this and
paste it three times and then save we're
going to go back ok so this looks pretty
close to what we want over here right
yeah so what happens though when we drag
this in all right this is still all good
nothing seems too cluttered all right so
now we switch to over here to the small
version and look how cluttered it starts
to get this here looks bad all right so
that means we need to make some
responsive adjustments so that each one
of these columns here will maintain its
own column and they're going to become
stacked on top of each other so we have
to make some adjustments in order for
that to work properly so I'm going to
back up just to about there and we're
going to make some changes here to these
class names okay
so what we're going to change now is
instead of just call one we're going to
put in call - a screen size of small and
then twelve so what that means when you
change this it's going to mean
automatically I let me go ahead and save
this and just go back here and see what
changes we can now see that this is
occupying its own column it's not left
aligned to this all right so we also
want to change it and/or add rather call
- medium which is the next size up right
here - wine so that'll go back to one on
medium in large sizes and so I'm also
going to add text center which is going
to Center that icon and I'm also going
to add margin bottom - 3 and then margin
bottom on medium will be zero so let's
go ahead and save this real quick I'm
also going to make adjustments to this
again call on small will be twelve and
then call on medium and up will be three
we're going to text center this and this
text will be centered by default
actually if I save this real quickly let
me just show you and you don't have to
copy this I want to show you kind of
just before and after when I add these
classes what they H do all right
so right here this looks actually pretty
good now let's come back out and see
what happens
all right so notice how it's still
centered right here we don't really want
that I think it looks better left not
basically all to the left and left line
so what we'll do is after text Center on
these elements we're going to put text -
also uppercase just to make it all
uppercase and also text - MD for medium
and up left so now let me add a couple
more just for margin and I on the bottom
right here we're going to push them away
from each other a little bit more so
margin bottom three
then merge and bottom on medium will be
zero okay so now let's save and I'll get
rid of these two
copy and paste this save it there we go
so now we have this looking good and
there we go much better so I'm going to
pause right here real quickly just to
customize these and then I'll show you
the code and then you can pause as well
if you wish okay so all I did was
changed as the class of F a site map
right here from gamepad to site map to
also line chart FA a line type and chart
and then also these custom descriptions
so if I save and go back there we go
awesome okay so now hopefully you
understand at least a basic sense of how
the grid system works and how you can
use the sizing to create custom
adjustments based on the amount of
columns they take up all right so in the
next section we're going to go ahead and
finish this off by doing a form that
will be situated beneath this area right
here all right all right so we're going
to go ahead and finish our layout right
here by adding a third section so we
have our hero section up here with a
navigation we have this feature
container down here and then in the
bottom I will have an email capture
section with a simple form and a
call-to-action button with the text
field alright so let's go ahead and
focus on that so I right here we have
our feature wrappered and this is our
teal color down there so we don't want
anything inside of there it's going to
be outside of it completely so let's go
ahead and put in a new div of id join
container we're going to give it a class
and we're going to some margin or
padding rather to push things away from
that teal container so part padding top
of Lara type in six which is a custom
sizing class we already added padding
bottom will be large
- yep six is what
and then padding-top will be five all
right so then inside of there we'll put
in a div class of container and every
all the text inside of this container is
going to be centered so text center and
then inside of here we're going to have
a heading and a subheading of as well so
we're going to put h2 class equals text
type in uppercase and give us your email
okay then the hen eye we're going to do
an h4 class of text uppercase as well
and we'll give you awesome stuff like
beta invites and discounts get rid of
that semicolon there and then I h4 all
right so let's save this just to see
what it looks like right now in the
browser okay
so we'll make some adjustments doesn't
look like the greatest thing you've ever
seen
so underneath that we're going to have a
form so we're just going to put a basic
form tag in here inside of here we're
going to have a div class a form - group
and this is specific to bootstrap form
so if you check out the bootstrap for
documentation you'll see you know how
you basically set it up and the way you
do that is to attach a form group and
read put row and then we're going to
give ourselves some padding here padding
top of large 5 padding bottom of large 5
and then padding top 5 all right inside
of here we're going to have a column so
div class equals call - small 12 so we
want these to stack on top of each other
this is going to be the container for
the text field where you enter the email
and then also call medium 5 so on medium
sizes and up for screen sizes this will
occupy 5 columns so it's going to be
left aligned to a submit button and then
offset - MD on medium and up to
so the offset class is something we
haven't used before but we're using it
now and what this does is it pushes over
the I our column here by two columns all
right so we'll see how this works I'll
show you before and after real quickly
just once we get that text field in here
so we're going to put in an input type
of email class is form control and again
this is specific to bootstrap four and
then margin body bottom we're just going
to give it four ID you can put whatever
you want
I'm example input and then we're also if
you want to remain consistent and
applying your area right here Arai ever
area I'm not really sure how you
pronounce that and then also a
placeholder it equals e let's see enter
email all right so let's say this for
now see what it looks like okay so I
notice how this is where the first
column begins there's probably another
column right here so it pushed it over
to the left or to the right rather by
two columns and that's what that offset
does now of course if we bring this back
to a small screen size
we'll see it occupies the whole 12
because we added a call small of 12 to
it all right so let's I keep on going so
next I'm just going to copy this part
and I'm going to paste it alright so for
this we're not going to offset anything
this is where a button is going to go so
delete that we're going to put in button
type equals submit class equals BTN
again this all the stuff is specific to
buttons for bootstrap for so BTN primary
BTN block text
upper case to make it uppercase and nbg
primary for the background color so it's
going to be that teal color that we have
defined all right so let's save this now
alright so as you can see it's a little
bit too large
right here this all looks good and by
the way we're going to style this so
it's not all white too much contrast in
my opinion and the reason this is too
large is because I I didn't put this
correctly I didn't change this from 5 to
3 so let's save that there we go much
better okay so let's make some
adjustments here to the this area we're
also going to give it a custom
background which is what the third image
is for in our assets folder so let's go
ahead real quickly we'll go to styles
sass which is right here and we'll start
off by referencing our join container
alright so the background is going to be
URL assets screen one jpg no-repeat
background size is cover and then we're
going to well let's go ahead and save
just so we can see where we're at
currently there we go it's got like a
screenshot over like a first-person
shooter or something back there kind of
two unrelated images that's no big deal
though and then also it's reference our
h2 which is embedded inside or nested
inside so we have a letter spacing we're
going to make it like four pixels and
then font-weight:bold that and then you
see what that does to this section right
here
let's also reference the h4 this is
going to be color simply gray and that
will help create distinction here
between these two elements alright so
the primary I think that we want drawn
to in terms of visual hierarchy is this
section right here
and then form control this is going to
allow us to style that text field so
background we're going to make it not
black but kind of close so we just want
six ones and then also we're going to
give it a border of three pixels solid
and f2 or no - f - f - f let's save this
so far and just see what happens all
right that's better and then also we're
going to give it some padding to just
enlarge it a little bit of ten pixels so
there we go and then also finally a very
last rule set to define is our button
we're going to make it a padding of 12
pixels beefing it up a little bit border
of none and a color of black for the
text and then there we go guys oh we
also may want to make that
cursor:pointer all right awesome and so
that my friends is it for this 100% free
course of course and I see yeah let's go
ahead and check it out what it looks
like on the various screen sizes so
we're getting down to tablet size this
is a smaller tablet size kind of cool
how the background like that adjusts
based on our background cover and then
also smartphone size awesome okay so I
hope you guys learned a lot B shirt if
you're watching this for example for
