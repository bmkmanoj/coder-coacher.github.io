design course calm and also a course
instructor at envato Networks toots plus
calm so in this free tutorial we're
going to go ahead and take a look at
designing a logo design in adobe
illustrator CC and this actually just
released two days ago and there are some
improvements but largely there's not a
huge difference especially when it
concerns logo design between previous
versions so if you have a previous
version don't worry about how to be able
to follow along just fine so the first
thing we're going to do is go to file
new and we'll just name this logo
project and I'm going to set my width
and height that 750 by 500 points and we
can leave all the rest of the same so
it's hit OK and that popped up in a new
window one second all right so if you
hit control one we can get back to a
hundred percent okay so I our fictional
company I for our logo is going to be
called in blood and this is just going
to be for a TV series okay um
it doesn't exist it's just completely
fictional I and I came up with just out
of nowhere
oh no why but this is it so the first
thing we'll do with the type tool is
type in blood now ordinarily when it
comes to designing logos I you would
first sit down and you would sketch out
ideas that pertain to potential logo
design concepts now I already came up
with one that I thought would work well
and so that would be I taking this in
and actually putting it in blood I so
let me just show you what I mean
I'm going to take the ellipse tool right
here and just with this red color right
here in the swatches panel I'm going to
make that our foreground and I'm going
to hold shift and just create a sphere
all right so if we go here to our layers
panel and drop this down we can position
this layer beneath the in type so now if
we move this over here
we'll see it is in this circle so to
make it actually look like blood we're
not going it's not going to be a perfect
sphere but before I do that let's go
ahead and make the type white and I'm
going to use a free font which I will
link in the description of this video
I called station station medium and it's
just kind of like a bubbly font I so now
what I want to do is go ahead and make
this more of a kind of like a envelope
seal type of blood spatter I so what
we'll do is we will zoom up and then we
will take the pen tool and if you've
never used the pen tool don't worry it
just takes a little bit of time getting
used to but I'm just going to click up
around here and you don't have to follow
me exactly it's not an exact science you
can do however you want this to appear
so we'll just left-click and drag oops
sorry
left-click and drag and then left-click
and drag around here again and what we
want to do is just kind of stay around
this general circle so we'll do this a
few more times and we want it to end up
real nice
right around there we want it to flow
well okay
so now what we can do is we can delete
this circle back here and then we can
position once again I the shape that we
just created
beneath the in
all right so let's go ahead and just
position both of these over here I and
then what we'll do is control C and then
control F so we can copy it and let's
first go ahead and make this that red
color right here and then we'll type
blood which is our full name so real
quickly I just want to go over this and
see if this area right here is just a
little bit too turbulent if we compare
it to the rest of the shape so we can
always just come in here with this tool
the direct selection tool and adjust any
of these points to smooth it out or make
any adjustments that we think are
necessary so let's see here and again I
you can you can do yours however you
wish it's not an exact science right now
okay okay so now what we want to do is
this in right here we don't want this to
actually exist we want this right here
to be a single shape so what I mean by
that is this what we'll do is take our
type or now right now we can edit it and
you know make it anything we want but
now that we know it's obviously going to
be in we want to convert this to an
outline or to a path so let's go to
object path one second first we go to
control shift in oh and then that
creates the outlines and then we go to
object path now this won't work if we
try to hit divide objects below it will
give us this error so the reason that is
is because it's currently any group
because we have two letters here so all
we have to do is right-click and go to
ungroup so now we can select the letters
individually go to object path divide
objects below now that changes the color
here which we can just go ahead and
change
back now we have the in that or the I
rather that we need to do the same thing
with now because there's a dot here we
have two different shapes and this is
called a compound so what we can do is
right-click release compound path so now
we could select just that portion of the
eye and go to object path divide objects
below and then finally we have the
circle and the eye up here and we'll do
the same thing okay so now that we've
done that we can go ahead and select the
up to N and then just hit the Delete key
now we are in the background right here
so let's do the same thing for the eye
and also the top of the eye so now this
is one shape there's only eye
oh yeah we can delete these two paths
beneath all right so now it is just a
single shape and you can see only we
have the group here selected but really
this doesn't need to be group we can
ungroup and I we have our path right
here okay so when you're designing logo
you have to make sure absolutely have to
make sure that your logo works well in
black and white and obviously all have
to do is I change the color to black and
another thing you have to make sure
about your logo is that it scales well
so what that means is I really quick I'm
just going to convert this to a path
control shift and OH so if we go ahead
and scale this down a lot we want it to
be identifiable we want it to be
readable still and it is and that's very
good so simple is always better in terms
of logo design when it comes to
readability so let's go ahead and scale
that back up so we know our logo works
well in black and white which is great I
and if you were designing for a client
or just yourself or for a personal
project you would go ahead and export
this very basic version of our logo in
multiple formats for
we would save it obviously as in Adobe
Illustrator file AI which is 100% vector
we could save it as an EPS and then we
can also export it in a number of
different formats down here like a PSD
or jpg etc etc I and then we also denote
those as the file names with you know -
block this is the most simple version I
then we would create a second variation
where it's containing our actual colors
so if we wanted our official color to be
the CMYK red right here we would also go
ahead and export those and save those as
our our files and denote that as like
for example - red and then I it's
typical that we see I in areas that a
logo where it's displayed I there are no
restrictions like for example on the
website uh or in print if there's no
restrictions in terms of colors I you
you'll see a lot of big brands I their
logo will be very diverse with a lot of
colors and gradients etc so that's
completely acceptable if we wanted to
create a more elaborate version of our
in blood so let's go ahead and do that
and what I'll do is just scale that up a
little bit and so to give this some
depth I what we'll do is add some
shadows I inside this blood here to make
it look like it's 3d a little bit so
let's go ahead with our pen tool and I'm
going to select a darker red just right
around here and we'll go ahead and click
down here and we're just going to follow
the bottom of this and I just hit
control Z just to undo if you place a
point that's not accurate so let's just
go ahead and follow this loops follow
down
okay and then we can add a hilight up
here so if we take this color right here
we'll double click it and then just
choose a lighter hue up there we can go
ahead with the pen tool and do the same
thing except on the top now and actually
I may want to just end it right there
because that I will clash with it a
little bit so we'll start right back up
here okay so now if I go to control one
in zoom a2 or zoom back 200% we'll see
that it actually has a little bit of I
guess you could call a depth to it so we
could take this a little bit further um
let's see here we could go ahead around
each one of these for example right here
now the way we have the the the light
coming from is pretty much from this
upper left angle so we zoom up a little
bit more we can go ahead and oops and
add this
and just right back up and then continue
it right here
okay
and once more up here
and we do want to make sure these are
all even in terms of their positioning
around the actual letters and then we
could take our shadow color down here
and then with the pen tool you can add
one underneath then we can take this
control C then control F and hold the
shift and move it over
and then finally one more right here
okay so that's I one way that we can go
ahead and actually I will just to make
this consistent I will add the shadow
and highlight portions around the circle
here
and take our highlight or shadow rather
and add it around here okay all right so
if i zoom this up so we can get a better
look at this we can see that it
definitely looks pretty cool so what we
could do now I say for example if we
wanted to present this to a client or
something I of course we would always
show it on a white background but we
could even do a little bit more with
this and let's say for example we wanted
to go to deviantART calm and we wanted
to get like kind of like a blood
background so this is a great site and
on which you can use and you can find
free stock and resource files so if we
go down here to resources and stock
images and take something like blood
background we can see that we have some
live different options to choose from so
if we choose this one paint blood
spatter texture we could see that the
author is given a description and it
also lets you know how you can use this
so you can use this image in your
digital art etc there's no need to note
me just leave a comment here or on the
stock page that you used so if you
wanted to download this then we could
just go ahead and click download image
and let me scale that down because it
made this massive pop-up now I'm just
going to right click and hit copy image
and I will go back to illustrator and
I'm going to select everything and just
hit group real quick so that puts
everything in a group layer and then I'm
going to hit ctrl V to paste so this
image is massive so I have to scale it
down a lot so I'm going to hit shift in
alt together while scaling it down okay
and then I'm just going to stretch it
just to fill up the canvas and then put
it in the back and just change the
opacity down to like 40 percent or so
and that way we can present the logo
kind of in a different medium so if I
were to present this logo you would also
for example I we could save this as one
variation or we could just take this let
me lock the layer real quick and hit
well first I'm going to scale it down by
holding shift and then hit control C and
then ctrl F so we want we would
definitely want to show the black and
white version I so and also just the a
single color version with our actual red
color and then this version right here
so I'll make this on our big version and
this one will just be all black this one
will be our red color and actually I'd
position those at the bottom here
and that is our logo so I hope you
learned a little bit and enjoyed the
tutorial all right I if you have any
questions just go ahead and post in a
comment area and I will attempt to
answer them all right thanks a lot talk
to you later good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
