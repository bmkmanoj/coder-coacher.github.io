design course calm welcome to design
challenge number 23 the review and this
week we had some good entries we had
some bad entries I some were really good
and some were really bad I think the key
takeaway from this week's challenge is
try not to go with the most obvious
concept try to think outside of the box
okay so if you haven't yet subscribed
here check out design course calm and
let's get to the review alright so let's
get started here it's go to the first
entry and this is from I'm not even
gonna try to pronounce that I ok so when
I saw this first initially I thought
okay this is probably what most people
went with the idea of a sailor like a
steering wheel on a boat the hell is
that even called in an earth I so this
works very well as a symbol because it's
uniform it's circular and done a pretty
good job here I outlining you know the
various details but not too much detail
because if you ever look at like a real
picture of the earth there's tons of
tiny little man landmasses these tiny
ones right here the Caribbean islands I
believe those might get lost at a
smaller size if this would be scaled
down by like maybe ninety percent but
other than that it works well it's good
that you use just one color here you
don't have a lot of crazy effects that a
lot of people do simple shapes and
performs God the only possible downside
would be that it may be almost too
obvious I not to say that this isn't
good I but one thing you know if you
were to be developing this for a real
client for instance you definitely want
to do multiple concepts and try to see
if you can come up with something that
might be even it'll be a little bit more
unique so thanks for that submission all
right down here where you have Dhara
okay so I looking at this I I really
wasn't sure what's happening here on the
Left I think I could see like kind of
like an anchor right here um and this
supposed to symbolize an earth but I
just don't see the earth aside from
maybe just the ellipse here the general
shape over here it's a good idea but the
one thing that I kind of immediately
recognized in this logo was the Marines
logo now of course you know it is still
quite a bit different yours is
simplified and this one has a lot of
stuff going on but you still see the
anchor going through which is the
general I'd same kind of general idea in
terms of everything else though
execution-wise simplicity definitely did
good I you know again this is just one
of these things it probably wasn't
intentional but people you know like
myself when I first saw I kind of
immediately thought of Marines logo
which is a negative of course when it
comes to such a well-known symbol but
yeah other than that I really like this
one a lot so thanks for that all right
so Mario here we have an e monogram
combined with a sale this is definitely
really unique and i would say really
good execution for sure I think maybe
the green here might be the only hint
I've and also the e itself to the idea
of Earth but we could definitely see the
sales here and it's definitely very
stylish I and well-executed so very good
thanks for that alright so here's
another one I from lauric so there's a
couple problems with this nice so first
we have three different symbol of pieces
of symbolism occurring here you have the
anchor you have the wheel and you have
the earth ideally you just want to stick
to two of them so either get rid of the
anchor or get rid of these right here
because you won't really want it to be
simplistic second issue would be you
kind of just slapped or overlap this
anchor on here just with a 1 pixel I
border and that's not ideal because if
you were to scale this down that one
pixel becomes blurry and you know and
just doesn't look good I so you would
either definitely if you're going to
stick with the anchor increase the
weight of the stroke or the border that
you have here
and third even if you had that fixed if
you did make it thicker you didn't have
that issue I would still say it may just
look slapped on kinda I not really much
thought has gone into you know trying to
combine these two symbols in order to
make it almost its own unique symbol in
and of itself so those are just a few
gripes other than that you stuck with I
the most part simplicity in terms of not
using all these effects I but yeah
thanks for that and rat 0 or raid 0 ok
so again we have three different forms
of symbolism we have the earth we have
the wheel portion handles and we have
the e so again I would stick with just
two of the three in order for this to be
most effective because it does feel like
okay here's the symbol and then we have
a over here I you know where's the word
which is supposed to say earth over here
or what just kind of feels a little bit
disconnected as a symbol or as a single
symbol so that's my only gripe I
everybody's been doing a pretty good job
including yourself in terms of keeping
things simple especially with color in
not using all these crazy effects so you
definitely doing that correctly so
thanks for that ok again we have one of
these I pretty obvious it doesn't look
bad I but an obvious sort of concept
here this one this is what I was talking
about earlier when it comes to all the
detail you know of course at this
resolution it's fine have this detail I
but when you scale that down these tiny
little land masses are going to become
blurry so this area right here will be a
little bit blurry this over here will be
a little bit blurry I've heard the idea
of responsive logos you know when it
comes responsive web design how your
your layout and your user interface
adapts I there are the ideas of having
responsive logo so you can simplify the
forms at smaller sizes but ideally you
don't want to have to go that route so I
would just get rid of some of the real
tiny details here with the this the
shape
other than that I like it um I there's
maybe a tad bit of a concern these are
far away enough I don't think it would
be too much of a problem if you scale
this down you definitely don't want it
to get blurry along these edges but it
may be far enough are scaled away I
would maybe even remove these right here
these inner ones other than that good
submission thanks for that ok so Marilyn
we have a lot of issues with this one
unfortunately the colors clash with each
other so there's not allowed to contrast
between this hue of green and this hue
of blue there's also inconsistency
because you have a one pixels black
stroke on this over here but then
there's no stroke on the linnean masses
so it creates for an issue of
inconsistency you have this gray down
here which doesn't really seem to have
much of a purpose and then you have this
looks like kind of like a Miss shapen s
it's kind of not smooth along the edges
I understand this is probably a sale and
but there's just a lot of issues here
that need to be tackled in order for
this concept to be truly effective I
would say so keep trying and keep
following the advice I'm giving
throughout the rest of these videos here
and you'll eventually get it just take
the practice thanks for the submission
Bobby Mike all right I this is another
one sorry my daughter just came barging
in I so this is there's a lot of issues
because I looked at this and I really
wasn't sure where the element of the
Sailor or sailing and ships or whatever
comes into play because these I these
right here the bars are supposed to act
like waves I still don't see it it's
just too difficult to understand what's
happening add to that you know the land
masses they're not really anything you
can recognize if you look at a globe for
instance they kind of just seemed random
I so it may be even it's a little bit
hard to even know what this shape is in
and of itself so trying to stick with
more relevance I you definitely have
simplicity down and you're not using a
lot of crazy effects so you have that
going but trying to make it a little bit
obvious is as to what's going on what's
happening here would be ideal it's fine
to be abstract but not to the point at
which most people would be scratching
their heads alright thanks for that all
right George X we have this one here
first time doing something like that
okay so looking at this I see no earth I
just looking at it I don't see any type
of reference to an earth maybe aside
from the the circular shape but then
again that's not enough to really know
so that's one issue another issue would
be having the letters es which I assume
stands for Earth sailor it becomes just
a little bit too cluttered i would say
because you have you know the difference
right here from the e and then the white
when it intersects with what our
mountains as mentioned here but again
that's not obvious enough so when i
looked at this i didn't know that this
was a landscape of some sort so that's
an issue I we need to try to make those
a little bit more obvious and i would
say probably find a different way of
trying to get the es there without
intersecting because all of these
different intersections creates for
clutter and it makes it a little bit
hard to understand and read so if you
probably got rid of these es and this
white parts it might be a little bit
more obvious that this is a land mass so
you may want to be get rid of it
entirely I so the Rope yeah that's
definitely a slight hint at the idea of
sailing but maybe not enough I for a
person to say oh this is you know a
sailing logo or whatever but other than
that good job I definitely did well with
these lack of use of colors and try and
effects and all that so everyone is
pretty much done a very good job at that
aspect at least so thanks for that all
right so digital art by the way you can
update your avatar and it will actually
work now so I fixed that issue so
looking at this I let's see here
okay one problem that I this may be
unintentional but due to the landforms
and the landmasses I thought this was
like a face almost I mean obviously it's
on earth but the face I saw like two
eyes are here at a nose again probably
not intentional but i'm not sure if this
even aligns up with the actual earth and
how the land masses are formed this
could be Africa I'm not sure but I other
than that I'd say I definitely a good
job with the colors that you used and
everything kind of complements each
other well but again and that it seems
like the face thing is just kind of
throwing me off but yeah I like the
simplicity of it it's not extremely
simple but it's not complex or it's not
cluttered either so good job on that
front all right here's the same sort of
I take from above and I would say the
strokes right here in between the other
hat and the earth I would be too thin
because when you scale that down it's
going to look like one tiny pixel line
and that adds to clutter so you want to
I bait you would definitely want to
thicken those up another issue is I if
you look at the green and blue right
here and then compare it to the green
blue used up here it's much easier to
see this one this one based on the hues
and the lightness of them they almost
bleed in together so it's hard to see
that so I would definitely use a darker
blue right here and it would be a lot
easier to see i guess i would say aside
from that pretty good execution I think
would be fixed both of those things it
would be a lot better so everything else
you did pretty good job with all right
another one from pixel factory we have I
yeah another one for this individual
yeah again I definitely a unique take
I'm glad you know a globe wasn't used
now this is
piece of Earth so in terms of executing
that concept that works pretty well it's
definitely one of the type of logos that
kind of feels more cartoonish than it is
serious which you know isn't necessarily
a bad thing it's tiny detailed like this
right here little sailor probably
unnecessary because remember when it
comes to the LOI design ideally you want
to try to you know symbolize what you're
trying to or illustrate what you're
trying to symbolize in the most simple
but unique way possible so I probably
get rid of that the tiny little wood
strips here I would thicken those up or
remove them other than that definitely a
good idea in a unique concept especially
compared to the other ones so thanks for
that or this individual made so changes
based on the other one you definitely
get the idea of earth again or sailor
rather in the E in the earth not so much
but again we already reviewed that one
but thanks for that mm I mean I was
pronounced at Mariah so looking at this
I definitely unique you know what I
would do actually I would get rid of the
e in the s and try to just combine these
into one symbol and then that would be
really unique because if you brought
these two together you would tackle the
idea of Earth with the Leafs and sailor
water right there so and it seems like
this would almost fit right there to
make one really cool sort of circular
symbol and that would definitely be a an
abstract and unique take on approaching
this logo as it stands with the ens it
doesn't look too bad again I think it
would be awesome to see what it would
look like by combining these two and
some unique way so definitely thanks for
that unique take on it all right chaos
let's see here when I saw this initially
I I mean I definitely liked it as a
symbol I wasn't sure where the Sailor
portion comes into it maybe I'm just
ignorant and I'm
sure what this thing right here is I i
mean i guess i could for some reason it
does seem like this is like a sailor
type of thing I don't know I sound
ridiculous I like everything else though
the the very abstract earth here you
could temporarily tell this is a globe
attached to you know a spinning globe I
but then this down here I'm not sure
what's happening dammit I don't know why
i can't really review this one well I do
like it the form and everything very
simple scale town well yeah it's just I
it's just one of those logos it's hard
for me to really pinpoint I think
there's some other slightly more obvious
hint at sailing I might be a little bit
more effective but I could be completely
wrong I felt there let's see here earth
and sailor what I yes oh this one
definitely has potential i would say
simplify the shape because we have so
many tiny details scaled that down and
get it become cluttered and blurry I'm
not what I'm not sure what's happening
down here though because usually I know
what this landmass is this is South
America but it doesn't look like this so
I'm not sure what's happening there but
I do like to transition from the earth
to a sale in kind of like a unique form
so definitely good it definitely has I
let's ear oh ok so after reading this I
understand now they tried to get an S
out of this and there's an e in here in
the negative space I didn't really see
that and it's hard to see the s for sure
in here so unfortunately that wouldn't
really work too well I would say that's
not even relevant to two or needed i
would say trying to convey the the E in
the s you don't have to do that I would
say just trying to have an earth here
combining into this this this sale would
be more than enough for it to be an
effective logo so thanks for that and
finally well no not finally we still a
few more this one was funny
because everybody associates beer
drinking with sailors but unfortunately
you're probably that's a stretch most
people are going to look at this and
they're not going to think anything
about sailing having said that though
it's a pretty good logo um simple shapes
obviously so it should scale well um in
the long shadow thing yeah that's
starting slightly to become a little bit
overused and dated so i probably
wouldn't include that when i'm trying to
showcase a logo anymore i definitely
wouldn't make it a part of it i guess
showcasing its fine but not making an
official part of the logo but having
said that yeah simple shapes simple
colors that work so that's definitely
good oh let's see here to variations
second one okay let's see here so I kind
of like this because the the shape of
the earth and the landmasses are
definitely stylized kind of like in this
block e format and I think that
definitely works so the very interesting
sort of skewed sail boat up here I think
that works well as well I so yeah it's
not too much I could say that that's
really bad with this so yeah thank you
for that submission alright this one
immediately reminded me of the what do
you call the Internet Explorer logo
which I think like the older version of
it I so I don't see any hemispheres on
the earth is a negative space of an e y
X so this one yeah you can see kind of
like a sail or the hint at sailing but
this one not so much unfortunately now
this one I almost look it almost reminds
me of like a basketball of sorts so the
problem with this of course I don't
really see in earth being symbolized
here directly so if I didn't know
anything about this logo i might not see
the earth but other than that between
both of the simplicity use of colors
lack of you know crazy effects
definitely a positive so thanks for that
and then finally our last submission
here I yeah definitely a lot happening
here I like
very interesting use of these I'm not
sure I heard how you would kind of these
shadows essentially um let me go ahead
and scale down my my browser here just a
bit just so we can see a little bit
better yeah I like it it's a one of
those certain types in styles of logo
designs I have a lot of fine details in
it but I I wish we could have done
without the the background here and just
have it or not pure white I think it
would have been showcased a little bit
better but having said that I really
don't have too many gripes with this you
could definitely tell you know it's a
sailor with this anchor also the the
life raft which are generally orange and
black I believe or no orange and white
and obviously the sale or the earth
right here so yeah I think it's done
pretty well again one minor could
critique I would say might get it
confused with the marine logo but but
again I mean it's tough to avoid those
certain instances especially when you
come you're basically have the same type
of concept when the Marines obviously
they're the US of course and sailing and
anchors and such I aside from that very
good entry so thanks for that and that
is it alright so I thanks everyone for
the submissions I we did pretty good on
this one see how many we had 21
submissions or 20 submissions rather so
I tomorrow again just for those that
you've you that don't know we're going
to be I having every Tuesday is going to
be a new design challenge so look for
that and also every Monday just as what
today is going to be the review videos
so every week you can look forward to a
new design challenge alright so I make
sure you subscribe here at YouTube if
you haven't yet and check out design
course calm all right goodbye
