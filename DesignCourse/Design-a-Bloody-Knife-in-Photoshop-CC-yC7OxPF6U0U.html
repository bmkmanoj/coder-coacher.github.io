column today is February 2nd with our
32nd or 33rd I don't even know anymore
video of the year and we are just going
to design a knife I don't know why
actually I do know why I had a hard time
coming up with an idea of what we were
gonna do today because I mean doing a
video every day of the year is kind of
difficult so I came up with this idea
just for some practice with the pen tool
and Adobe Photoshop CC and also working
with just some shading and I'm playing
around with flayer styles so this would
be a good tutorial if you're looking to
do something that maybe might look a
little bit photorealistic in Photoshop
so we're going to design a knife with
some blood on it so of course as always
check out design course calm and if you
haven't yet go ahead and subscribe here
on YouTube alright the project files of
course they're available for free in the
description below this video in youtube
alright let's get started alright so to
get started we're going to go ahead to
go to file new and we'll just call this
knife and the width I'm going to use 860
by 600 if it's well for my resolution at
100% I background contents I I always
leave it at transparent and I'm gonna
take the paint bucket tool hit ctrl 1 to
get to 100% and for our layer 1 which
will be our background let's go ahead
and I'm gonna choose like a color right
around I don't know right around here D
60 66 hit OK and fill that in alright so
for our knife we're going to design you
know basically like a kitchen knife not
one of those insane military ones that
are like real complex so I'm gonna get
started here with the pen tool make sure
shape is specified not path over here
and the fill will just make it something
a little bit darker and we'll start off
over here with the handle the end of the
handle and work our way through
so I'm just gonna click once and I'm
going to hold shift all the way to
around here and left click and drag
click out or hold out and then over here
slightly down just click once so usually
the top of a knife it will kind of taper
off at the end I mean go back just a
little bit further right around there
okay
and then we want to come down like right
around here so to do that we will
left-click and drag hold shift so it's
high basically completely horizontal and
then hold the Alt key and only drag that
engine out just a tad bit so we want
like a rounded edge and then we'll come
over here click once hold shift and drag
up just a little bit and then come down
here and we're going to end it a little
bit further and hit alt and left click
and kind of round that alright so if
yours doesn't look like this that's fine
I'm actually going to make some
adjustments to the to the point so I for
example I'm gonna move this point hold
shift left click hold shift to make sure
you select those three you may not need
to do this I kind of want this to be
down just a tad bit further and then
also I want this to be just a little bit
thicker so I'm going to take all these
points by holding shift kind of just
drag them down a little bit maybe take
this one pull it out and let's kind of
look at the proportions here in terms of
if you hit control H you can get rid of
those views just so you can see a little
bit better and I may just extend
everything out a tad bit making this
wider
if hit ctrl H again take the direct
selection tool over here and take all
these actually let me just take those
two up the top and that way extend it
out a little bit further all right guess
right around there is good all right so
now what I want to do I let's change
this base color to right around there
which is b8b 88 right okay now we're
going to hit control shift N and we're
going to create a clipping mask to make
sure that selected hit okay and then
we're going to take a rectangle tool and
we're going to drag out right around
here you can hold alt and hit control H
and that's going to be the start of the
actual handle it just kind of comes in
slightly right here and we want to make
that a little bit darker say around 2 C
2 C 2 C alright so now we have the basic
the two basic parts of the knife diamond
which is the handle of course and then
the actual blade so now we want to do i
what we want to do is to kind of get
some shading going on here so just
initially and I viewed this kind of
through a reference image I was doing a
search on Google Images and it seems
like you know a lot of kitchen knife
still have this portion right here that
kinda is like an indentation so I'm
gonna start with that first so basically
starting right around here will click
and you want to go just above maybe like
a pixel above this the bottom of the
blade click once there we'll hold shift
maybe go like right hand around there
and just slightly drag it up and then we
will connect it back right there alright
so now what I want to do is go ahead and
rasterize that take the blur tool
and or not the blur hold the eraser tool
rather and just slightly bring that into
a like a fade then what I want to do is
take the blur tool right here and the
strength is set at a hundred percent and
I have a size 64 so we'll see what that
does if we just slightly bring that in a
little bit okay now we may want to take
the opacity down just a little bit so
far it doesn't look good but that's
expected all right so I let's create
another layer we'll come up here and
kind of come down like right here and
then follow it through to this side and
then come up to the middle all right
something like that then I want to go
ahead and take I will go ahead to pull
rasterize that as well with the blur
tool take the blur tool rather make
maybe adjust the opacity a little bit
maybe move it in just a little bit
all right that's good for now I think
and we'll take another layer with the
pen tool I come up right around there
and we will rasterize that and blur it
out just a little bit maybe drop the
opacity down all right then we're going
to work on this portion I these all if
you take them all I'm holding shift
create clipping mask that way you make
sure it stays inside the actual blade
let's create a new layer clipping mask
I'm going to take the brush tool
something around the size of 146 and
just start out over here and hold shift
and just drag out then you could take
this of course the square the
rectangular marquee tool and just delete
that portion and we can go ahead and
take the experiment with the blend mode
a little bit maybe something to around
there that's fine for now and now what I
want to do is linked in the project file
or the description of this video on
youtube I there's a link to a deviantART
resource images actually it's that
deviantART or not no one second I gotta
find that actually no that was from
Flickr I it's linked here in the
description and YouTube and just I've
the video and this is the image we want
so let me see here if we click on
download all sizes and just take this
one that's large 1024 I'm going to copy
that or you could save it and then open
it up and copy it I but now it's in my
clipboard and so now what I want to do
is go ahead and take I think I'm going
to put it just above here so if I hit
ctrl shift and hit OK or enter and paste
that in hit ctrl T
scale this down just so that we see
everything hit apply and I play with the
blend mode so if we use our arrow key
and come down we can kind of just
experiment and try to find something
that makes it look pretty realistic so
if I go back up to the top I think what
one thing I want to do is take the color
of the knife and make it a little bit
lighter so around e5e5e5 and we can just
barely see it behind on normal or
overlay rather so I'm going to go back
up and go through these with the down
arrow key until I find something that I
think works well and if I don't think
something works well we'll just move it
to the top and see how this begins to
affect it if we play around with the
blunt layer blend modes also it seems
like there's a blue hint to it on how
our hue so if I go image adjustments
desaturate we can get rid of that and
also we see this overlapping so we want
to delete that hard light might actually
work so let's go through one more time
actually I think soft lights better we
don't want it to stand out too much all
right so then what I want to do is keep
on working on the actual the shading and
such over here so let me take the move
to auto select layer checked on it's
obviously gonna just choose out once and
never mind that and we just need to find
yeah right there I'm gonna take the
eraser and kind of taper off this
portion all right and then what I want
to do is we'll come we'll take the the
pen tool and just go underneath that
texture layer create a new layer
control-shift-n and we will take the pen
tool and we'll come let's see start out
here just before it starts the blade and
slightly just click and drag and we'll
come just to the top of this thing
all right left Facebook open what am i
doing and then we'll I rasterize that
take the blur tool and take this down a
notch
and I'm going to do basically the same
thing one more time
except with eighth a brush so let's go
ahead and say around 73 will work and
that needs to come down quite a bit
alright and then what we're gonna do is
take the move tool take their bottom
shape layer you I hold the ctrl key and
then left click and that gives us a
selection of the path itself and then
what we want to do is go to select
modify contract by one pixel hit OK
select inverse and we'll come up here to
this layer we created and hit the Delete
key hit ctrl D to deselect and you'll
see it created kind of a basically a 1
pixel white edge so let's take the
eraser tool I don't want to be right
there on that portion all right and
let's see here maybe bring that down a
little bit more alright so far not too
bad I trying to think if there's
anything else I want to do I may take a
new layer above our texture I right
click make sure it's a clipping mask and
take the white for the foreground
yeah and just kind of go across holding
shift
and let me experiment with the layer
blend mode yeah it's actually not gonna
work the way I wanted to so I'm gonna
take the eraser tool just kind of get
rid of that that middle portion I think
that's well what the hell happened that
didn't look right all right that's well
alright I think that's fine all right I
and you could take down the opacity a
little bit I think I like it kind of up
there real white alright and we're
almost done with this part come back
down here maybe a larger brush yeah even
though I've done this a lot of this is
just about experimenting trying to
create a realistic shadows and
highlights all right so I'd say that
looks pretty good
here I now let's go ahead and focus on
the handle the handle isn't gonna have
like any type of gradients or anything
we're just gonna use the pen tool so we
can start you know just here at the
bottom you can click here and then we'll
just start right around outside of it
and when it comes to handles they're
usually you know kind of obviously
three-dimensional alright so and come
above that layer right there change the
color to be like a highlight barely
noticeable we'll create another one oops
me around the edge
maybe make this one black and then do
one more
right click Oh No me not to do that what
am i doing alright and maybe just change
this just slightly darker and that's
like pitch black I don't like that so
let's take the I'm just like well notes
right there right around there like 29%
and then they usually have these three
circular I'll take the sphere tool or
lips tool metal things that hold it
together and what we'll do here is
double click on that to bring up layer
Styles will take gradient overlay will
change the style to angle will take the
gradient editor
and let's create several of these things
I'll call them and will go back and
forth between that color and white color
Pickers let's see here and then end it
right there out there we'll hit okay so
now it kind of creates a little metallic
type of effect we'll duplicate this now
when you duplicate that and you have
think layers above that's what happens
that kind of just no big deal well I fix
that afterwards right there and then
duplicate it again or you just right
click go to duplicate layer it's kind of
off the screen or set up a hockey I use
ctrl shift D to duplicate and then take
all those again right click and create
clipping mask alright alright so I that
is pretty much almost it let's create a
couple of other things here to take the
actual shape layer for the knife and
let's put in drop shadow
and it's kind of hard because I don't
have a lot of screen to work with take
the opacity down maybe just her around
there like nine percent hit okay and now
let's go ahead and just for the fun of
it
go ahead create a new layer at the top
make its clipping mask okay and I'll
link the blood-spatter brushes in a
description it's just they're really
easy install just double-click I'm gonna
load in or you click over here and just
go to load brushes once you download
them and let's just experiment with some
these are real bigs by the way so let's
take a darker red color obviously you
only want it to be on the actual handle
are not handle but the blade and I'm
just gonna experiment with a couple of
different ones here just a good idea of
what I might want to use
well not bring on that you just
something subtle like that and then come
down here beneath layer one or on top of
layer one or background layer and let's
get another one
me right there come back up here change
the blend mode so it appears maybe a
little bit darker yeah I think we add
one up there that would work well linear
burn seems to work well and then down
here we can put an adjustment layer on
it or just go to window adjustments
fight it here maybe just a hues all we
need but we'll see you here click on
this so that only affects that take the
heat the the saturation down a little
bit otherwise to bright it doesn't
really look right like will naturally
stain a little bit darker as it or at
least I think it does all right okay so
that is it so you could as you can see
you can kind of quickly it's only been
about 20 minutes create something that
looks you know semi-realistic if you
ever need to create any type of blood
you know we have a lot there's a lot of
great brushes out there for that sort of
thing alright and that is it so I of
course to always check out design course
comm and if you haven't yet subscribe

different social networks are on
Facebook Twitter Google+ etc alright so
I will see you guys tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
