today we're going to finish up the 3d
iOS app icon launcher if you enjoyed
this tutorial check out design course
comm and subscribe here on youtube and
also check out design course premium
where I will personally walk you through
and train you into becoming a better
designer
alright so design course comm for that
alright let's get started alright so
here in Photoshop go ahead and open up
the render where have you saved that and
you can see it's only at 33.3% the full
version is if you hit ctrl or command
one on I command autumn rather on Mac
I'm sorry you'll see we can get up to
hundred percent this is the actual size
it's pretty big i zoom out here so what
we want to do is go to file new and
specify now again this is what I talked
about yesterday's video he's trying to
upload an app icon let's say for example
I at 1 0 2 4 by 1 0 to 4 background
contents I've set the transparent RGB 72
hit OK alright and then we hit we take
control a control C to copy everything
here and then paste it in we'll see that
this is it's almost the right size but I
wanted mine to be just a little bit
bigger than this so if you wanted to use
that size of an app icon at 1024 by 1024
you could just go back into blender and
increase the size right here of the
resolution I
and then it'll work appropriately but
just for the purposes tutorial I'm going
to close out of there I'm going to go to
file new and just change it to 512 by
512 alright hit OK and now we want to
take the rounded rectangle tool so you
just left click and drag and select
rounded rectangle tool just left click
anywhere once and then it will give you
the create rounded rectangle dialog box
we're going to make the width 5
12 and the height 512 and these are the
Bohr radius so what we want to do is
when it comes to at 512 by 512 app icon
size the border or the corner radius is
84 an iOS app icon alright so if it was
if you're using 1024 by 1024 you're
gonna use 160 all right so a little bit
of maths for ya
all right hit OK and we'll get this
lined up make it a darker color by
double-clicking on this color right here
and just making it darker and let me
close that out and then you can use your
keyboard arrow keys to get this lined up
properly
right there alright so we already have
this copied over here I what we want to
do instead of just ctrl ving and pasting
it in we want to create a new layer
first ctrl shift and the letter n as a
nose or new and we want to specify use
previous layer to create clipping mask
hit OK so now it's pointing down to this
and so now when we paste this in it's
only going to show inside of this layer
alright so now we can move this and now
we can see we have our cool-looking app
icon and it's only being affected by
where we move this in so I want to go to
image real quick and we're going to go
to canvas size and I'm gonna expand it a
little bit just so we can see outside of
the edges of the icon so 512 we're gonna
change this maybe to 800 oops
no we want to change the width and the
height by 800 there you okay alright so
I want to give the background layer
first we have to create it
control-shift-n to call it BG for
background hit enter drag it to the
bottom and then we'll give it a pretty
dark blue d saturated sort of color
right there alright now I want to take
layer 1 we'll just call this 3d and I'm
going to
control-t and we're just gonna move it
down so we can get the edge over here
hold shift' scale that down a little bit
and you may have to do it a few times if
you want to see everything easier
hold all in your scroll wheel you can
zoom up and out that way
and so you can hold shift and you can
you can rotate this even I think right
there is pretty good just to the bottom
portion is touching the bottom of the
app icon select the move tool hit apply
all right so now if we hit control one
we can go up to 100% and I notice I it
kind of looks at a hundred percent
jagged for some reason I think that has
to do with changing the the the canvas
size so if that happens to you just go
back here ctrl C to copy ctrl a to
select all and then hit delete ctrl V to
paste again oops just select on rounded
rectangle and ctrl V to paste again and
hit ctrl T and do your adjustments again
and that should definitely not happen at
this time I think right there's where I
had it select move tool hit apply
now it's smoother yeah it's kind of
strange and I never happened to me
before but anyhow not a big deal all
right so now what I want to do is we can
still play around with this quite a bit
so I'm going to delete this rename this
one to the 3d I if you go to windows
adjustments or click over here you can
apply all these adjustment layers to
this layer specifically so if we want to
play around with the brightness and
contrast is click on this if you play
around the brightness it's gonna select
everything including this background we
don't want that to happen so we click on
this little icon right there and that
way it only affects this layer all right
so I'm going to turn the contrast up
you be right around there and you can
see what it looks like without that just
by hiding this adjustment layer so this
is with it on this just kind of
brightens things up a little bit I kind
of like it so I'm gonna leave that and
also I kind of want to add like some
kind of just flair or type of reflection
things so I'm gonna take the brush tool
and we want a hardness of zero for our
feathered brush and the size I'm going
to use around 330 pixels make sure we
have white selected okay control-shift-n
for a new layer hit enter
oops the hell happen there there we go
all right and now we want to duplicate
that right-click hit duplicate layer hit
OK and hit ctrl T and hold alt and drag
down the top portion so we kind of have
like this horizontal flare going there
and select move tool hit apply and just
like this layer one down here we'll just
call this large glare and you can always
play around with the layer blend mode up
here by default it's normal of course
but if you click it and it's highlighted
now you can use your down arrow key to
filter through these just to see if
there's something that might look a
little bit better I like that it kind of
highlights this portion and you can
always duplicate this as well so right
click duplicate layer it okay
and it can become a little bit too
intense so it screws up your edges a
little bit but you can always take down
the opacity so that doesn't happen so
much and then maybe do one more time
change this to normal hit ctrl T shift
and alt will scale down this way
so I can move to hit apply and then our
layer one will call this horizontal
glare and then this one you could try
overlay as well we're just experiment I
think that's pretty good
right around there alright so now that
you have that done I this is basically
what we'll consider oops our finished
icon alright so if you take everything
hold shift select all those layers hit
ctrl G to group them up call this 512
for that size and take I auto select
make sure that's checked on you can
change it to groups that way we click on
this it will automatically select a
group this is now are designed basically
so if we go to file new and specify 512
by 512 and drag this off come back here
left-click and drag this in position it
your arrow keys alright once you have a
position correctly you can go ahead and
file you can save this as a PSD first of
all so you can always edit it in the
future and then file save for web you
can save as like a 24-bit PNG and save
and then there you go that's basically
the file that you would upload and use
as your app launcher all right so let's
say we wanted to kind of showcase this
icon I let me go ahead and I'm just
gonna close out of there alright so let
me zoom out here a little bit so it's
always nice sometimes if you want to
showcase for your portfolio the actual
icon you can do it this way I mean this
looks pretty sweet and I in contrast for
the background shows the icon that's
cool I you could say this if you wish
I'm gonna go ahead and go to image
canvas size and I'm gonna make the width
like 1200 all right I'm gonna select
this background color using the
eyedropper
take the paint bucket tool select BG
fill those in I'm gonna move this over
and hit ctrl shift D that's a short
could I have for duplicating a group or
right click duplicate it so I'm just
going to use that shortcut for now on
all right and actually the better way of
doing this
I shouldn't have closed that other
window I am sorry damnit it's good to do
that real quick again if we go over here
and we actually let me see something
yeah if we go over here and drag this
down pull that in dock that back up move
this over get that centered so if we
wanted to show a 256 by 256 version we
get an image image size not canvas size
we change this to 256 hit OK control a
edit copy merged and then come back here
ctrl V to paste it and then if you
wanted to do that again come back over
here to this document image size change
that to 128 control a control C damn it
you've been going wrong here yeah okay
so if you control C that instead of
going to edit copy merged that's what
happens now we'll do that
pretty sweet anyhow but yeah that is the
tutorial you could of course keep on
doing that all the way down to 64 and 32
but yeah you get the point at this point
so and that is it so hopefully you
enjoyed this pretty quick and easy how
to 3d how to create a 3d version out of
a vector graphic for use in an app icon
alright so check out design course comm
for sure and if you liked what you seen
here let me bring this up check out the
design course comm forums introduce
yourself in the introduction section I
will say hi and yeah subscribe here on
YouTube of course that always helps out
doing videos I'm pumping them out like a
madman so yeah alright I will see you
