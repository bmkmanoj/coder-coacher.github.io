so today just on this lazy Sunday I
checked my dribble comm account and I
have two invites so first what is
dribble comm well if I switch over here
to the desktop and get out dribble comm
we'll see this is what it is it's
basically a portfolio site for designers
to showcase their work okay whether it
be identity design logo design app
design whatever and the way it works is
you have live actual players and I'm a
player they use basketball terminology
for the site it's pretty large site as
well and then you have prospects and
individuals who want to be players and
if you're a player you just get to have
the full experience you can comment and
there's a few other perks I believe and
so in order for you to become a full
player is to become drafted by a player
all right so you would be a prospect
what you need to do is join and then
mark yourself as a prospect and then you
can post which is a relatively new thing
people weren't able to post work before
until they were a player but now you can
actually post your work and then that
way for people who have invites like
myself we will be able to make you a
full player if you if we think your work
is good enough alright so here's how
this works if you want to join and you
do actually have work right now and post
in the comments here in the the YouTube
here section I a couple things first
your dribble URL
alright so that's your profile URL and
then also if you maybe have a separate
portfolio site then also include a link
to your design work if you already
uploaded to dribble then you don't need
to choose step 2 and then if you want
optionally of course follow me on
dribble at course cetera
alright so let me just show you real
quick what that looks like so this is my
URL I kind of have to have to update my
work it's been I don't know yeah it's
been a year since I updated it but I'm
planning on updating it but anyhow yeah
that's it so I I will try to choose the
two
winners um probably within the next few
days maybe 48 to 72 hours and I'll let
you know in the comments I'm not going
to create a new video about who I picked
or whatever but I will let you know if I
actually chose you and you'll receive a
notification email probably from gerbil
that I have actually drafted you alright
so I'll see you guys real soon
with new content and tutorials check out
corset ro calm and of course as always
subscribe here alright see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
