going to do the review of the Apes
design course icon design challenge and
that was based on doing a fictional logo
design for a company called speed cloud
alright so yeah we had a lot of entry so
thank you for all of your entries so let
me go ahead and get started alright so
before I get on with the review real
quickly I wanted to show some of you
guys I just a project from mentor so you
know just recently I launched design
course premium right here and that is I
just a set of different products one of
them may the main one being one-on-one
design training and part of that a
premium also is designed course of his
ID which is the visual identity design
course which will show you how to design
full identities like branding and logo
design for companies and then mentor you
select from a bunch of different
fictional projects and then you take
what you learn there and then applied
you know you try to see how you can do
on your own which is kind of important
and so one of our members I submitted
this project from mentor and this is
this a fictional project called sink and
learn and basically I this is what i
submitted is called a corporate identity
some of you learn how to do in this and
then i provide a response based on that
and so you know these design challenges
where i do a quick review of you know
what you submitted the design course
mentors like that but like a hundred
times more basically so i take some time
and I review it through video and then
the individual is able to watch this
video I'm going to pause it though and
one of me talking over myself here and I
even I a lot of cases i will take the
design you can see this is eight-minute
video here and offer suggestions and
improvements based on what they did so
what's cool is this particular
individual they entered a second i
mentor project and they definitely made
improvements from just you know this
video in the critique I gave them so
definitely check out design course doc
calm / premium I it's right now if you
use the promo code it's 39 bucks a month
or day 95 very cheap you can cancer
anytime and only stay one month and you
would still gain a ton all right so
enough of my spam I'm going to go ahead
and do the review here alright so
basically I for this we had a ton of
entries um just use blues and or blacks
Noah the company texts show a version
that's at least 500 x 500 pixels and
submit by then alright so this person
this is an indenture they had a question
about something so the first entry we
have is from gizmo snogger and I so the
first thing i would say here is you know
in terms of the type that this is fine
in terms of the simple though it feels a
little bit disconnected I because we
have first here over here is the the
cloud and then separate are the tales
coming from it it seems like could
probably make a big improvement just by
integrating these tales into the cloud
may be as white space I because right
now it feels more like an illustration
than it does a single you know compact
identifiable mark alright so that's one
big thing I would say that would improve
this all right I secondly we have here
from Janine I so basically there's a lot
here that probably could be definitely
improved the I understand by having the
trails and the slashes here you're
trying to convey the idea of speed but
what happens is when you put it over the
actual text it makes it kind of
difficult to read Plus on top of that
the colors seem a little bit washed out
with gradient that you've applied so if
you were to scale this down you would
have a hard time at a small size kind of
scene exactly what's going on so I also
see that there's like a stroke add a
stroke going on here I with a gradient
also applied onto it a little bit too
too much happening in terms of
complexity and color for it to be
identifiable like I know neat if I
didn't know already it would be hard to
know that this is necessarily a cloud
right off the bat so I would work on you
know too i'm going to show you a few
there's a few concepts here that really
do a good job of what i'm talking about
so just keep watching the video if you
are you and I yeah and you'll see what I
mean so I next one's from Myra or mirror
I so here's the result so
they mentioned you know common cloud
logo which is fine simple and white
space trust in class and one font for
the name may be different for whites
okay so I initially when I saw this
design here I thought to myself you know
is that SS you know is that like I'd
supposed to be a see I thought but
really this what you meant maybe was
just like a single ass being outlined on
the left and right of the letter I by
the way i would say you nay in and of
itself it feels a little bit cloudy i
guess you could say and there is an S
there so I it is definitely more so on
the abstract side you know which is fine
but I would definitely say in terms of
your alignment with the mark and the
type here that could have some I
improvement so I would probably scale
down the size of the symbol in relation
to the text a little bit and align it so
that maybe it's in the center I because
right now you don't even have on a
baseline which is right down here it
just feels it feels those it's just a
little bit off and it feels like two
separate things going on instead of just
one single logo I in terms of the font
and I'm usually not too much of a fan of
the serif fonts for especially something
that's web-based it feels a little bit
dated in my opinion so that's why I I
understand you trying to go for trust
but I know I this seems elegant enough
the lines in the path that I don't think
you would have a too much of a problem
with any type of the ideas of trying to
convey trust so I wouldn't I mean I
wouldn't necessarily take the route of
using a serif font like this for that
reason alone all right so all right so
back mommy we have done your speed cloud
very simple logo I would say maybe the
only gripe I would have well I have a
couple grapes they're not big though is
that on on the side of originality in
uniqueness you may have I'm I understand
that there's white space here and you
have another cloud maybe that's supposed
to emulate speed but overall I like it
compared to a lot of entries I actually
do like it it's very simple you could
scale down you'll be able to see it
still at a small size
I you kept it at one color you know the
other grape that i have is maybe there's
a little bit to space between speed and
cloud when you already have the
different that the difference of the
font weight you can move those two
closer together all right I and then
second you another entry from this
individual I i would say you're going to
take this route well you know already we
really introduce an element of
complexity already into it so you can
get rid of this you don't really need
that because you already have the
element of a speed conveyed already
through this all right and then secondly
i'm not entirely too sure about the
radial sort of i gradient that you have
in here I only because it seems like it
clashes a lot there I would find a way
to make it a little bit more simplistic
while keeping this the clock idea but
overall the cloud and stuff I like that
so alright another one from panda I so
this one I like the idea of introducing
you know like an arrow shooting upwards
you know that's the idea of conveying
speed but there's a couple things that
have been done wrong here mainly there's
an issue of contrast there's not much of
it happening so you would really want so
we already have the form of the cloud
here and by the way i would also get rid
of the stroke it's pretty much
unnecessary in this usage so i would
give her this do the very brief stroke
that you have and i would also get rid
of the flares like this these intricate
flare designs with the balls i would get
rid of that completely now I i would
probably scale up this arrow and i would
make it so that you can actually see it
a lot better right now it's just a lot
of blues and it's a little bit lighter i
would try to work on making it white I
and maybe getting rid of some of the
other extra fine detail that you have in
here I and again if you watch if you
keep on watching this video and watch
till I get to the second page you'll see
there's a couple of examples I really
like in really showcase about you know
how you can approach this and a little
bit better area and also the radial
gradients I would get that I would get
rid of that as well off of each of the
letters it's just not necessary and it
and it just makes it difficult to read
in a sense all right so lawyers okay so
this one is two entries here so
basically I like the idea of having
tails you know kind of give the idea of
speed with the cloud but I add the first
entry that are reviewed this is same
kind of issue they feel a little bit
separate if you're going to have this I
would try to make so that these four
lines align with the side of this cloud
because right now they just feel
completely separate and then also
there's a an issue with the size of the
font and the size of the cloud this is
definitely too small in relation to it
because especially if you were to put
this on a on a website it has to be
scaled down a lot more and then you want
to be able to see the speed cloud
anymore so I would work on that overall
I do kind of like the oh and also
another one is like a de the the stroke
ends here they're flat you could change
those caps to rounded because these are
around it as well that way you keep
things consistent in their appearance
and you kind of just change the tail on
this it looks like I actually like this
one a little bit better all right and we
have I don't even know how to pjs going
to call you PJ all right and so we have
here I this was it's difficult at first
is to really read that the fact that
this is an SNS see I generally when it
comes to logo design if you're going to
have letters in it or you're going to
use a letter mark you kind of wanted to
come out I would be recognizable within
the first second or so because upon
viewing it I in this you know just
because I know there's a logo
quantitation I'm going to stay here and
really try to figure it out and it did
take me a little bit time just to see
the s and the see here and so with that
said you want to try to make that a
little bit more evident and then
secondly when it comes to the eye the
outer shadow there or the outer glow
this dark outer glow that you apply to
it completely unnecessary I wouldn't do
that at all just you work with the
colors like if you're going to have a
darker
blue for this I go ahead and do that and
then the the negative x the negative
space would be white and you can see it
you don't need to add the glow the outer
glow and it's a in terms of professional
logo design it's just a turn-off in
terms of the appearance so aside from
that I yeah I you kept the the cloud
simple which is definitely a plus and
the type as well so and then secondly I
I would not do that yeah never try to
mix your or put in the background of the
you know the symbol I in that and try
not to mix these two type in a symbol
like this because otherwise you're just
you're going to make it difficult to
read that when it gets at a smaller font
size so try to keep them separate if
possible and then over here fibo leb or
fab lab I so yeah we have an issue with
colors i would say I the you have a
gradient that's on here and it kind of
goes from this green and really clashes
I would say with this blue so I would
try to maybe yeah definitely work on the
if you're going to have gradients I
would definitely work on trying to keep
it you know a minimum to the colors that
you're working with whatever color
you're working with blue which is right
here in this case is being blue so
adding two green to it just kind of
clashes in my opinion and then I second
another tip here I when you're
presenting a logo it's always nice to
you know I know I said 500 x 500 but
that doesn't mean scale the logo up to
500 x 500 try to have a lot of white
space so scale the logo down so that we
can see it without seeing the edge of
the site and need the text by and
everything otherwise it'll just it'll
make it hard to see really so what I'm
talking about if I go into Photoshop
real quick and that's huge okay and then
a scale is down we can see that it's
just easier once I make this background
white just to see the logo rather than
what the logo looks like when it's
like this so just a tip they're always
white space and makes it things much
more easy to see and then second to type
here I would close the gap between speed
and cloud for sure because again you use
a thicker font wait right here and so
the differential differentiation is
already seen all right so all right next
one is at eight so tax design I so I
like the idea of just using a simple
stroke for it that's that's a good idea
I but it seems like the cloud might need
a little bit of work in terms of this
portion right here it seems like these
two were good in terms of their
consistent in how the the stroke is
applied right here when it comes to this
intersection and this one over here but
this one feels a little bit different it
just feels like I don't know something's
off a little bit so I work a little bit
more on the cloud form and then I would
say I you know contrast all that is good
but I would move the speed Claude up a
little bit closer and probably scale
down the size of this cloud here or vice
versa so that they don't feel so
separate in a way so and then and then
third I would say I it probably lacks a
little bit in terms of uniqueness
originality I just because there's no
element of speed introduced here it's
just a cloud so you'll see a few
concepts that really do what I'm talking
about well
right here and then this one I would say
this one is definitely an improvement
over this one I just because you can see
it a lot of contrast but we have this
this great out sort of type inside of
what's already somewhat of a dark sort
of blew it makes it hard to see so if I
were you I let's just made this white I
may be a slightly darker blue and you'd
be able to see the type in here all
right and then pixel chaos we have here
I alright so my grape mainly with this
is there's a lot happening that's
probably unnecessary those are most
composers like a
lava illustration there's not much white
space between these tales here and speed
on this on this I logo design concept to
lease I so I like this more this concept
here because I you can actually read the
speed plowed this one the speed set
inside and it's just it seems like real
clutter so this is definitely the better
one I but if I'm looking at this one
specifically I I would get rid of the
well i would get either get rid of this
arrow or these tales because again
someone else did that earlier they're
trying to really get elaborate and
intricate in terms of trying to
reinforce the idea of speed so we
already have the cloud this can serve as
you know the idea of conveying speed
these tales for this but I i would
probably get rid of the arrow as its
design here just because it seems like
oh it's a little bit quirky in terms of
quirky or out of the not saying I in
terms of the design it feels like it's
just I doesn't flow right I don't know
there's probably another way to get to
get a better arrow in here but yeah and
in terms of the the highlights here or
shadows or whatever there's you know I
know what they're supposed to be but I i
will probably get rid of those I mean if
you want to have a colored version we
have those that's fine but for the black
and white i would say stay away from it
all right and it's Chris so I like this
one this is the most unique cloud we've
had so far for entry number 17 I but
there's one thing I would definitely say
that you could get rid of and make a
huge improvement right off the bat I
would get rid of this little clock speed
dial reference I want it clashes right
here with the blue what
it kind of breaks the design and it
breaks the flow as you can see there's
literally a flow of these things that
feels like they're all interconnected
and I think that in and of itself kind
of takes care of the idea of speed so
you know it is a cloud but it feels like
because everything is connected and the
gradients are flowing that already takes
care of it so in this case I would say
this is very effective logo if you got
rid of the minute or hour hand or
whatever right here it would appear much
better so yeah with that said with the
font the type select you see it didn't
seem like too much went into the eye and
choosing the font maybe it seems like
the something a little bit more unique I
could be done with this but I the ways
folks up here
got rid of that would be a big
improvement so this is a good entry I
would say just you know we disregarding
the couple Graf's hat so I Peter here I
so I would see right away get rid of
these tiny little trails I understand
you try and emulate the idea of speed
but italicized text usually gets that
idea across just being pushed forward in
a running motion so you when it comes to
these fine details you're going to have
our time kind of even if they're scaled
down a lot it's gonna it's it just won't
look very good especially when you have
a symbol already over here so i would
get rid of those I the cloud you know i
would say probably get rid try to make
everything on one line I it's a unique
creative idea but I would just keep
everything simple on the same line and
then the cloud here just so that it
could be used possibly independently I
would try to scale down maybe thicken up
the line to a stroke and it would be a
little bit more effective because right
now with everything going on here it's
just
otherwise it is simple
like it and the colors are good all
right so I Peter over here oh it's the
same person I see ya this may be a
little bit more about us talking about
up here I just having a separate symbol
and using this may be picking up these
lines because if you have anything
that's a little bit too thin when you
scale that down it become blurred
usually and hard to read so with this
already if you could just imagine taking
this may be moving it down a little bit
more maybe scaling it down I making
these all in the same line and get rid
of these it would be a much more
effective logo so I yeah you already did
that down here I forgot I already went
through these but first it's there so
many it's hard for me a tremor so yeah
you got rid of them that's a good thing
you listen to making this up anyhow yeah
just move this down into much space here
I
like
and I psyops over here so one issue is
letter mark or letters in the symbol
they should usually represent something
not just be kind of arbitrary letters
inside of something because people will
think you know well what is EE so it may
not make too much sense so I I would
probably try to make this separate or I
definitely one thing I definitely want
to do is I have both of these shown at
the same time I'm not sure if that was
your attention to probably wasn't if
this is the whole logo okay it's
definitely better than having this as
well in addition to this I so I'm not
too sure i would emphasize though and
have this behind the ee in and of itself
just because it seems like you know what
what is easy you know what significance
does that have so I in terms of contrast
simplicity I really like it even with
the cloud I being I upper cased up like
this I definitely like it so alright so
TK Maxx alright so there's a lot of
improvement that could be made here I
mean not to be an ass or anything but
you know
when it comes to logo design you have
these very thin lines that are just
separating this graphical sorta element
there's just too much happening for it
to be a real effective logo so there's
also issues with the contrast the
gradients that apply to these clouds on
this this portion right here kind of
clashes with the blue you have two
clouds here that's it's just I
cluttering it a lot way too much I
understand the idea of kind of their
making it mirrored but I it's just too
much happening for it to be a real
effective logo so you would want to only
use one cloud and also I wouldn't flip
the cloud like this or not flip it or
move it you know 90 degrees or whatever
I would keep it represented as the your
standard cloud just because it's it kind
of throws you off a little bit so just I
just keep on watching this video and
you'll see a couple real good concepts
or the person really did it right in my
opinion all right so okay so this is the
same person and I think it definitely
made a huge improvement from this to
this I'm definitely a fan of not using
all these gradients and all this you
know these different color gradients and
stuff so this is definitely a huge
improvement this time they use the D is
trying to be the cloud I would say yeah
if you got maybe just maybe just made
wanted to just make this a d a regular
date like this text over here and then
maybe
you fill this in with that blue and
maybe put addy in there it could work a
little bit but still I'm not a fan of
flipping the cloud like that but yeah
huge improvement and they're there all
right so Alexandra I dis one I'm not a
fan of the the glows and the recall
looks like motion blur is happening in
here you got to try not to do that as
much as possible I dafont I would say
he's definitely kind of too thick and
they're just barely touching each other
which creates for clutter ruling I and
see what else so in also trying to
convey all these ideas within a logo
that that's not how you do it i mean
just imagine of like McDonald's or
something if they tried to convey that
they sell drinks and I've you know
beverages and recall different
sandwiches you don't want to do that
with it low you want it to be a very
simple single identifiable logo mark
that's why so I wish some of you people
would join a design course premium even
if it's just for a month so I can work
with you specifically because I can take
you guys you have talent I can tell raw
talent but I can take you guys and
really just make you better designers
just within 30 then but anyhow yeah
thanks for the entry another 140 key
here and this is just a mark here I'm
not a fan of this gradient that's we're
on the why it's kind of clashing with
this and then there's the inner shadow
try to stay away from this
trying to try to really emphasize
emphasize at this time with this design
child try to stay away from all these
crazy ingredients and
and set of facts
I mean plus we still have the cloud
thing going you can still have a cloud
I'm trying to make it
just coming off the side or something
all right and like all right page two
all right so here's another one from
newman or no this is the first post i
think i do you need any provements i
well you entered a couple here so i
would say out of the three that you
submitted i would get rid of this just
because it looks a little bit too
intricate to technical i would say this
one I like the the font better than this
one up here all those tonight like a
huge difference I but I actually like it
yeah I actually do like it I mean it's
very simple you have a cloud and it's
kind of serving as the back of a clock
and this is the center I so yeah this
isn't that at all so I don't really have
too many gripes with this I i would say
it feels just a tad bit possibly bland
but really i mean in terms of if are
comparing it to most of the other
entries this is still pretty good here
alright and then we still have the basic
form just with a different color
gradient so I thanks for the enthusiasm
and trying to submit them though so all
right so I all right Kim we have here
okay so we have this is a debt they
don't like the s already um but ok so
this I really like this cloud just
because it is so simple and so when it
comes to low the design something that's
really simple that's awesome I but
introducing the s and the sea to the
left of it already now you've made it a
little bit too complex so I would find a
way if you wanted to make it a letter
mark try to get it inside of here
somehow um or make somehow maybe make it
flow or somehow maybe make if you're
going to have an S maybe try to make
this part the sea from the cloud but I
would ultimately maybe just get rid of
the idea of making it and I letter mark
and just sticking with working with this
idea and making it on trying to
introduce the element of speed somehow
into this cloud I like the cloud a lot
and the font selection of course I I
think we need to scale that down and
remember i already mentioned to this
before I this individuals on mentor but
I but just previously in this video you
know scaling it down so that we can see
it without all this I this minimal white
space on the side alright and cone
alright so again the same issue with
with it being real big scale that sucker
down so we can see it this kind of nomas
works because it's on the very edge here
but the problem is when you scale this
down it's going to feel like it's
chopped off completely so just to show
you real quickly so if I scale this down
I'm going to fill this with black real
quick or lease right here I don't know
it just kind of feels immediately just
chopped off um let me go back your
screen here and so the size of the cloud
in relation to speed cloud I'm not sure
if I'm too much of a fan of actually
it's not too bad i mean if this is white
we could definitely see it more um let
me go back here and so one thing you
have to be wary opens when you're using
certain fonts the distance between the
letters they're there they could
sometimes be off so you need to manually
adjust for that when you're using these
fonts because there's a lot of space
between the s and the P and the P and
the E and then not between the rest of
letters the tracking so you want to make
sure you get that set so that it doesn't
because it will throw it'll just not
look good as a whole even to people who
aren't artistic all right and then
minifigs Steve I would say you know
again the other grape that I had with
you trying to convey all these different
ideas to the logo get rid of these
entirely and then definitely I I know
you just your first post you'll know
that if you watch enough of these
challenge videos i'm not a fan of having
all the drop shadows and outer glows and
the gradients all combined to each other
so coming up pretty shortly there's
going to be a concept that i'm going to
say hey this is good this
should do it so just stick with me all
right so Mike here another you know
trail type of vibe thing the problem is
is when it comes to these gradients when
they're all not one color you'll have
clashes here if you're using gradients
on different elements so you see they
kind of class right here and that
doesn't look good generally so I would
try to make if you're going to have a
gradient include it with these three
tails the gray say it's a consistent
gradient all the way across all right
then aside from that I in terms of just
how they're kind of just going off into
the distance and I would try to work on
integrating that better in a sense and
then the size of the speed cloud
relation to this again if we scale this
thing down a lot more that we have more
white space and we can view it without
the clutter of the website I'll be able
to kind of see better or ascertain
better you know if this the relate the
size of the mark is good with the size
of the text all right and there's a
little bit too much space for my liking
between speed and cloud although again
it's hard to tell because it's so big I
end up against the browser when it comes
to the cloud there's just not enough
happening I mean that the cloud shape
itself is fine but there's not enough
happening for it to be unique I guess
you could say um and sometimes having
like this you know small different
treatments inside of the the the the
type is fine although I think this is a
little bit Ted bit too thick I but yeah
I would just work on trying to make the
cloud more unique and this is better so
you know I probably wouldn't you have
used white or black i would use white
instead and maybe use a darker or it may
be fine with this shade already i'm not
sure i haven't seen it or what that
would look like in white be yeah this is
definitely better alright so tiki max
this is I this is actually something you
could work with but I would say try to
get rid of all the details I maybe make
us more simple sort of cloud and maybe
use a little bit less
of these trails and then scale it down a
little bit in in relation to the speed
clot here and in terms of the the
gradient it looks like there's a
gradient with three different colors
kind of just with the white in there I
probably get rid of that it in terms of
color it just makes a little bit too
much going on for the purpose here but
yeah it's definitely unique so thinking
out of the box and definitely graphical
so Alexander I there's a lot there's big
issue with this one when it comes to the
complexity issue so I would say get rid
of all the intersection lines kids
especially when you take something like
this oh it's going to do that one second
leg over here when you take something
like this and
you scale it down
the size like that makes it hard to read
because you have not much white space
between the cloud this line right here
and the text right here and it just
seems a little bit too intricate for it
to be an effective logo so you know if
you take a look at some of the top logos
just go to google and type in top brand
logos or something like that you'll see
that they don't have all these intricate
lines and that's for a very important
reason because I clutter and complexity
is something that's usually hard for
people to remember to immediately
remember immediately identify so that's
just a real important note here all
right so like the idea of you know in
terms of creativity that's certainly
there but we just haven't Lee work in
terms of making things more simple all
right so voltage or I think that's how
you pronounce it this is definitely in
terms of all the entries I've seen so
far the best one in terms of you know a
very simple cloud shape in terms of the
rocket and then met in the middle which
kind of just seems to completely just
flow right with the circular cloud
shapes and so we have the cloud and we
have the reference to speed right here
perfect so I really like this as a
design so for all the other individuals
who are really just beating yourselves
up over the complexity part of the logon
focusing on a lot of the gradients and
all the crazy colors and stuff this
coming up with a solid unique idea
that's what LO designs about all right
so and then we have macoris here speed
cloud I so it seems like the the actual
mark here when it comes to using a gray
and we have three different colors here
you have a black and gray and blue and a
gradient on the blue I seems like a
little bit too much is happening here so
i would probably get rid of the gray and
just stick with the blue you're going to
have a lightning bolt in there which
it's a cool idea the concept of it i
think it would be integrated better by
maybe having just a filled-in logo like
this a cloud and then using the white
space to integrate this flash some way
that's why again I wish some of you guys
were designing course premium members i
would actually take this cloud and I
would feel an didn't exactly show you
guys what I'm talking about
so now we have a letter mark there's not
enough with white space between the s
and the sea out here so creates for a
little bit of clutter so I'd scale that
down if I were to do you know take this
approach and the this symbol along with
the Bob old that's that's too much in
and of itself so that
to minimize that and then this these
lines right here just too thin so the
smaller size they'll become pixelated I
so it's stay away from that
and then I also try to stay away from
whenever you're working with type try to
stay with the way from letters that
clash of different colors kind of just
creaks a classroom doesn't look
so yeah version 2 here yeah and this
right here someone else put like the
logo intersecting so
crazy plotter so I would stay away from
doing now and move the speed over to the
left and
the cloud that's fine I but definitely
don't let them intersect and these
aren't needed as well so I the speed
also they having downwards I don't know
traditionally a down arrow means
negativity and so if you wanted to
emulate speed I would put it on the
upper part of the d that would make more
sense but yeah alright so LG portfolio I
so three were entered here I for this
one and I definitely like this one the
most in terms of the symbol I think
maybe even the text of the type so this
is a it flows real well with the side of
the cloud I maybe try to find a way for
it to kind of find some type of way for
you to get it so that the arrows up
because we have the down arrow thing but
I the way I like this the most this we
have the down arrow again plus it
doesn't seem to a hundred percent i
would say original or whatever but I
like this a lot actually and then this
there's the details of two finite here
so they're going to become quite pix
elated when you scale it down a little
bit so I would just I would definitely
go over I would go with this rather than
this and this and this just becomes a
little bit too complex in the colors
clash here so yeah this one isn't too
bad except it feels like the side of
this I the beginning of these tales
don't align with the flow of the I the
cloud here so you got the idea right to
put space between them to put negative
space or white space I but they don't
flow with the profile of this cloud so
that would be a big adjustment at least
alright and that no we have a couple
more no this is the last one so the
cloud here becomes way to is way too
wait too bumpy I guess you could say I'm
most the other entries to see that they
use a simple simpler cloud type thing
and these are two I would also say thin
form to be effective I so I would just
work on a more simple cloud I mean the
one I like the most only has three three
cloud blobs I guess you could call them
or whatever so yeah I would work on
simplifying things alright so that is it
thanks guys for submitting the entries
there's that I think this is our most
active design course challenge I let me
know if you guys want me to keep on
doing logo design ones I or if you have
other ideas and yeah for sure please
consider dot sorry my cam software stop
for a second but yeah please consider
joining design course premium where I
could really spend a lot of attention
just on you and getting you guys to
become badass designers all right so
yeah check out design course calm sauce
premium and subscribe here on youtube if
you haven't yet alright so we're going
to be doing another challenge here in
the next few days so check back often
all right goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
