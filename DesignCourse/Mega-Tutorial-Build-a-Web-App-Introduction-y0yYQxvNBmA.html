comp
today we're not going to be doing any
design work instead I'm going to be
introducing our second quote unquote
mega tutorial so this tutorials going to
be focused on creating a web app
something very simple but it's going to
be very elaborate because we're going to
cover every single step that it takes so
first we'll start off in Adobe
Illustrator in designing the logo then
we'll move on into Adobe Photoshop to
create a responsive grid based Photoshop
mock-up for the website in the home page
then we'll move into coding the actual
HTML and CSS and making it responsive
and then also we're going to tie in for
the first time PHP and MySQL and
basically this idea is very simple it's
just like an idea to try to connect
streets in a social manner or
neighborhoods rather so it'd be kind of
like Facebook except for very specific
people that are around you I so anyhow
the idea it can be replicated depending
on where you live so we're going to be
registering a domain name you're going
to need hosting I but but everything
else I'm going to try to keep so that
you know in terms of cost it's going to
be you're only going to have to worry
about a domain name and hosting
basically so I the focus isn't going to
be really towards the idea the idea
itself it could succeed if you really
put all your effort into it and
marketing and stuff but really I the
purpose of this tutorial is to show
people the whole process of what it
takes to basically create and establish
a web app I so yeah take it you know the
idea itself you could scrutinize it no
big deal but anyhow so yeah I just
wanted to introduce that and be ready
tomorrow we'll be choosing our domain
name and a couple other things all right
so I'll see you then
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
