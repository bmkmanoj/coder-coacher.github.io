the design course on youtube channel and
in this free video tutorial we're going
to be covering your creation of a custom
letter R and the reason I'm doing that
is because on the design course comm
slash forums we're having a design
challenge and that is for creating a
sci-fi slash high-tech stylized letter R
alright and so there's still time left
to actually enter this competition at
least at the time of recording this
video and all the requirements are here
it's free to enter a submission deadline
is August 1st so if you're watching this
after that well obviously you can't
enter but we already got quite a bit of
submissions but today's Monday
it ends Friday you still have some time
if you want to enter this alright so I'm
just going to do my take or I'm just
going to do my own entry for this so the
first thing we're going to do is go to
file new and we're going to name this R
and I'm going to choose 859 by 600
pixels and I'm using that because it
just fits well at 100% with my current
resolution and then RGB we have here
raster effects screen 72 and we don't
want to align new objects to the pixel
grid so hit OK ctrl or command one will
get you to 100% view right here and we
want to go to view and then show grid
and then view in snap to grid then we
want to go to edit preferences and
guides in grid over here
grid guideline every a grid line every
72 pixels in subdivisions I have set at
16 all right so hit OK and we want to
really pay attention into snap to the
grid and use the grid in order to make
sure all of the different weights and
throughout the letter form are
consistent so what we're going to do eye
is just block out the basic shape of
this thing first so in the middle of one
of these overall grids you can see how
672 pixels we have a grid line it's a
little bit darker than the rest here in
the center of one of those squares using
the ellipse tool we want to left-click
hold shift and alt and drag it to the
total of three different grid lines so
we have one here or actually four one
two three and four all right so I'm
going to move that back down holding
shift and yeah I think right there is
good and I want to also get rid of the
fill so you just click over here and you
can't see it it's on its off my screen
but it's just the first color swatch on
the very upper left hand corner and that
gets rid of the fill here alright so
stroke I have it one and the second
thing we want to do is control C or
there's two different ways get control C
and then control F or control G a oops
I'm completely wrong control C control F
scale that down holding shift and alt
right there alright so basically we have
a doughnut shape all right now what we
want to do is take the line segment tool
and starting off just over here it has
to be further than this point right here
because we're going to create a an
intersection point basically that goes
from this way at a 45 degree angle so we
want it to extend a little bit further
it's a hold shift and then have it
extend out over here far to the right
alright so this is going to be the right
section a very edge of the the are right
here that comes down and we also want to
make sure you have to be absolute
certain that these lines are
intersecting and the only way they are
is if this is on the actual grid so if
you take a direct selection tool right
here and you take this point left click
and then drag it it'll should snap to
this center point right exactly on it
same thing with with this as well all
right so then what we want to do
is hit control C control F duplicate it
move that one down right there control C
control F move that one down right there
and then one more time move this down
right there alright so I know it looks a
little bit confusing but you'll see how
this works really shortly alright so we
need we need to create a another one and
this time it's going to be the 45-degree
diagonal line I'm just going to start
out here somewhere I outside of this
point right here and I'm going to hold
shift and left-click and drag and we're
just going to go all the way down like
that alright so the goal here is to
actually a little bit wrong I think we
need to get this over here instead okay
there yeah the goal is to have the top
portion of the are start right here at
this slant and come around and end right
here and so the way we'll do that is
using the shape builder tool but first I
want to make sure real quickly that this
is indeed snapped to that point and it
is alright so if I take everything right
now and with the move tool hitting B on
the keyboard and we just take a
selection on all that or hit ctrl a to
select all what we can do is use this
tool right here the shape builder now
what this allows us to do if we hover
over it it lets us it kind of just
creates a selection depending on where
you're you're selecting around so you
can see right here if you just
left-click and drag
oops you'll see that it goes over we
don't want the center so just these two
for now then left click select those two
as well and that is it you can see now
we have the right portion of our are
selected so now what I want to do is
from here I'm just going to take
these two lines control C and control F
and just move them temporarily down here
and I'm just going to delete these extra
lines that are not needed so I will do
this and then this right there
all right good okay so now what we need
to do is create the X at the bottom part
so what we'll do here is this is going
to be slanted on a 45 degree angle as
well so hold shift left click there we
go and let's see here we what we want
this the way we want this to work is
that this right here extends all the way
up and meets on this line I'm going to
select both of them and move both here
so that this is right on that line right
there I'm going to take this and move it
up as well all right and then I actually
going to take both of those and do the
same thing because we want to go pass
just a little bit for the shape builder
tool to work correctly and then I'm
going to take another horizontal line
and put it right there control C ctrl F
hold shift and drag that down and make
sure this also intersects as well all
right so now at this point all we have
to do is take that shape builder tool so
we have to make sure this is selected
hold shift and select that bottom one
and then left-click alright so now we
can get rid of these pieces right there
all right and now at this point we can
get rid of the stroke if we wish and
give it a fill oops get rid of the
stroke and then select over here and
choose black and there we go
and so I what you would also do if
you're satisfied with this letter you
can go to window Pathfinder and make
sure you can unite these objects I right
here and or merge them and so this will
now give you one single layer select
both of them and that is it and so this
side will work really well for example I
let me move this over just copy that
real quick because of how its design
there's a lot of white space in between
it it's thick it'll work really well on
smaller sizes of course so you know if
you wanted to further go ahead and work
with this object to make more details in
it for example
I you could use these grid lines again
to do exactly that so for instance if
you wanted to take the let's take a
rectangle tool real quick and we'll make
this white for the fill and we'll start
off maybe two grids down and maybe start
maybe put in maybe right around there
take the direct selection tool and give
it that same 45-degree angle copy that
do the same thing to grid lines down or
that would honestly that would seem a
little bit redundant I make this further
if you wish and then leave it like that
let me move this over real quick and
then what you can do is take both of
these holding shift and just selecting
both and go to window Pathfinder and
clicking this - front
oops if we right-click and ungroup those
and then click - front now we can have a
transparent portion right here and then
that way if you wish I do to add or
create an actual font or more letters
you can you know follow that same sort
of strategy for the other letters
letters as well to create for
consistency I but yeah that is it so I'm
going to keep mine simple and just stick
to the real simple basics and I'm just
going to submit submit mine to that
contest or the challenge threads just
for the heck of it i but yeah hopefully
you learned you know how to use the grid
and how to line things up and use the
shape builder tool as well to create
tight alright so as always make sure you

YouTube because I'm putting out videos
consistently and I in addition to that
