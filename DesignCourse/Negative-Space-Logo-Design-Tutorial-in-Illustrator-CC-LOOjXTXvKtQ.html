today we're going to look at negative
space logo design and how you can kind
of practice to create your own so
negative space of course is the area
around a shape or design that has no
fill to it but you can create
interesting ideas in images and
illustrations out of this and it's
particularly effective when conveying
ideas and especially through delicate
design so I came up with a way to
quickly basically gain practice and
experience by designing a negative space
logo so I'm going to use a site called
random letter generator comm and I'm
going to pick two different random
letters and then immediately after the
letters picked I'm going to come up with
the first noun that I think of that
begins with that letter
and then I'll take that letter into
Adobe Illustrator and try to use that
letter to convey through negative space
the noun that I chose randomly alright
so I encourage you to follow along and
maybe do your own there's no project
files for this you have to worry about
that I'll be using Adobe Illustrator to
do this and as always check out these
nine course comm if you haven't yet
subscribe here on YouTube let's get
started alright so random letter
generator calm Here I am and to create
our first letter I can just I click this
and then I'll come up with the first
noun that comes to mind using that
letter a Apple oh god this is going to
be stupid alright so let's go to file
new eight sixty by six hundred control
one it goes down two percent I'm going
to do a capital and a lowercase a o
shift alright so I kind of have
immediate idea that could possibly work
I think so the goal here again is to use
the
negative space to come up with both in
Apple while still maintaining the shape
of an a so I think right away I'm going
to get rid of this capital right here
that's my wife out there being loud and
so I'm just going to duplicate that ctrl
C and ctrl F and you can experiment with
different fonts to give you different
shapes and possibly different ideas all
right so let's see here
some ridiculous fonts wanting to have
these alright if I use this and just
block this out real quick alright and
zoom up
and try to quickly create an apple here
they usually have this little but
looking thing err hold on let me see
keep on going we can fix this up this is
obviously a rough draft all right create
a stem maybe well I mean I think that's
the best I can come up with I'm right on
the spot I mean we could take the the
negative space from this circle here and
just make it into an apple so that's one
way that you could possibly approach
let's try this again now let's try this
process another time all right so I want
to move this down just a bit all right
so not too bad for you know just being
on the spot I'm going to try this again
gee Garden I'm making this harder myself
let's see here so all right G&amp;amp;G
all right so I'm going to keep this font
here control C and control F and maybe
just use try to come up with something
else
that might work that's already kind of a
cool idea I think I'll just leave this
here for now and keep going up so you
know when you think of a garden you
think of plants off its obviously we're
doing with this food concept here oh
well um garden garden using the negative
space see here I'm just going through
these hoping to spark an idea I think
I'm just going to enter right there
let's see let's take this so the idea of
a garden let's see here to help you come
up with ideas you can go to images
Google and just type in garden
okay so nothing really helped me there
um see see it's worth trying to look
outside of the letters and what type of
shapes are created from that so we have
like this little look like a mountain
type thing here and so the challenge is
of course coming up with something that
is relevant using the letter form you
know I came up with another idea with
this actually let me think here maybe if
I
pen tool
yeah let's see come up over here
hmm come on think think myself on the
spot look a ridiculous here no I think
that's good right there
connect that
and of course this is just a rough
drafts and other than I think is going
to be exactly perfect now what I want to
do is take a white
come on over here
now is this necessarily using the
negative space I'm not sure yet I mean
the leaf right here in and of itself may
not be I'm going to keep on doing this
working with us though actually what I
can do is take this copy that move this
down get rid of these points real quick
okay
that way we can see the full leaf a
little bit better and let's see what
else can I do you know what can be
construed here in the middle hmm okay so
right here I don't know why it reminds
me possibly of like a seed this leaf
possibly coming out of it so I'm going
to go here and type in a plant growing
or something
yeah this is kind of what I was looking
at or thinking of rather well that's
tiny it's a basic idea though let me see
if I can possibly illustrate that into
this leaf idea okay so this is going to
have to change a little bit so what I'm
going to do is come through here all
right and then come back there come back
like this I think and come back up here
of course this is just a rough draft so
you definitely want to play around with
making this these lines smooth and then
take this over here now I need to look
at the reference image a little bit more
just to kind of see what these things
look like when they're coming out the
plant leaf kind of just comes out of the
side of this yeah so I think I could
still illustrate that idea just kind of
going into this blindly I all right so
I'm going to take first let me take this
add an anchor point right here all right
and oops
okay and then take the black here and
let's kind of just continue on this line
or the stem maybe right around there and
for now yeah let's go out like that
hopping around like that does that look
like a seed oh let me see here let's
make this bigger
you kinda garden alright so one thing
I'll do is take this type out garden
here okay I had to pause my family was
being loud as always control-shift-n
oh uh yeah you know we could enter just
right here I see some possible
improvements that can be made but I
think we get the idea I can't help
myself though I kind of once you
slightly adjust this possibly because
usually when it comes to these seeds
take this and delete that actually
usually it could probably look better if
I wrapped it around like this but you
know I'm going to leave like that we get
the point I mean so basically a negative
space logo it's basically using the
space around in in around the form of it
could be a letter or not in our case
we're using letters um to to create
something that is relevant to the actual
company or business or idea so yeah that
is it
ah so basically check out design course
comm if you haven't yet and subscribe
here on YouTube I'll see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
