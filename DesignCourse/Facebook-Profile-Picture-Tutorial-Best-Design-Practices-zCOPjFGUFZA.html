today i'm going to be talking about a
160 by 160 pixel graphic known as the
facebook profile picture and this may
not seem like a big deal but i see a lot
of people in businesses especially
sometimes get the design of the profile
picture wrong and so the whole key is
simplicity contrast and a few other key
factors that i'm going to talk about in
this video all right so check out design
course comm if you haven't yet and
subscribe here on youtube alright so i'm
going to go to the design course
facebook page here and the profile image
is right here this also is known as the
cover photo and i'll do another video
sometime down the line regarding this
and probably also a full one where we
talk about doing a full i guess you
could say visual identity branding for
facebook which would encompass this and
this piece together but today we're just
gonna focus on this eye cover or not the
cover photo but the profile picture and
as we could see i this portion right
here the viewable dimensions are 160 by
160 and so i know this because i paused
and I loaded this up real quick
this is at the con time of recording
this these are the specifications and
now depending on how late or in the
future that you've watched this this
these details may have changed so it's
always a good idea to go to Google type
in facebook cover photo or facebook
profile picture dimensions and you'll
find the official Doc's here so as it
stands I this is displayed at 160 bytes
160 and the photo upload must be a
minimum of 180 by 180 in terms of size
so they'll scale it down to 160 by 160
whatever you upload so I you can upload
anything as long as it is a perfect
square that makes I the best results so
as you can see here the one that I chose
for my business which is design course
calm is the DC letter mark and this is
called a letter mark logo because this
is a D and this portion is a C and it
creates basically a unique symbol that's
not relevant to the business so I chose
it because in terms of a company's
visual identity I this is the most
simple and I would say relevant
depiction of the business visually so if
that makes that may not make too much
sense to you but I for instance think
about Nike for example when you think of
Nike what do you think of right off
immediately immediately at the top of
your head without any thought it's the
swoosh right for almost everybody it's
going to be that little swish mark and
so they put that thing basically in all
their display advertising you will see
that and that's because they want to
create a well they not want to they did
it created a very unique type of symbol
that people can immediately identify as
being Nike okay and so this is the same
approach that I've used here for design
course comm on my Facebook page and so
when it comes to like if you have a
business for example and you have a name
I and you have a logo you have to
determine you do you want to put the
full logo here do you want also the text
because if I go to design course comm
and I recently just change this up by
the way I you'll see that I have the
full logo so why didn't I just put the
full logo when we have a lot of space
right here in and of itself well the
reason being is look how small it gets
scaled down so that same picture that
you upload for the cover art for the
profile picture will be scaled down to
this size and it gets even smaller than
this and I'll show you where if we go
over here it even shows up smaller right
there with I all your pages so if you
were to have text in here chances are
you're not going to be able to to read
it it's going to be indiscernible and so
the most the the most common size that
people will see is in their feet
so this is the most common size and so
that same size can be seen over here
when you make a post like right here so
this is well I if you're going to have a
full name like it like if I turn to
stuff design course comm in there
it wouldn't be identifiable it'd be all
messed up and just ugly looking so I
real quickly just for the fun of it I'll
go ahead and critique I'm going to type
in some random business names or random
words and hopefully business pages will
appear i and i'll just critique a few
just so you can get an idea of what is
effective and what is not so i'll just
type in tool okay so tool they probably
have like an album cover I wasn't really
thinking of a tool set or whatever tool
room records they have some type of logo
design and also if you have a business
that's based around your name
putting your your physical photo of
yourself that's perfectly acceptable
because you are the brand in that sense
so that's fine I let me type in some
maybe ones that I some big name I type
ones like Adobe very simple you're going
to be able to discern exactly what this
is when you see it in your Facebook feed
candy crush saga that's kind of like an
icon that they have probably the
launcher icon I let me try to come up
with some other ones here I mean these
are all pretty decent although this one
I would say definitely kind of is not I
you look at it yeah you can read you
could see it when you view the full
image but I definitely wouldn't advise
against putting all this text in there
just because look at it looks like a big
crumbled mess you can time kind of tell
that it's a cat but when people are
scrolling through their Facebook feed
you know this becomes just kind of a
blur really so that's why you in the end
want to choose something that is simple
and so how do you create one all right
well I most of my regular subscribers
and followers here on YouTube I mean you
guys don't need to watch this because I
knowing how to save an image or whatever
that's 180 or 180 or whatever by 180 is
fine you guys know that off the top of
your heads already but this B might be
reaching people who never touch
Photoshop or illustrator so if you guys
have that access to the program I all
you do is just go to file new and I do
like to use at least 500 by 500 for the
profile picture reason being if someone
comes up to your page and they click on
this graphic right here it's nice just
to see a full size of it like this
otherwise if you click on this you're
going to get a tiny little image that's
in a size and it's just that doesn't
look good in my opinion so I like to use
500 by 500 and so very simple to specify
here in Photoshop pixels of course over
here 500 by 500 resolution 72 that's for
web and that's where we're using and
background contents you can by default
set up white I always have mine a
transparent and then put in whatever
you're going to be putting in in here
obviously and also pay attention to
other design I mean it shouldn't just
only be simplistic and relevant you
should also pay attention to all the
other important design aspects such as
contrast is there a lot of contrast too
like for mine yes you can see very clear
there's a dark blue background then I
kind of desaturate it a bit and the
white logo so there's a lot of contrast
you see that is there white space is
there margin and padding between
whatever type of object it is that you
have in here I a lot of people are new
designers least get that wrong like
there's a lot of designers for example
they would take this and they would kind
of like maybe put it way too close to
the edge and try to make it real big but
then you don't have a good solid white
space around it and that's bad for just
visibility so you do you know design
whatever you want in here and then just
save this file save as
I I like to do safer web and always save
as the actual PSD obviously if you have
everyone edit it jpgs fine PNG 24 or 8
is fine as well
I you know really have to worry about
quality or file size too much since
you're uploading it so just using a JPEG
and stick the quality of episode to 100
and then save it very very simple what
if you wanted to use illustrator like
say for example your logo you want to
use or you let them mark your icon or
whatever is in adobe illustrator file
well file new I specify pixels same
thing so like 500 by 500 and RGB because
we're not using print screen hit ok ctrl
or command one Mac and then do whatever
you're going to do in here and then you
can do the same thing file save for web
and this large window will show up here
and specify you know your JPEG settings
over here and save it and then of course
over here edit profile picture and
choose from photos and you my friend are
done so that is how you make an
effective prop I was going to say cover
photo again no profile picture for your
facebook business page alright so I know
that wasn't a very exciting tutorial for
most of my followers but I I was busy
today I was busy doing this I just
changed everything up here and this is
going to be loud if I click it I know I
go ahead and check it out though the
video at least something I launched I'm
getting ready to launch the premium
course or subscription service rather
which includes both of these projects
but yeah these pages don't exist yet so
you just click on it and nothing happens
I'm going to be getting these knocked
out very shortly but yeah check out the
forms at design course com go ahead and
I female viagra introduce yourself in
the forums I tried to make it a point to
respond and say hi to everybody
and yes free of course so anyhow I I'm
doing a video tutorial or I'm tempting
to do a video tutorial day of the year
of 2014
today is May 15th I have no clue how
many videos that is it's like 140 or
something and that's how many days we've
had so I've been pumping is out like a
crack addict but yeah we have fun so
