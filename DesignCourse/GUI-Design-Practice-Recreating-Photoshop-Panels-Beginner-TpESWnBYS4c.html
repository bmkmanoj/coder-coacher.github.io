calm today we're going to have a quick
video tutorial and we're going to focus
on graphic user interface or GUI design
techniques and we're going to step into
adobe photoshop and actually try to
recreate some of the adobe photoshop
panels with photoshop layer styles so if
you need access to the project files
which will include all the layers with
their predefined layer styles they're
available for free design course calm
always have to do is just login and
register real quick it's free and also
if you haven't yet subscribe here on
youtube and check out the site alright
let's get started alright so let's go
ahead and go to file new and i'm just
going to choose a width and height that
kind of fits in this area I for me it
happens to be 8 60 x 600 and hit control
one just to go a hundred percent and I'm
going to fill in the background here
with a white and basically I want to get
a screenshot specifically of this
interface area so that I can grab the
color code so all I have to do is I hit
alt and print screen to do that here on
Windows and just ctrl-v to paste that in
so I'm not going to be recreating the
entire interface but just the basic
elements mainly the panels that kind of
contain the different buttons I so
there's actually some detail in there
and they're all around just one pixel so
what I want to do is first get the
eyedropper to get this background color
right here and then switch this over and
I also want to get this color right here
alright so that's basically like a 1
pixel stroke outline on most of the
panels so now I'm going to take the
rounded rectangle tool and I'm going to
make the border radius 2 because I you
can see right up here at the very corner
there's a slight border radius and I'm
going to hit control one just to get
back two hundred percent
and then just hold all and left click
and drag out all right so the actual
color of this needs to be yeah that's
the right color I and then the actual
panels stroke we double click over here
click on stroke make that one pixels for
the size and then color here and grab
this color hit okay and there is also a
very faint I'll show you actually leave
it there and just bring it up right
around here we can see both this top
here and in here we see a I a light
basically inner shadow and so this
colors a little bit less light than this
one so I'm going to flip this over and
get this as well all right and I'll
switch them back all right so now I'm
going to get control one and hide that
I'm going to double click over here and
I'm going to choose inner shadow and we
can see it right there and I'm going to
make the blend mode normal make the
opacity 100 make the size zero and
distance 1 i'm also going to change the
angle to 90 alright and then the actual
color will be right here hit OK and ok
so it's probably hard to see on this
video but we can zoom up we can see
we've recreated that as we need to all
right so now what I want to do is take
this and duplicate it so right-click you
could duplicate the later I have a
shortcut key set up control shift + D
and I'm going to hit ctrl T and
basically put one in here right around
there select the move tool and hit apply
and now we can see it inside there and
it's much easier now to see this I the
details here and now if we double-click
on inner shadow we can give it this one
the lighter one which is down here for
the color so it slightly makes a little
a little bit brighter stand out
are all right so I recreating these
other elements is I kind of interesting
because if we see over here we see it's
very fine detail over here and over here
which just signifies that you can grab
it it's actually if you zoom up very
simple all they are is basically just
two different colors and they're working
with just single pixels here so we hit
control 1 hide that we can recreate that
very simply and we could do it in a
smart way by using the stroke so first
I'll just make my own kind of design a
lot going to follow there's I what we
could do is make that color that color
it there and to know whether or not
we're at a single post this is actually
two pixels so if a ctrl T bring it in
there's one pixel and then if I double
click on this and I give it actually a
smarter way real quickly would be to
right click this layer copy layer style
right click and then paste layer style
then come over here remove that stroke
and the inner shadow we don't want it to
be inner we want to be outer or drop
shadow rather so that really didn't save
me time they're usually it does so I'm
going to hit 0 here one here 90 here and
then I'll grab maybe this color right
there hit OK and then go ahead and
duplicate that just drop it down to
pixels all right and now we can see
we've recreated this thing over here in
which you can basically move around
however you wish and we could also
duplicate that again and hit ctrl T hold
shift and scale it up and down
vertically
you can see we have the same sort of
little thing here so these are just you
know just some ways to practice I with
user interface design and let me go
ahead and take those again put those
over here let's try to recreate this
area over here real quick so basically
we can take this layer right here
duplicate it ctrl T it apply ctrl H get
rid of the bounding view there zoom up
here just a bit ctrl T will move this up
apply and what we do now is get rid well
now I think we'll leave it there what I
want to do is change the actual color
and that's good right there and then
also the inner shadow I want to change
that to be less visible all right and
then of course
we can always make these simple things
right here I'm just submit messing with
the size real quick as you see very
simple I'm going to go ahead and select
these four up here just move them over
here then we could all see even put on
an experiment with adding the menus up
here and I already experimented with the
type of font that you need that I'm just
choosing Ariel and for anti-aliasing I'm
choose none spread these out a little
bit further you can also do things like
you know once you create the layer
styles for these you know recreating
them to do other things it's very simple
so I may find this over here we could do
is come underneath this area let's put
these at the top and maybe show what it
looks like when a person has clicked on
one of these all right and then also do
another one
and take both of those control e and
then right-click actually this one yeah
i'm just going to paste that layer style
whatever you had before we can see that
it works pretty well and that is
basically it i mean that's what you
would do as you can see when it comes to
recreating an interface it gives you
good practice not obviously to steal but
obviously just so you gain an
understanding of how to use layer styles
and all that so i'm going to end this
video here is just a very quick tutorial
the past two days have been so insanely
busy Evan I've recording and finishing
my monthly video course that I do for a
different network finally finish that
today but I my throat is killing me from
talking so much so yeah that is it
hopefully you learned a little something
here about you know just a ways to use
those layer styles in order to create
very specific effects usually people use
like you know inner shadows and stuff
for like really blurry but you can just
really use this the size and the
distance to really affect them in a much
different way then what's usually done
with them alright so if you haven't yet
check out design course calm I just
launched some forms there go ahead and
introduce yourself and subscribe here on
YouTube alright I will see you tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
