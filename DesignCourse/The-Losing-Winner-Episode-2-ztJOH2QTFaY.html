completed design contests where we try
to figure out something very important
what the hell were they thinking hello
Gary Simon here of design course calm
and welcome to episode 2 of the losing
winner where we'll delve into the solace
practice of design crowdsourcing alright
let's get started here first we have 40
is this person 12 hundred dollars and
eighty one designs were submitted from
25 designers and wholly metallic Batman
what the hell is happening here between
the various hand tools depicted in the
intense gradients I feel as though I'm
looking at my father's tool shed from
behind half-open window blinds this is
not how you use gradients and a logo
design and this is certainly not how you
depicts symbolism in a logo design
trying to literally depict and convey
every aspect of a business is exactly
how you get people not to remember your
brand simplicity and being unique is
what you should strive for as a logo
designer let's look at some of the other
losers this one much better for obvious
reasons this one even though it's not
great and the type could definitely use
some work if we look at them both are
definitely better than this abomination
let's take a look at our second project
q a scientific this person 11 hundred
sixty dollars 33 logo designs were
submitted from 19 designers the obvious
problem here is the type in that their
copy of illustrator apparently expired
and to resort to using ms word to finish
the rest of the logo but it's even worse
than that perhaps it was in a fit of
rage during a drunken stupor this
designer didn't even bother changing the
default Times New Roman font in all
seriousness this looks lazy and slapped
together yet they won let's look at some
of the other losers this one yep loser
this one even knows some issues in terms
of clutter they're both superior to the
winning design so you guys just wasted
your time completely alright so let's
look at ALS this guy won a hundred sixty
dollars and thirty-two designs were
submitted from 15 designers now I've
saved the best for last now upon first
glance you're really not sure what to
make of it between the Sprague run and
the orange reindeer antlers you're left
wondering if this company has something
to do with using
ten psychotropic drugs while hunting I'm
not going to install any of my viewers
intelligence by talking about why this
logo is bad instead I'll show you some
other terrible entries there are still
1,000 times better than this thing in
front of us take this one the whole side
swooshing arch logo approached about
415,000 company use a similar iteration
but still this is far superior than the
first or take this entry now if you know
anything about design contest you'll
know that you have at least five asshole
designers who submit this exact concept
with the arch going through the center
of the business initials thing yes even
this one is still better than the
winning design or how about this entry
this guy he just said fuck it I'm not
even going to bother changing the
template to reflect a business name I'm
just going to straight-up submit this
template and yes even this one is still
better than the winning design even to
the point at which i would say it would
be wiser for the business owner to
change your name from ALS to company
name just so they could use this logo
and not have to slap this abomination as
the visual representation of their
business uh and that is it for this week
hopefully you've come out more as a wise
designer and decide not to waste your
time by submitting to these god-awful
design contests have some dignity now as
always I'm Gary Simon of design course
