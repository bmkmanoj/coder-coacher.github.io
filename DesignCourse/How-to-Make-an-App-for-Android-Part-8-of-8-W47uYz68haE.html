what we're gonna do is I take out I'm
Java and double click on main and this
is where we specified our font change
just underneath it we want to paste the
following so troll V to paste set class
to import hit OK and that is it so I'm
gonna attempt to make sure I link these
somewhere in description or near this
video so that you can just paste it in I
so basically I'm not going to explain
every single thing that's happening here
but just the general idea of what's
happening I you know in this block of
code essentially what we're doing is
we're taking first of all when you have
red areas like this you need to make
these so that they're reflecting the
actual variables or the names of the the
textview for example so this is not
correct the ID of our textview is
actually called textview and so it paste
that in there and result view we're
going to put a new line up here just
after this portion right here and call
this declare it as a textview so text
view result view all right and then that
redness goes away and then get data is
called to a function that we have to
create afterwards so we'll worry about
that in a second and then i put a
comment here for button stuff so i the
buttons ID is button for our button that
we click and it says insert set
onclicklistener and that basically says
listen to or whatever goes in here go
ahead and execute what's inside of here
get data so you see we have get data
running twice so the first time the
phone loads up I this part's gonna get
run this isn't because the button hasn't
been clicked so I when someone clicks
the button it's going to going to run
the same function again so and again
that function is basically going to
connect to the database and it's going
to run that PHP file in order
to grab that quote basically it's
getting the output of that PHP file
so hopefully that all in all kind of
makes sense it's not necessary that you
understand exactly what's going on with
each line at this point especially if
you're a beginner so before we get to
the get data and setting that up we need
to set up a permissions in our Android
manifest and so basically right here
just above application we need to put in
uses - permission so we'll click on that
Android name and we want to specify
internet right here and close that up
very simple all right so let's go back
to our main Java file and now what we
need to do is come down here and we're
going to paste in just underneath this
portion right here the closing the final
bracket here what we need to do is I
pasted in quite a lengthy amount of code
so I'm gonna try to remember to also you
know get that something so that you can
paste that in add it as an annotation or
a link that you can access and just
coffee so I'm gonna go ahead and paste
that in right here see we have a bunch
of red lines over the place but see
basically it's saying public void get
data so we just named it right here and
it's being referenced up here no longer
is it red because now we've created it
down here so it's just real quick
alright so if you alt left on one second
here so you hover over and hit alt enter
and I'll enter and keep on doing this a
bunch of times
let's see here that's one second here
and we're eventually getting pretty
close to where we're getting all rid of
those by hitting all enter so now it
should basically look like this so over
here the part that I so basically what I
mean what this is doing is saying try
and then catch try means you know it's
trying to actually give this code if it
doesn't work then you know give us some
type of information about how you know
why didn't work so where it says result
view which is declared up here which is
our text view the big the large text
that we have in the center it's saying
if it doesn't connect then it's gonna
say in that text I field could not
connect connect to the database so this
what this does is it all this code is a
connect stand attempts to get this
information here and then try and
there's another trying catch and this
basically never changes here like
whenever you're trying to pull
information from a PHP file this code
remains the same so I'm not gonna try to
explain all of it basically all right
here's as a result equals SB to string
so result is the variable that's created
that will contain the quote another
catch over here error converting result
and then finally one more try and result
view that's referencing our our result
or a text view that's in the center of
the app set text result and result right
here is declared right there so it's
setting the result from this up here all
right so hopefully that kind of makes
sense then if it doesn't work for some
reason couldn't set text damn it okay
all right so hopefully at this point I
should be just about it what I did just
did now is hit play and I launched it on
the phone and guess what it worked
surprisingly usually you run into a
bunch of issues but now I ran through
this beforehand so that it wasn't the
case written usually if you're starting
from scratch yeah you'll run into issue
so expect that to happen now one thing I
did notice is I do need to make one
change on a layout here for activity
main let's see here I may actually want
to bring the center vertical back sorry
about that
save that and I'm gonna launch it again
just to be sure it worked properly and
just on pause and unfortunately that
didn't have much of an effect so what I
did was I I pulled this down so that
when I brought it down we could see this
green arrow current going across the
center that's what ultimately helped and
and I once I Ryan it ran it now it's
pretty much perfectly in the center
between quote fuel and this button and
yeah everything works so you click on
the button and it shows up and ask
exactly what we want
alright so another thing that I wanted
to do is you know when you tilt your
phone it will automatically switch to
the portrait mode I you can do the same
thing right here and it will kind of
emulate that just the way it looked I
didn't really liked it so if you ever
want to force a particular screen
orientation whether it be portrait or I
the wise in coming to my landscape sorry
I you can go into Android manifest and
under activity for splash in main we're
just worried about main you can put in
two areas - two lines Android screen
orientation equals portrait and then set
Android config changes orientation
keyboard hidden you do that and save and
hit play you'll see that the screen
orientation cannot be changed from
portrait even if you slant the phone all
right so that's just a quick tip right
there alright so that's it
check out design course comm if you
haven't yet and check out the youtube
channel which is designed course.com
slash user slash design course
and also most importantly I definitely
check out design course comm slash
premium and that is the service which I
trained you one-on-one through design
course mentor how to become a better
designer I also have other products here
I'm going to be adding more in the
future this is a visual identity design
