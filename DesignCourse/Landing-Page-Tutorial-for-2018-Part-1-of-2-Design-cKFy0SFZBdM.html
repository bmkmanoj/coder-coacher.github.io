ro welcome to the very first tutorial of
2018 for the corsetry channel and today
we're gonna be focusing on designing a
landing page and I'm gonna show you my
process and what's also cool is the fact
that this landing page we're gonna be
designing is for a personal project that
I have high hopes for and it's based on
a crypto currency project so what is a
landing page well first a landing page
is basically any page in which your
users will land on and it depends on you
know whatever type of project you have
regardless to the type of project it has
to have a goal you have to have an
objective for that page and so in my
context is going to be a web-based app
that I want people to click on a button
and ultimately create an account so they
can use this app essentially so I'm just
gonna walk you through my process I'm
gonna be using Adobe experience design
however you can use anything that you
really want so first let me switch over
to the desktop and I'll show you the
actual app that I've been working on
here so this is just basically in an app
I'm calling it Crips CR y pts actually I
showed you how I design the logo in one
of my previous videos and this is just
basically taking the concept of
cryptocurrency real-time charts as seen
here I'm gonna have more information
though this is still very much in
development and then with combining it
with basically you know real-time chat
right here so I that is the purpose of
this app and so what we have to ask
ourselves as designers slash developers
is how can we get people to use this app
or as many people as possible and that
of course is by designing an effective
landing page alright so just to show you
something real quick as you can see here
I swear a lot some some some one which
was just really myself how to use a name
of right there ah so let me show
you what happens when we we ban one well
look at that I know it's so silly
anyhow so let's go ahead and actually
design a landing page for this app and
I'm gonna show you how I do it so oh but
real quick before we begin make sure you
check out my site course cetera comm
where you're gonna find a bunch of
courses on modern design and development
a lot are free and others you can access
for the cost of buying me like a six
pack each month that's it
now also it probably wouldn't hurt to
subscribe here on YouTube and be sure to
make sure the notifications are turned
on alright let's get back to it
here I have Adobe XD or experience
design up and by the way let me just
show you real quickly the very you know
the beginning step is to actually load
up XD and choose web 1920 because I'm
going to I'm going to do a web based
approach for the layout here at least
initially and right here I have the logo
already set up along with three of these
icons he scripted currency icons that
we're gonna be using in the actual
landing page I just wanted to have them
ready to go I will make this file
available for you to download however so
you can start with me also I'm a big big
advocate if you're trying to learn how
to do something instead of just sitting
there watching on YouTube you should
also follow along especially you know if
you're really wanting to become a better
designer actually physically going
through the steps helps kind of ingrain
in your memory much better alright so
for this landing page I said like I said
I have one goal and that is just to get
people to click on a button in order to
join the chat which will load up you
know some type of login system but we're
not going to focus on that we're just
gonna have that call to action and so
your landing page really needs two most
effective landing pages the least they
consist of a few elements first is a
headline you know some type of very
catchy title that kind of informs them
instantly of kind of at least what this
this whole website is about or this
landing page a sub headline where you
can go into a little bit more detail and
then a call to action of some sort so
we're gonna have those three elements
plus some sort of very unique sort of
illustration or graphic that's relevant
to this service alright so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
change the background I really like
light gray if we're gonna go for a
lighter or you can use dark gray if you
wish I'm just going to go on the lighter
side of EB EB EB alright and this type
of landing page I'm gonna use is very
simple it's not gonna be very content
heavy so I'm gonna have everything kind
of just there's gonna be a ton of
padding around at least in a desktop
version so I'm gonna put the logo stay
right around here and this right here
again when it comes to design in general
there's not many things that you can do
that are absolutely wrong you know a lot
of things are subjective one of the
first things I usually ask myself though
is you know do I want to have anything
in the background do we want just a flat
color do we want a gradient do we want
some type of maybe a watermark in the
background and so the idea that I had is
when it comes to cryptocurrency charts
for instance like this over here this is
called a candlestick chart and these are
very popular and a lot of people who are
involved in crypto currency and stock
trading in general understand what these
are what I want to do is kind of have a
chart in the background as a watermark
so let me just show you how I would
recreate that here in XD so just going
to use the rectangle tool and just drag
out something right around this size I
don't want a border I do want to fill
however because we're using a watermark
and this is gonna be really just like a
an afterthought a secondary you know
element we want it not to have a lot of
contrast in comparison or in contrast to
the background itself so if I take the
background color right here and go
slightly darker like around da da da
then I think that will be good now you
could see it just enough to will to
where you understand what it is but it's
not going to take away from the
important stuff which is the foreground
elements so I I'm going to show you a
real cool thing if you've never seen xD
Doby experience design before but first
I want to add like a bottom little
candlestick sort of thing all right I'm
gonna make this the same color as well
all right that looks good so what I'll
do now is I'm going to situate this
right over here to the lower left and
we're going to use the repeat grid tool
and so with both of those selected I can
hit repeat grid and then drag this out
all the way to the right now I want to
increase the spacing just a little bit
between them right there looks good
okay now this next step is kind of
tedious and because of that I will speed
up the the video momentarily but I just
wanted to show you how we're gonna
adjust this make custom adjustments to
each one of these before I do that so
I'm gonna ungroup them and now ya the
general concept by the way of what I
wanted to do is to make it kind of start
out low and then it's gonna grow all the
way to the right that gets people
excited when it comes to these type of
things so I'm going to let's see here
we'll take these I let see these initial
ones right here and by the way these are
each a group so I'm gonna take these
initial ones over here and just ungroup
them alright because the repeat grid
tool will group those up take these
initial ones I'm gonna scale them down
and now what I want to do is just make
adjustments so the way Candlestick
charts kind of work is this is based on
a period of time like a minute for
instance and then this is the next
minute it'll start from wherever the
other one went off either whether or not
it's going down
up in price or down in price and so
these initial ones I'll just kind of
make like that and of course we're gonna
have to adjust the lines underneath them
too
match the bottom so for instance take
this take this
and so I'm gonna do this all the way to
the very end and I'm going to increase
you know the direct that trajectory if I
could talk right as I go along to the
right alright so I'm going to go ahead
and pause as I go through all these and
do this actually I'm not going to pause
I'm just going to pry speed up the video
okay so I know technically the anta
which that I have here are only going in
one direction
I have Skyy popping up but really just a
minor detail so now what I want to do at
this point shut the hell up please okay
is I let's go ahead and get rid of that
is hit ctrl G and I will group them all
up and then I'll get out the layers here
rather right there and with that
selected we'll go ahead and just lock
this because I don't want to adjust it
anymore I don't want to mess with it by
accident so we'll lock it right there
okay so now let's go ahead and integrate
or create a headline something that will
really draw the users attention to
usually on the upper left or centered in
the middle and it's you know larger than
the rest of the elements and text on on
the page for the most part at least and
it informs the user in some unique way
so what I'm going to do is just kind of
do a little bit of equation so I'm gonna
say crypto plus chat which are really
the two foundational elements of what my
service is about equals Kryptos or
crypts rather that's the name of the
service so crypto currency plus chat
real-time chat is this service you know
I it could be better
the way to really find out is to do
split testing when you launch the site
to see you know which iteration of the
headline a sub-headline the
call-to-action copy and anything else
would really result in the most signups
that's what all you can really do at
first is just a guess on what would be
effective so I'm gonna use a font called
Mont Surat monster I have no clue how to
pronounce that it's free though you can
google it and download it we're gonna
make it bold alright I'm going to make
it black and make it larger maybe I'm
gonna make it semi bold I don't want it
to really contrast too much or not
contrast but you know equal the same
with too much of the
logo so maybe semi bold and maybe not
quite black maybe just writing around 5
3 5 3 5 3 next gonna have a sub-headline
underneath and let's draw out some space
here and this I'm gonna do I'm just
gonna left click and do like an area
sort of copy here and this is gonna be
the sub sub headline so I can elaborate
a little bit more on what this is so
when it comes to good ad copy or landing
page copy you want to emphasize benefits
rather than features for the most part
so I'm gonna put slack meets real-time
crypto currency charts now is that a
benefit or a feature it's probably a
feature but that's all I came up with so
far I will probably adjust this more so
in the end so let's see here our medium
I think let's see here so we want to
create enough of a contrast either
through size and weight and color to
really make these two elements
discernible from each other and make
them easy to read so in terms of visual
hierarchy we can see first we sort of
have Crips such as the the branding via
the logo the identity of the service
then we have this right here which is
the headline it's more important than
our sub headline and this is all
reinforced through font size spacing
positioning color etc alright I think
that's pretty good I think I'm gonna
make this instead of medium maybe just
regular alright and then we're gonna
have a call-to-action button right here
I'll say right around that size we don't
need a border I'm gonna make this I
think like a a blueish color let's see
right around there seems pretty good I
think yeah that works well
all right so inside of here I'm gonna
have some copy so this is gonna be our
call to action which is a button join up
or sign in let's make that white for the
most contrast all right get it over here
well now we'll put it right here so
we'll give it a little bit of a border
radius by left-clicking and dragging
those little angles right there and then
I'm by the way I think I want to make
this just a tad bit smaller but we'll
make it
semi bold okay and I'm going to zoom up
and just put an icon right here and
we'll use the pen tool and hold shift
and just make a triangle hi to the
border give it a white fill and we want
to Center it between the left of this
button and the beginning of this text
all right
that's looking pretty good right there
okay so this bakes a question what goes
over here by the way you could also
position this layout differently than I
did it doesn't have to be you know two
column side-by-side sort of arrangement
you could for instance you know take
this over here maybe or if you have a
toolbar at the top you could just put it
in a traditional kind of like a header
navigation area you could just do this
Center all this stuff up and then have
some sort of illustration down here
really it's up to you and ultimately the
the answer comes through split testing
and understanding how that all of that
works effectively so right here I'm
gonna have like a illustration of sorts
and I'm still gonna I'm gonna you could
do it for instance with Illustrator or
any of your other favorite vector
applications however Adobe XD does have
decent basic tools where you can do this
you do a lot of work essentially
completely in this this app here so what
I wanted to do here was kind of give
them a visual representation not a
literal one I don't want to take a
screenshot of this interface but I
wanted to kind of recreate it in a
simple vectorized fashion so I want to
illustrate to them that this is damn
that's just one up high I've that's pick
one for you
I just wanted to illustrate that there
are charts here on one part of the
interface and there is chats here on
this part of the interface and I want to
do this in a very simplified sort of
abstract manner so I'm gonna have an
actual let's see what do you call a
monitor right here and I'm going to
recreate that interface in a very
simplified manner and then even have
some little chapped lips using these
three icons up here so the first thing
I'm going to put on it is a actual
monitor so I'm just gonna left click and
drag out an area mmm I'll say roughly
right around here we'll go ahead and get
rid actually no I'm gonna keep a stroke
here and that way we can really make it
stand out because I plan on having it be
mainly white and so there's not enough
contrast without it to really make it
stand out so we're going to add a border
and I'm gonna make it three for a stroke
and then also we'll go ahead and pull
this in just slightly so I have a net
basically that's sixteen by nine sort of
monitor resolution I'm also going to do
a stand down here so I'm just gonna hit
control D to replicate that and just
move it down while holding shift will
drag this in will say roughly around
here we're gonna make it completely
normal coroner's hold alt drag this in
maybe up a little bit more and let's see
we'll make the fill color get the
eyedropper all right the same right
there
and then I'll do one more so we'll take
it ctrl D drag it down and then I'm
gonna hold alt and scroll wheel to zoom
up and then hold alt and scale out
alright that looks pretty good right
there
you know what I might want to make this
color a little bit darker for the fill
and the border so what I'll do is come
right around here
forró forró forró add that as a
swatch and then choose that real quickly
all right and finally here all right
awesome so I'm just going to move this
into place a little bit more see what
this looks like
zoomed out by the way I can move
everything else down more in Center
there we go and then um let's see what
else you know what I'm gonna make the
background of everything here just a
little bit lighter it's coming in just a
tad bit too dark there we go so it's f4
f4 f4 okay so now the goal is to take
this and create sort of I like I said an
abstract representation inside of this
monitor here okay so what I'm gonna do
at least initially I'm gonna bump this
up probably writing around there but I'm
not going to be keeping it quite that
bold it'll go back to three but I just
want to have some white space between
the interface elements in the outer
right here so the first element that we
have is this sidebar this black sidebar
and that's going to be the only part of
that sidebar that I actually decide to
you know place or depict in this
interface I'm not going to add the
individual icons in the middle it just
become a little bit too busy again we
want this to be simple for the look that
we're
for and so I'll just use that and then
we also have this middle area I'm not
gonna have well I just keep looking at
this username I'm not going to have this
little sidebar for the users area
because that is actually collapsible so
I'm just gonna have this section and we
can see it's lighter so you may just
keep that white so I'm not gonna put
something there I'm just gonna do this
section right here for this panel and so
what I'll do is duplicate that control D
and drag it out right there and then
make it light maybe like that well
that's fine for now we're not going to
see this part we're gonna see the fact
that this is orbital overlapping a
little bit next we'll have and by the
way it's not really 50 percents more
like over here there's a little bit more
room dedicated to the chat so next we'll
have let's see here we have a chat bar
the actual input area down here oh by
the way check this out cool stuff huh
I stole that from Facebook by the way
there's gonna be a lot more um emoticon
it's not just two of them so let's go
ahead and do that little chat area down
here no stroke give it a fill probably
the same color right here and then I'll
also give it a border radius and then
I'm gonna duplicate it just for that
little area where it had those little
user reactions something like that
alright and then also the individual
chat messages how would I Ella straight
that in a simplified manner well it's
very very simple again we want it to be
simple so at this point by the way we
can go ahead and get this back to three
oh I hate when it does that just take it
down to three this way for some reason
if I hit three there it affects the
opacity which we don't want
all right so looking at this so far so
good
alright let's go ahead and do this
little individual chat clip elements I'm
just gonna take this one and duplicate
it we're not gonna make it as thick but
there'll be just varying degrees of this
so we can repeat this as a repeat grid
vertically like that and then ungroup it
and then we could just adjust these to
varying sizes to represent chat messages
so again it's really simple stuff like
that alright next I just want to have a
very simple representation of the the
candlestick chart the the graph which
shows up over here in this area so it's
gonna be the same process almost as
these the background process but nowhere
near as many of them so I'm just to save
myself time I'll duplicate that we'll go
ahead and make this um like a desaturate
a green almost maybe like that so that's
6/8 EAD if you're following along I'll
rotate it 90 degrees all right we'll
start one here oh let's just do a repeat
grid make your life easier be something
right around here okay that's fine
ungroup it and now let's make our
individual adjustments so by the way let
me just take everything here start it
down a little bit lower
alright so it there I'm not gonna pause
because this will go by pretty quickly
we're gonna need one for when you need a
red color for the negative so that's
pretty good ie 1 8 8 8 8
all right yeah we'll go back up here
almost done we'll make this one red I
should have added these as swatches save
myself a little bit of time not a big
deal though
and finally rate here all right that's
sweet so let's see what this looks like
at this point I'm gonna move it over
just a tad bit more I think so around
there all right and then finally one of
the last elements we'll be creating a
little chat messages like I mentioned
before so I'm going to give this the
same stroke so if I double click in here
because this is a part of a group we'll
see the border and the border will be
this color and it's 3 pixels it's what
we want and then I'm going to create a
little chat area so a little like kind
of like a chat container message blip
thing if you know what I mean
let's go up to 3 again keeping the same
aesthetic across now we're going to zoom
up all right and I'm going to use the
pen tool I'm gonna left click left click
here
drag out to create a Bezier curve and
then come back like that I think that's
good right there
all right so now what we can do I'm
gonna take both of these holding shift
so both of these layers are selected and
we can see this up here we have these
little path tools we're gonna choose add
tada awesome stuff so now it's all part
of the same path oh you know what before
I do that I'm gonna back up I want these
to be rounded so we'll say right around
here so now we can do that BAM
awesome so now we're gonna put some text
in it and this is gonna be simple text
something like let's see here
should I sell the text is white so
that's why we can't see it so let's go
ahead and yeah right around the mid gray
will work alright let's see what this
looks like so far I think that's a
little bit too big so if I take both of
these and well I could scale them down
this way
holding shift when you do this yeah it
does actually yeah sometimes when you do
this it will mess up the alignment of
the text in relation to the path so you
can always just make adjustments if you
need to to the path itself or the size
or location of the of the type all right
so that one's good I would say right
here you move it a little bit closer and
then well take the same process and
repeat it two more times so now I want
to go there let's go ahead and bring
this one right here I'm gonna take this
and just both of those hit ctrl D will
put let's see here we're gonna take both
of these here and put them like right
there I don't really want it to cover
too much of anything that's important in
this section so this one I'll make it
say it's mooning that's a lingo for
crypto trading and stuff like that again
we need to get the border on this all
right and then finally this one right
here I'm gonna stick this one I think
like right here we'll get that stroke on
there
duplicate these guys will put this one
right here this one I'm gonna make a
little bit different maybe a little bit
more lines of text we need to stop the
bud okay fear uncertainty and doubt okay
so now we have to make adjustments to
this container and this is fairly simple
so if I go down right there I double
click on this and double click again
we'll have access to the anchor point so
I'm just gonna hold shift to select all
four move up and that looks pretty good
right there all right I like that this
is a pretty solid in my opinion so this
is it for the actual landing page I'm
gonna have now I am going to take this
and export them as SVG files and export
these individually and that way I can
use CSS to animate these on top of this
little monitor section so I'm going to
do another video where we take all this
right here and get it up into HTML CSS
and export the assets as you can see
right here and do that animation that I
was talking about so look out for that
video real soon
if you're watching this in the future
its done already so just check out the
channel and you'll find that video
alright see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
