calm today is February 13th and we're
going to focus on creating a protein
product display in blender and Photoshop
so this is going to be a two-part video
tutorial today we're just going to focus
on the modeling aspect and blender and
then tomorrow we're gonna create the
label in Photoshop and get it all ready
and working and blender alright so if
you haven't yet check out design course
calm and subscribe here on YouTube
alright let's get started alright so a
quick rundown if you've never used
blender before to select objects you
just right click them and it's not left
and then hold shift if you want to
select multiple if you want to rotate
around the 3d view you just use your
middle mouse button to zoom up you use
your scroll wheel and then to pan you
just hold shift and use your middle
mouse button pretty easy so I'm gonna
file new and just reload startup file so
we're all looking at the same thing and
so by default we just want to get rid of
this cube so hit the Delete key and
select delete and then we're gonna go to
shift a which really is just a shortcut
for add so shift a mesh and cylinder so
obviously this the the shape of our
protein container is going to be a
cylinder very simple so I what we have
to do here is basically to get into
right now an object mode that's a
default mode that's where you select
move object scale etc to if we wanted to
actually edit this thing we have to go
to edit mode so you can on here click on
edit and you can switch back and forth
by just hitting tab between those two
modes
alright so real quick you have three
different modes or ways to interact with
objects that's the vertex that's the
edge and the face and so each one allows
you to kind of manipulate whatever you
want to so I what I'm gonna do real
quickly is just turn on smooth shading
make sure everything's selected and do
that you hit a and that will select all
or select none so make sure it's all
selected and highlighted and for shading
we're going to choose smooth and then
we're also going to come out here
pull this out we're gonna click on the
object modifiers add modifier
subdivisions surface all right so this
is what happens like what the hell is
that doing well if we increased the
subdivisions and render I'm going to put
them both at 3 I'm gonna hit ctrl R and
that adds an edge loop kind of like up
here
these are edge loops so all I have to do
is left click and then it allows you to
specify where you want it so I'm just
gonna put it pretty close to the top and
ctrl R and do another one pretty close
to the bottom and then what we want to
do is take the way you can select an
edge and then or there all the edges
around you hold the Alt key and right
click pretty simple so normally if you
just right clicked you'd only select
individual edges here but if you hold
all and right click you got all of it
all right so now what I want to do is
extrude it so the way you do that is hit
E pretty simple and it has it basically
on the z axis that's the only way we can
move it so I'm just going to put it up
here and I'm gonna hit 5 on the number
pad and that takes us from perspective
mode to orthographic which makes it a
little bit easier to select edges when
we need to so I'm going to hit 1 that'll
give us on the number pad that is
they'll give us the front view and I'm
gonna hit a to deselect it and then I'm
going to hit B but first come down here
before you do that and click on this
because if we went right now just hit B
and then selected all these edges it
would only select the ones that are
visible from the front view so if we hit
a just to deselect and turn this on and
hit B which is basically you know as a
selection tool it selects all of them
and that's what we want so now what we
want to do is hit the Delete key and
we're gonna put hit our delete
nope not vs.
Edge's all right so now we got these two
different these two can separate pieces
but they're still part of the same
object so I'm gonna hit I'm gonna go to
one or on the number pad in front view B
select it hit P on your keyboard and
that allows you to separate selection so
click that now if we go into tab mode
these are two different objects all
right so this is gonna actually serve
for our lid all right so with that
selected hit tab to go into edit mode
and I'm gonna go back to well we're if
you want to go to the front mode you can
I I'm just gonna go like this just
slightly and I'm going to select
everything alright and then hit e to
extrude and I'm gonna extrude raw right
around here this is the basically the
height that I want the cap to be and
then hit ctrl R put one right down there
ctrl R and one like right up here
alright
so far so good
I also kind of want to add like a little
edge right here so ctrl R left click
maybe right around there ctrl R right
around there and then ctrl R one in the
middle and then hit s to scale that in
just a little bit all right cool all
right so now I also let's go back to tab
out select this other one we're going to
tab into that and with yeah we're in
edge mode alt right click go to hit E
and then just I click once don't even
move it and then hit ask to scale will
scale this in right around there and
then hit E and hit the letter Z or Zed
and that way it keeps it on that axis
and just come down around here I also
kind of forgot about this well take this
inner edge that we just saw it
drew did oops yeah right there and we're
gonna extrude that to up on the z axis
axis right around there okay and then we
are going to hit again left click once
hit s and then hit e and z just down
okay now what we want to do is create a
an edge loop control R just click once
left click and then we're going to hit
our for rotate well first we're going to
click it then hit R so you click twice
so we're going to rotate like right
around here
let go and then we're going to hit ctrl
R and click twice and then ctrl R in the
middle
and click twice and hit s to scale that
out just a tad bit that way kind of
creates like this what you call like
where the portion where it screws on
basically alright so I now let me go to
tab out get out of edit mode we take
this lid and we drag it down it should
be pretty good like that so the reason I
even bother creating the portion that we
can't see is because I'm going to
duplicate the the the containers I mean
they're being loud downstairs my kids
anyhow and I one of them is gonna have
the lid off just to make it look
interesting
alright so okay um I don't know I don't
like how this looks down here it's kind
of like you see these ripples go to back
to tab with this selected edit mode and
you come down here kind of just hit ctrl
R and create another edge loop and
that's looking better now okay
so we hit five on our number pad for the
perspective mode this is pretty much
what your protein container should look
like roughly okay so I'm gonna real
quickly get some things set up let's go
over here this is in the render panel
we're gonna be using cycles render for
this ultimately so choose that and GPU
compute makes everything run a lot
faster
we're gonna go to sampling no yeah
sampling samples right now if we were to
render this we just changed a render
view down here I things are usually real
grainy you can't tell because let me go
over here world scene make it white let
me also switch back to solid we will hit
shift a add plane scale that thing large
and then we'll go back to a rendered
okay now you see there's like kind of
great and grainy right here that's
because of the sample so they're set
really low initially so your preview
which is what we're doing now in preview
mode I turn this up to like a hundred it
makes it a lot better-looking and
especially when you're ultimately
rendering it as well alright so let me
take solid here and get back to
orthographic by hitting five on the
number pad hit one now we just move this
up so that's sitting on it pretty simple
five again and we'll go to rendered okay
and another thing that I want to do is
work with this background or this this
plane a little bit so I kind of wanted
to be like well I'm not gonna explain it
I'll just I'll just do it so with it
selected will go to tab and then we're
going to select yeah we're an edge mode
right click this edge hit E and then hit
Z
and then pull this thing up real high
all right and then what I want to do is
go into back to object mode we'll add a
subdivision surface and it looks
terrible it's expected though and then
we will go back to this edit mode
hitting tab hit ctrl R add one right
around there
ctrl R up here and I want to right
around there
I control R again and we will also go
back to object mode hit s for scale and
we'll scale on the x axis like that all
right there we go okay so now me and
they are being loud down there let's go
to rendered all right
it's kind of hard to see because
everything's so white and if you want to
adjust that you just take this color
down a little bit but let's see here
yeah okay
I think that's going to be where we're
going to end for now and tomorrow we
should be able to wrap things up by
adding the actual label that we're going
to do here in Photoshop and then setting
up the material correctly to make sure
it looks you know kind of like a protein
container
it's type of material then we're going
to also duplicate this a couple times
and ultimately get something that should
look pretty cool all right so check out
