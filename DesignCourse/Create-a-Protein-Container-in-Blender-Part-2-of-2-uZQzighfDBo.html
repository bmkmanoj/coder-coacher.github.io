today is February 14th and we're going
to finish up the protein product display
in blender and we're gonna get started
in Adobe Photoshop by getting the actual
label designed and then we're going to
get it all looking good and ready to go
in blender alright so check out design
course comm and if you haven't yet
subscribe here on YouTube alright let's
get started alright so this is what we
were left with I and basically you know
if we go here to rendered we see it just
looks like clay alright so what we want
to do I now basically you know I'm still
I'm still a newbie when it comes to
blunder
I've only been learning this for like
two months but I've learned a lot
through different video tutorials online
and stuff and Andrew Kramer did I say
Kramer and that's the video Coppock I
now Andrew price of blender guru comm he
put out a video recently about how to
make an airplane and blender and I
learned how to do some UV unwrapping
with his method
so basically we're in cycles render now
we want to change here to blender render
and let me real quickly just change here
to solid and the importance of doing
this is just for the UV unwrapping
portion I so basically what we want to
do we're right now we're in object mode
I make sure this is selected and will
tab into edit mode and right now we're
we're in the perspective mode so let's
hit 5 to get into orthographic hit 1 and
we'll zoom up here alright so basically
what we want to do is take here and
switch to face mode and we want to
select only these faces so right now
because we have this option selected
limit selection to visible eye basically
we want to uncheck that I want to hit a
first just to make sure nothing else is
selected a again and then hit B as in
boy and select those and that way it's
only going to select the visible
portion I real quick I'm gonna hide that
this plane in the back so come over here
hide that and then oh yeah if you hit
one and then you hit control one it'll
give you the back portion of it and then
hit B again and then just come over here
make sure it got everything on the sides
alright so now that only those faces are
selected we want to separate them so the
way we do that is hit P and just select
selection so now it is its own object
alright and the reason I did that is I
was playing around with this tutorial
before and when I didn't separate them
and I tried to do the UV unwrapping and
I applied the label it did not line up
correctly and so maybe someone can die
let me know what why the hell it was
doing it I tried so many times sure to
fix it but basically separating it and
then going back into edit mode with that
selected basically gives us every piece
of UV that we need I just by hitting a
so we'll hit one here we're going to
drag this out just left-click and drag
to split the window and we'll bring up
the UV image editor over here and what I
want to do is go to image new image and
then I you can name it whatever you want
I the width we're going to put in we're
gonna leave one zero two four and then
just put times 4 and that automatically
does some math there for you so the
width is going to be obviously a lot
wider than the height is or whatever and
proportionately speaking because this is
going to be just kind of eye taken out
and the label realistically would look
like this
so if you hit you over here and we type
in or not type but we select cylinder
protect projection and we see it comes
over here hit a to select all hit s and
then to scale on the x-axis hit X and we
want to go just right around there it
doesn't have to fill out the whole thing
necessarily
and then we're gonna hit G just to get
it in there make sure everything is not
nothing's cut off rather so once you
have that then we can go to you V's
export UV layout and you can see I did
so many stupid exports I'm just going to
call this I label export and make sure
if we come down here make sure all you
visa select selected and PNG is select
in the fill opacity is 25 percent so
export UV layout alright and I switched
over a positive temporarily and opened
up that label export PNG in Photoshop
you can use any other graphics editor if
you wish doesn't have to be Photoshop
and so this is what we're presented with
by default we can see you know the the
UV layout right here it's a 25 percent
opacity on layer 0
control-shift-n to create a new later
later a layer hit OK and we'll just fill
this in with a white color and let's see
here oh and the reason we see that
because I had the grid on
I thought those are the movies alright
alright so now I could see oops the UVs
basically so what you wanted to do now
is open up and and download the project
files from design course comm and you
don't necessarily have to use my logo
but this is the one I'm using
so I've already opened it up I've
everything in my clipboard basically so
ctrl V and then I say ctrl T and then
rotating it holding shift right around
there is good and we can get rid of this
temporarily animals put it over here to
the side and we'll get some type going
here I just typed in design course got
to make that bigger
alright apply maybe we'll use a B+ or B
basore baby bus I haven't now to
pronounce it but basically is a free
font and it will work well for this
intended effect here all right let's see
here and you can take out the over here
the character panel yeah you know what I
don't really like this one it's kind of
like crappy right here the letter
spacing is all off I will just go most
people have this ships with Photoshop so
we'll use this we'll use a bold
condensed alright as you can see I did
not really get to the full label design
before doing this I'm kind of just
winging it right now I so let's also go
ahead I'll take that and duplicate it
and you could right-click to duplicate
it and I set up a hockey ctrl shift D
just for quickly duplicating things and
ctrl T design on steroids okay
we'll come back over here and make this
yeah something like that's fine slightly
darker alright let me zoom out here
alright so to really make a design kind
of just our label really make the 3d
make it look impressive the label itself
needs to be impressive so usually what
you find on a I let whether it be a
protein container or some type of
pre-workout supplement container there's
a lot of different you know you have
your your label your have your
nutritional facts I'm not sure if I'm
going to go that
your kick because it's it's I mean
that's something you can do yourself
really but I am gonna try to add just
some filler text in different areas that
will try to make it look at least
slightly resemble what a protein or
pre-workout supplement would look like
so I'm just gonna take the rectangle
tool hold an alt I'll go right around
there and we'll get rid of the fill or
you could do that up there as well and
then we'll give it a stroke I let's just
use that for now and then get the stroke
width up and alright that looks good and
I'm gonna bring up a website real quick
it's off of my screen or um dip some
generator basically let me bring this
thing here into view it's called lips um
calm you can just grab the text copy it
real quick and then with the type tool
hit ctrl H twice go ahead and just left
click and drag out right around there
paste in our text and I let's get up a
hundred percent control one you can use
your spacebar and left click to pan the
view Wow let's see here 18 I'm not
really sure if I want and that might be
better we'll make the font size I'll try
25 alright so let me now also just cuz i
zoom out without using this tool you all
have to do is just hold all in your
middle and your squirrel well alright
I'm just gonna take different parts of
this and just keep on copying and
pasting it well I'll take the whole
thing really just to make it look a
little bit different in areas
all right and what else get up put I'll
take that logo again and unfortunately
it's not saved so let me see here open
up my logo off screen real quick come on
hard drive stop being slow ok I will
leave it at 300 paste that in ctrl T it
will copy a little bit more text
all right so we have a couple more areas
that we can fill up possibly let's see
here
also I might want to add some more color
so let me think about how I would want
to do that you could take this layer
right there and double-click the right
side of it to bring up layer styles and
see about giving it a gradient overlay
so we'll take the presets yeah maybe
like that all right okay so you need to
really think about what else I want to
add here and one thing I let me just
bring this back now if we zoom up here
yeah I guess that's fine I wanted to
make sure that this did not go you know
over these UVs
it doesn't look like it is so I may want
to scale that and slightly if I take
nope not that you can lock this layer so
we don't select it auto-select layer on
the move tool selected we can hit
rectangle one control T just bring it in
a little bit holding shift and alt all
right that's better and I think over
here I'm just going to let me i zoom out
here take that text and just put
something like oh man does that even
make sense all right yeah I guess it
makes sense in the context of a
supplement so let me get this out try no
obviously has to be a lot nine or
twenties not enough 160 alright that's
better maybe we'll make this black all
right what does about done I think you
know we get the point and just for the
heck of it and I'll copy this again just
because I want the whole thing to be
filled out we'll make this like up a
watermark one over here so we will go to
luminosity take the opacity down and
maybe right around there alright and
that is our unimpressive I label so now
what we want to do is just save this so
ctrl alt shift and whatever else or just
gonna file save for web we have a
massive image here PNG 24 just save this
and call this a little yeah what's
called as label one alright now we'll
switch back to blender will go change
this to cycles render come over here
change this to node editor will tap into
object mode over here with this still
selected will go to new over here and
then this shows up and we'll change this
to a gloss where am i right here so from
diffuse we're going to change the glossy
come over here hit shift a to add a
glossy no no no no no I don't shift a to
add a image texture just connect these
two right there what am i doing come on
there we go and
we'll open up our label one and watch it
not work I'm just gonna guarantee it's
not gonna work
here we go that's just been my luck
lately rendered let's see here let me
get rid of this plain for a second wait
area is let me hit five to get into
perspective mode and let me pull this
over real well one second first I want
to take this roughness yeah so we add
the roughness is zero point two let's
take this and left click drag it over so
we get to a better view of what this
thing looks like all right whoo it does
kind of end right there so what we would
do in that case is I would just come
over back to photoshop and try to just
probably move everything over a little
bit or make the end make this smaller
but I'm not gonna worry about that we're
not gonna see that backside for now so
cool so you can get real close because
we have a pretty high resolution image
all right bring back our plane all right
so now what I want to do is we're gonna
click this just to get well probably get
a material mode we want to select this
yeah the one that we separate it from
and just change will give it the same
material so just pull down you click
there and then we still won't see
anything outside of it we'll still give
the same material at least and then
we'll take this lid create a new texture
we'll make it a mix shader' and take the
first shader and give it a diffuse and
then the next one will be glossy all
right and I like just go here to render
just to see what it looks like currently
so you could see it's glossy it has a
mix of diffusing and you know the Glocks
the glossy texture I want it to be like
a black so we'll change the colors here
and
and let's see at an issue with my
harddrive in the recording program
saying it and I'm a space anyhow um
let's see here and then you could play
with this FAC value just to see how this
works alright so what I want to do now
I'm just gonna leave it right around
there for just for now I is duplicate
these so let's go ahead into material
mode and I'm gonna select everything
here so I'm holding shift I got those
two selected alright so we have three
different objects selected and we want
to duplicate them so she h shift d will
hit X first and then we'll hit G and
then Y and you know we can just pull
things around a little bit and look
around in our scene we don't want them
actually touching or going into each
other but we want to set up just kind of
a for our final shot basically so what I
want to do is everything's still
selected we can hit R to rotate this on
the z axis just to give like a different
view slightly of what this thing looks
like and then we will duplicate once
again shift D I'm just gonna hit X and
our Z
Yeah right around there and I want to
take the lid oops
not that one take the lid and just pull
it lift it off and I'm gonna hit five
real quick just to get an ortho mode and
then hit seven and I'm going to move
this off I'm gonna hit one move this
down over here I'm gonna hit R and I'm
just kind of moving it into place here
all right so it's at five again all
right cool
all right so let me go ahead and hit
rendered and so that that's that kind of
like you know the twisty part and this
does actually look like a lid
fortunately I if you hit G we do have it
selected and then Z we can move this
down slightly
if yours wasn't touching and uh there
you see your make sure everything is
looking good
let me go over here to solid real quick
yeah subdivisions are three all right so
let me go ahead to rendered and if we
wanted a final shot of this what we can
do is just go ahead and let me set up
our camera if you hit zero on your
number pad that'll give you actual
camera view I so let us hit the letter n
as a nose choose lock camera to view hit
and again to get it that little thing
off of the tool bar and now we can move
around and kind of get things set up
here
alright oops let's go back alright I
think that looks pretty good
right there and let me go to a render I
already have some options set up here
for a final render you know you wanted
to go definitely want to go higher so
I'm gonna put it a thousand on mine and
what else do I want to do let me go to
performance change the tiles to 256 all
right all right uh so now over here the
resolution I'm gonna change to 1280 by
720 let me move this down a little bit
yeah right around there and then I'm
gonna change that 50 to 100 all right so
now it's ready to render so I'll just
click render and I will pause this until
it's finished
alright and this is it so I yeah it
looks pretty good to me so now if you
wanted to save this just hit f3 and just
go ahead and save this final view you
know you can use PNG JPEG you know
whatever you want I'm just gonna save
that and that is it so I check out these
on course comm if you haven't yet I
today oh me in the last week I've been
just recording so many different videos
outside of the day like videos for my
first product and that is going to be
viz ID which is the visual identity time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
