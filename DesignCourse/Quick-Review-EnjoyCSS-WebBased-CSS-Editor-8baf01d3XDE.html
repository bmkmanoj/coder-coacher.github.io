today I'm going to do a real quick
review of an online CSS tool called
enjoy CSS comm it's entirely web-based
and it's 100% free so I'm gonna switch
to the desktop real quick just to do
that quick review alright so this is the
initial page when you visit enjoy CSS
calm Izu right off the bat you can
choose a type of template to start with
the B input block I haven't even tried
that yet or buttoned I'm gonna try
blocks just to see what this is so
probably just like a div element I would
assume let's see here actually you know
it's good a gallery just see what they
mean by block probably just a reference
to something that's generic in terms of
a div I don't know but the buttons here
I so let's just say we click on one of
these in the gallery here what's cool
about this is you can kind of quickly
just take a look at the CSS and you're
able to edit it like an editor and
preview everything live right here and
to give you a lot of options here so if
you want to change all these the line
height whether or not you want to be
bold italic and as you're making these
adjustments it does two things it shows
you in a preview here and you can also
it also generates the code based on your
changes that you make in any of these I
if you click on get the code so it shows
you the HTML but that's necessary to
create whatever you're trying to create
and then you have all of the CSS so some
of the examples in the gallery there's a
lot happening so there's quite a bit of
CSS that's generated so you may or may
not want to use these I but what's also
cool is it's also
I would say a handy tool just for
learning CSS just to see what type of
changes that you trying to make in this
visual sort of editor and see how they
transpire in to the CSS code so I'm
gonna go back to gallery just for the
heck of it what I would like to see they
have like a see all type of things so
all the buttons that they have that like
they have one that's based around
Facebook and just a bunch of generic
type of ones I would like to see this to
grow a lot more let me see go to text
fields yeah they don't have very many
going on yet see text effects neon glow
to check that out just for the fun of it
alright so you know you can of course
change all the fonts and this is all
generated purely with CSS so if I click
on get the code we'll see this is all of
the CSS that is required to create that
glow effect pretty cool I'm gonna check
out a few more just for the fun of it
they have shapes here that are done all
in CSS gradient patterns let's check
this one out
trying to see what exactly is going on
here border-radius transforms
transitions that's interesting it's like
a 3d that's really cool so they put a
lot of work into this I like it like the
idea of it at least I think the the
gallery needs to grow a bit more but I
just for basic starting points that's
more than enough
trying to see out what else you can do
here border interesting let's check out
the code here it's gonna be pretty
lengthy that's not too bad
come up here in the CSS these are just
fonts Wow very cool I like and it also
shows you the browsers at this oil I
work with as well so yeah this is a
nifty tool so for I what does this add
to Chrome thing here that's extension
and as an application very cool there's
a cattell just a ton of work has gone
into this you can see it's also denoted
as being an alpha so yeah this has
several uses on purposes you could
definitely use it as a learning tool you
can use it once the gallery grows in my
opinion you can use as a source of
inspiration so say for example you want
a really cool call to action button for
a landing page I just browse over here
try to see something maybe that would
spark an idea in terms of design and
what's nifty is you know if you decide
to use it the codes right there already
modify it that way it takes a lot of the
busy work out of having to manually
specify or code or type out all the CSS
for something yeah this is I definitely
cool check it out
I check out these nine course comm if
you haven't yet and subscribe here on
YouTube alright goodbye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
