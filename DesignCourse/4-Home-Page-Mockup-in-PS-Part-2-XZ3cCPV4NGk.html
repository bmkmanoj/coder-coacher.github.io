video we're going to design the middle
section actually the top middle section
for our homepage mock up so right now
this design up here is probably only
about 15 to 20 percent of the actual
content that we're gonna be designing
for so we have ourselves a little bit
ways to go so let's just continue on I'm
gonna go to image canvas size and just
take the height and really increase it
to from 15 to about 40 and hit OK and
I'm going to take the fill tool and take
our background layer here and just fill
this all in with white alright so we see
we have quite a bit of room to work with
now all right so the space down here
we're going to have I basically just two
testimonials and so let's bring up our
columns just to get a good idea of where
we want hit ctrl T rather select the
columns layer and hit ctrl T and we'll
just drag all the way down and select
the move tool hit apply all right so
yeah basically I've we have in this
these six columns right here will have a
testimonial and then in these six
columns right here will have another
testimonial and then when the if you're
viewing it on the phone of course they
won't float or a tablet they won't float
aside to each other it'll be on top but
we'll get more into that later all right
so what I wanted to do is kind of have
an icon I like right around here and
then the actual quote and the logo kind
of like a watermark gray version of a
logo underneath and just have two
different the testimonials side-by-side
so I want to get started with that icon
right here and it's just going to be
like a quote icon so what I want to do
is take the ellipse tool
and we have a white foreground selected
and then starting right around here
we'll just shift and hold alt and drag
out roughly around this size and then
what we want to do is go ahead and hit
ctrl H twice to get rid of that and I'm
going to double click on this and hit
stroke and we'll go ahead specify inside
for the position and the size we're
going to increase just a little bit to
right around six and the color we're
gonna make a light gray hit okay and
okay and I'm gonna get rid of the
columns real quick and that seems to be
pretty decent in terms of color so then
what I want to do is go ahead and
right-click this and hit rasterize layer
style and what do that will do is no
longer can we edit that style it's just
rostered the whole thing and you'll see
why I further but I do want to take the
magic wand tool and with the tolerance
of thirty-two will turn anti-aliasing on
let's change that to back down to moles
of say five we can hit the Delete key
and it gets rid of everything in the
middle all right so the first thing I
want to do is right-click and just
duplicate this layer and then just hide
it and we'll just call this blank circle
and we'll reuse this when we create
other icons down here in the future so
now that we have that I just want to put
like a quote right here so I'm going to
use the type tool and just put a quote
right there that
quote won't drag it up and change the
color to this color right here and
that's not the font I want to use so I'm
going to experiment real quickly and I'm
going to hit the up arrow and I'm just
going to choose something that looks
like a pretty good quote and again you
don't have to use exactly what I'm using
of course I'm hoping you're following
along with your own project I probably
should have figured out which one I
wanted to use before this but that's
fine alright so this works pretty well
and what we'll just do is I'm going to
delete this make it a single quote
actually duplicate it and then I will
just move this over so I can position
exactly where I want it all right and
then I will take both of these and we're
going to move them up just right around
here and then I'm going to zoom up and
for the actual ellipse right there the
layer will select that we'll take the
pen tool and choose path and we'll kind
of just outline this just on this upper
portion
every click and select make selection
hit okay and then hit the Delete key
and we can position a little bit more at
the arrows alright so that looks pretty
good I for the first icon for our quote
so we could take all these layers and
just hit ctrl e and we'll call this
quote
I'll just icon - quote alright so that
looks pretty good now what I want to
take AI is right here to the right hand
side we'll get the type tool and we'll
put the actual die quote right here so I
let's get our columns back up now we
want this to extend right here to these
six columns so what we'll do is with the
type tool selected we'll select right
here on the beginning of the second
column and just drag right there to the
end of the right guide the sixth column
and I'm just going to real quickly just
put well once again I'll enlarge this
say that you can see it in second but
I'm just going to put awesome job very
imaginative the website makes the whole
process painless - great service time
change the source sans pro and we'll try
18 or so
choose Auto for there and let me get rid
of the columns make sure sharp is
selected and choose that and I want to
choose light here for the font style
alright so now we can drag this up just
a little bit and I don't have a this is
an actual quote I'm going to use I just
made that up so once I get to the HTML
CSS and we go live I will get an actual
quote alright so this is also the logo
that will go right here to signify you
know who set it from what company I'm
just gonna pull it from I think this
high-tech logo right here and I'll just
paste it and ctrl T and shrink it to
right around there and make it a
luminosity for the layer style or layer
blend mode rather and we'll put it right
around there I think that's fine alright
so now we want to do is go ahead and
take this text this and this icon and
duplicate it so I with Auto layer
selected if we just like this hold shift
and then hold shift we have these three
up there I'll go ahead and group them
hit ctrl G call this quote one and then
we can duplicate the group and call
quote too and uncheck that and we'll
move this over make sure our grid is up
and it starts right there okay so let me
hide the grid all right so of course
this will be a second one that'll be
different
I alright I think that's pretty good
now what I want to do beneath this area
here we're going to have a section where
we just kind of get more specific about
you know what we cover exactly I and
we'll have a container that's kind of
gray and so let's what get started with
that first I want to I don't want just
100% white area the container is going
to be a light gray so first thing we'll
do is get out the rectangle tool and
just drag out roughly to around this
size and we'll double click here oops
and we want it to be pretty high a light
gray so fo fo-fo zero rather alright and
I kind of want to use the same eye
design right here except it'll be a
grayscale on the top version of this so
I also another way to quickly select a
layer if it's not on auto suck layer you
just hit ctrl and then left click and it
will select that layer right here I so
let me see here I'm just going to
duplicate this and we'll drag it to the
top here you can make it clip a clipping
mask and then we'll drag this down and
we could change the opacity right around
10%
all right
and then I'm going to take this text
here see it's going to be kind of
another eyes headline right over here
it's going to be centered as well so I
select the layer we'll duplicate that
we'll just move this down drag it up
here at the top and and here it's going
to say let us take care of your visual
identity all right and it's going to be
mostly black we're actually going to
change some of the words the colors
let's get up the columns here and turn
that on drag this to the top control T
scale it down a little bit I don't want
it to be too big I don't want to compete
with the text at the top but I think
right around here is pretty good
actually I want to scale that down just
a little bit more it apply all rights
get rid of the column view and we'll
take the type tool and select visual
identity here and just use this same
color right here all right so now what I
want to do I is kind of put an icon
right here but it's not going to be
based on this design it's just going to
be kind of like an eye so we'll come
over here we'll view the grid
and I want to make sure in my foreground
we have this color selected and shape is
selected all right so I'm going to
select right there and select right here
and then we're going to come up just
around right to there and then hold the
Alt key and click once and then bring it
back and do the same thing right there
so now we can hide the grid by hitting
ctrl H twice and now what I want to do
is create a new layer make it a clipping
mask hit OK and select a slightly darker
color right there take the rectangle
tool and actually I want to position
this at the bottom just to create a
little bit of depth alright and then
what I want to do is take the ellipse
tool right ctrl H we can get the grid
back and I want to take this color here
this gray in the background and drag out
an eyeball roughly to around that size
and control H get rid of this then take
the pen tool again and I'll select right
around here all right now if I go back
to 100% it's a little bit too large so
what I want to do is take all those
shapes
I believe these four are them I'm just
going to group them real quick hit ctrl
T and scale it down all right and select
that and hit apply all right so that
looks pretty good I not what I want to
do is in this area there's going to be
four basically circles and inside them
will be specific designs and so let's
the first thing we need to do is get the
columns and each one of these these
icons really they're going to be three
column widths and width but they're
going to be centered and they're not
going to take up the full width of the
column so you'll see what I mean so
let's go ahead and do that real quick I
take the ellipse tool and basically
something right here around the center
going to hold shift and drag out and the
size will be right around here and just
so I can see it I'll make it black and
then what I want to do is take the pen
tool with this color selected make sure
that's our foreground
and I'm going to just select right
around here to the little bit left to
center hold shift and do the same thing
we'll change that color to that gray
and get rid of the columns real quick
I'm just hit ctrl T and scale this up a
little bit alright and then in the
inside we're going to actually put in
image so this first one this is caption
underneath right here will be a logo
design so just to get that out of the
way real quick I'm going to take this
text and just hit I just duplicate it
real quick put it up here just position
it somewhere right around there
local design and I'm gonna make it
try 16 for the size and really if we
wanted this to be the center the same
width as this we can just move that over
and hit center and then what I wanted to
do I will take this and duplicate it so
I want to take this layer this layer and
this we're gonna group this we'll call
this I will just call this logo design
right click duplicate group let's get
the columns out move this over here to
the middle of these three columns and
we'll duplicate both of those move these
over here in the middle of the three of
these so alright so I this one will be
called identity colors and I will change
that text right here
get rid of the columns so you can see
this better this one right here will be
stationary and this one over here will
be called social presence all right let
me collapse those okay so now what I
want to do is put I like an image in
each one of these I to represent what
exactly you know each of these means so
I I'm going to go to file open and I'm
going to open up this file right here
it's called presentation and this is
just a mock up identity a presentation
that I did and so for the first one
since it is logo design now obviously
logo design a code that's the one of the
basic most simple you know it's obvious
things that we do I'm going to take the
logo up here and just copy that whole
area right there edit copy merged and
then in here with ctrl + left click to
select the layer create a new layer
create a clipping mask and control V to
paste soap right pasted over here
somewhere
okay Patrol T I'm going to scale it down
but while holding Shift + E Gaulke and I
wanted to kind of first
skew this as well so edit transform skew
it transform distort rather hit apply
all right
and then for identity colors I'm not
going to use an image I'm just gonna
create a design kind of abstract just to
illustrate you know what the color
palette of this logo right here for
instance would be so I'm gonna select
that layer and it's going to be around
just this gray it's gonna be a little
bit darker hit okay then take the
ellipse tool and just going to drag out
alt here and shift and the color is
going to be darker here and then a right
click duplicate layer move it over here
and this one's going to be roughly that
color right click duplicate layer
this one's going to be white now I'm
going to take all three of these and hit
ctrl T scale them up just a little bit
all right and then for the middle one
for the blend mode I'm going to hit the
down arrow key and I think multiply
works well and then experiment with the
white one as well we want this to appear
white but we want it to blend well all
right
I think overlay kind of works pretty
good for that all right and then for
stationery I had a preview of some
business cards right here and so I'll
just go ahead and just take this whole
area edit copy merged do the same thing
for this right here create a new layer
ctrl V ctrl T and scale them just to
where you can notice what they are
they're business cards apply all right
and then for social presence will have
on it spelled that wrong by the way
we'll have I just going to scroll down
here Amy ultimately use something
different for social presence this is
kind of like an app icon so what I'll
just do is select right around here edit
copy merged create a new layer make it a
clipping mask
and leave it right around there and I'm
going to select this eye container hit
ctrl T and extend it just down a little
bit further and then down here we're
going to have a portion of centered text
I so real quickly I'm just going to take
that text duplicate it and drag it to
the top of all the layers
and let me collapse these real quick
will view the columns and let's make
that centered and then double click
right here and we'll extend it basically
to the it's about to the full width of
the twelve grids and I'm going to type
up actually I'm just going to go ahead
and copy and paste some text that I have
in a different window that you cannot
see so I'll have to type of this all out
ctrl V to paste I'm going to hide the
columns all right all right this kind of
looks off because it's this right here
is hanging off so it doesn't look like
it's centered we're well so I'm just
gonna go select this take this group one
just move it over a little bit and go
ahead and ctrl T drag that up just a tad
bit hit apply all right I let me select
all of these layers just drag out move
them up just a little bit so we have the
same white space between these two
portions okay that's cool now one of the
things I wanted to do is hi when we're
actually live in the browser with this
design and we scroll down the this logo
design and the portfolio testimonals
login the nav bar basically will kind of
just come with us
so we'll see as we're scrolling down
this bar that will that will stay at a
fixed position I so down here I once we
actually get to the next video we're
going to have more icons to design in
the fashion of that quote one up there
and we're going to have six areas that
elaborating more further or more
specific
you know the details of the service and
then finally down here we'll have
another area that tries to get a strong
call to action for a phone number and to
actually get started and to be able to
order so I will see you in that video
all right good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
