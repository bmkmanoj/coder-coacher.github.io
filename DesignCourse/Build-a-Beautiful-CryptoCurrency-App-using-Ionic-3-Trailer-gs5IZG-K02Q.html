favorite things and that is the emerging
world of the cryptocurrency industry
along with building apps hi I'm Gary
Simon and I've been a new stack
developer for nearly two decades and
also an instructor for LinkedIn fluro
site and my own online education
business you're about to embark on a
journey to building from scratch from
start to finish the very app that you're
watching right now you see I think
slides and theory are boring
I actually think most of us learn best
by actually doing and that's what this
course is all about meet coin for the
app that you're going to build from
scratch first we're going to tackle all
of the design considerations like logo
design the app mock-up process and Adobe
experience design and then we're going
to spend the rest of our time developing
the app using ionic 3 which is a
powerful framework for building hybrid
apps by the end of this course you're
going to walk away with a real app that
you designed and coded yourself so if
you're ready to learn let's get started
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
