know I released a one hundred percent
brand new service corsetry com check it
out it's in the description but that's
not what this video is about now a long
time ago I used to do something that a
lot of you people liked and then I
stopped doing it which meant a lot of
emails mostly complaining some death
threats but fortunately very shortly I'm
going to restart it and it means a lot
of you aspiring designers and coders are
going to have an opportunity to improve
your skills much more so what am I
talking about design challenges are
coming back and this time they're not on
design course they are on the brand new
corset row calm not right now though
don't get mad I'm currently developing
it and it's going to be much more robust
and also no more participation trophies
we are going to pick winners because
that's only right it's only right that
people who do well are recognized for it
now these may not be video reviews
because we're going to get a lot more
submissions and I'm only one guy however
I will be rating these based on some
type of design principle guidelines okay
so with that said look out probably in
the next month to max I'm thinking
within the next 30 days for sure this
feature will be here and then you will
have another great opportunity to get
better and also compete and have fun
with others all right look out for it
and check out corsetry com see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
