comm today we're going to step into
Adobe Illustrator to design a tribal
tattoo so these tribal tattoos sometimes
guys have them on their arms and woman
how I found I bet you a tramp stamps
from whatever so yeah we're gonna do
this also by only using perfect circles
so you'll see how this works it's kind
of interesting you can use the perfect
circle technique for other things like
icon logo design and all that I so yeah
let's go ahead and get started
also if you need access to my project
file that I finished with I've made that
available for free and design course
calm for this video alright let's get
started
alright let's go to file new here in
Adobe Illustrator and I'm gonna just
keep the width at 8:59 by 600 points
that's what works well for my resolution
100% so ctrl or command one will get you
200% and we're gonna go to view show
grid and then view snap to grid alright
so we want to get rid of the fill so you
did you select it and click on this
little red slash that would gets rid of
the actual fill and we'll leave this
black stroke and I'm gonna choose the
ellipse tool by left-clicking and
dragging out and then coming to any of
these portions where the darker grids
intersect and they just hit shift and
alt left click and drag alright so now I
actually do want to make one quick
adjustment if I take this stroke color
let's make it like a gray that's a
little bit too there we go
ctrl C C and ctrl F will duplicate
duplicate it rather and what we want to
do is just kind of imagine if the lion
were to start here and come around where
these intersect and then stop and then
continue on and we basically if we do
that we can get an idea of what the
shape will ultimately look like so come
around here here and here and right
there alright so then if we take those
again
and I increase this right around there
and it will stop right here and this is
where it will be mirrored over there I
mean want to make that a little bit
bigger all right and then take this one
control C control F and increase the
size of that as well but we want the
size of these to taper a little bit so
take this one control C control F right
around there looks good so the
intersection it will start here with
these initial ones and then come back
down right around there
all right so now at this point I'm going
to take these control C and control F
just move those over temporarily holding
shift and I want to select the originals
that we created so that's this one and
this one and this one all right no I am
incorrect I it's kind of hard to see
these based on but if we get our layers
out here we'll see actually going to
group these temporarily hide it all
right so the first ones that we created
would be the first okay every other
because we duplicated those all right so
what we want to do is go to window and
Pathfinder with those three selected and
click on unite all right and then do the
same thing with these three right here
all right so now what we want to do is
I'm going to take a rectangle and the
left portion of it should intersect with
both of these right on that line oops
sorry about that
and I think that right there is pretty
good all right so if I take this object
path divide objects below
that will divide them alright so now
what I want to do is get rid of the top
portion using the direct selection tool
right here
all right just like that okay so now I
want to combine this into a single shape
so if I take this one up here hold shift
and oops I'm sorry I had to pause if we
select this and hold shift and merge
those and then we have these two over
here just hold shift and select those
and connect them all right so now if I
get rid of the stroke make it oops and
switch to the foreground and make that
black control C control F go to
transform reflect and vertical I turned
off snapping real quick if I go to view
and snap to grid that'll connect them
it's almost looks like a mouth or
something some type of weird eye all
right so let's bring back the group that
we have here and just move it into play
oops move it into place back over here
all right we can add some more to this
obviously you can get much more complex
I'm gonna ungroup and it's all about
kind of just envisioning you know what
you can do with these shapes I I'm going
to take them again and duplicate those
and group them ctrl G and just move them
out of sight and hide them all right and
I'm going to get rid of some of these
over here I just want to keep this one
right here all right
and
right around there control seeing
control f
all right take this and I'm gonna
duplicate that oops
dammit I get back here
I'm going to scale it differently I
think
all right so you're like okay what the
hell is going on here
I'm almost something in the same boat
basically let me see if I can I play
with this a little bit so real quickly
I'm going to take those and duplicate
them idea is to have this portion right
here kind of create some white space and
cut into this area and then this will be
some more black that will come along the
side of it so let's see if I can do that
let me hide that real quick so we have
these two window Pathfinder
no not pattern options Pathfinder yeah
we don't want to do that yet what I can
do is real quickly take the rectangle
tool move everything up just one notch
because I don't want this intersecting
this object path divide objects below
and take the direct selection tool get
rid of that part all right and
all right combine those and also combine
knees and give it a white come down to
the stroke area and get rid of that all
right okay
and what we can do is select both of
these with the Pathfinder click on this
one - front right so that gets rid of it
makes it transparent
bring back this other thing over here
and yeah what I can do is actually let's
get rid of that and bring those back
that's why I duplicated those what's
that in the right position doesn't look
like it I see here there we go all right
so I can get rid of this one and now we
have these two to work with so we want
it to end right here all right so what
I'll do is take the direct selection
tool let's see yeah that's fine and
yeah I could take the take this
rectangle tool come up here and let me
turn off snap real quick end right
around their object path divide objects
below okay get rid of that wait didn't
delete those what the hell
ah it's not working
divide the damn objects below password
alright actually what am i doing one
second yeah that's not gonna work either
okay so I had to pause the one we want
to use is exclude by selecting them both
and that way it creates intersection
point right there take the direct
selection tool and delete that one and
it looks like there's an extra one down
there alright so now we can take those
and get rid of a stroke make this black
alright and as you can see you can just
continually play around with this
circular geometry to kind of create
something that's just kind of
interesting and tribal ish I guess you
could say so let me
well what sucks is I didn't maintain
those other circles I wanted to keep
those oh well no big deal so just doing
a lot of the same thing I'm going to
pause this and then just I come back and
show you what I've come up with in terms
of more detail alright so I just added
this thing down here I it is
time-consuming just to do this sighs so
I think we get the point so what I want
to do just real quickly I'm gonna get
rid of Oh real quick I'm gonna make this
let me see here clocks are gonna wait
until I do that what I want to do is
take this drill C ctrl F actually before
I do that even make sure okay I want to
get our circles here in place okay those
are in place
but there's still yeah these ones over
here
those ones right there I'm going to
recreate the ones that I created for
this one because I accidentally deleted
those so if I take this one just real
quickly I make this one right there
yeah that seems right and boy this is a
mess
should not have deleted those ones oh
well I I'm going to go to view and turn
off snap to grid
all right all right that looks pretty
even with this one right here
all right I cool so now what I want to
do is I'm going to delete this and I'm
gonna select all of these just by using
the magic wand tool hit ctrl G put them
at the bottom all right and I'm gonna
take this alright so let me bring this
down okay we have to unlock that
and my pathfinder - front there now it's
basically transparent as it should be
all right so now if I take everything
I'm gonna group it ctrl c ctrl F
right-click reflect vertical yeah let me
snap turn on snap again alright and if I
real quickly open up that group take
this one out of it put it at the bottom
there none of it collides with it
the design all right so it's hide drag
this out here - there you kind of have
the beginnings of some sort of tramp
stamp tribal tattoo type thing actually
because I'm demented let me put
something here real quick I hope I don't
offend anybody ah there we go that's
perfect for some I'm not gonna say I'm
gonna delete that real quick I'm having
too much fun yeah so that's how you can
use you know just perfect ellipses to
create something that's real cool like
this so yeah I yeah I apologize for all
the the pauses and screwing up I didn't
go through this tutorial before
beginning this so that is the reason for
that but yeah check out design course
comm subscribe here on YouTube and yeah
I have another video for you tomorrow
for those of you unaware ah man I've
done a video every day with exception to
one day because I was like feigning and
stuff it was all messed up of 2014 so I
think I've done about 110 videos there's
been around 110 ish days so far in 2014
so you have to stick around there will
be plenty more alright goodbye
